            "article_content": "Harry Reid, the scrappy former Democratic Senate leader who spearheaded epic legislative battles through three decades in Congress, has died at the age of 82, according to a statement from his wife, Landra Reid. \u201cI am heartbroken to announce the passing of my husband, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He died peacefully this afternoon, surrounded by our family, following a courageous, four-year battle with pancreatic cancer,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday. Reid rose from humble beginnings in Searchlight, Nevada, to become the most powerful politician in Nevada history, capping off his political career as the Democratic leader in the Senate, including eight years in the majority. President Joe Biden, who served with Reid in the Senate, called him one of \u201cthe all-time great Senate Majority Leaders in our history\u201d in a statement Tuesday. \u201cHe was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday evening. \u201cHe\u2019s gone but he will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every single day.\u201d Former President Barack Obama released a letter he had written to Reid before his death in lieu of a statement. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn\u2019t have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination,\u201d Obama wrote. Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2018 and said less than a year later that he was in remission. At the time, he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that he felt \u201cvery good\u201d and that he was \u201cdoing fine.\u201d But Reid responded to his cancer diagnosis with his usual bluntness, telling The New York Times in 2019: \u201cAs soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you\u2019re dead.\u201d The beginning of Reid\u2019s life didn\u2019t hint at his political future. Born in 1939 in a modest home with no running water, his mother once earned money by doing laundry for local brothels, he wrote in his memoir, \u201cThe Good Fight,\u201d while his father worked as a hard-rock miner. He attended high school in Henderson, Nevada, often hitchhiking the 45-mile route. A boxer in his youth, Reid later attended Utah State University before moving to Washington, DC, and working his way through law school at George Washington University by working as an officer for the United States Capitol Police. \u201cI think I am the only former Capitol policeman here that is a senator,\u201d Reid said in 2011. \u201cI have such great respect for the work that they do.\u201d In pictures: Former US Sen. Harry Reid After law school, Reid returned to Nevada and served as lieutenant governor from 1971 to 1975, the youngest person elected to that role in the state. After losing reelection, Reid served as chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position that oversees and regulates the state\u2019s casino industry. The job made Reid and his family a target of the mob: After he left that post, his wife found a bomb in the family\u2019s car, Reid wrote in his memoir. Reid\u2019s political career grew with Nevada. When the state went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\u2019s open Senate seat in 1986. He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\u2019s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\u2019s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\u2019 time in both the minority and the majority. As the chamber\u2019s Democratic leader, Reid was a polarizing figure. Republicans argued much of the congressional gridlock stemmed from his hard-ball tactics, but Reid often reveled in playing the political bad guy \u2013 even calling then-President George W. Bush a \u201closer\u201d and a \u201cliar.\u201d (Later, when Donald Trump was in the White House, Reid told CNN\u2019s Bash that he wished for Bush \u201cevery day.\u201d) Reid is often blamed for deepening an era of political polarization with irascible rhetoric about Republicans and the use of controversial Senate procedures that left traditionalists worried that the consensus that once made the chamber special had vanished forever. He brought those same tactics to electoral politics, too. During Obama\u2019s reelection bid in 2012, Reid accused Republican nominee Mitt Romney, with no evidence, of not paying his taxes. Asked by CNN in 2015 whether he regretted the attack, Reid said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret that at all.\u201d \u201cRomney didn\u2019t win, did he?\u201d Reid asked rhetorically. As much as he irked Republicans, he was often cheered by Democrats for being the last line of defense to Bush and other Republicans. He was a staunch defender of social programs and, reflecting wishes of the large Latino community back home, a proponent of immigration reform. Reid shepherded the centerpieces of Obama\u2019s liberal political legacy into law, and he said one of his proudest accomplishments had been encouraging then-Sen. Obama to run for president. \u201cI did call him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. And he was stunned because I was the first one that ever suggested that to him,\u201d Reid told CNN in 2015. \u201cWhen he was reelected, (that was) one of the most moving phone calls I\u2019ve ever received because he said, you know, \u2018You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m here,\u2019\u201d Reid recalled. Obama reiterated that sentiment in the letter he sent to Reid released Tuesday evening. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cAs different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other - a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team,\u201d he added. Former President Bill Clinton also lauded Reid, remembering him as \u201cone of the most effective Senate leaders our country has ever known.\u201d \u201cWe will likely never see another public servant quite like him\u2014in personality, command of strategy and tactics, and assuredness in marching to the beat of his own drum,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. In the darkest hours of the Great Recession, Reid ushered a nearly $800 billion economic stimulus plan through the Senate despite insurmountable rows with most Republicans, who said it was too expensive and racked up too much debt. Later, he piloted the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through the Senate using a controversial budget maneuver known as reconciliation to bypass a Republican filibuster, and he told the GOP to \u201cstop crying\u201d about it. \u201cSenator Harry Reid was a leader of immense courage and ferocious conviction who worked tirelessly to achieve historic progress for the American people,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, as the House\u2019s top Democrat for the last 20 years, worked with Reid across the Capitol. \u201cOver more than four decades of public service, Senator Reid was guided always by his North Star: to improve the lives of working families like his own,\u201d she added in a statement reflecting on his death. In modern-day Washington, the former senator\u2019s impact is perhaps most present in his 2013 change to the Senate rules to prevent filibusters of most executive branch nominations. He told CNN last year that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d doesn\u2019t regret changing the rules at the time, saying: \u201cI have no regret. It was the right thing to do. And by the way, it\u2019s not the first time the rules have been changed. They\u2019ve been changed lots of times. It was time to do it again.\u201d Broad use of the filibuster has soared in recent years in an increasingly polarized Congress. The shift prompted Reid to pen an opinion piece in the New York Times in 2019 calling for an end to the filibuster altogether. \u201cDuring the two decades we served together in the United States Senate, and the eight years we worked together while I served as Vice President, Harry met the marker for what I\u2019ve always believed is the most important thing by which you can measure a person\u2014their action and their word,\u201d Biden said in his Tuesday statement. \u201cIf Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That\u2019s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,\u201d the President added. Despite his blunt political style, Reid inspired fierce respect from many of his longtime aides, as well as fellow lawmakers \u2013 even those across the aisle. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was frequently at odds with Reid during their lengthy careers, remembered him as a \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d senator, saying their relationship had transcended political fights. \u201cThe nature of Harry\u2019s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cHe will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state.\u201d Reid told CNN earlier this year that he has \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker from Ohio with whom he sparred for years, as he reacted to excerpts of Boehner\u2019s memoir and lambasted the Republican Party\u2019s more recent \u201ctribal\u201d turn. \u201cThe deal is this. John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn\u2019t mince words,\u201d he said. Despite Reid\u2019s reputation as a hard bargainer with no qualms about scrapping with his opponents, he was also known as a romantic and the most influential person in his life was his wife, Landra. The two met in high school when Reid was 15. Her father was so opposed to the two dating that Reid and his would-be father-in-law got into a fist fight early in their courtship. Reid, who was raised agnostic, told Bash in 2015 that their opposition was that they wanted their daughter to marry someone Jewish. They eloped in 1959 during college, converting to Mormonism a year later. Her parents finally came around on him. \u201cI am a blessed man to have this 5-foot tall woman with me all these years,\u201d said Reid. The former Senate majority leader credited one thing for his political success over the years: Hard work. \u201cI didn\u2019t make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn\u2019t make it because of my good looks. I didn\u2019t make it because I\u2019m a genius,\u201d he said in his farewell address on the Senate floor in 2016. \u201cI made it because I worked hard.\u201d Reid\u2019s most lasting legacy is likely to be felt in Nevada, where the senator not only remade the Western state, but turned it into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004. \u201cThe little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada,\u201d he said in his farewell address in 2016. Reid was instrumental in pushing Democrats to make Nevada one of the first nominating contests in the country, a move that focused Democratic attention on Nevada and was a catalyst to its leftward shift. He often pushed Democrats to make Nevada even more important, urging the party, because of the state\u2019s diversity, to move the state before Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states in the nominating process. He also used his power to lift up the careers of younger politicians, like Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, whom the former Senate majority leader recruited to run for his seat when he was retiring in 2016. \u201cHarry Reid was a champion for Nevada, helping preserve our precious environmental treasures, strengthen our rural communities, and build up our great cities,\u201d Cortez Masto recalled in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe American people are better off because of the leadership of Senator Harry Reid.\u201d In recognition of the impact Reid had on Nevada, the Clark County Board of Commissioners voted earlier this year in favor of renaming McCarran International Airport to Harry Reid International Airport. Reid reflected on his life \u2013 and the role he played in changing Nevada \u2013 when he received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Democratic Party in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way from Searchlight to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get there alone. I got there because of you, Nevadans.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information. Stephen Collinson and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Over the last year, the Supreme Court\u2019s newly solidified conservative majority has made clear that it is willing to forgo a deliberate pace of justice in favor of a race to the right, leaving behind the liberal justices and at times Republican-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts. The conservatives on the bench, including all three of former President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees, cast votes to take up a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade and hear a Second Amendment case that could expand gun rights. They have moved to bolster religious freedom protections and could soon take on affirmative action as well as election-related disputes. Perhaps most notably, the court allowed a Texas six-week abortion ban to remain on the books, even though it directly contradicts the court\u2019s nearly 50-year-old precedent. Democrats walk on eggshells around Breyer as GOP plans another blockade for any Biden Supreme Court pick The last 12 months have confirmed not only where the court is heading, but how fast it might get there. Staring at the prospect of decades in dissent in the cases that most capture the public\u2019s attention, some progressives want to expand the number of justices on the court to dilute the conservative majority. But a commission set up by President Joe Biden to explore court reform made no formal recommendations, only saying that there is \u201cprofound disagreement\u201d on whether to expand the court. That means if Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, announces his retirement by July, as is widely expected, his replacement will be younger and maybe more liberal, but she could be in the minority on the most socially divisive issues for much of her tenure. RELATED: Supreme Court schedules January 7 oral arguments in challenges to Biden vaccine mandates Biden\u2019s first nomination is likely to come less than two years after Trump placed his final appointee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, on the high court. After the September 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Republicans moved at an accelerated pace to get Barrett confirmed before the election. Barrett made her presence known immediately. When Ginsburg was still alive, for example, the court turned away emergency challenges from houses of worship to state covid restrictions. But Barrett\u2019s vote changed the course of those disputes, shifting the majority in favor of the houses of worship. The current Supreme Court's partisan moment rivals Bush v. Gore At about the time of Barrett\u2019s confirmation, the Supreme Court also began considering whether to take up a Mississippi abortion law that bans the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Behind closed doors, the justices mulled whether to accept the case for months, before granting cert in May. Soon after, Mississippi raised the stakes in its opening brief by asking the court not only to uphold its law, but overturn Roe. The case catapulted the justices back into the middle of an issue that has dominated judicial confirmation hearings as well as public discourse for the last several decades. At oral arguments in December, Roberts floated a middle ground position that might stop the majority from overturning a landmark decision so early in the new court\u2019s tenure. At the time, Roberts\u2019 approach didn\u2019t seem to attract the interest of any of his conservative colleagues, but that could change as they grapple with the case behind closed doors. Meanwhile, another abortion case popped up this fall that managed to overshadow the Mississippi dispute for a time. At issue was a Texas law barring abortions after six weeks that was written in a novel way to keep the dispute out of federal courts. The Texas legislature specified that the law could not be enforced by Texas. Instead, individuals, from anywhere in the country could bring suit in state court against anyone they believed had helped a woman get an abortion. Critics noted that the so-called \u201cbounty hunters\u201d could potentially collect more than $10,000 in damages. Doctors in the state \u2013terrified by the prospect of fines \u2013 stopped performing abortions covered by the law, bringing the exercise of a constitutional right to a near halt in the state. The Supreme Court allowed the law to go into effect on September 1 over the dissent of Roberts and the three liberals, and later agreed to an expedited hearing in November. At oral arguments it appeared that Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett had concerns with the way the law was structured. But when the decision came down on December 10, they sided with the majority to allow it to remain in effect. In the end, the court offered abortion providers a narrow path to challenge the law, but the so-called \u201cbounty hunters\u201d are still free to bring suit and clinics aren\u2019t likely to start up again in the near future. Roberts, joined by the liberal flank, pointed out that the decision would inspire copycat laws. \u201cThe nature of the federal right infringed does not matter,\u201d he said, \u201cit is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake.\u201d The case also showcased the fact that the conservatives no longer are dependent on Roberts to move the court to the right. It\u2019s something Roberts has joked about before. \u201cI did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership you should be careful not to tug on them too much \u2013 you will find out they aren\u2019t connected to anything,\u201d he told an audience at New England Law in 2016. This is now his reality. The court\u2019s shift right was not only evident in the area of abortion. At the end of last term, in July, a 6-3 court limited the ability for minorities to challenge state laws they believe are discriminatory under the historic Voting Rights Act. In another 6-3 decision, the court also invalidated a California regulation that required charities to disclose their donors, a decision that could lead to the invalidation of other donor disclosure laws in the political realm that would allow more anonymous money into the political system. A 6-3 court also weakened the power of unions in a property rights dispute out of California. Yet at times the court\u2019s pace hasn\u2019t satisfied the court\u2019s right flank. In Fulton v. Philadelphia, decided in June, the court ruled in favor of a Catholic Foster Care agency that refused to work with same-sex couples. The court\u2019s majority said that Philadelphia had violated the First Amendment when it froze the contract of the agency because it believed that marriage should be between a man and a woman. But Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, while agreeing with the result of the opinion, were still disappointed. They wanted the court to overrule decades-old precedent \u2013 called Employment Division v. Smith \u2013 that would make it much more difficult for the government to enforce laws that burden some individual\u2019s religious beliefs. Notably, neither Barrett nor Kavanaugh were ready to go that far. That triggered Alito to criticize the court\u2019s slow pace. \u201cThose who count on this Court to stand up for the First Amendment have every right to be disappointed \u2013 as am I,\u201d he wrote. At the conclusion of most terms, the justices leave Washington to enjoy quiet summer months before starting a new term in October. That didn\u2019t happen this year. Instead, the justices\u2019 summer was punctured by emergency applications. Over the dissent of the three liberals, the court declined to put on hold a lower court order that required the revival of one of Trump\u2019s immigration policies. It also blocked Biden\u2019s eviction moratorium that was put in place amidst the pandemic. And Barrett declined a request to block Indiana University\u2019s vaccine mandate. By the time the new term started in October, the justices were already fully engaged and the court instituted a new oral argument scheme that significantly changed how cases are heard. Instead of the rapid fire sessions of past years where the justices often interrupted each other, a new format allowed the justices an untimed round of questioning after the advocate\u2019s time officially expired. Supreme Court schedules January 7 oral arguments in challenges to Biden vaccine mandates The new format pleases Justice Clarence Thomas, who, after years of near total silence during oral arguments, now launches each session with a question. According to an analysis by Goodwin Law, arguments also take up much more time, running 42% longer than the time the court initially allocated. That was evident on November 3, when the justices suggested they are poised to strike down a New York handgun law. It\u2019s been a decade since the court decided a major Second Amendment case, and now it will occur in the first full term of all three of Trump\u2019s nominees. They also took on a religious liberty case in December where the majority expressed skepticism at arguments about a Maine tuition assistance program that allows parents to use vouchers to send their children to attend private schools but excludes religious schools from the program. As the term continues, polls show the court\u2019s approval rating has reached a new low. In the fall, several of the justices took the unusual step of appearing publicly, sometimes stepping up to defend the institution. \u201cMy goal today is to convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks,\u201d the conservative Barrett said at an event in September hosted by the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. Breyer expressed skepticism of plans to add members to the court in interviews with CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic. Alito defended how the court deals with cases that come up on its emergency docket in a speech at Notre Dame Law School, also in September But of all the appearances, a talk by Justice Sonia Sotomayor resonated with liberals. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of disappointment in the law, a huge amount,\u201d she said at an event hosted by the American Bar Association. \u201cLook at me, look at my dissents.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden visited Missouri on Wednesday to promote the infrastructure law he signed in November. And Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, a Republican who is also a US Senate candidate in the 2022 election, greeted Biden with a scathing letter \u2013 one which began with a false claim. Schmitt\u2019s first paragraph in the letter, which he printed on attorney general letterhead and posted on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, read as follows: \u201cWelcome to Missouri. This is reportedly your first visit as president to one of the 25 states that cast its electoral votes for President Trump in 2020. It took almost one year. Welcome to the rest of the country.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s trip to Missouri was not even close to his first visit as president to a state Trump carried in the 2020 election. In fact, Missouri was the eighth Trump 2020 state to which Biden has made a visit since his January inauguration. The others are Texas, Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Florida and Idaho. Biden landed at an airport in northern Kentucky in July, and spoke to the state\u2019s governor there, before traveling to neighboring Ohio for official events. (Former CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, a longtime tracker of presidential travel, noted the Kentucky stop in a November tweet.) People can decide for themselves whether a brief airport stop means Biden has visited nine Trump 2020 states. Regardless, Biden participated in more extensive activities in the other eight. Biden has visited some Trump 2020 states more than once as president. He has gone to Ohio three times, Louisiana twice and North Carolina twice. Schmitt did use the qualifier \u201creportedly\u201d before the false claim that Missouri was the first Trump 2020 state Biden visited as president. But that didn\u2019t make the falsehood any better. At best, Schmitt or his aides misread the report they claimed to be citing. Schmitt spokesman Chris Nuelle said in an email to CNN that the claim was based on an article in the political publication The Hill. But as Nuelle acknowledged, the relevant sentence in The Hill was actually about Biden\u2019s presidential travel for the particular purpose of promoting the infrastructure law, not about all of Biden\u2019s presidential travel. Here\u2019s what The Hill actually reported: \u201cWhile Biden has visited other states including New Hampshire, Michigan and Minnesota in an effort to tout the $550 billion infrastructure measure, Missouri will be the first such visit to a state that voted for former President Trump in the 2020 election.\u201d Schmitt\u2019s letter \u2013 in which he also criticized Biden over the economy, immigration and the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 remained on his social media accounts without any correction early Thursday afternoon, more than 20 hours after journalists pointed out that it started with something untrue. Schmitt had about 32,000 followers on Twitter and about 42,000 on his campaign Facebook page, plus about 9,500 on the official Facebook page where the letter was also posted and another roughly 900 on Instagram.",

For young people, there\u2019s, \u201can overall feeling like I voted in the 2020 election and nothing really has been done for me,\u201d Shaadi Ahmadzadeh, who is 19 years old and goes to University of California, Berkeley, told CNN. Despite backing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primary \u2013 Ahmadzadeh served as a student organizer for the progressive candidate while in high school \u2013 she voted for Biden in the general election. Ahmadzadeh was able to get behind the President in part because he listed student loan debt cancellation, climate action, criminal justice reform and the Iran deal as issues he would prioritize. Now, she\u2019s disappointed. \u201cI was expecting substance out of his administration. I am getting some substance, but not enough,\u201d Ahmadzadeh said, adding that she believes Democrats need to pass Biden\u2019s social safety net plan as soon as possible. She cited prescription drug costs as one of the areas where Democrats could help her family. Although Biden this week signed into law the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2013 that will deliver investments into traditional infrastructure such as roads, bridges, transit, broadband and the electric grid \u2013 young progressives say that package alone does not go far enough. Jeffrey Clemmons \u2013 a 21-year-old student who said he \u201cagonized\u201d over voting for Biden, but cast a ballot for the President \u2013 thinks Democrats should be \u201cworried\u201d about youth voter turnout in 2022. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten so many of the things that we were promised,\u201d said Clemmons, who attends Huston-Tillotson University, a historically Black college located in Austin, Texas. Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, Biden overcame an initial lack of support from younger voters. Half of young people ages 18 to 29 voted in 2020, according to research from Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts (CIRCLE). And in that age group, 60% cast a ballot for Biden, while only 36% voted for former President Donald Trump, according to CNN\u2019s 2020 exit polls. But nearly one year into his presidency, Biden\u2019s popularity is waning. According to a recent CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, among those under age 30, Biden\u2019s approval has dipped to 61%, with just 9% saying they strongly approve of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Lessons from this month\u2019s state and local elections \u2013 most notably in Virginia where former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe lost support with younger voters, helping Republican Glenn Youngkin win the gubernatorial race \u2013 should serve as a warning sign to Democrats ahead of 2022, organizers say, adding that in order to secure the youth vote, Democrats need to go beyond being anti-Trump and actively prove they are committed to improving the daily lives of young people. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just run against Donald Trump. We need an affirmative vision about what you want to do with our future,\u201d Maxwell Lubin, CEO of Rise, a youth organization focused on college affordability and voting rights, told CNN. Tuition-free community college was cut from the version of Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan that passed the House. Lubin worries that if it\u2019s not revived early next year before the midterms, it could be a repeat scenario. \u201cWe (could) have nothing to sell next year,\u201d Lubin said about the midterm elections, adding that young people are the most likely to drop off as voters between election cycles. Bruna Sollod, a 30-year-old DACA recipient, said that when running campaigns, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for Democrats to say they\u2019re not Trump.\u201d Sollod, who serves as senior communications and political director for United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights organization, said the immigrant rights community is feeling let down. While Biden promised action on immigration, he has not yet followed through. Although Democrats and advocates have for months been pushing to include protections for undocumented immigrants in the bill, that too could be left out of the final legislation as the Senate parliamentarian previously made a recommendation that a pathway to citizenship should not be included if Democrats use the reconciliation process. Sollod said she\u2019s lived in the country for 22 years, but currently has \u201czero pathways to citizenship,\u201d explaining that her DACA status is not permanent, especially now, as the program continues to face legal challenges. \u201cI think the Democrats try to complicate things. They say there are these rules and tradition,\u201d Sollod said, referencing the filibuster and Senate parliamentarian. \u201cVoters don\u2019t care about that. They want Democrats to pass bills.\u201d Likewise, climate activists have in recent weeks grown increasingly vocal about their frustrations. They have taken a number of measures to demonstrate their anger, including a 14-day hunger strike outside the White House. \u201cYoung people handed Democrats everything they needed in 2020: a governing majority and a popular mandate. If they fail to deliver their agenda, then they will be the reason young people disengage from politics forever,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, executive director of Sunrise Movement, the progressive youth climate activist group. \u201cWe expect a return on our investment and for politicians to deliver on their elected promises,\u201d Prakash said. Ellen Sciales, spokesperson for Sunrise, said the disappointment young progressives are putting on display should make Democrats nervous. \u201cDemocrats should fear that young people won\u2019t come out to vote in 2022 and Democrats will lose,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd there\u2019s too much on the line to lose.\u201d Furthermore, some young progressives worry that even if a pared down version of the Build Back Better bill passes, due to a lack of clear messaging from Democrats, the average young voter doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in the bill or how it will impact their life. \u201cThe sad thing is even if the smaller version of the Build Back Better bill does pass, we need to do a lot more work to get young voters to understand what\u2019s in the bill,\u201d said Ali Sait, a 20-year-old student at the University of Chicago. Sait, who is originally from Texas, said that Democrats\u2019 weak messaging on their priorities is a problem that could impact youth voter turnout. Ahmadzadeh, like Sait, said the Democrats\u2019 messaging needs improving. \u201cI know it\u2019s early to know what specific parts of our community will get the money, but I want to know how that will affect me personally,\u201d she said. To fill the gap, Sunrise Movement wrote a blog post attempting to explain the negotiations and Build Back Better legislation to its community of supporters. But according to Clemmons, if Democrats want support from young progressives, it\u2019s up to them to effectively reach young people with their messaging. \u201cRight now we\u2019re facing the climate crisis, evictions, health care crisis,\u201d Clemmons said, adding that in order to \u201cinspire\u201d young voters, Democrats should highlight \u201cconcrete\u201d policy proposals. \u201cI need to hear a theory of change,\u201d the self-described progressive said. \u201cHow do you plan to include us in the process of your legislation and how do you plan to move it forward on these issues?\u201d",

            "article_content": "If it was just about selling Americans on the infrastructure law, Democrats might have a hope. As the White House struggles to pitch President Joe Biden\u2019s big infrastructure win \u2013 a bipartisan law that may actually deserve the over-used description \u201chistoric\u201d \u2013 ahead of next year\u2019s midterms, its political salesmanship is already coming under fire. But the forces assailing Biden\u2019s presidency, the obstacles thrown up by a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, and the weight of his own missteps cut far deeper than anything a public relations blitz can fix. Here's what's in the bipartisan infrastructure package The administration hasn\u2019t always done a good job drawing direct lines between Biden\u2019s priorities \u2013 infrastructure and an even bigger yet-to-pass social spending bill \u2013 and the lives of regular Americans, even though each is packed with measures to create jobs, and alleviate the cost of health care, education and other living expenses for millions of people. \u201cWe can deliver real results for real people \u2026 in ways that really matter each and every day, to each person out there. And we\u2019re taking a monumental step forward to build back better as a nation,\u201d Biden said as he signed the infrastructure bill into law surrounded by Democratic and Republican lawmakers Monday. Yet almost every political metric says that for all his passion, millions of Americans aren\u2019t convinced. A recent CNN poll, for instance, found a majority of respondents believe Biden isn\u2019t paying attention to the nation\u2019s most important concerns. An earlier CNN poll found relatively few saw the infrastructure and broader economic package as one that would help them personally. The victory of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin in Virginia earlier this month suggests Republican fingers may be closer to the nation\u2019s pulse. Convincing Americans of the merits of a law that may take years to produce civil engineering projects is an especially tough task at a time when Thanksgiving turkeys are shooting up in price and the gasoline it will take to get to grandma\u2019s house next week is blowing a hole in wallets. Transportation projects can make a big difference. But repairing bridges, roads and railroads is a multi-year or decade endeavor. Maybe someday Biden will be remembered in the same way as ex-President Dwight Eisenhower, the architect of the inter-state highway system. But it won\u2019t help his party in time for the midterm elections next November. Here's how long it may take Biden's infrastructure package to jolt the economy And so far, the White House\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t been all that impressive. Biden\u2019s personal salesmanship doesn\u2019t seem likely to suddenly transform his fortunes, if his low-wattage event filled with recycled stump speech lines and jokes in front of a creaking New Hampshire bridge on Tuesday is a guide. He was in Michigan on Wednesday, touting the electric vehicle provisions of the law at a General Motors facility and vowing to secure the jobs of the future in the United States and not in China. While the Democratic Party and outside groups are stepping up advertising to sell the infrastructure law, there is no real sign yet that it is breaking through in a big way. And previous sales jobs by Biden\u2019s team on more immediate reforms \u2013 like an expansion of the child tax credits \u2013 hardly eased his political difficulties. Months of internal Democratic debate about the size of programs has also fueled GOP charges of out-of-control spending, while distracting from provisions that would actually benefit the public. But even if Biden had the genius for marketing that ex-President Donald Trump claims to possess, simply doing a better job of showcasing the infrastructure law would not do the complex layers of the nation\u2019s mood sufficient justice. The President faces a dark political environment a year before the first midterms of his presidency, which history suggests already come with a high possibility of losing control of Congress. Some of his own missteps \u2013 like overly rosy predictions about the end of the pandemic, a previously blas\u00e9 attitude to rising inflation and his denial of the chaos of the Afghanistan withdrawal over the summer \u2013 all helped drag down Biden\u2019s approval ratings and ability to sell his programs. 4 projects that could be funded by Biden's infrastructure package The Washington narrative of an economy slipping out of control was not helped by a miscalculation that caused a stunning underestimate of 626,000 jobs created this year. The originally reported numbers created days of bad headlines for Biden, and it\u2019s not clear the correction \u2013 which he touted at Wednesday\u2019s event in Detroit \u2013 will shift the public\u2019s perception of the economy that may already be baked in. Many Democrats believe they will be rewarded if they deliver for voters. But that idea may be flawed, at least in the short-term. Passing the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t stop then-President Barack Obama from getting a midterm \u201cshellacking\u201d in 2010 when Democrats lost the House. It took many more years for Obamacare to become so popular that GOP attempts to repeal it because a losing crusade, overshadowing their 2017 tax cut proposals and contributing to their loss of the House in 2018. It is always harder to make a positive case for a law than to demagogue it. Republicans are loving the chance to blame post-pandemic economic glitches on Biden\u2019s policies. It may be unfair, but it plays into voters\u2019 immediate concerns. Many factors are behind the rise in prices, including a supply chain logjam caused by the pandemic, soaring demand by consumers and higher energy prices that make it more expensive to transport goods. But nuance is the first casualty of campaigns. \u201cThis is going to be the most expensive Thanksgiving for American families in history,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, said on Wednesday. His fellow Republican from Alaska, Sen. Dan Sullivan warned: \u201cMore Americans are gonna be driving around to see family and friends and they\u2019re going to start to have sticker shock.\u201d According to GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, \u201cThis year, there won\u2019t be blueberry pie, and there\u2019s not going to be any pumpkin pie.\u201d Florida Sen. Rick Scott \u2013 the head of the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm \u2013 spotted a Grinch. \u201cIt\u2019s Thanksgiving, it\u2019s Hanukkah and Christmas. The Biden administration is doing nothing.\u201d The White House would disagree things are this bad. But the GOP\u2019s relish in painting a picture of deprivation underscores how the perception of tough economic conditions makes it harder for Biden to sell his plans. Seizing on the economy also allows Republicans to distract from the extremism in their ranks as the House on Wednesday voted to censure Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and remove him from his committee assignments over a violent video targeting New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Biden. Fact check on Sen. Rick Scott's comments blaming inflation on government spending It\u2019s fair to debate whether trillions of dollars that Biden has poured into the economy with his spending plans spiked inflation, although there is strong evidence that the aftermath of the pandemic is more to blame than Biden\u2019s legislation. And the fact that other nations that didn\u2019t stimulate their economies are experiencing similar pain would suggest government spending isn\u2019t at fault. Still, \u201cBidenflation\u201d is simply too catchy for Republicans to resist. Their glee prompted White House press secretary Jen Psaki to accuse them this week of \u201crooting for inflation.\u201d While Biden must tout his achievements to drive Democratic voters to the polls next year, he also has another massive obstacle: the conservative media machine limits the audience he can reach. Pro-Trump TV outlets rarely carry Biden\u2019s speeches live or give him a chance to make his case. As he signed the infrastructure bill this week, social media feeds directed at conservative readers were filled with misinformation about the legislation, mockery of Biden\u2019s age, claims that Democrats \u2013 and not Trump\u2019s insurrection-appeasing GOP allies \u2013 were authoritarians, and lobbying for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenage shooter on trial for homicide in a politically charged case in Wisconsin. Americans are not hearing Joe Biden right now But to markedly improve his position Biden must break through in critical Midwestern battleground states. He managed to do so in 2020 in some cases. But right-wing media also constantly showers such voters with cultural rather than economic messages, focusing on immigration, race and guns, which may be just as resonant. So even if Biden\u2019s policies improve the living situations of millions of working Americans, they may not believe the evidence or give Biden credit for it. The idea that better marketing would help Democrats also discounts the question of whether they are actually giving voters what they want. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell often makes the point that minuscule Democratic congressional majorities mean there is no mandate for the kind of vast political reform that Biden is attempting. Even an endangered House Democrat, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, caused a stir by declaring that no one elected Biden \u2013 who carved out a more moderate image in the 2020 campaign \u2013 to be Franklin Roosevelt, the father of the New Deal. The fact that Biden outperformed congressional Democrats on the ballot suggests the 2020 election might have been more of an anti-Trump vote than a pro-Biden one. So it\u2019s possible he may have misread his mandate. But while the political environment looks grim for Biden and the Democrats now, they may have hit bottom. America is forever changing, as forces emerge to reshape national politics. So House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy might not want to take his prediction of a more than 60-seat gain next November to the bank. Anything can happen \u2013 from foreign crises to domestic controversies \u2013 to change voters\u2019 minds in 12 months. Inflation is bad. Infrastructure is good. It\u2019s also reasonable to expect that the national mood could improve next summer, after a public health crisis that has already lasted nearly two years, if plentiful booster vaccines, new anti-viral treatments and high natural immunity make Covid-19 an endemic rather than pandemic threat. Investment bank Goldman Sachs this week predicted that the unemployment rate could slip to a 50-year low of 3.5% by the end of 2022 and that inflation will stabilize. So Biden\u2019s approval ratings \u2013 a critical measure of success for first-term presidents \u2013 might tick up and selling his policies could become far easier. And even if they don\u2019t, Biden is doing what all presidents must do. Power is there to be used because it quickly erodes, and presidents are often remembered for only a few big things once the fever of the political moment has passed. So it makes sense for Biden and any other Democratic or Republican president to go big when they can, even if they struggle to sell what they are doing in the short term.",

            "article_content": "Leavenworth Detention Center seems like a prime example of why President Joe Biden wants to close private prisons: So far this year, the federally contracted jail has been the site of multiple stabbings and a fatal beating. Former guards say drugs and weapons are common behind bars \u2013 and for months, many cell doors didn\u2019t even lock. A judge called it \u201can absolute hellhole\u201d at a recent sentencing hearing. But while the Biden administration is ending contracts with private companies like the one operating the detention center, the Kansas facility and others like it are trying to get around the President\u2019s directive and still collect federal money. One key loophole they\u2019ve found: holding detained immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Biden signed an executive order his first week in office that banned new private prison contracts, but it didn\u2019t apply to immigrant detention centers. A Pennsylvania federal prison owned by the corporate giant GEO Group has reopened as an immigrant detention center, and local officials around the country told CNN prison companies are exploring the same playbook for at least a half-dozen other private facilities with expiring contracts, including possibly at Leavenworth. Activists say the moves amount to a broken campaign promise from the President. \u201cThe Biden administration is literally allowing private prison companies to fill beds that were emptied out under the executive order with immigrant detainees,\u201d said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project. \u201cThese companies are basically playing an end run around the executive order.\u201d Elsewhere, local or county governments are simply stepping in as middlemen, accepting federal funds to hold federal inmates and negotiating new contracts with the same private prison companies to get around the executive order. The tactics have led to an uncertain future for prisons like the Leavenworth Detention Center, which was the first maximum-security federal private prison in the country when it opened three decades ago (and is separate from the more well-known government-run federal penitentiary nearby). The detention center\u2019s contract, with the prison company CoreCivic, is set to expire at the end of next month. Eight current and former correctional officers at Leavenworth told CNN the private jail was putting inmates and staff alike in danger \u2013 allegations that CoreCivic denied. Many of the officers argued the jail shouldn\u2019t be allowed to stay open in any form. \u201cThat facility really needs to be completely shut down,\u201d said Shari Rich, who quit in July after almost 13 years working at the detention center. \u201cOur families are very glad we\u2019re out of there.\u201d Closing private prisons has been a long-standing goal for liberal activists \u2013 and Biden\u2019s election put it within reach at the federal level. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice moved to end its use of private prisons in 2016, following an inspector general report that found federal private prisons were more violent than publicly run facilities. But after President Donald Trump took office, the order was quickly rescinded. Biden reversed course again in January, directing the attorney general not to renew contracts for privately operated detention facilities. His executive order applied only to Department of Justice facilities: about a dozen federal private prisons contracted by the Bureau of Prisons, as well as at least a dozen other private federal jails contracted by the US Marshals Service, which mostly holds pretrial inmates. 'There's no trust': Pro-immigrant groups blasted Biden officials on a call Friday morning The order didn\u2019t include ICE detention centers, which are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 even though Biden had pledged on his campaign website that as president he would \u201cmake clear that the federal government should not use private facilities for any detention, including detention of undocumented immigrants.\u201d That created a significant loophole. George Zoley, the executive chairman of the GEO Group, said during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call on November 4 that in working to reopen the private prisons closed by Biden\u2019s order, \u201cwe\u2019ve made our facilities known to the ICE officials \u2026 and they are evaluating those facilities.\u201d Federal contracts for prisons and jails accounted for about a fourth of revenue last year for the two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and the GEO Group, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, while ICE facilities made up a slightly larger share. Roughly 8 in 10 ICE detainees are held in private facilities. The companies objected to Biden\u2019s executive order, saying the reasoning behind it was flawed. \u201cOur efforts are fully aligned with the administration\u2019s goal to prioritize rehabilitation and redemption for individuals in our criminal justice system,\u201d CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said in an email. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve worked with both Democrat and Republican administrations for the past four decades is a testament to the quality of the services we provide and the genuine need the government has for them.\u201d The prison companies are also adapting and expanding beyond the detention industry to continue raking in federal contracts. In a stark sign that Biden\u2019s order hasn\u2019t blunted their business, the two corporate private giants have been awarded more federal money per day during the Biden administration than during the Trump administration, according to a CNN analysis of federal contracting data. Since Biden took office, the federal government has approved more than $888 million in direct payments to CoreCivic, the GEO Group and their subsidiaries \u2013 or about $3 million per day of Biden\u2019s administration. That\u2019s more than the $2.9 million per day of the Trump administration or $2.2 million per day of the Obama administration. Most of the Biden spending came from ICE. In many cases, the Biden administration is fulfilling contracts originally signed by previous officials, not awarding new deals. But the spending shows how the private prison industry has adapted to the changing political climate: ICE has awarded more than $255 million in payments to a GEO Group subsidiary for ankle monitors and other monitoring services for immigrants in 2021, significantly more than the Trump administration paid for the same program. The monitoring program accounts for the largest private prison company payments of the Biden era. \u201cThe idea of alternatives to detention is being more popularized and receiving support on a bipartisan basis,\u201d Zoley said on the earnings call. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper and it\u2019s effective, and the technology is being continuously improved.\u201d Across the country, prison companies are trying to get around Biden\u2019s executive order in two ways. In some cases, they are working to reopen private prisons as immigrant detention centers. Elsewhere, they are recruiting local governments to act as intermediaries, taking over prison contracts but then passing federal funds on to the private companies. So far, one federal prison has reopened for ICE. The Moshannon Valley Correctional Center, in central Pennsylvania, closed at the end of March, and in late September the GEO Group and ICE signed a contract with the county to reopen the facility as an immigration detention center. While local activists and immigrant advocates criticized the deal, John Sobel, the chairman of the Clearfield County Board of Commissioners, said that it worked out well for his community. In addition to saving roughly 300 jobs at the prison, the county will receive an annual fee of $200,000 under the contract, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare occasion when an entity closes and jobs are lost that you\u2019re able to restore them within such a short time,\u201d Sobel said. Moshannon likely won\u2019t be the only facility to see such a conversion \u2013 prison companies are exploring the possibility of reopening other closed prisons to hold immigrants, local officials around the US told CNN. In Tipton County, Tennessee, the CoreCivic-run West Tennessee Detention Facility closed in September after its contract with the Marshals Service ended. Before the prison closed, local officials were already in negotiations with ICE and CoreCivic about the possibility of an immigration detention center, according to county records. Jeff Huffman, the county executive, said that CoreCivic wanted \u201cto use the county as a passthrough\u201d for ICE, although the details are still being negotiated. He said he thought locals would support an immigrant detention center due to the economic impact of the facility remaining shuttered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you do with a closed prison that\u2019s growing up in johnsongrass and weeds,\u201d he said. And in Big Spring, a small West Texas city that\u2019s home to the GEO Group\u2019s Big Spring Correctional Center, Mayor Shannon Thomason said his city has reached out to both ICE and the US Department of Health and Human Services about the possibility of converting the private prison into an immigrant detention center or a facility for unaccompanied immigrant minors after its contract expires at the end of this month. \u201cICE has expressed an interest,\u201d Thomason said. \u201cIf we do go as an immigrant detention facility, my intent is for it to be a model detention facility.\u201d Other communities, however, have turned down prison companies\u2019 pitches for immigrant detention. In rural Hinton, Oklahoma, the Bureau of Prisons ended its contract with the GEO Group-run Great Plains Correctional Institution, which closed in May. With the prison closed, the town lost about 230 jobs, as well as $1.5 million a year in utilities and fees, according to local officials. Because of the lost revenue, the Hinton government cut one of its six police officer positions as well as its only code enforcer, said Shanon Pack, the town administrator. But Jason Garner, the head of the local economic development agency that contracts with GEO to run the prison, said that the company\u2019s proposal to revive the facility for ICE was a nonstarter. GEO \u201cwanted to use it as a processing facility for illegal immigrants,\u201d Garner said. \u201cThey worked on a contract for that, but we didn\u2019t like the idea because they were going to process the detainees and release some of them into the community.\u201d In Youngstown, Ohio, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, a Marshals Service jail run by CoreCivic, was originally set to close in late February, when its contract expired. But the Marshals Service inked a deal with the Mahoning County Sheriff\u2019s Office to keep it open: The feds pay the county, then the county pays CoreCivic. Even though the jail is still run by a private company, the company never signs a contract directly with the federal government \u2013 and avoids running afoul of Biden\u2019s order. A similar arrangement is being negotiated for the Western Region Detention Facility in San Diego, another Marshals Service jail run by the GEO Group. While its contract was supposed to expire at the end of September, it was granted a six-month extension, and GEO is in talks with the city of McFarland \u2013 250 miles north of the facility \u2013 to serve as a middleman, according to city records. Activists blasted these maneuvers as a blatant strategy to get around Biden\u2019s directive. \u201cIt goes against the spirit of the executive order and against the promises Biden made,\u201d said Setareh Ghandehari, the advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, an advocacy group. The GEO Group did not respond to specific questions about its contracts but said in a statement that it was focused on providing \u201cinnovative, flexible, high-quality solutions that help our government agency partners address current and future support services and infrastructure needs.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and Department of Justice and Marshals Service spokespeople did not answer questions about why the contract extensions had been allowed. \u201cThe Department of Justice is carefully examining its existing contracts with these facilities, while also taking care to avoid unnecessarily disrupting meaningful access to counsel, timely court appearances and case resolutions, and access to family visitation and support,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in an email. An ICE spokesperson said all facilities holding its detainees are \u201crequired to follow ICE\u2019s stringent detention standards, which help ensure that all detainees are treated humanely.\u201d Just beyond the barbed wire fence that surrounds the Leavenworth Detention Center, a string of \u201cNOW HIRING\u201d yard signs and banners advertise a starting wage of $22.75 per hour. But according to guards who work at the jail, which holds up to about 1,000 inmates for the Marshals Service, the recruitment effort is a sign of critical understaffing. In interviews with CNN, eight current and former correctional officers painted a picture of a violent, dangerous prison that spiraled out of control during the coronavirus pandemic. The problems start with the jail\u2019s most basic function: Many of the doors to individual cells simply didn\u2019t lock, after being broken by inmates, all of the guards interviewed by CNN said. Ron Miller, the US marshal for Kansas, confirmed in an interview that broken cell door locks had been a problem in the facility earlier this year but said the issue had been fixed in recent months. The prison has also faced near-constant understaffing, the employees say: Single officers would be assigned to staff areas that in past years would be covered by four or more guards, and several key security posts \u2013 known as pod control posts \u2013 regularly went unmanned. A scarcity of employees has been a problem at Leavenworth for years, with a 2017 inspector general report finding that up to 23% of correctional officer positions were vacant. But guards said the vacancies increased during the Covid pandemic, as more and more employees quit. Constant turnover also meant that many newer guards receive little training before they start working. Guards said weapons such as improvised shanks and drugs are rampant behind bars, with cell blocks often filled with the acrid smell of K2, a type of synthetic marijuana. \u201cJust walking down the hallway, it feels like you get a contact high,\u201d said Justin Chmidling, who started as a guard in February 2019. He said he quit in September after the stress of working there made him physically ill. The deadly cocktail of understaffing, drug use and weapons has led to an eruption of violence in recent years. Data provided by CoreCivic to a federal public defender, and included in an inmate\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction, show that the number of assaults and uses of force has jumped from 2019 to 2020 and 2021.\u202fAnd Leavenworth Police Department data shows a similar increase in calls for service to the facility for reports of battery, assault and rape. Many of the problems with the prison have previously been reported by the Missouri Independent, a nonprofit news organization. Former correctional officer William Rogers said he was assaulted seven times in the detention center over his four and a half years working there, including three times that sent him to the hospital. Documents he provided to CNN show that he and colleagues repeatedly warned CoreCivic higher-ups about violence and security oversights. \u201cRight now we seem to have lost control of the jail,\u201d he wrote in one letter to his warden.\u202f\u201cLeaving these posts empty is putting staff at great risk,\u201d he wrote in another report. But he said that almost none of his missives received a response. \u201cIt\u2019s about the profit for them. They don\u2019t care to make it better,\u201d he said in an interview. Rogers was fired last year for violating a use of force policy by pushing an inmate. In one incident in February, an inmate threw boiling water in the face of a correctional officer, then stabbed, kicked and punched her, according to multiple guards. The inmate also stabbed a second officer as she tried to step in, sending both to the hospital. In August, Leavenworth inmate Scotty Wilson was attacked by another inmate at the facility, who bashed him in the head with a metal food tray. He died two days later. Wilson was being held at the CoreCivic facility for failing to show up to a halfway house after a previous prison stay. Wendi Anaya-Wilson, his widow, said he had described the prison as \u201ctotal chaos,\u201d telling her in phone calls that inmates \u201chad to watch themselves and there was no guards and doors didn\u2019t lock.\u201d \u201cHe was only looking at eight to 14 months, but what he got was the death penalty,\u201d Anaya-Wilson said in an interview. She pulled up photos on her phone from the hospital showing her husband\u2019s bruised and bloodied head \u2013 just above his tattoo of the couple\u2019s names and faces. In a statement, CoreCivic denied \u201cspecious and sensationalized allegations\u201d that Leavenworth is violent or dangerous, arguing that criticism from former employees and activists is \u201cdesigned to exert political pressure rather than to serve as an objective assessment\u201d of the jail. Both public and privately run corrections facilities deal with contraband and violence, and staffing shortages have hit prisons around the country in recent months, Gustin, the CoreCivic spokesperson, pointed out. He said Leavenworth has \u201cmade significant capital investments to the facility to improve safety and security,\u201d including adding a locksmith position, repairing any damaged locks, reducing violent incidents and interdicting more contraband. The company declined to allow a CNN reporter to visit the facility. Federal officials overseeing the facility have made clear they\u2019re aware of the problems. \u201cThe only way I could describe it, frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hellhole,\u201d Julie Robinson, the chief judge of the US district court for Kansas, declared during a September sentencing hearing, according to a transcript reviewed by CNN. A staffer for Robinson declined an interview request for her. With the Leavenworth contract set to expire at the end of December, the Marshals Service is starting to pull detainees out of the jail \u2013 but what comes next is still uncertain. Miller, the US marshal for Kansas, said that most inmates are being relocated to a separate government-run federal prison in Leavenworth. Conditions have improved in the CoreCivic jail as the inmate population has decreased, he said. Still, he said he would have recommended the contract not be renewed even if it weren\u2019t for Biden\u2019s order. \u201cCoreCivic was not able to address it,\u201d Miller said of the violence in the facility. Earlier this year, CoreCivic proposed that the county government take over the facility. The CoreCivic CEO, Damon Hininger \u2013 who grew up nearby and launched his career as a corrections officer at the Leavenworth Detention Center in 1992 \u2013 described the proposal during a meeting of the county commission in April as \u201ca thoughtful but creative way\u201d to keep the jail open and comply with Biden\u2019s executive order. But the county commission eventually turned down the proposal, worried about lawsuits related to the jail. Since then, \u201cwe\u2019ve not had any further contact\u201d from CoreCivic about the facility\u2019s future, said Vicky Kaaz, a commissioner. During CoreCivic\u2019s quarterly earnings call on November 9, Hininger told investors the company is \u201ccurrently in discussions with other potential government partners to utilize the Leavenworth facility,\u201d adding that conversations are happening at a \u201ccouple of different levels.\u201d In Leavenworth, rumors are swirling about who that partner could be. Paul Kramer, the Leavenworth city manager, said he had heard that CoreCivic was exploring the possibility of reopening the jail as an ICE detention center. Several guards said that executives at the prison were still assuring employees in recent weeks that the jail would stay open. An ICE spokesperson declined to comment on whether the facility was being considered. Any facility that\u2019s transformed from a prison to an immigrant detention center would require major renovations. But in at least one past example, a troubled prison converted to hold immigrants continued to have problems after reopening in its new form. \u200b\u200bIn 2019, the Bureau of Prisons stopped using the Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi, operated by CoreCivic, after reports of chronic understaffing, lack of medical care, poor conditions and a riot that had killed a guard. A few months after the Bureau of Prisons left, ICE began using the facility to hold detainees. Local ICE officers objected to the use of the Adams County prison as an immigration detention center \u201cbecause of that facility\u2019s history of chronic understaffing in correctional and health services\u201d but were overridden by ICE headquarters, according to a report from the US Government Accountability Office. Earlier this year, an inspector general report found \u201cviolations of ICE detention standards that threatened the health, safety, and rights of detainees\u201d at the facility, including a medical oversight that had led to a detainee death and lax Covid procedures that had resulted in an outbreak. Activists are worried that if Leavenworth does reopen as an immigrant detention center \u2013 or in another form \u2013 the problems plaguing the facility would continue. Federal public defenders and local American Civil Liberties Union chapters urged the Biden administration in a September letter to keep the facility closed. Sharon Brett, the legal director at the ACLU of Kansas and a former Justice Department lawyer who spent years investigating prison conditions for the federal government, said Leavenworth could be appealing to ICE due to its central location in the US, as well as a new Illinois law forcing the agency to stop detaining immigrants in that state. \u201cIt\u2019s a thousand-bed facility that will be sitting empty in a region that would be ripe for ICE to target,\u201d Brett said. \u201cAs long as the government is going to continue to rely on detention, there is an opportunity for corporations to profit.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\u201cA lot happens in a year.\u201d It\u2019s a favorite phrase for politicos who don\u2019t like the way the winds are blowing. A year ago, it was Republicans saying that. Democrats had just celebrated winning the White House and holding the House, albeit with a slimmer majority than anyone had expected. (Securing the narrow Senate majority would come a couple of months later.) But last week\u2019s gubernatorial results in Virginia and New Jersey now have Democrats getting behind the mantra as they hope the national environment is more favorable to them this time next year. Republicans already had history on their side heading into 2022, and they\u2019re feeling increasingly energized by President Joe Biden\u2019s slipping approval ratings. One year out from the midterms, 58% of Americans say Biden hasn\u2019t paid enough attention to the nation\u2019s most important problems, and a majority disapprove of the way he\u2019s handling his job, according to a new CNN Poll released Tuesday. Biden\u2019s party still had a small advantage on the generic congressional ballot among registered voters in the CNN Poll, but the five most competitive Senate seats are all in states that Biden carried by much smaller margins than he won in Virginia (10 points): Pennsylvania (1.2 points), Georgia (0.3 point), Wisconsin (0.6 point), Arizona (0.4 point) and Nevada (2.4 points). And despite missing out on what would have been their top recruit \u2013 when New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced on Tuesday that he would not run for the Senate \u2013 Republicans are bullish on winning the Granite State, which Biden carried by a more comfortable 7 points last year. They\u2019re even seriously talking up Colorado, which Biden won by 13.5 points \u2013 more than Virginia but less than New Jersey, which he carried by nearly 16 points. Of course, the unspoken factor in all this calculating is candidates. With former President Donald Trump drawing Republicans in Senate primaries to the right, there likely won\u2019t be a bunch of Glenn Youngkin-like candidates on the ballot next November. Virginia\u2019s Republican governor-elect charted a course to winning back the suburbs without alienating Trump\u2019s base that could very well work for some candidates in 2022 \u2013 but that\u2019s only if they become the nominees. Youngkin was nominated at a party convention that doesn\u2019t look much like the Trump loyalty contests that are today\u2019s GOP primaries. And beyond perpetuating unfounded claims about election fraud, some of the former President\u2019s chosen candidates are facing serious scrutiny over their personal lives. That\u2019s one reason why Pennsylvania \u2013 where one of those candidates is running \u2013 remains the seat most likely to flip partisan control, as it has been all year. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring, giving Democrats their best pickup opportunity. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, more polling and advertising spending data will become factors. While Republicans grapple with what their future looks like with Trump out of the White House but still very much engaged in politics, some Democrats have been raising huge sums of money as they fight to hold the Senate. That\u2019s especially true for the newest incumbents \u2013 Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Mark Kelly of Arizona, who are running for full six-year terms next fall. Two incumbents first elected in 2016 \u2013 Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Catherine Cortez Masto \u2013 have raised comparatively less money but could be facing contests just as competitive next fall. After Pennsylvania, the next three seats on the list \u2013 Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona \u2013 remain unchanged. But things have shifted in the middle of the pack, with Nevada sliding above North Carolina and, now that Sununu is not running, above New Hampshire too. Despite Americans\u2019 concerns about the economy, the administration did get a double dose of good news at the end of last week, with an encouraging October jobs report and House passage of the infrastructure bill. Democrats are optimistic about passing the President\u2019s broader social safety net and climate bill in the coming weeks, too, but it\u2019ll be up to them and the President to sell it \u2013 especially if the benefits of the two plans won\u2019t be fully tangible before November 2022. There\u2019s the risk of those measures being overshadowed by headlines like this week\u2019s about surging prices. That there\u2019s still a year to go \u201cmight be the only sliver of good news for Democrats,\u201d Nathan Gonzales wrote in Inside Elections about the aftermath of Virginia and New Jersey. Indeed, as one Democratic strategist noted, the pandemic wasn\u2019t even on anyone\u2019s radar at this point in the 2020 cycle \u2013 so yes, a lot can change in a year. But the clock is ticking. Here are the seats most likely to flip one year from now: Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Pennsylvania still takes the top spot. Biden carried the state in 2020, and it\u2019s an open seat since GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection. Both of those factors made it an early target for Democrats looking to solidify their majority. But now there\u2019s the added element of a messy GOP primary \u2013 one that\u2019s causing some consternation among Republicans who think Trump\u2019s chosen candidate could jeopardize the seat should he win the nomination. Army veteran Sean Parnell\u2019s personal life was dragged out into the open by rival Jeff Bartos, and an ugly custody battle with his estranged ex-wife is making headlines in the state. She has alleged that Parnell choked her and injured their children, claims that he denies. Parnell raised about $1 million in the third quarter but has canceled two fundraising events in the past two weeks, CNN reported Tuesday. Bartos raised $653,000, but $400,000 of that was a personal loan. Carla Sands, another rival candidate and Trump\u2019s ambassador to Denmark, loaned her campaign more than $3 million. Concerns about Parnell, however, may be creating an opening for other candidates, with hedge fund manager David McCormick looking at the race. Democrats also have a crowded primary field \u2013 and Republicans are betting whoever they nominate will be too far left \u2013 but Republicans will need to sort out their own drama before they think about the general election. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock The biggest evolution in GOP primary dynamics over the past few months has to be in Georgia, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is now behind Trump-backed candidate Herschel Walker. His endorsement came after months of hand-wringing from establishment Republicans that Walker wouldn\u2019t be a viable candidate because of his troubled personal history, including accusations that he threatened and abused women. McConnell had even tried to recruit former Sens. Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue into the race. But Trump\u2019s early encouragement of Walker\u2019s candidacy made it hard for other Republicans to see a path. Republicans who have come around to the former football player appreciate that he\u2019s well known in the state and seem to view his openness about some of his mental health struggles as a positive. GOP leadership (No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune has also backed Walker) was impressed by his team, and he went on to raise nearly $3.8 million between late August and the end of September. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, meanwhile, raised an astounding $9.5 million in the third quarter. Democrats see Walker as a flawed candidate and they feel good about Warnock\u2019s image and fundraising prowess. But in a state Biden carried by less than half a point where Republicans have made it harder to vote, the national environment could sweep away even the most prepared incumbents. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson Another season has come and gone, and we\u2019re still waiting for Sen. Ron Johnson to decide whether he\u2019s running for a third term. If he does, he\u2019ll be the only Republican running for reelection in a state that Biden carried last year. That makes him a top target for Democrats, who increasingly believe that his penchant for peddling conspiracy theories makes him a better opponent for them than if this were an open seat. Johnson raised about $906,000 and had spent about $317,000 in the third quarter. At a similar point in the 2016 cycle, before he went on to come from behind and win a second term, he had raised and spent much more, bringing in $1.4 million during the third quarter of 2015 and spending $652,000. Johnson\u2019s approval rating was 36% (42% disapproval) among registered voters in a Marquette Law School Poll conducted in late October. Notably, more than half of voters (54%) said they don\u2019t trust the senator much or at all for information on the pandemic. Biden carried this state by less than a point, however, so it\u2019s the kind of place where the national environment will matter. His approval in the state slid from 49% in August to 43% in that same Marquette poll. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes raised about $1.1 million and has racked up some big endorsements, with the Congressional Black Caucus PAC and End Citizens United//Let America Vote backing him last month. Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who loaned his campaign $750,000 in the third quarter, is running TV ads showing himself in a hard hat while touting the commitments that he \u201chelped build Fiserv Forum on progressive values.\u201d Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has been raising similarly impressive money as Warnock in Georgia, posting $8 million in the third quarter (which included a refund from a campaign vendor). But while Republicans feel like their field is somewhat settled in Georgia with Trump and McConnell now aligned behind the same guy, the primary in Arizona is still a free-for-all that\u2019s causing some concern for the GOP. As the major statewide elected official in the race, Attorney General Mark Brnovich would seem to start with an advantage, but he raised only $564,000 in the third quarter, which would be mediocre money for a candidate in a competitive House district, let alone a top-tier Senate race. He\u2019s also taking incoming fire from his GOP rivals. A super PAC backing Blake Masters, the president of the Thiel Foundation, is attacking Brnovich on the air on immigration. The motif here, as in the other ads against him from the Thiel-funded group, is that he\u2019s been \u201copposing Trump.\u201d Trump was scheduled to attend a fundraiser for Masters at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon ended with the most cash on hand at the end of the quarter, but much of that came from a $3 million personal loan, which doesn\u2019t exactly represent a wide base of support, while retired Maj. Gen. Michael \u201cMick\u201d McGuire raised just $250,000. And there\u2019s now another Republican in the race: Justin Olson \u2013 a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities \u2013 announced his campaign last month. Arizona has a late primary, so Republicans have until August to duke it out. But GOP outside groups are already attacking Kelly, hoping he\u2019ll be sunk by Biden\u2019s slipping numbers. Kelly outran Biden last year \u2013 winning 51.2% of the vote to the President\u2019s 49.4%. But the former astronaut now has a voting record Republicans are eager to use against him. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Nevada moves up a couple of spots on the list, in part because it\u2019s one of the few races where next year\u2019s matchup looks mostly settled: Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt is likely to be challenging Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator. Laxalt may not have the strongest recent track record \u2013 he lost a gubernatorial bid in 2018 \u2013 but he has the backing of both McConnell and Trump, which allows him to look ahead to next November. Biden won the Silver State by just 2 points in 2020, so it\u2019s fundamentally a less Democratic state than New Hampshire, and GOP inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020 could make this state even more competitive. Cortez Masto, meanwhile, could be hobbled by a divided state party. Republicans have tried to tie the former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair, who raised $3 million in the third quarter, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a preview of many more ads likely to be made about Democrats\u2019 social safety net bill. Democrats have also run economic-themed messages, like a contrast ad from Senate Majority PAC that begins by praising the senator for passing Covid relief and then attacks Laxalt. But they\u2019ve also tried to cast Laxalt, Trump\u2019s former state campaign co-chairman, as an election conspiracist. Recently, he\u2019s been leaning into Republican rhetoric on race and education, showing up at a school board meeting in Douglas County last month to call for banning critical race theory. Laxalt entered the race mid-quarter, raising about $1.4 million. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) Trump\u2019s early endorsement of GOP Rep. Ted Budd hasn\u2019t quieted this GOP primary, with former Gov. Pat McCrory and former Rep. Mark Walker still running \u2013 and a new candidate, Marjorie Eastman, entering the race last month, saying, \u201cI am the only political outsider, veteran and woman in this race.\u201d The conservative Club for Growth, which helped Budd emerge from a 17-way primary when he first ran for the House in 2016, has been spending money on TV through its political arm to reinforce that he is Trump\u2019s candidate. Budd and McCrory each raised about $1 million, while Walker brought in only about $122,000 during the third quarter. The March primary will be the first real test of the power of Trump\u2019s endorsement in 2022. Democrats also have a primary. Cheri Beasley, the former state Supreme Court chief justice, raised $1.5 million in the third quarter \u2013 ahead of state Sen. Jeff Jackson ($902,000) and far ahead of former state Sen. Erica Smith ($129,000). Beasley also has the backing of EMILY\u2019s List and End Citizens United//Let America Vote. Democrats supporting her are enthusiastic about the prospect of an African American woman who\u2019s a former statewide elected official driving out rural and minority voters, whom the party has had trouble turning out in the past. But whether that would be enough in a midterm election in a state Biden lost in 2020 remains uncertain. Republicans feel good that North Carolina\u2019s reddish tinge will keep it safely in their hands next year, and they\u2019re feeling even better about those odds if the national environment looks the way it does right now. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan Finally, a decision. Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s announcement that he would forgo the race disappointed national Republicans, who had been salivating over taking out Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Had he run, this seat would have shot near the top of the list of seats likely to flip. Republicans have long maintained that Hassan would be among the most vulnerable incumbents even without the governor running, but as of now they don\u2019t have an A-list candidate. Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who lost to Hassan by about 1,000 votes in 2016, does not seem interested. Trump has already praised retired Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who came up short in the 2020 primary, but having raised just five figures in the third quarter, he\u2019s unlikely to be the candidate to take out Hassan. GOP optimism in this state \u2013 which has trended increasingly blue at the federal level \u2013 has had to do with Hassan\u2019s declining popularity. An October UNH poll, for example, captured a 12-point drop in her already-negative net favorability from September. (Sununu\u2019s favorability had also dropped but his net rating was still positive.) After not being on the ballot for five years, Hassan started reintroducing herself to voters on TV in September. End Citizens United has also been up on TV for her. Democrats are gearing up for a tight race here given the state\u2019s track record of electing Republicans statewide, but they\u2019re hopeful that the Senate contest is much more likely to track with the state\u2019s recent presidential performance. And they\u2019re breathing a giant sigh of relief that Sununu is staying put. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio Rep. Val Demings raised an eye-catching sum in the third quarter: nearly $8.5 million, which is about $2.5 million more than GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, although he ended the quarter with a cash-on-hand advantage. Florida was always going to be tough and expensive terrain for Democrats. There\u2019s excitement that Demings is keeping the money race competitive for now, but big fundraising hauls haven\u2019t always been the best indicator of in-state support (see the Texas Senate race in 2018 or the South Carolina race in 2020). That\u2019s not to discount Demings\u2019 impressive profile, however: The African American former Orlando police chief could blunt some GOP attacks trying to tie her to the national left. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan received the endorsement last month of the man whose success he\u2019s trying to replicate \u2013 Sen. Sherrod Brown is the rare Democrat to win Ohio at the federal level in recent years. It\u2019ll be a difficult path to follow, but Ryan raised $2.5 million in the third quarter while the Republicans continue to fight among themselves over loyalty to the former President. The political arm of the conservative Club for Growth and USA Freedom Fund, for example, have been hitting \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance over his past criticism of Trump. Both groups have backed former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, who has run and lost against Brown. Also running are former state party Chair Jane Timken, businessmen Mike Gibbons and Bernie Moreno, and state Sen. Matt Dolan \u2013 the rare GOP candidate backing the infrastructure deal negotiated by retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) Missouri is somewhat of an outlier on this list because Trump carried it by 15 points \u2013 a far more comfortable margin that either he or Biden carried the other nine states. There\u2019s no question it\u2019s a red state, and if presidential performance is increasingly the best indicator of Senate outcomes, it looks pretty hard for Democrats to flip. But the reason Missouri holds the No. 10 spot is mostly about one man: disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct. Should he become the GOP nominee in Missouri \u2013 which is more likely because of how many candidates are in the primary and could split the vote \u2013 he risks creating a Todd Akin situation for the GOP. The 2012 Senate nominee\u2019s \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost Republicans the Missouri Senate seat and imperiled GOP nominees across the country. To take advantage of that scenario, of course, Democrats need a candidate. Marine veteran Lucas Kunce raised the most money of any candidate from either party \u2013 $849,000 in the third quarter \u2013 but it\u2019ll take more than money to make this race competitive next fall.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s next political nightmare is inflation, a force that can destroy family budgets and political careers and is being driven by domestic and global factors tough for a president to quickly fix. Government data showing the cost of living rose 6.2% over the last 12 months \u2013 the highest rate in 30 years \u2013 set off White House alarm bells on Wednesday and offered a new opening for Republicans lambasting Biden over high energy prices. The figures underscored what all Americans already know. Every trip to the supermarket shows that basic foods like eggs or meat are shooting up in price. The gallon of gas it takes to get to the weekly grocery run is currently averaging $3.40 nationwide. Such pain in the pocket, coming off a demoralizing pandemic that is nearly two years old, threatens Biden\u2019s already weakened political standing as he battles a corrosive political issue affecting voters every day. Inflation is bad. Infrastructure is good. The White House has sometimes been slow to respond to flashing red political warnings \u2013 for instance, over immigration. But there were clear signs of a shift in tone on Wednesday after officials spent months insisting that higher prices were merely a transitory byproduct of the pandemic. Biden first issued a statement saying he would work to bring prices down. Then in a trip to the Port of Baltimore to tout his newly passed bipartisan infrastructure bill, the President went out of the way to show he cared and understood the issue. \u201cEverything from a gallon of gas to a loaf of bread costs more, and it\u2019s worrisome,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMany people remain unsettled about the economy and we all know why. They see higher prices, they go to the store or go online, they can\u2019t find what they always want and when they want it.\u201d Referring to one of the big economic problems slowing the economy \u2013 a clogged up supply chain \u2013 the President did a good job in his speech explaining why a closed factory in Malaysia could make life more expensive in the US. But the political task ahead of him requires a relentless daily focus and repeated strong messaging that has not so far been a strength of the Biden White House. Biden\u2019s speech and his clear urgency about inflation came across as something of a political reset as his approval ratings dip into the mid-to-low 40s. All presidents face diminished popularity and political reversals from time to time. Those that are successful and win second terms show the ability to bounce back from tough times. Biden\u2019s capacity to do so now hinges on his own political dexterity and the extent to which outside forces will shape the politics of the next three years. Still, his team\u2019s swift reaction to the new data does suggest that after a morale-sapping loss in the Virginia gubernatorial race and a much closer-than-expected win in New Jersey last week, the White House is more alert to shifting political tides. Rising prices in the shops and higher home heating costs threaten to cast a pall over the holiday season and make the coming winter more expensive for Americans. A less important, but still significant effect of inflation is how it will weigh on Biden and Democrats heading into midterm elections next year. Already, there are signs that Wednesday\u2019s report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics could yet again complicate the President\u2019s push to pass his vast social spending bill through the 50-50 US Senate. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin was been warning for weeks that an injection of at least another $1.5 trillion dollars into the economy could heat up price rises even more. He insisted that the threat posed by record inflation was not \u201c\u2018transitory\u2019 and is instead getting worse\u201d in a Wednesday tweet. \u201cFrom the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans know the inflation tax is real and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day,\u201d Manchin wrote. Here's why groceries keep getting more expensive Growing political turmoil over inflation also threatens to further politicize the White House\u2019s approach to the Federal Reserve as Biden wrestles over whether to nominate Chairman Jerome Powell, an appointee of ex-President Donald Trump, to a fresh term. The Fed will be a key (and independent) player in reducing inflation, possibly through interest rate hikes, but faces a delicate task in not disrupting a recovering but still fragile labor market. Inflation is an especially damaging political force because of its immediate impact on the well-being on voters. A rate of 6.2% is well above levels at which policymakers can be relaxed about rising prices and threatens to also wipe out wage gains, in effect giving everyone in the country a pay cut. Inflation complicated the pandemic recovery because of a spike in demand coming out of months of lockdowns, a shortage of key commodities and raw materials and higher levels of savings from Americans stuck at home for long periods. It has been exacerbated by disruptions in manufacturing, for instance, in Asia. A shortage of semi-conductors has made items like new cars more expensive and hard to come by and has therefore also pushed up the price of used vehicles. A supply chain crunch has seen ships lining up for days to offload at California ports. Backlogs have been exacerbated by Covid-19 shutdowns in manufacturing hubs abroad and by a shortage of truckers and rail freight capacity in the United States. Biden has taken increasingly active steps to tackle such issues \u2013 for instance, meeting with CEOs of courier companies this week in a bid to ensure shop shelves are full during the coming holiday season. But the root causes of the crisis are complex and worldwide and will defy easy remedies. The political impact of the current price hikes may also be exacerbated because inflation \u2013 which stalked developed world economies in the 1970s and caused huge political turmoil \u2013 had been under control for decades. None of these mitigating factors are stopping Republicans from exploiting the painful cost-of-living increases and prices at the pumps to slam \u201cBidenflation\u201d and to argue that the President\u2019s ambitious political program is squandering past economic gains. \u201cThis is a pay cut families can\u2019t afford,\u201d Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said. \u201cNo wonder Americans now rank inflation alongside Covid as their biggest concerns \u2013 and believe Biden\u2019s $4 trillion tax-and-spending binge will only make prices worse.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, who has recently been more often praised than criticized by Democrats for standing up to Trump\u2019s election lies, also took a swing at the Biden administration on Wednesday over the new data. \u201cThe Biden Admin has tried - and failed - to rely on our adversaries to lower prices at the pump. Now, they\u2019re considering tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is wrong. We should support American oil producers so they can meet our needs,\u201d Cheney wrote on Twitter. Fact check on Sen. Rick Scott's comments blaming inflation on government spending The Wyoming Republican struck at the heart of a politically damaging feature of high gas prices for Biden. He has publicly urged oil-producing nations to pump more crude to bring down prices. But the calls have fallen on deaf ears and risk making him look weak. Similarly, warnings by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in recent weeks that the supply chain problems could linger into next year may be realistic but hardly instill confidence in the administration\u2019s ability to improve things. And rising inflation, if it is still a drag on Americans next year, could make historically difficult midterm elections next November even harder for Democrats by overshadowing their legislative wins. But a new CNN fact check contradicts claims by Republicans that rising prices are solely caused by wasteful Democratic spending. Many factors, including supply chain chaos and production limits by OPEC countries, are factoring into a complicated situation. It\u2019s ironic, given current challenges, that the central premise of Biden\u2019s presidency is making the economy more rewarding and equitable for working Americans. But Biden\u2019s multi-trillion dollar remedies \u2013 the infrastructure and social spending bills \u2013 could take months and years to be felt by regular Americans and to begin to change the political atmosphere. That doesn\u2019t mean fixing roads, creating jobs, providing home health care, free pre-kindergarten and revolutionizing the US power grid with low carbon fuels will not help the economy. But the current needs are more immediate. And it\u2019s not clear Democrats have done a sufficiently good job in selling the benefits of such plans to convince most Americans they will really help. A new CNN poll, for example, found that 58% of people don\u2019t think Biden has paid sufficient attention to the nation\u2019s problems. And the issue cited by the most respondents (36%) was the economy, ahead of the pandemic at 20%. Those figures suggest that to improve his political standing, Biden must now flip from Covid-battler in chief to rescuing a sense of economic wellbeing. Still, White House chief of staff Ron Klain on Thursday insisted that the economy was improving specifically because of steps taken by Biden. \u201cI think things are better in this country than they were a year ago with regard to Covid, with regard to the economy,\u201d Klain told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of work left to do and I think voters are in a show me, don\u2019t tell me mode.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The greatest trick Donald Trump ever pulled was keeping the Republican Party loyal to him even after he cost the GOP control of the White House, Senate and House over his four years in office. I\u2019ve been continually baffled/amazed at how Trump has seemed to tighten his stranglehold over the party despite scads of evidence that make very clear that his presidential term was an unmitigated disaster for his side, electorally speaking. Any other person who presided over this much losing would be cast aside by a party desperate to move on. Instead, Trump is the unquestioned party head and frontrunner for the 2024 nomination. All of which makes very little obvious sense. Unless, that is, you do a deep dive into the various strains of belief within the Republican Party \u2013 at which point it all starts to make some sense. Which is exactly what Pew did \u2013 in its annual political typology survey. What the typology poll seeks to do is to suss out the various factions within each of the two major political parties \u2013 and dig deep on what they believe and why. The data splits the Republican Party into four main buckets: \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives,\u201d \u201cCommitted Conservatives,\u201d \u201cPopulist Right\u201d and \u201cAmbivalent Right.\u201d Of those groups, two are the largest with 23% of Republicans and Republican leaners each fitting into each bucket: \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives\u201d and \u201cPopulist Right.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Those two groups then comprise approximately half of all Republican voters. And their numbers dwarf those who Pew identifies as \u201cCommitted Conservatives\u201d (18%) and the \u201cAmbivalent Right\u201d (13%). Which makes the common threads between what those \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives\u201d and the \u201cPopulist Right\u201d all the more interesting. And what does link them? Their continued support for Trump \u2013 and the idea that the November 2020 election was not conducted fairly. Of \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives\u201d Pew notes: \u201cThey are among Donald Trump\u2019s strongest supporters \u2013 both while he was in office and today. Most say Trump definitely or probably is the legitimate winner of the 2020 election.\u201d And the poll has this to say about the \u201cPopulist Right\u201d: \u201cLike Faith and Flag Conservatives, Populist Right strongly support Trump, and most (81%) would like him to remain a prominent political figure, including 57% who say he should run for president in 2024.\u201d Pew is careful to note that these two groups are not monolithic. They \u201cdiffer over corporate power, economic inequality and taxation of large businesses and wealthy individuals.\u201d But, for the purposes of understanding Trump\u2019s continued appeal, the similarities between these two groups are what\u2019s important. And, if we take it out of the language of Pew and put it more into our traditional ways of describing the coalitions within the GOP, Trump\u2019s sustained strength within the party starts to make more sense. Substitute \u201cevangelicals\u201d for \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives\u201d and combine that with anti-establishment/anti-elite Republicans  (\u201cPopulist Right\u201d) and you can understand how Trump not only won the Republican primary in 2016 but also remains such a potent force within the party. (Sidebar: What\u2019s still something of a mystery is how thrice married and openly profane Donald Trump became the preferred voice of evangelicals in this country.) Trump effectively controls half of the party solely because he is who he is \u2013 a natural populist committed to appointing conservative judges. And, the other factions within the party are simply not strong enough to stand up to him. Again, take Pew\u2019s \u201cCommitted Conservatives\u201d and read that as \u201cestablishment Republicans.\u201d (As Pew puts it of this group: \u201cWhen asked to name the best president of the last 40 years, they are much more likely to say Ronald Reagan than any of his successors.\u201d) Even if you combine those establishment Republicans with the \u201cAmbivalent Right,\u201d you only cover 3 in every 10 Republicans in the party. And there\u2019s plenty of reasons not to combine those two groups since the \u201cAmbivalent Right\u201d \u201care far more moderate on immigration and on social issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization.\u201d The simple conclusion from the Pew study is this: Members of the \u201cFaith & Flag Conservatives\u201d dovetail very nicely with those in the \u201cPopulist Right\u201d \u2013 and both groups, which make up roughly half of all Republicans, remain extremely loyal to the former president and believe his Big Lie about the 2020 election. And there\u2019s this: The factions within the GOP who are more skeptical of Trump and his broader populism are both relatively small and too internally fractured to represent any sort of real resistance to the former president. Which all means that the Trumpist base within the party remains quite strong \u2013 and that there is very little chance of Trump not being the party\u2019s nominee again in 2024 if he decides to run.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped anime video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in response Monday saying a \u201ccreepy member\u201d of the House had \u201cshared a fantasy video of him killing me.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019ll face no consequences bc @GOPLeader cheers him on with excuses,\u201d the New York Democrat added. As part of the initial tweet, Gosar asked, \u201cAny anime fans out there?\u201d He also shared a link to the video. Gosar is portrayed as a cartoon anime-type hero and is seen attacking a giant with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 face with a sword from behind. The giant can then be seen crumbling to the ground. Another scene shows Gosar flying through the air, swinging two swords at a character with President Biden\u2019s face. Gosar said in a statement Tuesday night that he doesn\u2019t \u201cespouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden,\u201d going on to say that the video \u201csymbolizes the battle for the soul of America when Congress takes up\u201d the President\u2019s economic package, which he said includes immigration provisions he disagrees with. \u201cThis video is truly a symbolic portrayal of a fight over immigration policy,\u201d the congressman said in the statement. Gosar\u2019s digital director, Jessica Lycos, had said in a statement to The Washington Post on Monday night, \u201cEveryone needs to relax.\u201d Gosar had tweeted a similar sentiment on Tuesday morning, using another meme that included the phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s a cartoon. Relax.\u201d Calls to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy requesting comment have not been returned. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged McCarthy to call on the House Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate Gosar\u2019s video. \u201cThreats of violence against Members of Congress and the President of the United States must not be tolerated. @GOPLeader should join in condemning this horrific video and call on the Ethics Committee and law enforcement to investigate,\u201d Pelosi tweeted Tuesday. In a news release, four Democrats who co-chair the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, wrote, \u201cIn any other job in America, if a coworker made a video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.\u201d The Democrats called on McCarthy to take action, writing \u201cMr. McCarthy needs to decide whether he will finally stand with the American people on the side of law and order or he will continue to support violence and chaos.\u201d The co-chairs include Democratic Reps. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, Debbie Dingell of Michigan, Ted Lieu of California and Joe Neguse of Colorado. Twitter said Monday evening that the video violated its rules on \u201chateful conduct\u201d but did not remove the video, instead affixing a label to it that reads, \u201cTwitter has determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\u201d The video was also posted to Instagram, owned by Facebook (now Meta). Instagram labeled the video as \u201csensitive content\u201d Tuesday. \u201cThe video may contain graphic or violent content,\u201d the label states. In a section explaining why the video was labeled that way, Instagram explains, \u201cThis post doesn\u2019t go against our community standards, but may contain images that some people might find upsetting.\u201d The company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Monday night. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cthere is absolutely no place for of any kind of \u2013 no place for any violence of any sort in this political system,\u201d but she did not weigh in on how social media companies should go about moderating that type of content. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go any further than that. I leave it to the social media platform on how they\u2019re gonna move forward on that. But there is no place for any type of violence or that type of language in the political system and it should not be happening and we should be condemning it,\u201d she said at a White House press briefing. Gosar, a Republican congressman from Arizona, voted against certifying the election for Biden, and has said that Ashli Babbitt, who was shot at the capitol on January 6 had been \u201cexecuted\u201d and that \u201c(t)he Capitol Police officer that did that shooting appeared to be hiding, lying in wait and then gave no warning before killing her.\u201d Several law enforcement agencies including the Justice Department have cleared that officer of any wrong doing in the shooting. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Jason Hoffman, Annie Grayer and Elise Miller contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "So much for the Republican Party being all about the future. A week ago, Glenn Youngkin showed his party a new way to win. His triumph in the Virginia governor\u2019s race sparked talk of a new GOP surge in the suburbs, of tiptoeing past Donald Trump and of letting 2020 election conspiracies go. But now the party is showing its uglier, and arguably more authentic, face, even as ex-President Trump suffers a rebuke from a court that rejected his bid to keep hundreds of documents related to the US Capitol insurrection secret. Violence is now everywhere in our political debates An Arizona congressman tweeted a photoshopped anime video of himself slaying liberal Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Sen. Ted Cruz , a Texas Republican, has reportedly been spitballing about secession. Michigan Rep. Fred Upton shared a vile voicemail branding him a traitor and threatening his family after he was one of the handful of Republicans to vote for a bipartisan infrastructure bill to create jobs mending roads, bridges and airports. And the ex-President himself has taken his incitement and obsessional lies about an election in which he tried to destroy US democracy to new levels of intensity. He has already notified the court that he is appealing the judge\u2019s ruling Tuesday night that the current President\u2019s decision not to assert privilege over the documents outweighs Trump\u2019s position that they should not be handed over. For all the signs of a newly focused GOP ready to exploit President Joe Biden\u2019s struggles against inflation and high gas prices and to court parents dismayed over pandemic school closures, its unhinged wing is again stealing the spotlight. The GOP is again coming across as a party that glorifies violence, denies truth, defies constitutional order, excuses insurrection, fuels conspiracy theories, appeases extremists and trashes democracy in its zeal to grab back power. A week after Youngkin won because he had listened to voter concerns that Democrats failed to hear, the GOP extreme entertainment machine, which seems to exist to drive outrage-fueling content for right-wing media, is humming again. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, one of Trump\u2019s most vehement defenders, is at the center of the latest insult to decency, after his social media post about Ocasio-Cortez, which also showed his cartoon figure slashing at a representation of Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s a cartoon. Relax,\u201d Gosar wrote in a graphic on a follow-up tweet. In a later statement, Gosar denied that he had meant \u201cviolence or harm\u201d toward any member of Congress or Biden, claiming the animation was meant to portray a fight over immigration and that the monsters it depicted with the faces of the President and Ocasio-Cortez were supposed to portray \u201cthe policy monster of open borders.\u201d \u201cIt is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life,\u201d Gosar said. His statement, however, noticeably referred repeatedly to \u201cMr. Biden\u201d and did not use his rightful title of \u201cPresident.\u201d As usual, critics of stunning GOP incivility are being accused of lacking a sense of humor or being overly literal. But given America\u2019s blood-spattered history of political assassinations and attacks on members of Congress, Gosar\u2019s threat against a fellow lawmaker is hardly a joke. And quips about violence are a lot less funny in a nation traumatized by the attack by a pro-Trump mob on Congress that resulted in four deaths, saw scores of police officers beaten and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Gosar has said that crowd of criminals was full of \u201cpeaceful patriots\u201d and like many of his House GOP colleagues, has tried to wipe the history of the worst affront against US political values in generations. As many observers pointed out, Gosar\u2019s behavior would likely be a firing offensive in many jobs. Yet it did not cause House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who after next year could be called upon to uphold the highest moral and ethical standards of Congress as speaker, to break his silence. The California Republican has a long record of tolerance for extremism among allies of Trump, whose base he hopes to ride to power in midterm elections next year. Indeed, he was the first top party leader to embrace Trump after the insurrection when political expediency forced him to repudiate his initial criticism of his friend\u2019s incitement of violence. Some old-school Republicans are dismayed about what has become of their party. \u201cI think it\u2019s incumbent on Republican leadership, particularly Kevin McCarthy, to set standards of conduct and to enforce them,\u201d former GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d on Tuesday. Republicans who voted for Biden's infrastructure bill come under fire from Trump The bile heaped on 13 GOP members who backed a bipartisan infrastructure bill revealed another example of the zealotry pulsating through the conservative populist movement. Upton revealed on CNN a voice mail calling him a \u201cf**king piece of sh*t traitor\u201d after Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading light of the GOP\u2019s stunt and conspiracy caucuses, tweeted the phone numbers of Republican colleagues who voted for the bill and called them traitors. Greene, who has carved a reputation for insults, tantrums and spectacles since coming to Congress earlier this year, is becoming a metaphor for the modern GOP \u2013 one barely recognizable as ex-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s party, which once prided itself on making the world safe for democracy after winning the Cold War. The latest eruption from extreme GOP rabble-rousers came after leading Republicans had spent the last few days arguing that Youngkin\u2019s success and Biden\u2019s troubles pointed to a new path for the party. Nearly a year after Trump left office, the party had hopes of reconnecting with suburban voters alienated by the ex-President. \u201cWe can no longer talk about the past and the past elections \u2013 no matter where you stand on that issue, no matter where you stand, it is over,\u201d ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told influential fundraisers over the weekend. Christie was referring to Trump\u2019s lies claiming the last election was stolen, which tens of millions of the ex-President\u2019s supporters now believe. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has tolerated Trump for years in the cause of bolstering his own power but nevertheless wants to move forward, also tried to haul his party out of the Trumpian abyss this week. \u201cI think the election will be about the future, not about the past,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said, saying the key to the 2022 midterm elections was focusing Americans on the Biden administration\u2019s policies. Given underlying historic and political factors, next year\u2019s elections are likely to be favorable for Republicans. Chris Christie delivers tough message to Republican audience, saying GOP gains hinge on moving on from 2020 But events of the last few days show the core weakness of the Christie/McConnell approach. The incidents also exposed the naivete of the idea that the Youngkin blueprint, which relied on sending coded signals to Trump supporters but avoiding the ex-President himself, could work everywhere for Republicans in 2022, especially with Trump handpicking some problematic candidates in key primaries. After five years in Trump\u2019s thrall, and after he repeatedly lowered the standards of public discourse, GOP leaders have no capacity to control their own supporters and are unable to demand civility from their elected members. Their path to power also runs through the very Trump supporters to whom radicals like Greene and Gosar are trying to appeal. In a recent poll by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, 30% of Republicans said they believed violence might be necessary to \u201csave the United States\u201d \u2013 proof of the power of Trump\u2019s insurrectionist and racially suggestive message that the country has been stolen from real, patriotic Americans. Faced with such realities, Youngkin-style tightrope walking is almost impossible to pull off on a national stage. Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who is running the GOP\u2019s bid to take back the Senate next year, for instance, repeatedly refused in an interview with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar this week to condemn Trump\u2019s recent claims that future US elections will be corrupt unless his 2020 loss is overturned. Leaders like Scott would much prefer to talk about serious economic problems that are haunting the Democratic White House and the GOP\u2019s new opening on education. But Trump\u2019s repeated inflammatory attacks on the electoral system and the determination of his extremist acolytes are showing no sign of abating. The ex-President sent out a flurry of statements just on Tuesday, claiming the real insurrection had taken place on Election Day last year, not on January 6. His latest blasts came as some of his aides refuse subpoenas issued by the House select committee investigating the attack. Their obstructionism raises questions about Congress\u2019 constitutional role in assuring checks and balances on executive power for decades to come. And it deepens concerns that if he wins back the White House in a possible 2024 campaign, the ex-President will finish the job of obliterating democracy. As he plays a far more visible role in the midterms than he has during an already active first year out of office, it will become even harder for Republicans to replicate Youngkin\u2019s model of deliberately forgetting to mention him. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the few House Republicans to tell the truth about Trump\u2019s coup attempt on January 6, bemoaned the state of her party on Tuesday. She warned that the US was confronting a threat it had never faced before \u2013 \u201ca former President who\u2019s attempting to unravel the foundations of our constitutional republic, aided by political leaders who have made themselves willing hostages to this dangerous and irrational man,\u201d Cheney said. In a speech in New Hampshire, the Wyoming lawmaker, who is facing a primary challenge from pro-Trump forces, lambasted \u201cpolitical leaders who sit silent in the face of these false and dangerous claims.\u201d But Cheney is an outlier, certainly in the House GOP, which booted her from its leadership earlier this year. And there was a new sign on Tuesday that the uproar and bitter divides in Washington may be depriving the party of some of its top talent. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, one of his party\u2019s most coveted recruitment targets to run for the Senate, announced he would stay in the Granite State and run for reelection. \u201cI\u2019d rather push myself 120 miles an hour delivering wins for New Hampshire than to slow down, end up on Capitol Hill debating partisan politics without results. That\u2019s why I am going to run for a fourth term,\u201d Sununu said. The state of the GOP in Washington is in many ways a national tragedy. It deprives conservatives of a voice untainted by violence and demagoguery. But more importantly, governance itself is weakened when one of the country\u2019s two great parties is consumed by extremist dogma and rage. And ultimately, it threatens the very existence of American democracy, which is under siege on multiple fronts from a radicalized party that has lost control of itself.",

            "article_content": "Just as Democrats face another round of hand-wringing about their erosion among working-class and rural White voters, the long-delayed congressional approval of a historic infrastructure plan will test President Joe Biden\u2019s central theory on how the party can reverse that decline which was highlighted by last week\u2019s daunting election results in Virginia and New Jersey. Biden and many of his advisers have long argued the best way for Democrats to regain ground with blue-collar voters is to show that government can deliver them material benefits. The party is increasingly attempting to reach out to Hispanic blue-collar voters and even some Black ones \u2013 not only the White blue-collar voters, who have drifted toward the GOP since the 1960s. The bipartisan infrastructure plan, which Biden calls a \u201cblue-collar blueprint to rebuild America,\u201d constitutes one prong of that plan, with spending designed to spur employment in such working-class occupations as construction, energy retrofits and manufacturing; the other prong is the massive spending bill the President still hopes to steer through Congress solely with Democratic votes by Thanksgiving. That proposal, experts say, tilts its benefits heavily toward working-class families across racial lines, including subsidies for child care and health care and an expanded child tax credit, as well as programs that would support potentially more than 1 million caregiving jobs. Just as importantly, the plans fund these new benefits primarily with higher taxes on corporations and the most affluent. In an extensive new study of working-class attitudes released last Friday, the veteran Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg and firms specializing in Black and Hispanic voters argue that the combination \u2013 new benefits for economically squeezed families, funded by confronting groups that have benefited from increasing economic inequality \u2013 provides Democrats their best chance to improve with blue-collar voters of all races. \u201cThis polling and this collaboration is a wake-up call that says these people are desperate to have someone battle for them,\u201d says Greenberg, who became renowned in the mid-1980s for documenting the alienation from the Democratic Party of White blue-collar \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d in Macomb County, outside Detroit. \u201cThey are only there [electorally] if you want to change the power balance \u2026 if you want to make real big economic change, and you really understand their lives. And it\u2019s been a long time since they have seen that from Democrats.\u201d But the depth of the hole Democrats face with working-class White voters was underscored by last week\u2019s election losses in Virginia, where exit polls showed Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin, a wealthy former private equity executive, winning about three-fourths of Whites without college degrees, and in New Jersey, where the longtime Democratic president of the state Senate was swept away in a heavily blue-collar district by a Republican truck driver who had never before sought office. To many analysts, those outcomes underscore how many cultural barriers still limit Democrats among White blue-collar voters, even if they can deliver more kitchen-table assistance. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are in the reconciliation package that will be very beneficial \u2026 to the White working class and non-White working class,\u201d says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist who recently published a study on attitudes among working-class White voters. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem to matter, because it\u2019s not what they are voting on. What they are voting on is that they are much more closely aligned with Republicans across a whole range of issues, that arrays from cultural issues that get a lot of play to racial issues, immigration.\u201d Virtually no analyst in either party believes that Democrats, whatever strategy they follow, can win a majority of working-class White voters. (No Democratic presidential candidate has done so since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, polls show). But the difference between a normally disappointing midterm for the party holding the White House and a catastrophic result that could lock Democrats out of congressional power for years may come down to whether they can regain any ground with working-class voters of all races from the direct economic benefits that the infrastructure plan will deliver \u2013 and that the reconciliation plan could deliver if Democrats overcome the intractable internal disagreements that have stalled its approval for months. White voters without four-year college degrees functioned as the brawny backbone of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cNew Deal\u201d electoral coalition from the 1930s through the 1960s. The party\u2019s erosion with those voters after that, largely around issues of racial equity and cultural change, generated enormous alarm and internal debate during the 1970s and especially 1980s: The centrist \u201cNew Democrat\u201d movement led by Bill Clinton was sparked mostly by the desire to win back more blue-collar and rural Whites. From roughly 1992 through 2008, Democrats settled into a sustainable equilibrium with these voters. In national exit polls over that period, Democratic presidential candidates consistently won only about two-fifths of them, but they typically captured significantly higher percentages in the key Rust Belt battleground states (such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania). Over this period, Democrats were able to overcome their deficits with working-class Whites in the Rust Belt and beyond by maximizing their performance among college-educated White voters and people of color, both of whom were growing as a share of the electorate, while blue-collar Whites were shrinking nationally on average about 2 to 3 percentage points every four years. (Those working-class Whites have fallen from about 52% of all voters in 2004 to just under 40% last year, according to census results.) But since 2012, Democrats\u2019 position with these working-class White voters has slipped further, in a manner that has grown more difficult to overcome with improved performance and turnout among other groups, especially in less diverse industrial battlegrounds. The Democrats\u2019 national vote share among them fell to a little over one-third in President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 election before cratering to just below 30%, according to multiple data sources, in Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton; as important, Trump erased enough of the Democratic blue-collar overperformance in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to capture all three states and squeak out his Electoral College win while losing the national popular vote. A lot of these issues are tied in with this sense of racial and cultural grievance. There\u2019s a sense they don\u2019t like the way the country is changing, they think Democrats and liberals are catering to non-Whites and immigrants and they are not looking out for their interests. Even when they are offering them policies that would benefit them, you can\u2019t seem to penetrate that.\u201d Alan Abramowitz, Emory University political scientist In 2020, Democrats slightly recovered among non-college-educated White voters, with Biden winning about one-third of them nationally and recapturing just enough to help flip back the three pivotal Rust Belt states that had keyed Trump\u2019s win. But the 2020 results opened a new vein of anxiety for Democrats, with some evidence that Trump had gained among working-class Hispanic voters, too, especially men. Last week\u2019s results triggered new Democratic alarms about the trends with these non-college and non-urban voters, particularly Whites. Youngkin pushed his vote share past 80% in multiple rural southwestern Virginia counties and captured fully 76% of all non-college Whites statewide, according to the exit poll conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Close to three-fourths of those non-college Whites disapproved of Biden\u2019s job performance, according to results provided by the CNN polling unit. In part, Youngkin ran so well with non-college-educated Whites in Virginia because half of them identified as evangelical Christians, a devoutly Republican constituency: Youngkin carried more than 9 in 10 of those White evangelicals without college degrees, the CNN polling unit found in previously unreported results. That\u2019s a common deficit for Democrats across the South, where evangelicals compose a relatively larger share of the working-class White population and often vote for Republicans in such overwhelming proportions. More ominous for Democrats was the Virginia outcome among the half of non-college White voters there who are not evangelicals \u2013 a group that is more populous in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds. In 2018, the exit polls found that Democrats carried a majority of those voters in House races nationwide; in 2020, the exit polls and other post-election analyses found that Biden won 42% to 45% of them. But Youngkin last week carried fully 65% of them, holding McAuliffe to just 35%, a result that presages ominous losses for Democrats across the Midwest if it holds through the midterm elections. Avoiding such an outcome is the goal of the study released last Friday by Democracy Corps (a group founded by Greenberg and longtime Democratic strategist James Carville), Equis Research (which focuses on Hispanic voters) and HIT Strategies (which concentrates on African Americans and millennials). Based on extensive online polling conducted through late October in battleground states, the poll portrays Democrats facing towering discontent in line with the dismal results from Virginia and New Jersey. \u201cDemocrats,\u201d the authors write in a memo summarizing the results, \u201cbegin weak on crime, immigration, the economy, who is best on jobs and wages, losing to Trump on who is better at delivering for the forgotten Americans.\u201d The party\u2019s best chance to reverse those perceptions, the authors argue, is to deliver policies that address \u201cpeople\u2019s acute economic needs (Medicare expansion & lower health insurance premiums and the expanded child tax credit delivered monthly)\u201d and, just as important, to send a signal of their allegiance by funding those initiatives through higher taxes on big corporations and the wealthy. In testing that message, Greenberg said in an interview, \u201cI was stunned by how much of an audience [Democrats] got.\u201d He added: \u201cFor decades, [working class voters] have not heard a Democratic Party that is upset with the status quo, really wakes up every day wanting big economic change, wanting changes in economic power, wanting workers to have more of a say and higher incomes.\u201d Terrance Woodbury, CEO and founding partner at HIT Strategies, says legislative progress on the party\u2019s economic agenda is critical not only to holding working-class White voters but also to motivating the intermittent African American voters who surged to the polls against Trump in 2018 and 2020. Biden\u2019s favorability, he says, has fallen more among those voters than more reliable (and usually older) Black voters. Those surge voters, Woodbury says, have \u201can acute awareness that they were responsible for or contributed to the Democratic power in Washington, and they just aren\u2019t seeing any results yet.\u201d Standing up for certain traditional cultural principles against the left might help Biden establish his own bona fides. He can\u2019t really ride on \u2018Amtrak Joe.\u2019 Andrew Levison, contributing editor,The Democratic Strategist These consultants\u2019 advice to stress kitchen-table economic assistance to working-class families of all races fits squarely with the plans of White House and Democratic congressional leaders, who see touting the infrastructure plan and broader reconciliation bill (if they can finally pass it) as their best chance to avoid severe midterm losses next year. \u201cFor all of you at home who feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that\u2019s changing so rapidly \u2013 this bill is for you,\u201d Biden declared after the House finally approved the infrastructure plan last week. Adam Hersh, who analyzed the infrastructure and reconciliation plans for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, projects the plans would create about 4 million jobs, and that about four-fifths of them would not require college degrees. Still, many political analysts and operatives remain skeptical that Democrats can regain much ground with working-class White voters in particular so long as Republicans are stressing an ever-mutating roster of issues that inflame the anxiety many of them feel about cultural and demographic change. With help from conservative media, Youngkin, for instance, focused enormous attention on a backlash among some White parents over how racial issues should be discussed in Virginia schools. For working-class White voters, \u201ca lot of these issues are tied in with this sense of racial and cultural grievance,\u201d says Abramowitz. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense they don\u2019t like the way the country is changing, they think Democrats and liberals are catering to non-Whites and immigrants and they are not looking out for their interests. Even when they are offering them policies that would benefit them, you can\u2019t seem to penetrate that.\u201d Given those barriers, a diffuse constellation of Democratic thinkers and operatives have lately coalesced behind a distant echo of the arguments from the \u201cNew Democrats\u201d and the Democratic Leadership Council during the 1980s. They maintain the party will face further losses in 2022 and 2024 unless it more explicitly repudiates the most aggressive positions from its left flank, particularly on racially infused issues including \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and \u201cdefunding the police.\u201d In Republican-leaning states and districts, \u201cDemocratic candidates have to forcibly separate themselves from the Democratic brand\u201d on cultural questions, says Andrew Levison, a contributing editor at The Democratic Strategist, a website that debates the party\u2019s choices. He argues that \u201ca reckoning does have to be done with certain elements of the progressive wing of the party\u201d and that Biden should directly renounce some left-leaning ideas on race the way Bill Clinton did in 1992, when he criticized the rapper Sister Souljah. \u201cStanding up for certain traditional cultural principles against the left might help Biden establish his own bona fides\u201d for 2024, says Levison. \u201cHe can\u2019t really ride on \u2018Amtrak Joe.\u2019 \u201c To Democratic groups rooted in the nation\u2019s rapidly growing minority communities, this approach represents both a moral and electoral dead end. They argue that downplaying demands for racial equity is unlikely to win back many working-class Whites, but will inexorably depress turnout among the irregular young non-White voters who contributed so significantly to the Democratic gains in 2018 and 2020. Instead, they argue that Democrats should stress the material benefits their programs would produce \u2013 and then directly attack the Republican use of racial issues as an attempt to divert attention from their opposition to such programs. \u201cInstead of ignoring race while Republicans beat us silly with it, Democrats must confront it and explain that powerful elites and special interests use race as a tool of division to distract hardworking people of all races while they get robbed blind,\u201d Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson, two leading Democratic strategists in this camp, wrote after the Virginia result. CNN Poll: Majority of Americans say Biden isn't paying attention to nation's most important issues As Greenberg acknowledges, whatever approach Democrats follow, or whatever agenda they pass, the party will still face strong headwinds among working-class voters of all races next year unless they also see improvement in the immediate conditions concerning them, from inflation and Covid to crime. \u201cA lot depends on what is really happening a year from now,\u201d he says. That dynamic was underscored by a CNN poll released Monday that showed about three-fifths of Americans (and nearly three-fourths of non-college-educated Whites) say that Biden, who has spent weeks caught in the party\u2019s legislative quagmire, has not focused on the issues that most concern them. The nearly unbroken pattern since the Civil War of midterm House losses for the president\u2019s party also suggests that even a brighter national mood might not prevent Democrats from surrendering at least that chamber. The bigger question for Democrats may be whether the kitchen-table agenda embodied in the infrastructure and reconciliation plans will help Biden, or another nominee, win in 2024 by holding enough working-class Whites and Hispanics otherwise drawn to conservative Republican cultural messages. Lynn Vavreck, a UCLA political scientist and co-author of the book \u201cIdentity Crisis,\u201d about the 2016 election, says that whatever Democrats do, attitudes toward cultural and racial change are likely to overshadow economics as the principal driver of most people\u2019s political loyalties. \u201cThat\u2019s where we are now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not going back to fighting over the New Deal. We are going to fight over this for the foreseeable future.\u201d But, she notes, because the country is so closely divided, particularly in the states at the tipping point of the Electoral College and Senate control, even if Democrats can move only a small number of working-class voters by delivering more material benefits to them, that shift could have a huge impact. \u201cCan you make a big enough dent to win the 2024 presidential election?\u201d she asked, before answering her own question: \u201cYeah, because you don\u2019t need to [change] that many votes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The Covid-19 vaccine debate is getting weird. On Twitter, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz accused Big Bird of pushing \u201cGovernment propaganda\u2026for your 5 year old!\u201d after the Muppet tweeted about getting the shot in his wing. CNN aired a special on Saturday with \u201cSesame Street\u201d to explain the vaccine to children ages 5-11, who are now eligible to get the shot. Watch Rosita, a green Muppet, overcome her fear and bravely get her first Covid-19 vaccine dose. Big Bird talks to Dr. Gupta about Covid-19 vaccine fears Meanwhile, Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, did not. Then he lied about it. And now he\u2019s trying to explain it away. Rodgers seemed so smart when guest hosting \u201cJeopardy\u201d in the spring. He did not sound very smart when he spewed Covid-19 conspiracy theories on a podcast Friday and said that he had done his own research rather than rely on the medical community\u2019s advice. Once known for speaking out about social justice, he\u2019s now mainlining conservative talking points and complaining a \u201cwoke mob\u201d is out to get him. Some people will not be convinced. Rodgers bought into the false and viral fear that the vaccine could affect fertility. He\u2019s getting advice from the anti-vaccine podcast host Joe Rogan, who is not a doctor but who debated vaccines for more than three hours with CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta last month. Room for debate. The vast majority of doctors and the public health community is on board with vaccines. But support is not unanimous. It is not completely settled within the National Institutes of Health, which includes Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, according to a Sunday report in the Wall Street Journal. The paper profiles the NIH\u2019s Dr. Matthew Memoli, a senior researcher who disagrees with the country\u2019s current all-in approach on vaccines. He\u2019s applied for a religious exemption for himself and feels the country should be pushing the vaccine to at-risk communities like seniors rather than giving it to as many people as possible. He\u2019ll take part in a debate streamed to NIH employees, according to the Journal, and he is apparently willing to leave his job rather than get the Covid-19 shot. US borders reopen. While debates continue, travel policies are evolving. See: fully booked flights from Europe and traffic stretching for miles into Mexico. US borders opened up to vaccinated international travelers Monday, ending an 18-month moratorium and marking a welcome change to the pandemic lifestyle as cases drop in the US. But this comes just as the virus reemerges in Europe. Here are some of the takeaways from CNN\u2019s report: Who can enter the US? Fully vaccinated travelers from 33 countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom and much of Europe \u2013 can now enter the US without needing to quarantine, provided they have proof of vaccination and a negative viral test. Where is the virus surging? Large swathes of Europe are battling to beat back surges of the Delta variant, amid the relaxation of restrictions and stuttering vaccine rollouts in some countries, with the WHO warning half a million Europeans could die with Covid-19 in a potentially devastating winter. Germany on Monday recorded its highest seven-day incidence rate since the pandemic began\u2026 \u2026neighboring Austria banned unvaccinated people from restaurants and hotels amid a surge in cases. Iceland has also reintroduced masks and social distancing rules following a rise. And cases are hovering at record levels in Russia, Ukraine and Greece. Vaccine rule halted for now. A federal appeals court temporarily halted the Biden administration\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule that requires most workers to be vaccinated or submit to regular Covid-19 testing. The court said it would expedite its review of the lawsuit brought by states and private businesses challenging the rule, which is supposed to go into effect January 4. Republicans interested in running for President are falling over themselves to join the lawsuit. More than half of US states \u2013 26 \u2013 have objected to the rule. Going from pandemic to endemic. I liked this phrasing in a CNN report since, with borders opening, schools in session and young kids getting the shot, it feels like we\u2019re in a new place. Maybe that\u2019s the \u201cendemic\u201d part of it. From the report: Endemic means that a disease has a constant presence in a population \u2013 but it\u2019s not affecting an alarmingly large number of people as typically seen in a pandemic. Even in early 2020, as the pandemic was ramping up, officials at the World Health Organization predicted that the novel coronavirus \u201cmay become another endemic virus in our communities\u201d and never go away. Backlash to Covid-19 policies could play out for years. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown sat down with a group of Virginia women who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but supported Republican Glenn Youngkin in the state\u2019s governor\u2019s race last week. Their reasoning had everything to do with Covid-19 restrictions: anger about their children being out of the classroom last year and frustration that more is not being done to bring kids up to speed. \u201cI had to figure out what can I do to make sure that never happens again,\u201d Shawnna Yashar said of school closures. A warning for Biden and Democrats. While vaccines are the topic of ongoing debates, voters are more focused on the economy than the pandemic, per a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. From the report: As the election year approaches, the nation\u2019s issue landscape appears to be shifting. With the latest wave of Covid-19 infections subsiding and prices on the rise, the economy (36%) outranks the coronavirus pandemic (20%) as the most important issue facing the country. Immigration (14%) and climate change (11%) follow and are the only other issues to land in double-digits, followed by national security (8%), racial injustice (5%) and education (3%). Biden\u2019s approval rating is under 50%, a perilous political position and similar to previous presidents like Donald Trump and Barack Obama, who suffered midterm election losses and lost majorities on Capitol Hill.",

            "article_content": "One year out from the 2022 midterm elections, 58% of Americans say President Joe Biden hasn\u2019t paid enough attention to the nation\u2019s most important problems, as a majority disapproves of the way he\u2019s handling his job as President, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. More than a third of Americans call the economy the most pressing problem facing the country (36%). Among the group that sees it that way, 72% say Biden hasn\u2019t been attentive to the right issues. That dynamic is reversed among the smaller 20% who consider the coronavirus pandemic the nation\u2019s top problem: 79% in that subset say Biden has had the right priorities, while 21% not. All told, 48% of adults approve of the way Biden is handling the job while 52% disapprove. Intensity within those ratings breaks sharply against the President. The share saying they strongly approve of Biden\u2019s performance has dropped to just 15%, down from 34% in April. Although CNN does not ask strength of approval in every poll, that number never dipped below 20% during the presidencies of either Barack Obama or Donald Trump. In the new poll, 36% say they strongly disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of the presidency, and that figure is about the same as it was when CNN last asked strength of approval in April, suggesting the drop in approval over the last few months has been driven more by disappointment among his original supporters than an expansion of the group that started off strongly opposed to his presidency. The poll was completed November 1 through 4, before the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The nearly 6 in 10 who say Biden hasn\u2019t had the right priorities is similar to the share who felt that way about Trump in September 2017 (59%) and who said the same about Obama in January 2010 (55%). Both presidents\u2019 parties suffered significant losses in Congress in the midterm elections held during the second year of their time in office. Registered voters do give Biden\u2019s party a narrow edge in a generic congressional matchup, though, with 49% saying they would back the Democrat in their district in next year\u2019s midterms and 44% the Republican. That\u2019s about the same as the Democratic advantage in CNN polling in November 2009 (49% Democrats to 43% Republicans). Ongoing congressional redistricting could alter how those preferences translate into actual congressional seats, but recent elections suggest Democrats typically win a smaller share of seats than they do overall votes. The results of off-year gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia suggest that Republicans are currently more enthusiastic about voting than Democrats, which could also work against Democrats\u2019 chances. About half (52% of registered voters) say their 2022 vote will not be about Biden, but those who do feel they are using their vote to say something about the President are more negative (26% sending a message to oppose Biden) than positive (19% sending a message to support him). About two-thirds of Americans say they are confident that next year\u2019s congressional elections will be conducted fairly (65%), but that only includes 31% who are very confident. The effects of repeated lies about the 2020 election\u2019s validity are clear: Republicans express significantly less confidence than Democrats in the fairness of the coming contests. Overall, just 40% of Republicans say they are confident the elections will be carried out fairly, compared with 84% of Democrats. Among independents, 66% are confident that the elections will be fair. And as the election year approaches, the nation\u2019s issue landscape appears to be shifting. With the latest wave of Covid-19 infections subsiding and prices on the rise, the economy (36%) outranks the coronavirus pandemic (20%) as the most important issue facing the country. Immigration (14%) and climate change (11%) follow and are the only other issues to land in double-digits, followed by national security (8%), racial injustice (5%) and education (3%). The nation\u2019s top concerns \u2013 like its views on many things \u2013 are sharply divided by party. Among Republicans, roughly half (51%) choose the economy as their top concern, with immigration (23%) and national security (13%) far behind. Just 4% of Republicans call coronavirus the nation\u2019s most important problem. Independents likewise rate the economy tops (38%), followed by coronavirus (18%), immigration (13%) and climate (11%). Among Democrats, though, 34% name coronavirus as the top problem, followed by the economy at 20%, about even with the climate at 18%. Another 8% say immigration is their top issue. Just 3% of Democrats cite national security as their top issue, with Republicans similarly unlikely to be focused on climate change, racial injustice or education. The connection between perception of the top issue and views on whether Biden has had the right priorities is strong, and even among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, the share saying Biden has had the wrong priorities climbs to 42% among those who call the economy the top problem, compared with 17% among those who consider the coronavirus the top problem. And although Biden\u2019s approval ratings are sharply polarized by party, the new poll finds Biden\u2019s disapproval rating creeping upward among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. In the new poll, 21% say they disapprove of the way Biden is handling the presidency. That figure was 17% last month. Biden\u2019s weakness within that subset seems to come among younger people. While nearly all adults age 65 or older who are Democrats or Democratic-leaners approve of Biden\u2019s performance (95% approve), among those under age 30, approval dips to 61%, with just 9% saying they strongly approve of Biden\u2019s performance as president. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS November 1 through 4 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults surveyed online after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points, among the 859 registered voters surveyed, it is plus or minus 4.3 points. It is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon\u2019s aggressive campaign to undermine American democracy didn\u2019t stop on January 6. Bannon, a bellicose right-wing nationalist who served as White House chief strategist under President Donald Trump in 2017, is fighting a subpoena from the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The Justice Department is contemplating whether to act on the House\u2019s vote to hold Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress. At the same time, Bannon continues to host a popular podcast that is one of the country\u2019s most important promoters of the very stolen-election lies that incited the January 6 mob. DOJ officials unfazed by calls to expedite Bannon contempt decision The podcast, called \u201cWar Room,\u201d is a six-days-a-week alternate reality that is kind of like Trump\u2019s banned Twitter account revived in audio form. In the fantasyland of Bannon and friends, Trump won the 2020 election \u201cin a landslide\u201d (he lost), Trump\u2019s victory (which didn\u2019t occur) was ripped from his hands by a sprawling list of cheaters (pure fiction), and President Joe Biden\u2019s win can still be decertified (nope). As Bannon proudly noted on one October episode, \u201cWar Room\u201d gives its listeners election-related \u201cinformation\u201d that even Fox News avoids. On episode after episode, Bannon\u2019s podcast goes into elaborate, incorrect detail about how the election was supposedly stolen. One of his regular guests is Mike Lindell, the pillow businessman who makes conspiratorial election claims so ludicrous that Fox has refused to air ads that have invoked them. Lindell \u2013 whose pillow company has been a repeat advertiser on \u201cWar Room\u201d \u2013 appeared three times last week alone. Bannon has also provided a friendly platform for the debunked election claims of people like former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Trump White House official Peter Navarro, wildly inaccurate so-called \u201cdata analyst\u201d Seth Keshel, and an assortment of swing-state Republican candidates who are running on election lies. A Bannon spokesperson acknowledged having received CNN\u2019s request for comment this week but did not provide any additional response. The podcast\u2019s relentless barrage of election deception would be damaging enough to American democracy if it were just talk. Bannon spoke approvingly in October about how his efforts have reduced Americans\u2019 faith in \u201cthe legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s regime.\u201d But Bannon has also urged \u201cWar Room\u201d listeners to take long-term action. He has made frequent pleas for supporters to reshape the Republican party by signing up to serve as \u201cprecinct committeemen.\u201d Those are low-level local positions. As Bannon has emphasized, though, they matter. People in precinct posts can be influential in choosing representatives to serve on local elections boards and to fill key offices within each state\u2019s party apparatus. They also frequently serve as local elections workers. Merrick Garland is caught in a pickle with Steve Bannon \u201cIt is hard to overstate how dangerous Bannon\u2019s words and actions are,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science and co-director of the Fair Elections and Free Speech Center at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cHe\u2019s creating an army of duped people who will go into positions helping to run elections with the false understanding that the 2020 election was stolen. Who knows what such people are capable of doing when in charge of running polling places or counting votes.\u201d There is no hard data on the impact of Bannon\u2019s call to activism. But ProPublica reported in September that counties around the country had seen an unusual surge in people looking to sign up for Republican precinct positions after Bannon began advocating the idea early this year. \u201cWar Room\u201d has thrived on Apple\u2019s podcast app even after it was banned from Spotify, YouTube and Twitter following various election lies and Bannon\u2019s casual call last November for the beheading of Dr. Anthony Fauci. \u201cWar Room\u201d has consistently been in the top 100 on US podcast charts; while precise listenership figures aren\u2019t available, Bannon claimed in late October that the podcast had been downloaded a total of 100 million times since it was launched in late 2019 with a focus on Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor and Southern Poverty Law Center senior fellow who studies the podcasts and other online communications of right-wing extremists, said Bannon is \u201creally good at creating community around his podcasts,\u201d turning the show into something more than a passive listening experience. She noted that there are tens of thousands of members in \u201cWar Room\u201d fan groups on Telegram, an app popular for its group chats. \u201cThe fans can then extend the beliefs of the show, sometimes in harmful ways,\u201d Squire said. \u201cWar Room\u201d has come under scrutiny for Bannon\u2019s comments in December and early January, when he pushed election lies, spoke vaguely of his conversations with Trump advisers also looking to overturn the election, urged supporters to get angry and come to Washington on January 6, and predicted on January 5 that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d But Bannon never stopped touting the election lies even after the insurrection. Though \u201cWar Room\u201d covers other subjects as well \u2013 recent segments have addressed the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration and the Virginia election \u2013 Bannon is fixated on what he calls the \u201cThree November Movement\u201d about the 2020 election. Here are just 10 of the election lies that have been told on the podcast since mid-July.",

            "article_content": "In the wake of jarring election results in several states on Tuesday, the one thing Democrats appeared to agree on was that they needed action in Congress. Democrats needed wins. Democrats, in at least some form, needed to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping agenda. And House Democratic leaders are on the cusp of exactly that in a matter of hours. But for real this time. At least that\u2019s what is scheduled. And that\u2019s what senior Democratic aides are confident can get done. And that\u2019s what the White House spent Thursday, from Biden on down, urgently trying set the conditions to accomplish. In other words: After weeks of blown deadlines, intra-party warfare and intensive negotiations to unlock the most complex policy divides, for Biden and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, now is the moment to close the deal. The bottom line is that Democratic leaders, according to multiple sources, have worked down to one primary outstanding issue, with a methodical hour-by-hour approach that was designed equal parts to find solutions to the problems and simply wear down the members that had them. There was clear confidence heading into the day that they would have the long sought after, never quite secured votes to actually get things across the finish line. Projecting confidence and having 218 votes in the can are two different things, however. The next few hours will demonstrate if the latter is, in fact, a reality. By the time Biden departs Washington for his scheduled weekend in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the largest infrastructure legislation in decades \u2013 the thing prior administrations were convinced they could pull off but could never get close to the finish line \u2013 could be headed to his desk to sign into law. The bill is bipartisan, with 19 Republican votes in the Senate (including, as a reminder, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell). The White House will almost certainly set a high profile (and bipartisan) signing ceremony early next week. It represents the very action \u2013 and results \u2013 Democrats said they were in desperate need of in the 72 hours after losing the Virginia governor\u2019s race. There\u2019s a long way to go on Biden\u2019s other cornerstone package. There\u2019s no other way around that. But if the House passes the infrastructure proposal on Friday, that\u2019s headed to Biden\u2019s desk. And that\u2019s a big deal. Pelosi can afford to lose three votes. That\u2019s it \u2013 and basically no margin for error. The California Democrat has made clear, at least up to this point, that she\u2019s not bringing anything to the floor until she has 218 votes in her pocket. That is a serious lift given the number of issues that were outstanding just 24 hours ago, but the process throughout the day on Thursday was unmistakably in the direction of progress, as issue by issue, group by group, lawmaker by lawmaker, Pelosi closed chipped away at the lawmakers still on the fence, aides said. There has been steady, though still cautious, questioning from House Democrats about Biden\u2019s personal strategy over the course of the last several weeks. Leaders have wanted a more forceful push at times. Members have wanted him to make clear asks \u2013 or in some cases, flat out demands. \u201cCall for the damn vote. Tell people to get in line. Be explicit,\u201d was how several Democrats in the caucus wanted Biden to approach the moment, according to one House Democrat. But that simply hasn\u2019t happened, according to more than a dozen Democratic members who have spoken with him or talked to colleagues who have. Biden was once again on the phone with House Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, but he was not demanding a vote that day, a source familiar with his approach made clear. The scheduling \u2013 and the strategy behind it \u2013 was up to Pelosi, something Biden has been clear about throughout this whole process. But he did make clear to the lawmakers he spoke to, including moderate Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, that he wanted them to be there in the end \u2013 and that whenever the vote came, it would mark a critical moment for his presidency, his agenda and for Democrats on Capitol Hill. That approach may not assuage some of the simmering criticism on Capitol Hill. But if Democrats pass both bills on Friday, it may not matter \u2026 at least for the moment. Nothing in the House economic and climate package matters unless West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin signs off. Period. That\u2019s not overstating his power and that\u2019s not underplaying the importance of the House vote. At this stage in the game, the primary reason for the House to move forward on the vote is two-fold: to release the infrastructure bill and to release the weeks upon weeks of building pressure. Beyond that, the Senate will ultimately dictate what stays and what goes. Specifically, Manchin will dictate. The reality at this moment is the House bill will serve as a base text and a consideration in the negotiations. It tracks with Biden\u2019s $1.75 trillion framework, the bulk of which Manchin has signed off on. The prescription drug agreement will likely stay. The inclusion of paid family leave likely will not. The state and local tax deduction agreement simply won\u2019t fly in the Senate, which has its own proposal. The immigration piece may not survive the parliamentarian. The Senate is still targeting the week of November 15 to take up the legislation. Between now and then, there will be extensive negotiations between Manchin and White House officials. Pelosi\u2019s staff will obviously be deeply involved and have a say in how things progress. But despite the long-held position that the House wouldn\u2019t pass anything that would be changed in the Senate, that is simply no longer operative. There will be changes in the Senate \u2013 and Manchin will likely be the driver of the vast majority of them. The outstanding House issues: State and local tax deductions Democratic leaders secured a final agreement \u2013 and sign off \u2013 from the key holdouts looking to ease the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction. The agreement would raise the cap to $80,000 from 2021-2030 (an earlier draft raised it to $72,000 from 2021-2031). Many Democrats are deeply opposed on a policy basis to the inclusion of this provision, which skews heavily toward wealthier individuals. But see the regular reminder above \u2013 without it, Pelosi simply wouldn\u2019t have the votes. This also is a singularly important issue for a number of front-line Democrats. At least three of those Democrats \u2013 those who had the hardest line \u2013 officially signed off shortly before midnight. Here is the most critical line in the joint statement from Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York and New Jersey Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill: \u201cWe\u2019re confident that with this agreement, we can move forward on this crucially important package and we will continue working to ensure that this tax cut gets signed into law to deliver this relief to our constituents as soon as possible.\u201d Immigration This is another issue that for a myriad of reasons was one of the thorniest to reconcile. A combination of Senate rules and wary moderates clashed with Democrats who threatened to oppose the bill without a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Hours of talks and meetings led those Democrats to appear to agree last night to the language in the draft legislation from earlier this week, with a commitment from Pelosi to work through new options and avenues in the weeks ahead, separate and apart from the economic and climate package. Here was the tweet from Rep. Chuy Garcia, one of the most vocal House members on the issue, Thursday night: \u201cMet with Speaker Pelosi tonight. All options remain on the table, but we are not drafting new language for BBB. Speaker Pelosi shares our concerns for the immigrant community, recognizes their contributions and is committed to keeping immigration in play.\u201d A CBO analysis This is the biggest open question heading into Friday. A handful of moderate Democrats made clear they would not support the legislation without a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the package\u2019s cost and how much revenue it would raise. There will be no CBO analysis on Friday. Period. End of story. White House officials and Democratic leadership scrambled throughout the day on Thursday to produce estimates and data that could work in its place. A Joint Committee on Taxation analysis \u2013 which officials noted lined up closely with the White House estimates from the day before \u2013 was touted and circulated. Then late Thursday evening the White House circulated to all House Democrats a seven-page budget estimate, designed to tack as closely to what a CBO analysis would resemble, based on the Joint Tax Committee analysis and the administration\u2019s internal cost projections. Pelosi cited it in a letter to colleagues. The effort, though incomplete, marked what White House officials viewed as the best and most complete accounting they could pull together of the bill as it stood. Democratic sources say the negotiations over immigration provisions have been resolved \u2014 and the last remaining hurdle to passing a bill is the demand made by five moderates that they get a CBO analysis before a vote. The issue has not been resolved and talks were ongoing in Pelosi\u2019s office Friday morning. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer left Pelosi\u2019s office saying on Friday \u201cwe\u2019re working on it\u201d and it was unclear whether there actually will be a vote and if leadership can get the remaining holdouts on board. Hoyer was confident though, that there would not be a CBO analysis on Friday, which remains a key holdout for some moderates. \u201cIt could not be done today,\u201d he said. Biden, meanwhile, said he would be calling more House Democrats on Friday. During remarks at the White House about the October jobs report, he ramped up the pressure on his Capitol Hill allies, calling on the House to pass both bills \u201cright now.\u201d \u201cPassing these bills will say clearly to the American people, \u2018We hear your voices. We\u2019re going to invest in your hopes, help you secure a brighter future for yourself and your family and make sure America wins the future in the process.\u2019 I\u2019m asking every House member, member of the House of Representatives to vote yes on both these bills right now. Send the infrastructure bill to my desk, send the Build Back Better bill to the Senate,\u201d he said. The estimate concluded the package would be made up of $2 trillion (plus $100 billion for immigration) in gross investment and tax cuts and about $2.15 trillion in gross offsets. Pelosi, in her letter, specifically noted the estimate showed \u201cthat the legislation reduces the deficit by more than $36 billion over the first 10 years and at least $2 trillion over the second ten years.\u201d It should be noted here that a significant chunk of the programs in the proposal would expire before the second decade. The effort was viewed as the \u201cbest full accounting of the legislation\u201d from an analysis perspective up to this point, one of the people said, even though negotiations on several elements continue. Those pieces, however, are not expected to significantly change the topline numbers, leaving the White House to view this as the best effort to address the requests for a CBO analysis. The cost estimate, which was circulated to all House Democrats, is based off of the score of the tax measures released by the Joint Committee on Taxation and White House internal cost estimates of the programs included in the economic and climate package. Throughout the day, White House officials have pushed to find a way around the need for a final Congressional Budget Office analysis to advance the bill \u2013 something would take at least a week to finalize and release. The estimate shows net outlays and revenues under the legislation, finding that net outlays would equal under $1.7 trillion and net revenues just over that.  This translates into about $2 trillion (plus $100 billion for immigration) in gross investment and tax cuts and about $2.15 trillion in gross offsets.",

            "article_content": "Brandon Steele, a second-term Republican in West Virginia\u2019s House, worked hard this year to get his colleagues to pass his \u201cSecond Amendment Preservation Act.\u201d It seeks to bar state or local police from enforcing new federal gun restrictions the Biden administration might adopt. Mind you, Steele himself concedes he doesn\u2019t see significant new federal restrictions getting passed anytime soon. \u201cThe Biden administration has not gotten anywhere in terms of pushing their firearms regulatory agenda; they haven\u2019t even got their ATF guy in there,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere are a lot of forces in play to keep that from happening.\u201d With a 50-50 US Senate, a paper-thin margin in the House, and Biden focused on other priorities, advocates on both sides acknowledge that sweeping measures to address gun violence appear unlikely. But that hasn\u2019t stopped gun-rights groups and politicians across the country from ginning up fears that Biden wants to, as Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz put it, \u201cerase the Second Amendment,\u201d and come to people\u2019s homes and take away their guns. GOP lawmakers in at least 17 states have introduced bills this year taking aim at possible federal gun restrictions, a CNN review has found. Nine of those states signed new laws that take a page from the immigration sanctuary movement (which limited state and local police from helping with federal immigration enforcement), by barring local and state police agencies from helping enforce any new federal gun laws.  And two states, Missouri and Arizona, enacted measures that conflict with existing federal gun laws in ways that prosecutors tell CNN already are making it harder, or risk making it harder, to investigate gun crimes. The inflammatory rhetoric surrounding these new laws, critics says, is similar and even connected to claims of 2020 election fraud and pushback against Covid-19 vaccine or mask mandates in that they rely on a denial of reality. \u201cThey are part of an ideological system, [and believe] that the other side \u2013 in this case, the Democrats \u2013 are devious and intent on taking political rights away and imposing a socialistic tyranny,\u201d said Alexandra Filindra, a political science professor at University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies gun politics, disinformation and social media. \u201cInformation that conflicts with this narrative is dismissed,\u201d she said. \u201cSaying Biden is a Democrat and coming for your guns is a great way to motivate anger and get people to vote in the midterm, especially.\u201d While most of the new gun laws are aimed at some perceived future threat to gun ownership, the ones in Missouri and Arizona, at a minimum, have the potential to undermine present-day law enforcement investigations. Soon after Missouri adopted its \u201cSecond Amendment Preservation Act\u201d in June, at least a dozen federally deputized state and local law enforcement officers withdrew from joint task forces where they\u2019d worked with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate violent gun crimes and illegal gun trafficking, according to Frederic Winston, the head of ATF\u2019s Kansas City field office. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz confirmed it \u201chas suspended participation\u201d in ATF\u2019s joint task force. As a result, Winston said, the patrol stopped submitting firearms-trace requests to ATF, and stopped assisting in referrals to the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, for investigations of people who get a firearm from a licensed dealer despite being prohibited from doing so. Missouri\u2019s act seeks to nullify any federal gun laws that tax guns, ammunition or accessories; that register or track firearms or firearms ownership; or that would confiscate or forbid the ownership, use, or transfer of guns by \u201claw-abiding citizens.\u201d It says no state or local officers or officials \u201ccan have authority to enforce or attempt to enforce\u201d such laws. State lawmakers also adopted an approach used in Texas\u2019 controversial abortion legislation by letting residents sue, for up to $50,000, local or state police who enforce federal gun laws that fall afoul of the act. Frederic Winston, the head of the ATF\u2019s Kansas City field office, said in a court declaration that the act \u201cdeprives law enforcement of information needed to successfully investigate crimes, including violent crimes.\u201d The city of St. Louis filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law shortly after it was passed. The Department of Justice supported that effort, arguing that under the US \u201cConstitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, the State of Missouri has no power to nullify federal laws.\u201d Like Missouri\u2019s law, Arizona\u2019s \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary\u201d act, signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey in May, applies to current federal firearms laws. It orders state and local police agencies not to enforce or cooperate with any federal measures that are \u201cinconsistent with any law of this state regarding the regulation of firearms.\u201d That bar on enforcement is modeled on California\u2019s 2017 immigration sanctuary law, state Rep. Leo Biasiucci, its author, told The Washington Monthly. Biasiucci didn\u2019t respond to repeated interview requests from CNN. States can\u2019t simply claim to nullify federal firearms laws that go farther than state laws, said Jonathan Lowy, chief legal counsel of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If they think a law is unconstitutional, they can challenge it in court, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way you do it:  You challenge laws. You don\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to follow federal law.\u2019\u201d Unlike in Missouri, federal and state law enforcement officials in Arizona say they haven\u2019t seen changes in joint task forces or other collaborations to investigate illegal gun trafficking or violent gun crimes. Arizona\u2019s gun law did swiftly draw a backlash from the Tucson City Council, which in June adopted a resolution to continue enforcing federal gun laws. Tucson, where several churches were early leaders in the 1980s immigration sanctuary movement, and where the 2011 shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 18 other people in a grocery-store parking lot remains etched into memory, has often clashed with the state\u2019s GOP-dominated leadership. \u201cWe fully intend to enforce federal gun laws in Arizona,\u201d said Tucson City Council Member Steve Kozachik. \u201cI believe their nullification amendment is highly unconstitutional, and it\u2019s not anywhere close to being in the best interests of our constituents to say we\u2019re going to opt out of federal gun laws.\u201d Legal experts across the spectrum say that while provisions in Missouri and Arizona\u2019s laws appear to go too far, other recent acts, such as West Virginia\u2019s \u201cSecond Amendment Preservation and Anti-Federal Commandeering Act,\u201d are likely to survive legal challenges. Those measures rely on what\u2019s known as the \u201canti-commandeering\u201d doctrine, which holds that the federal government can\u2019t make state or local authorities enforce federal regulations on its behalf. That doctrine has repeatedly been upheld in recent cases involving immigration-sanctuary laws adopted by dozens of cities, from Seattle and San Francisco to Jackson, Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly constitutional for state officials to opt not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement or federal gun enforcement,\u201d said Eric Ruben, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy think tank. Some state GOP lawmakers who, under President Donald Trump, passed laws to preempt cities from declaring themselves immigration sanctuaries, initially shied at embracing a sanctuary approach for guns. \u201cI actually had some members balk at the concept of using the word sanctuary,\u201d said state Rep. Scotty Campbell, of Mountain City, Tennessee, about his gun-protection bill. \u201cI argued it was known and understood as a Second Amendment Sanctuary. They didn\u2019t want to use the word sanctuary.\u201d The new laws seeking to stave off gun restrictions echo gun-advocacy efforts under President Barack Obama that led to seven states adopting similar measures between 2010 and 2016. Even modest efforts to address gun safety often are painted by opponents as apocalyptic threats. Groups such as Gun Owners of America characterized Biden\u2019s recent call to restrict stabilizing gun braces, for example, as \u201cdisarming the American people.\u201d Last fall, the Trump campaign ran ads in key battleground states that clipped comments Biden made during a CNN interview, taking them out of context to falsely make it sound as though he planned to take away voters\u2019 guns. Cruz shared a similar false video on social media on the eve of Biden\u2019s first joint address to Congress, and claimed that Biden wants to \u201cerase the Second Amendment.\u201d In September, Fox News explicitly tied guns and Covid-19 together with a piece titled: \u201cSecond Amendment groups on Biden mandate: If he can force a needle in your arm, can he take your gun?\u201d In interviews with CNN, lawmakers in several states cited such fears as justification for their gun-rights bills. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how far they\u2019d go to restrict private gun ownership,\u201d said Arkansas state Rep. Brandt Smith, for example. \u201cConfiscation of guns? Restrictions of the purchase of firearms? We wanted to be proactive and prevent that.\u201d Americans own more guns than ever, and more guns per capita than any other country in the world. Researchers for the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey estimated that Americans, with 4.3% of the world\u2019s population, owned 393 million guns, or 46% of all guns owned by private citizens worldwide, in 2018, the most recent year the survey was conducted. And Americans have bought an estimated 36.9 million more firearms in the past two years, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in South Carolina. Since the US has no national gun registry, gun ownership and sales are estimated by surveys, firearms industry publications, and background checks. These GOP-led efforts to guard against future gun restrictions come at a time when some gun-control measures enjoy broad support. More than 80 percent of people in the US (including 70 percent of Republicans) said they support expanded background checks for guns, in an April 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center. The survey said about half of Americans see gun violence as a major problem in the US \u2013 understandable, given that, according to the Gun Violence Archive, 37,820 people have been shot to death in the US this year through Nov. 4, including 20,328 suicides. But it\u2019s the fear of losing guns that animates the call to bar such measures. State Sen. Joey Hensley, who cosponsored a Second Amendment sanctuary bill in Tennessee, said his constituents \u201cwere very concerned about the federal government making more restrictions\u201d on guns. \u201cI\u2019m personally not afraid so much of the federal government. I think we have plenty of protections under the Second Amendment and I think the Supreme Court would protect our rights,\u201d said Hensley. \u201cBut we wanted to get some legislation on the books, so people knew where we stood.\u201d Filindra, the political scientist, said that the gun-rights narrative has been shifting, from a focus on using guns for self or home protection, to \u201cthe idea that citizens have a right to arms as a check on government, and that without that, the franchise is insecure \u2026 if the voting box is insufficient to guarantee our rights, we have the ammo box.\u201d In this narrative, she said, \u201cthreats to gun rights are existential threats to democracy.\u201d Whether or not Congress actually can pass a substantial gun-control measure is beside the point, said Sarah Byner, research director for Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics and its effect on public policies and elections. \u201cThat\u2019s something about the political climate we\u2019re in. Even if it\u2019s out of the realm of anything being discussed in the Congress, people aren\u2019t following Congress; people aren\u2019t police experts. They respond to the messages and that\u2019s what these groups are putting out into the world, facts be damned,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "With his victory in the Virginia gubernatorial race, Glenn Youngkin wrote a new Republican playbook for keeping Donald Trump\u2019s base engaged without alienating the voters who were repelled by the former President in recent elections. That\u2019s despite running against a rival, Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, whose closing message \u2013 in speeches, debates and television advertisements \u2013 was devoted almost entirely to convincing voters that Youngkin was no different than Trump. How Glenn Youngkin may have forged an education roadmap for Republicans Republicans say Youngkin\u2019s win offers the party lessons it can apply across the 2022 midterm election landscape. Youngkin walked a tightrope on the right-wing grievances being fueled by conservative media. He said he favors auditing voting machines regularly, without embracing Trump\u2019s lies about widespread voter fraud. He said he would ban critical race theory, but characterized his position as favoring teaching \u201cthe good and the bad\u201d of history without pitting children against each other. Mostly, though, he focused on a broader education message \u2013 as well as kitchen-table economic issues such as eliminating the grocery tax and suspending the most recent increase in Virginia\u2019s gas tax \u2013 that appealed to voters outside of Trump\u2019s base. \u201cYoungkin winning shows that \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 isn\u2019t the winning formula for purple states,\u201d a Georgia Republican operative said. It was a performance that came with the electoral upside that Trump had brought the GOP with its base \u2013 without the cost of losing moderates and independents. Youngkin delivered a dominant, Trump-like performance among White voters in rural Virginia. But he also won back a share of the suburbanites who had abandoned Trump and handed Democrats control of the House in 2018 and the presidency in 2020. \u201cThe biggest thing Youngkin was able to do was bridge the gap between the increasingly populist base and some of the more mild-mannered traditional Republicans voters who blanched at Trump\u2019s style,\u201d said veteran Republican strategist Liam Donovan. Exit polls from 2017 and 2021 show the key groups that helped Youngkin turn Virginia red Trump endorsed Youngkin and issued a series of statements praising him. He also held an invite-only tele-rally on the eve of the election that was organized without Youngkin\u2019s involvement. But he did not visit the state, and after his ban from major social media platforms, did not have a significant role in the race. \u201cGlenn benefited from Trump\u2019s relatively low profile, both in the sense that his absence undermined McAuliffe\u2019s preferred argument, and because his nominal support was still a key signifier for motivating MAGA-minded voters who might otherwise be wary of an establishment-friendly candidate,\u201d Donovan said. Youngkin led a ticket that swept Republicans into power in a state where President Joe Biden had won by 10 points just one year earlier. \u201cIn Virginia at least, without Trump on the ballot, Republicans are winning back Romney-Clinton voters faster than Democrats are winning back Obama-Trump voters or finding new voters. If that trend holds, there is no math that gives Democrats the House, Senate, or White House,\u201d wrote Dan Pfeiffer, a long-time top aide to former President Barack Obama. At the core of Youngkin\u2019s win, many Republicans said, was his message on education. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday that as many as 70 House seats would be competitive next year. He said Republicans will unveil a \u201cparental bill of rights\u201d as the GOP seeks to make education and cultural issues a centerpiece of the party\u2019s midterm strategy. \u201cYoungkin\u2019s success reveals that Republicans can and must become the party of parents. There is real energy from parents that we need to understand,\u201d Rep. Jim Banks, the Indiana Republican who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, wrote in a three-page memo that outlined a series of policies GOP candidates could campaign on in 2022. Democrats struggle to find message on culture wars amid GOP success in Virginia \u201cDemocrats are attacking our schools in new ways, and conservatives must adjust,\u201d Banks wrote. \u201cGlenn Youngkin understood this. He knew parents weren\u2019t just concerned about traditional education issues, but rather viewed education as an extension of the culture war.\u201d Youngkin tapped into the grievances of parents with a mixture of education-focused messages: He pledged to end coronavirus-related protocols and keep schools open full-time. He said he would deliver pay raises for teachers and more funding for special education. He committed to a rapid expansion of charter school options. He promised parental involvement in schools\u2019 curriculum, and said he would ban the teaching of critical race theory, which isn\u2019t part of Virginia\u2019s education standards but has nonetheless become a popular target among Republicans. And then, with a gaffe in their second and final debate, McAuliffe helped Youngkin unite the constituencies for those disparate messages. \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\u201d McAuliffe said in that debate. CNN\u2019s exit polls showed that 52% of Virginia voters said parents should have \u201ca lot\u201d of say in what is taught in schools \u2013 and Youngkin got the votes of 77% of that group, while McAuliffe won by huge margins among those who said \u201csome\u201d or \u201cnot much.\u201d At Youngkin\u2019s rally in Richmond the day before the election, Anne Taydus, a stay-at-home mother from Chesterfield County who said she got involved in local school board meetings this year, wore a shirt that said: \u201cChildren first, common sense second, politics and fear dead last.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Virginia, it\u2019s not just about Chesterfield County, it\u2019s everybody, people who have had their hope and their faith in America squashed by the Democrats and the Democratic Party,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mess with the kids,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t mess with the children and that\u2019s a national feeling.\u201d Youngkin had several advantages that would be difficult for other candidates to replicate \u2013 including personal wealth that allowed him to define himself in television ads before McAuliffe could effectively link him to Trump. Youngkin also benefitted from Virginia Republicans choosing their gubernatorial nominee at a convention, rather than holding a drawn-out primary in which fealty to Trump would have likely become the defining issue. A key question facing Republicans next year is whether candidates who can win general elections will survive primary contests against more strident, Trump-aligned figures, and whether the party\u2019s base will rally around them if they do. Otherwise, the party could face losses reminiscent of blown races by hard-line conservatives in 2010 and 2012. Trump, for his part, has made clear that he intends to insert himself into races and claim credit for GOP victories. \u201cI would like to thank my BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe MAGA movement is bigger and stronger than ever before.\u201d Youngkin also brought his own strengths to the table. The former Rice basketball player and chief executive of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group was an unproven commodity as a first-time candidate \u2013 and carried the risk of facing attacks similar to those Mitt Romney faced as a presidential candidate in 2012. \u201cGlenn proved to be a really solid, natural retail pol, which as a first time candidate was not always assured. You can\u2019t teach that,\u201d Donovan said. Biden\u2019s declining favorability, said one GOP strategist involved in 2022 races who was on hand for Youngkin\u2019s victory party in Chantilly on Tuesday night, gave Youngkin an opening with voters beginning to doubt Democratic policies. But the strategist said Youngkin also tapped into a series of issues \u2013 crime, the economy and education \u2013 that will work for Republicans in other states, too. Youngkin drew contrasts with McAuliffe and tapped into economic issues that have emerged during Biden\u2019s presidency without reminding voters of Trump. Education was a particularly salient issue in Virginia for Youngkin, the strategist said; other issues, such as immigration, might play that role in other states. \u201cYoungkin had a message, was very disciplined and handled Trump with respect. Virginia punished Biden too,\u201d said Scott Reed, the former chief political strategist for the US Chamber of Commerce.

            "article_content": "The Justice Department is suing Texas over new voting restrictions that the federal government says will disenfranchise eligible voters and violate federal voting rights law. RELATED: The new Texas voting law includes these 7 major changes The lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in San Antonio challenges the law known as SB1 passed earlier this year to overhaul election procedures in the state. The law, which bans 24-hour and drive-thru voting, imposes new hurdles on mail-in ballots and empowers partisan poll watchers, was signed by Texas\u2019 Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in September. READ: Justice Department's lawsuit against Texas voting law The Justice Department lawsuit said the law illegally restricts voters\u2019 rights by requiring rejection of mail ballots \u201cfor immaterial errors and omissions.\u201d The law also harms the rights of voters with limited English proficiency, military members deployed away from home and voters overseas, the Justice Department alleged. \u201cBefore SB 1, the State of Texas already imposed some of the strictest limitations in the nation on the right of certain citizens to voting assistance. SB 1 further, and impermissibly, restricts the core right to meaningful assistance in the voting booth,\u201d the Justice Department said. Earlier this year, the DOJ sued Georgia over its new voting law, similarly arguing a violation of federal voting rights law. The Texas law passed following a contentious debate in which some Democrats left the state to try to prevent its approval. It was among a spate of similar laws in Republican-run states aimed in response to false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. \u201cIt does make it easier than ever before for anybody to go cast a ballot. It does also, however, make sure it is harder than ever for people to cheat at the ballot box,\u201d Abbott said when he signed the law. The lawsuit is the latest legal fight between the Biden Justice Department and Texas, which are battling in court over abortion rights, immigration enforcement and vaccine mandates. \u201cFinally, a Justice Department that fights for justice. Texas is torpedoing American democracy and our constitutional right to vote. We are encouraged to see the DOJ pushing back,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CNN about the Texas lawsuit. President Joe Biden said during a CNN town hall in late October that the US is experiencing \u201cthe greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States \u2013 for real \u2013 since the Civil War.\u201d But the President said that pushing his massive Build Back Better plan has prohibited him from putting a major focus on voting rights, while promising to focus on the issue once his agenda is passed. Biden also signaled he would be willing to fundamentally alter or completely get rid of the filibuster, which has effectively been used as a tool to block voting rights legislation on a federal level. He had previously supported preserving the rule. Senate Republicans blocked the John Lewis Voting Rights Act on Wednesday from advancing when the Senate took a procedural vote on whether to open debate on the legislation. The bill which would fight voter suppression and restore key parts of the landmark Voting Rights Act, originally passed in 1965, failed in 50 to 49 vote. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was the only Republican to vote along with Democrats. The law introduced new mandates requiring Texans who vote by mail to provide either their driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number twice: once on their absentee ballot application forms and once on the envelope in which they return their ballots. Those numbers will then be matched against voters\u2019 records to confirm they are who they say they are \u2013 a change from the current signature matching process. The new Texas voting law includes these 7 major changes Under the law, the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office is required to check monthly to make sure no one is on the state\u2019s voter rolls who said they were not a citizen when obtaining or renewing their driver\u2019s license or ID card. It also makes it a felony for a public official to send someone a mail-in ballot application the person did not request, or to pre-fill any part of any mail-in ballot application they are sending to someone.

            "article_content": "If Democrats are to avoid a far more devastating election night next year than they suffered on Tuesday, they must finally defeat the pandemic from which so much economic pain and voter angst flow. The victory of Republican Glenn Youngkin in the Virginia governor\u2019s race and a huge swing against New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy -- who won reelection, CNN projected Wednesday, in a closer-than-expected race \u2013 reflect a desperate political environment for Democrats. They have a heap of problems other than the pandemic. Youngkin\u2019s move on their strongholds in the suburbs could spell disaster in the midterm elections if repeated countrywide. Democrats have struggled to address many voters\u2019 concerns on education and immigration while failing to properly sell or even pass their generational social spending plan to electrify their base. And as Tuesday shows, turning every issue into an argument that Republicans are wallowing in the racism and extremism of former President Donald Trump won\u2019t resonate when voters are upset or angry and he is, at least for the next three years, out of office. Democrats look for lessons in Virginia and New Jersey as a blame game inside the party rages The most chronic stage of the Covid-19 nightmare seems to be ending, with new infections and deaths falling significantly. But President Joe Biden and other Democrats badly need a fundamental transformation of the political environment in the 12 months remaining before the midterms, and that looks unlikely if the pandemic \u2013 and its cascade of economic anxiety \u2013 is still here in some form. There is nothing more fundamental to basic life and voter sentiment than buying food and gasoline. However, if inflation is still rising, gasoline is still averaging $3.40 a gallon, the economy is still stuttering and Americans fear for their economic futures come next November, little that the Democrats do or say will break through. In those circumstances, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s prediction on Wednesday that the GOP could flip 60 House seats next year could actually happen. And in such circumstances, the Senate would almost certainly swing hard to Republicans as well. But if the country gets a grip on the pandemic, inflation is lower, the labor market is healthier and shop shelves are full, voters may be in a sunnier mood by November 2022. If the virus is circulating at low levels and there\u2019s no need for vaccine mandates and masking, Biden should be able to put in the past controversies that are instrumental in generating conservative fury \u2013 and in getting Trump\u2019s base to the polls. A Biden adviser told CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond after their poor showing in Virginia that while Democrats must show action and cannot just run against Trump all the time, there is hope within the President\u2019s circle that the treacherous political environment could ease next year. The pandemic is waning and there is a growing belief that congressional Democrats will soon pass both the President\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure bill and the social spending blueprint, the adviser said. Still, with polls showing that many Americans are not familiar with the latter plan\u2019s mix of funding for health care, education and climate change mitigation, the party needs to mount a major public relations campaign once the measures pass. Exit polls in Virginia showed that the economy and education were the top concerns of all voters in the state, ahead of the pandemic. But even if the worst national health crisis in 100 years is beginning to fade as the priority political issue, its threat is at the core of many of the other influences shaping America\u2019s always-changing political map. Biden said back in March that Americans elected him to fix problems, the most urgent of which was Covid-19. And toward the end of his 2020 campaign he vowed, \u201cI will end this,\u201d referring to the pandemic. Then, as now, the fortunes of his presidency and party depend on him living up to his word. Many of the current drags on the economy can be traced directly to the crisis. Some Americans haven\u2019t returned to work or were slow to do so because they couldn\u2019t get child care when schools were closed. The summer Delta variant spike slowed the momentum of the recovery after earlier infectious waves, and along with the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 another issue where Biden\u2019s comments didn\u2019t seem to match reality \u2013 helped drive the President\u2019s approval ratings down. Democrats got shellacked. Now what? A supply chain slowdown that has emptied some stores was caused by back ups and pandemic-inflicted truck driver shortages in the US. In Asia, manufacturing is still being hampered by Covid-19 closures. The consequent lack of supply at a time of rising demand has raised prices. Everyone will pay more to celebrate Thanksgiving this year, with turkeys costing 25% more than usual, CNN\u2019s Christine Romans reported. And in 2021, there\u2019s nothing more American than apple pie that costs 8% more than last year. High gasoline prices are being driven by multiple factors, including the reluctance of oil-producing nations to pump more crude to help the US out. But some loss of capacity in the industry during the pandemic is playing into the situation. Biden did make a show of addressing the supply chain crisis several weeks ago and secured 24/7 opening at the Port of Los Angeles to help get backed-up containers off the docks. But he admitted in a recent CNN town hall that he can\u2019t do a lot about gas prices, and his transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, recently said on CNN that the supply chain issues may linger into next year. Such comments hardly give the public the impression that the White House is focused relentlessly on this issue every day \u2013 even if such an effort could be as much a public relations exercise as a decisive intervention that could fix the problems. Youngkin\u2019s well-executed campaign in Virginia exploited the vacuum, stressing the economic concerns shared by many in the state and, since Democrats control Washington, put his opponent, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, on the defensive. The commonwealth\u2019s next Republican governor plans to abolish the grocery tax. And even his offensive on education \u2013 simmering with implicit messages on race and transgender rights to appeal to Trump voters \u2013 got more purchase than it might have because of broad frustration among parents at months of pandemic-fueled closures. Youngkin also came out against vaccine mandates for schools and state workers. And the political toll of pandemic leadership \u2013 of being the face of restrictions and closures \u2013 may well have hurt Murphy in New Jersey, where there was high turnout in areas that oppose those measures. After a grim flight back from Europe as the scale of Tuesday night\u2019s loss in Virginia unfolded, Biden tried yet again to create some optimism that the dark months of the pandemic were now mostly in the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve made incredible progress over these past nine months, but we have to keep going. The pandemic is not yet behind us, but we\u2019re getting there,\u201d Biden said as he celebrated regulatory authorization, at last, for vaccines for children ages 5-11 on Wednesday. When can kids under 5 get vaccinated against Covid-19? What parents should know \u201cAfter almost 18 months of anxious worrying every time that your child had a sniffle or started to cough, well, you can now protect them from this horrible virus,\u201d the President said at the White House. The administration is under pressure to swiftly and competently manage the rollout for kids\u2019 vaccines. While Thanksgiving and Hanukkah will come too early for the two-dose vaccine to banish memories of last year\u2019s dark holiday season, millions of American kids could be fully protected by Christmas. If history is any guide, however, a breakthrough in the public health offensive against the virus will spark a new eruption in the partisan showdown that has lengthened the pandemic. Conservative media will brim with misinformation about vaccines and government regulatory trials that say they are safe and effective for kids. Multiple polls have shown that millions of parents say they won\u2019t let their children get the shots, even though inoculations for other diseases are standard for school attendance from a young age. A backlash would mirror earlier hostility among conservatives over masking, vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic, all of which have contributed to successive waves of infection and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The US death toll passed 750,000 on Wednesday and many of those lost could still be alive had public health guidance been followed.   Controversy over child vaccines would also underscore that the President\u2019s biggest obstacle in his quest to end the pandemic \u2013 or at least to reduce it to an endemic threat rather than a constantly raging crisis \u2013 is posed by some Americans themselves. As Tuesday\u2019s results show, incumbent parties and leaders like Biden end up paying the price for the long and devastating economic and social half-life of Covid-19. And in some ways, Biden\u2019s fate may lie in the hands of the very voters most likely to oppose him next year \u2013 those who are most likely to ignore government public health advice. Voters may look to Republicans in the longer term if the fallout from the pandemic persists.",

            "article_content": "Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s projected win in the Virginia governor\u2019s race Tuesday erased any doubt: Democrats\u2019 slim congressional majorities are in grave danger in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe had hoped former President Donald Trump\u2019s continuing unpopularity would halt the pendulum swing against a new president and his party that nearly always takes place in Virginia and often continues in the following year\u2019s midterms. Instead, Youngkin drafted a playbook for Republicans to navigate around Trump \u2013 keeping the former President\u2019s base energized while also winning back a share of suburbanites who had fled the party during Trump\u2019s tenure. And while CNN projected Wednesday night that Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy prevailed in New Jersey, the race\u2019s neck-and-neck status through the night Tuesday was another shocker for Democrats who expected Murphy to coast to reelection. The close New Jersey race, which received much less national attention than the Virginia contest, might be an even more ominous indicator for Democrats that the political environment, at least for the moment, has shifted hard in Republicans\u2019 favor. And in cities across the country, Democrats dominated mayoral races, according to CNN projections \u2013 but offered mixed messages on the direction of the party, with progressives securing historic wins in Boston and Pittsburgh, while a moderate champion was crowned in New York City. Minneapolis rejected a measure to overhaul its police department in a closely watched vote that showed the backlash against a protest movement that followed the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in 2020. Here are eight takeaways from the 2021 elections: Until Tuesday, Democrats dominated in Virginia. The party had full control of the statehouse, and President Joe Biden had won there by 10 percentage points only a year ago. McAuliffe, who was governor from 2014 to 2018, tried to win his old job back by casting Youngkin, a milder-mannered former business executive, as Trump in a sweater vest. Instead, Youngkin pulled off a remarkable feat: He kept Trump\u2019s base, while also cutting deeply into Democrats\u2019 advantage with suburban voters who still dislike Trump. Youngkin won 17% of the voters who said they disapprove of Trump, exit polls showed, compared to McAuliffe winning just 5% of those who approve of the former President. Youngkin also proved more likable than Trump: 52% said they viewed him favorably, compared to Trump\u2019s 42% and McAuliffe\u2019s 45%. While McAuliffe tried to turn the race into a national referendum, Youngkin focused much more narrowly on local issues \u2013 pledging to repeal the grocery tax, suspend the gas tax and jump-start the state\u2019s economy. Perhaps most importantly, he tapped into the brewing culture war over education. He appealed to conservatives steeped in the right-wing media ecosystem by promising to ban critical race theory, which isn\u2019t taught in Virginia schools; to end coronavirus-related school shutdowns and mask mandates; and to launch an expansive charter school program. He also won over moderates by pledging an education budget with money for teacher raises \u2013 a core theme in his television ads \u2013 and special education. It turned into a coalition that could carry Youngkin to victory. Republicans across the country were watching Virginia for lessons that could apply to races for governor, the House and the Senate in next year\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 and some party operatives credited Youngkin with showing what could work. Youngkin\u2019s personal wealth, which can\u2019t be easily replicated, helped. He was able to define himself in television advertisements before McAuliffe could morph him into \u201cTrumpkin.\u201d But his message \u2013 focused on state-level steps he would take on crime, the economy and education \u2013 could work across the map, one GOP strategist said, particularly if Biden continues to face a weak economy and a stagnant Capitol Hill. In addition to defining himself early, Youngkin tapped into economic issues that have emerged during Biden\u2019s presidency, and did so without reminding voters of Trump. Education was a particularly salient issue in Virginia for Youngkin, the strategist said; other issues, such as immigration, might play that role in other states. Of course, the most important question for Republicans in 2022 may be whether candidates in Youngkin\u2019s mold, with the ability to build their own brands separate from Trump, can survive primary contests against fierce Trump allies who might be dragged down by their allegiance to the former president in general elections. A year after Trump\u2019s denial and mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic was the dominant story in American politics, the pandemic appears to be fading as a driving factor at the ballot box. In Virginia, just 14% of voters said the coronavirus pandemic was the most important issue facing the commonwealth, exit polls showed. That trailed the economy (33%), education (24%) and taxes (15%). And while McAuliffe won 83% of the votes of those who said coronavirus is the most important issue facing Virginia, he lost to Youngkin by double digits among those who identified every other issue as paramount. McAuliffe went all-in on linking Glenn Youngkin to Donald Trump and it failed. McAuliffe\u2019s central message throughout the close of the campaign was that the same voters who rejected Trump by 10 percentage points in 2020 should do the same to Youngkin. The effort was squarely aimed at boosting Democratic turnout and, while turnout on the left appears to have been significant, the results of the Virginia election have made clear to Democrats across the country that the Republican president \u2013 now that he is out-of-office \u2013 is not the bogeyman he once was. \u201cThere is no question that McAuliffe relied too much on Trump in absence of anything else. That was a mistake,\u201d a senior Democratic operative told CNN. \u201cUsing Trump is OK. Only using Trump in absence of anything else is not a good strategy.\u201d This failure has implications for Democrats going forward. Although Trump tried to inject himself into this race, the focus on negative messaging gave McAuliffe little space to push an affirmative message for why voters should back him. The loss now forces Democrats, ahead of 2022, to determine how to both rally their base and grow it in coming elections. The irony is that McAuliffe himself may have been second guessing his absolute focus on Trump. \u201cI\u2019d love to have him come in. But you know \u2026 this is not about Trump,\u201d McAuliffe told CNN before spending the final days making it all about the former President. Even though Murphy is now the first Democratic governor in more than four decades to win reelection in New Jersey, this is not how Garden State Democrats envisioned it going down. Despite his win, the narrow margin suggests Democrats face daunting odds in the 2022 midterm elections. In this race, Murphy led Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, a businessman and former state lawmaker, by double digits (or close to it) in most of the late polling. Yes, while Biden\u2019s approval rating in the state is underwater, Murphy\u2019s is not. His pandemic response, including mask and vaccine mandates, has been a political winner. But Ciattarelli led the incumbent on one crucial issue \u2013 the most crucial, according to a recent Monmouth poll that asked voters to rank their concerns: Taxes. And he hammered Murphy over a comment in which the governor downplayed the issue, saying, \u201cIf taxes are your issue, we\u2019re probably not your state.\u201d Ciattarelli tried to keep his distance from Trump, an unpopular figure in the state (where he has a home), a mostly successful strategy undermined by the fact he appeared at a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally last year. Murphy was saved, in the end, by the overwhelming advantage registered Democrats enjoy over registered Republicans \u2013 more than a million in New Jersey, though voters there have shown a willingness to support GOP candidates, like two-term former Govs. Christine Todd Whitman and, before Murphy\u2019s 2017 election, Chris Christie. With so much baseless questioning of elections after Trump\u2019s loss in 2020, there were fears that skepticism and fear would lead to low turnout elections. That didn\u2019t happen. And Tuesday night\u2019s races proved that elections work and can run smoothly. There were very few issues reported and, when there were blips, they were corrected and addressed. This was particularly clear in Virginia, where the state expended the use of early and mail in voting in respond to the coronavirus pandemic and continued the practice for the 2020 races. And, in response, both candidates took advantage, including Youngkin, who bucked Republican skepticism of non-election day voting and urged his supporters to vote early. \u201cWe were really excited to get a chance to come vote early. We\u2019ve been encouraging all Virginians to come vote, vote early,\u201d Youngkin said when he cast his ballot early. The strategy worked and Youngkin did what past Republicans had failed to do: Withstood the Democratic early voting surge with significant turnout of his own. With rising concerns over gun violence, the most aggressive bid to overhaul policing in America failed a big test Tuesday in Minneapolis. Voters in the city where George Floyd was murdered by a White police officer last year, setting off a worldwide protest movement against police and racist violence, rejected a ballot measure that would have eventually replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a city council-run Department of Public Safety. The measure would have removed a requirement to employ a minimum number of police officers in proportion to the city\u2019s population. Minneapolis City Councilmember Phillipe Cunningham, who spearheaded a similar ballot initiative over the past year, told CNN late Tuesday night that the result was \u201creally unfortunate.\u201d \u201cWe have just seen a clear backlash to progress in our city,\u201d he said. The success of the status quo is a setback for the activist wing of the Democratic Party, which has seen gains in its efforts to reform police departments, but failed now in its most ambitious effort to fundamentally reduce or eliminate the traditions role of police in America. Still, there were silver linings for advocates against the expansion of police departments. Voters in Austin, Texas, overwhelmingly voted down a measure that would have grown its police force. On a night to forget for many progressives, mayoral races projected by CNN painted a complex picture of what voters \u2013 Democrats, especially \u2013 want from their leaders. New York\u2019s Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president a retired former police captain who ran on a promise to crackdown on crime and police abuse, handily won election. Meanwhile, in Boston, Michelle Wu, a progressive prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is on pace to win a historic victory over her moderate rival and fell city councilor, Annissa Essaibi George, who has conceded the race. Pittsburgh has also elected Pennsylvania State Rep. Ed Gainey as its new mayor. Gainey, a progressive, defeated incumbent Mayor Bill Peduto in the Democratic primary and now will be the first Black mayor there. And a few hours west, Justin Bibb, another candidate with progressive support, will be the next leader in Cleveland. But as the west coast results rolled in, one more setback for progressives: City Council President Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez lost her race against former Council President Bruce Harrell. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "The Virginia governor\u2019s race hadn\u2019t even been called when Donald Trump stepped in to claim credit. \u201cI would like to thank my BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin,\u201d said Trump in a statement issued via his Save America PAC. \u201cWithout you, he would not have been close to winning.\u201d He was back at it during an appearance with Virginia-based conservative radio show host John Fredericks. \u201cI\u2019ve heard Virginia is blue, but I\u2019ve never believed it was blue,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWithout MAGA, [Youngkin] would have lost by 15 points, more \u2026 instead of giving us credit, they say, \u2018Oh he\u2019s more popular than [Trump].\u2019 \u201c This is vintage Trump \u2013 always quick to claim credit when things go well and loathe to take any blame when things go poorly. It\u2019s also fundamentally wrong. Youngkin won the race in spite of Trump, not because of Trump. Yes, Youngkin accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement in the race. And, no, Youngkin didn\u2019t actively distance himself from the former President when asked. But, make no mistake: Youngkin did everything he could to make the final weeks and months of this race about himself and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, not Trump. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cHe\u2019s not coming,\u201d Youngkin told reporters late in the race when asked about the possibility of a Trump rally before Election Day. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re campaigning as Virginians in Virginia with Virginians.\u201d Pressed on why he wasn\u2019t inviting Trump on the campaign trail, Youngkin was blunt: \u201cBecause this is about Virginia.\u201d While Trump still managed to be a presence in the race \u2013 he called in to several tele-townhall type of events aimed at rallying his most ardent supporters \u2013 it was quite clear that Youngkin was trying to keep him as far away as he could while still keeping the Trump base in the fold. Contrast Trump\u2019s lack of physical presence in the state with the who\u2019s who of the Democratic establishment who campaigned for McAulliffe down the stretch \u2013 from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris to former President Barack Obama. Democrats wanted to nationalize this race. Republicans didn\u2019t. Youngkin talked about the Loudoun County school system more than he talked about immigration or the national economy or, most certainly, Trump. That\u2019s not to say Trump doesn\u2019t deserve any credit for Youngkin\u2019s win. The Republican\u2019s margins in the more rural parts of the state were undoubtedly buoyed by Trump\u2019s praise of him. But, Youngkin spent the entirety of the general election trying to make the race anything but a referendum on Trump \u2013 a smart move given that just 42% of Virginia voters had a favorable opinion of the former president while 54% viewed him unfavorably. Youngkin won by keeping Trump out of his state and at arm\u2019s length in the general election. Trump can claim all the credit he wants for Youngkin\u2019s win but that\u2019s the political reality.",

            "article_content": "Demoralized Democrats need a reckoning after a rough election night that sent serious warning signs that they have misjudged the nation\u2019s mood as their window closes before next year\u2019s midterms. While the party feuds over its vast social spending agenda, Republicans are highlighting issues that preoccupy voters more immediately, like a sluggish economy, high gas prices, expensive groceries, crime rates and concerns about the rights of parents to influence what is taught in schools. Those concerns in many cases have been exacerbated by a prolonged pandemic, which President Joe Biden declared all but over in July but that spiked over the summer in a new blow to an exhausted nation\u2019s morale. Virginia governor\u2019s race especially was seen as a one-year referendum on Biden\u2019s presidency in a state he won by a whopping 10 points a year ago. Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin didn\u2019t just triumph, according to a CNN projection, he showed Republicans everywhere how to win, keeping former President Donald Trump out of the state to make inroads in suburbs lost to the GOP in 2018 and 2020 elections. 8 takeaways from the 2021 elections If Democrats only underperformed in Virginia, they could have put their misfortune down to an erratic and unfocused campaign by veteran party heavyweight Terry McAuliffe, who was trying to win a second, non-consecutive term as governor. But in New Jersey, a state Biden won by an even more comfortable margin, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s squeaker reelection race \u2013 which is still too close to call \u2013 reinforced a sense that the President\u2019s party has lost the country\u2019s confidence as he struggles to live up to his vow to restore competency to the White House and post-pandemic normality to American life. As the President arrived home from Europe in the early hours of Wednesday, it was not clear that Democratic leaders and many of the voters that ejected Trump from the White House last year are still on the same page. The party\u2019s lawmakers in Washington have spent weeks feuding with one another over the most sweeping social spending plan in generations \u2013 a cornerstone of Biden\u2019s agenda. Biden endured a wretched summer, including a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that shook confidence in his leadership and dented his approval ratings. It likely hasn\u2019t helped that progressives \u2013 who lost out in a series of city elections and ballot initiatives decided on Tuesday \u2013 have been a dominant force in the party in Washington, playing into GOP claims that the President is hostage to far-left influences in his own party. And while much of the Democratic Party and Washington\u2019s political and media world is preoccupied by the fallout from the January 6 insurrection, the results on Tuesday may also suggest that voters are focused on more tangible threats than the erosion of US democracy. CNN political commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones declared a \u201cfive alarm fire\u201d for Democrats and said the party needs to consider a change of course. Independent voters favor Youngkin as he clinches victory in Virginia, CNN exit poll shows \u201cThese numbers are bad,\u201d said Jones. \u201c\u2026These are our voters. These are voters that came to us in 2018, came to us in 2020, and have abandoned us in droves in two states that should be in our column.\u201d Guy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic group Priorities USA, said it was time for the party to come together. \u201cThis election is a warning for all Democrats. While DC Democrats spent weeks fighting each other, Republicans were focused on mobilizing their base and peeling away voters from the Biden coalition using deceptive, divisive tactics,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to focus on what\u2019s next. Congressional Democrats must immediately pass the infrastructure and Build Back Better bills. We must begin tomorrow to consolidate and mobilize those who turned out to vote Democratic in 2020. And we must draw a sharp contrast between Democratic progress and Republican extremism.\u201d In Virginia, Youngkin did exactly what he set out to do: He secured huge turnout in rural, conservative areas while avoiding alienating the kind of suburban voters who were turned off by Trump \u2013 a factor that helped cost the GOP control of the House in 2018 and the Senate and the White House in 2020. While sending coded messages to Trump\u2019s base on \u201celection integrity,\u201d race and transgender rights, the polished Youngkin didn\u2019t define his bid on Trump\u2019s voter fraud lies or adopt the polarizing, autocratic fury regularly displayed by the ex-President. And Trump, while continually injecting himself in the race \u2013 including on Tuesday night to claim credit for the win \u2013 largely kept out of Youngkin\u2019s way. He held a tele-rally on the eve of the vote, but he didn\u2019t travel to Virginia, for instance, after his frenzied rally in Georgia was blamed by some in the GOP for the loss of two Senate runoff races. Republican strategists believe that anxiety among moms and dads over months of lost in-person classes during Covid-19 gave them an opening in Democratic-leaning suburbs. McAuliffe played into their plan with a disastrous gaffe in a debate in which he appeared to suggest that parents should not have much say in how their kids were educated. The flap played into Republican efforts to exploit concerns among some parents about how America\u2019s tortured racial history is covered in history classes. Youngkin vowed to ban Critical Race Theory on his first day in office \u2013 even though it is not part of Virginia\u2019s curriculum \u2013 a move that got conservative media on his side. But an ad that implicitly attacked the late Toni Morrison, one of America\u2019s most revered African American authors, hinted at an ugly racial undercurrent to Republican politics in Virginia. Youngkin won for Republicans by keeping Trump \u2013 who dominates the party nationally \u2013 out of the picture. And McAuliffe ran against the former President, portraying a vote for a rival he accused of sounding racial dog whistles as a vote for a new Trump White House term. The result suggests fear of Trump among independents and moderates does not run as high when the ex-President isn\u2019t in the Oval Office or on the ballot. And McAuliffe, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Barack Obama all appear to have miscalculated by reasoning that the best way to down Youngkin was to paint him as a Trump clone \u2013 even though his behavior gave off few of the ex-President\u2019s vibes. Still, Trump is unlikely to be behind the scenes next fall, as he\u2019s treating the midterm elections as a dry run for his likely 2024 presidential run, so some Democrats may profit by portraying their opponents as in the pocket of the twice-impeached former commander-in-chief who incited a coup against the US Capitol. So, it\u2019s possible Youngkin\u2019s straddle to avoid alienating both Trump voters and suburbanites might not work quite so well across Virginia state lines. It can be dangerous to project too much from one off-year election. Virginia has a long habit of choosing a governor from a party other than the one that just captured the White House. And the volatile mood of voters in recent years has spelled danger for incumbents of both sides, showing how fast things change. But while Youngkin was only beating McAuliffe by around 80,000 votes among more than 3 million cast, a 10-point swing away from Democrats in only a year will come as a chilling warning to the party\u2019s vulnerable lawmakers in suburban districts who have fumed at House progressives who have held up a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package to secure a larger social spending plan. Anything close to those numbers next November would leave Democrats at extreme risk of losing both the House and the Senate. Youngkin\u2019s path to victory came by performing far better than Trump in vote percentage in the wealthy, populous, liberal suburbs around Washington, DC, where demographics favor Democrats. But just as interestingly, Youngkin also increased Trump\u2019s vote percentage in some of the most conservative counties. That could suggest that he managed to draw in some disaffected Republicans who balked at Trump\u2019s wild conduct in office. Or it could reflect the former President\u2019s move to urge his supporters to turn out \u2013 another apparent move to help the ex-President claim credit for the victory by a candidate who largely ignored him. However the Republican dynamics play out, Democrats know they have a grave problem. It\u2019s possible that the pandemic-affected economy could be in much better shape this time next year, and that Covid-19 will no longer be a dominant feature of national life or that inflation that is eating into many family budgets could be quelled. If Biden has already reached his low point, Democrats will at least hope to limit their losses in the midterms. But they need their voters to show up \u2013 against what looks like an electrified GOP base, according to Tuesday\u2019s evidence. And unless the President passes his two priority bills soon and makes progress on other issues including voting rights or immigration reform, already difficult midterm elections will begin to look impossible. \u201cPeople voted for us last year,\u201d a Democrat close to the McAuliffe campaign who was frustrated with Congress, told CNN\u2019s Dan Merica. \u201cWe have to give them something.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to make America normal again after the pandemic is proving to be far more protracted and complicated than first thought, which has enormous political implications for the President and his party. An admission by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on CNN Sunday that supply chain backups, which are having a corrosive impact on the wider economy, will linger into next year further underscored a tough midterm election environment for Democrats. There is only limited action Biden can take to get containers stacked up at ports out into the country, meaning the situation is causing a real headache for the White House. When Americans head into stores and see bacon has doubled in price, or when they cannot buy the gifts they want heading into the holiday season, Biden and Democrats are likely to get the blame in next month\u2019s elections and in 2022. The cost of living \u2013 along with gasoline that is now averaging $3.32 a gallon nationwide, according to the American Automobile Association \u2013 provides an opening for Republicans to argue that the Biden presidency is a failure. Rising discontent also fits neatly into the narrative of decay and national humiliation that Donald Trump is painting as he prepares the ground for a likely presidential campaign for 2024. On Sunday, for instance, the ex-President sent out a fundraising email that noted \u201cprices soaring.\u201d First-term presidents almost always suffer congressional election rebukes, as their actions often energize the opposing party\u2019s supporters against them and any struggles they have can cause their own voters to disengage. This time, with Democrats only possessing the narrowest of majorities in the House and the Senate, they badly need the economy to be racing ahead and the curse of the pandemic to be well behind the country in a year\u2019s time. But a catalog of problems, including a strapped labor market, rising energy prices, climbing inflation, political polarization over vaccines and an immigration crisis at the southern border, are creating a disgruntled national pre-election year mood.   Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations are forecast to keep declining over the next several weeks, but the Delta variant and Biden\u2019s own premature declaration of partial victory over the pandemic on July Fourth have also meant that any assumptions about being back to normal by late this year have already been shattered. The President sought to offer some light at the end of the tunnel last week, but was careful to point out that Covid-19 was far from going away. He cited \u201cimportant progress\u201d but added, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to let up. We have a lot more to do. We\u2019re in a very critical period as we work to turn the corner on Covid-19.\u201d His assurances are important because a CNN/SSRS poll released last month found that 69% of Americans thought things in the country were going badly. Surveys have also found that satisfaction with Biden, as he struggles to bridge Democratic divides on Capitol Hill and pass his agenda, has declined, though his approval rating did hit 50% in a CNN poll last week. Biden\u2019s election was in many ways a reaction to the chaos of Trump\u2019s failure to properly manage the pandemic. In fact, the President said so himself in a news conference in March of this year. \u201cWhen I took office, I decided that \u2013 it was a fairly basic, simple proposition \u2013 and that is I got elected to solve problems,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was Covid-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans.\u201d By his own benchmark then, and partly due to factors beyond his control, Biden has fallen short. And his diminished approval ratings appear to reflect his own judgment that beating the pandemic was the way he would be judged by voters. If the President cannot argue to Americans next year that he did what he was hired to do, then the traditional gains for the party out of power of the White House could translate into major Democratic losses in Congress. During the 2020 campaign, Biden\u2019s performance was notable for his command of the scale of the Covid-19 crisis, relentlessly on-message public appearances and an almost Fireside Chat-style in which he came across as taking Americans into his confidence and building their trust. As President, and as the pandemic has dragged on longer than Biden and everyone else expected, he has been less surefooted and his message has lacked the same resonance. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Biden\u2019s terse public response, meanwhile, supported the views of critics who concluded his presidency was being overtaken by events. There are some promising signs on the pandemic. Daily new Covid cases are about half the level of the summer surge and are trending down in almost every state. Deaths are also beginning to decline. It\u2019s likely that economic activity and job creation could spike once the virus ebbs across the country. But the sense of disrupted normality endures. Many parents of young kids are desperate for regulators to authorize vaccines for children under 12. Another Thanksgiving stands to be disrupted for many families since it\u2019s unlikely even if the shots are authorized soon, that millions of kids will get them and be fully vaccinated by the end of next month. It\u2019s also becoming clear that many of the serious global consequences of the pandemic, which will weigh on American life, will not simply disappear in the coming months. On that score, Buttigieg\u2019s comment on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d is the latest sign that a post-pandemic economic surge that could help mask other issues and persuade voters to stick to Biden\u2019s course is far from certain. \u201cCertainly a lot of the challenges that we\u2019ve been experiencing this year will continue into next year, but there are both short-term and long-term steps that we can take to do something about it,\u201d Buttigieg told Jake Tapper. Buttigieg spoke after Moody\u2019s Analytics warned last week that supply chain disruptions \u201cwill get worse before they get better.\u201d The supply chain crunch has plentiful causes, is deeply complex and influenced by many factors that the President cannot control \u2013 including Covid outbreaks in exporter countries and the fact that most of the US port, haulage and retail industries are run by private firms Biden cannot simply order to do better. Piles of containers backing up at US ports and ships idling offshore waiting to offload are being exacerbated by a post-pandemic shortfall in truckers, meaning this is a problem that is not easy to solve quickly. And the supply chain crunch is causing demand to increase, which in turn causes inflation to rise, which makes the cost of living more expensive and increases pressure on voters\u2019 wallets. Buttigieg, a rising Democratic political star who might have expected the Transportation Department to offer a comparatively safe political landing spot, now finds himself in the middle of a dicey political crisis. He actually portrayed the crisis \u2013 at least the issue of high consumer demand \u2013 as a sign of success for the President. \u201cEvery one of those ships is full of record amounts of goods that Americans are buying, because demand is up, because income is up, because the President has successfully guided this economy out of the teeth of a terrifying recession,\u201d Buttigieg said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The transportation secretary\u2019s appearances on several Sunday talk shows \u2013 and a move last week by the President to convene port bosses and unions that led to the introduction of 24/7 operations at the port of Los Angeles \u2013 proves that the White House is acutely aware of the damaging political impact of the supply chain issue and its consequences for regular Americans after a grueling year. Buttigieg also argued that passing Biden\u2019s stalled bipartisan infrastructure package, which is being held up by progressives as leverage in their fight for Biden\u2019s social spending plan, would help ease the situation. \u201cThere are $17 billion in the President\u2019s infrastructure plan for ports alone,\u201d Buttigieg told Tapper. He billed the other leg of Biden\u2019s agenda as a critical component of firing up the Covid-slowed economy. \u201cIf you care about inflation, you ought to care about not just the supply chain issues, not just the infrastructure things I work on,\u201d he said, going on to highlight features of Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda \u201clike paid family leave, like making it easier to afford child care, like community college that are going to give us a stronger labor force and help us deal with that major constraint on economic growth.\u201d While many of the problems hampering Biden\u2019s presidency do seem intractable, Democrats can at least hope that things will improve by next year. If the US is finally in the endgame of the pandemic, global energy prices ebb, and the supply chain crunch eases as the rest of the world comes closer to beating Covid, voters may feel in a better frame of mind as the midterm elections approach. But for now, it\u2019s a tough economic picture.",

            "article_content": "Leaning over a glass countertop displaying chorizo and carne salteada, Democrat Terry McAuliffe surveys the number of distinct nationalities he\u2019s encountered touring Todos Supermarket in northern Virginia. \u201cWe got Peru, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mexico,\u201d noted McAuliffe, who first visited the grocery chain in 2013, seeking to court Latino voters during his initial run for governor. Moments later, he asks a butcher: \u201cHave you voted yet?\u201d Amid an uptick in support for Republicans among the reliably Democratic-leaning demographic, McAuliffe recognizes that even a slight decline in support with Latinos could sink his chances against Republican opponent Glenn Youngkin come Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that I get the Hispanic vote out here,\u201d he said, expressing confidence that his campaign\u2019s top issues \u2014 as well as his opponent\u2019s embrace of some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 would draw the key demographic to him. \u201cI\u2019ve always had great support in the Hispanic community. I fight for them every single day,\u201d he said, listing job creation, education and healthcare as his priorities. Though President Joe Biden won nearly two-thirds of the Latino vote nationwide in 2020, former President Donald Trump outperformed expectations, leading to substantial gains for Republicans nationwide, including in Virginia, which has a growing Latino population. While Biden won the group\u2019s support by 25 percentage points in Virginia, Trump increased his support among Latinos by six points in 2020, losing by a narrower margin than he did in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. Harris among top Democrats planning to campaign in Virginia ahead of election Officials on McAuliffe\u2019s campaign say they\u2019re not taking any chances, launching a six-figure Spanish language media campaign with ads on television, radio and online, along with dozens of outreach events in the community meant to sway undecided voters \u2014 like Carlos Castro, the owner of Todos Supermarket. \u201cI think the political establishment needs to understand that we don\u2019t want \u2013 and we don\u2019t need \u2013 special treatment,\u201d Castro said of Latino voters like himself. A former undocumented immigrant, Castro immigrated to the United States in 1980, fleeing a civil war in El Salvador. He now employs hundreds of workers in multiple stores, and hosts visits from political candidates because he says he likes to offer \u201canother opinion\u201d to those vying for office. \u201cHe truly is an American success story,\u201d McAuliffe said of Castro, who led him on a tour of the store and introduced him to employees. Castro, who also hosted Youngkin in September, says his values align better with the GOP. But extremist rhetoric and discrimination toward immigrants like himself have turned him off. \u201cWhen we had good Republicans running the country, we had great opportunities, and we kind of like identified with a lot of them \u2026 with the Democrats, we have some difficulties because some of them lean too much into social issues that only bring, you know, division,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving all of this bad treatment from the Republican establishment, a lot of us have been forced to support candidates that show they care about the community and fortunately, it\u2019s been the Democratic Party lately,\u201d he added. As McAuliffe has tried to paint Youngkin as a \u201cTrump wannabe,\u201d some voters, like Raul Velasco, see that as a selling point. \u201cIt might seem wrong for other people, but if they said that Youngkin was more like Trump, I\u2019m 100% with him,\u201d said Velasco, who says he cast his ballot for the Republican based on concerns about crime and illegal immigration. Eager to replicate Trump\u2019s gains in 2020, Youngkin\u2019s campaign has sought to meet Latino voters where they are, holding more than 20 outreach events in the community and investing in Spanish language advertising and social media. \u201cThe campaign\u2019s outreach is remarkable,\u201d said Daniel P. Cortez, co-chairman of the Latinos for Youngkin coalition, who voted for McAuliffe in 2013. The disabled Vietnam veteran said he chose the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d when he cast his ballot for the former governor because he opposed Republican Ken Cuccinelli\u2019s stances on birthright citizenship and speaking only English in the workplace, which he says he found \u201creprehensible.\u201d But Cortez, who identifies as an independent, says he voted his pocketbook when he chose Trump last fall. This Republican candidate just got caught between Trump and a hard place \u201cI looked, as an independent voter, at who best could bring jobs to the nation, and I cast my vote for the conservative ticket. And it proved to be worthy because job-wise the economy skyrocketed,\u201d he said, encouraging other Latinos to do the same this year. This year, he cites critical race theory as \u201cthe most critical issue.\u201d The concept has been around for decades and that seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the United States. It\u2019s not part of K-12 instruction in Virginia, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans from seizing on it as a political flashpoint. Youngkin has pledged to ban the theory from schools on his first day in office. McAuliffe calls the GOP focus on the matter a racist dog whistle. Cortez said he sees the concept as discriminatory. Ultimately, he just wants to see race left out of things. \u201cThis is not about race, I\u2019m tired of dealing with racial politics \u2013 in the previous election and this election. Voters are tired. They\u2019re going to vote their pocketbooks, and they\u2019re going to vote their integrity,\u201d he explained. Health care also remains a central issue amid a global pandemic, with Castro citing it as one of the most important issues to his employees, who have worked on the frontlines for the past year and a half. Latino Virginians have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. According to state data released earlier this year, the number of coronavirus cases among Latino residents doubled those in White residents. Latinos were about two-and-a-half times more likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to die due to the virus. McAuliffe hopes his policies to expand Medicaid and support paid sick days appeal to Latino voters, but the debate over vaccine mandates has dominated the political discourse. Why Virginia's 2021 election matters The candidates are firmly split on the issue: McAuliffe would mandate covid vaccines for students, teachers and health care workers, while Youngkin is staunchly against requirements. McAuliffe has slammed Youngkin\u2019s position as \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the Hispanic community knows that I\u2019ll keep them safe.\u201d But Cortez said Youngkin\u2019s hands-off approach is what appeals to him most about the Republican\u2019s pandemic leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s got the shots, I\u2019ve got all my shots. I encourage everyone to get their vaccinations, their covid shots, and we\u2019re better off for it. But I don\u2019t think government should be mandating every aspect of my life,\u201d he said. Other voters are more concerned about what comes after all ballots are counted \u2014 and whether candidates will remember the community\u2019s concerns long after Election Day. \u201cEither Democrat or Republican, they tend to forget about us,\u201d said Luz Hernandez, a shopper at Todos Supermarket. \u201cWe want them to remember how important Latinos are and how we\u2019ve contributed to the nation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nine months after the attack on the US Capitol, Republicans in Congress are defending Donald Trump\u2019s role on January 6 in some of their strongest terms yet \u2013 and signaling he\u2019d have widespread backing from the party if he ran for president again in 2024. Republicans from across the conference \u2013 including some who are vulnerable in next year\u2019s midterms or have long been seen as part of the establishment wing of the party \u2013 are expressing little to no reservations about the prospect of Trump topping the ticket again, even as he continues to spread the same election lies that led a mob to storm their place of work. Some GOP members are cheering on a Trump comeback, saying he remains a popular figure and powerful force in the party. And there\u2019s widespread agreement among Republicans that Trump would be the automatic frontrunner \u2013 and freeze the primary field \u2013 if he chooses to jump in. Even some Republicans in swing districts \u2013 like Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 are embracing Trump\u2019s potential return into the political fray. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d Van Drew, who switched parties and became a Republican in 2019 to defend Trump during his first impeachment proceedings, said when asked if he would back the ex-President if he ran again in 2024. The southern New Jersey congressman, whose district narrowly backed Trump last year, bluntly said that he does not think Trump is responsible for the events of January 6, contending that the former President didn\u2019t call for violence. \u201cI do not,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cI think that people are responsible for their own actions.\u201d Asked if he believes that President Joe Biden won legitimately, Van Drew said: \u201cI am not going to make that determination. But what I do think is that we need to make sure that our election system works right.\u201d Trump\u2019s continued grip on the GOP is hardly surprising. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy trekked down to Mar-a-Lago just weeks after the insurrection seeking Trump\u2019s approval, while Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming was booted from the Republican leadership team this spring for calling out Trump\u2019s election lies. But as time elapses since January 6 and Trump makes a return to campaign-style rallies, a large swath of the House GOP conference is publicly rallying around the defeated former President while downplaying the deadly Capitol riot \u2013 a huge boon for Trump as he weighs his political future. If the GOP had any lingering doubts about Trump being the face of their party, they have completely evaporated from public view. \u201cIf he ran, I think he would be the nominee,\u201d said Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have anything to do with January 6. I think that\u2019s a far-fetched idea. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s damaged himself within the party.\u201d Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican weighing a Senate bid, added: \u201cWe got to win the midterm elections in 2022, but to see where our country is right now, I miss him. Absolutely miss him and I would support him.\u201d There is a reason that Republicans either embrace Trump\u2019s lie that the election was stolen, shrug their shoulders at his incendiary rhetoric, or whitewash his role fomenting the January 6 riot: Many believe his help will be essential to take back the House in 2022 and are eager to score his endorsement \u2013 or, in some cases, are scared to cross him. That dynamic was on full display last weekend at a rally in Iowa, where Trump addressed voters in a key state that is home to the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the longest-serving GOP senator currently in office, and Reps. Ashley Hinson and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, two freshman swing district Republicans who were vocal proponents of certifying the 2020 election results, all appeared alongside Trump as he continued to falsely claim that Biden did not win the White House legitimately. Grassley\u2019s bear-hug of Trump was particularly striking. The 88-year-old, who once harshly rebuked Trump for his behavior leading up to January 6, gushed about the former President on stage and said it would be \u201csmart\u201d to accept Trump\u2019s endorsement as he seeks another term in Congress. Grassley also spearheaded a recent GOP minority report pushing back on the findings of a Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee report that found Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department to overturn the elections. When asked last week if he believes Trump bears any responsibility for January 6, Grassley noted that the committee\u2019s probe didn\u2019t dive into the events of that day, suggesting he\u2019d wait to make a conclusion on that if there\u2019s a further probe \u2013 carried out by Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see if he does more investigation,\u201d Grassley said. In another sign that Trump is increasingly back in the party fold, the former President will headline upcoming fundraisers for both the House and Senate GOP campaign arms \u2013 even as he continues to attack Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the highest-ranking Republican official. Trump was not invited to attend a House GOP retreat earlier this year, when Cheney was still a member of leadership, but she\u2019s since been replaced by a more loyal Trump supporter in New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. GOP leaders in the House have made clear they view Trump as central to their quest to win back their majority, arguing he can help boost their campaign coffers as well as voter turnout. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who would be in line to be House majority leader if the GOP takes back power next year, told CNN on Tuesday that the former President is \u201cdrawing big crowds\u201d when asked if he would back Trump in 2024. \u201cHe wants to help us win the House back in 2022,\u201d Scalise said, before rattling off a list of problems facing Biden \u2013 from high gas prices to illegal immigration. \u201cThe enthusiasm has never been higher for us to win back the House. And President Trump is really going to help us get there.\u201d According to a CNN poll last month, the majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, or 63%, believe Trump should be the leader of the Republican Party. But they are about evenly split over whether having the defeated former President back on the ticket in 2024 would be an advantage: 51% say that Republicans have a better chance of retaking the presidency if Trump is the nominee, with 49% saying the party would be better off with a different nominee. Most Republicans in Congress have no qualms about another Trump presidential bid. Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York called the former President a \u201cclear, strong favorite for the party\u2019s nomination.\u201d Rep. Roger Williams of Texas said Trump is still widely seen as \u201cthe spokesman of our party.\u201d And Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, believes Trump would \u201chave a great shot of winning the general election too.\u201d \u201c\u2018If President Trump runs in 2024, he has my full support,\u201d Banks said. \u201cThe \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 message means more today than it did in 2015 when Donald Trump came down the escalator, because people feel it, they see the decline of America on the Democrats\u2019 watch.\u201d But even as Trump has continued his parade of lies and conspiracies over the election results, GOP lawmakers continue to look the other way \u2013 or embrace his claims. Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina called January 6 \u201can aberration that shouldn\u2019t have occurred\u201d but made clear that he didn\u2019t think Trump was responsible at all. And he said that \u201cthere were irregularities that need to be looked into\u201d when asked if he agrees with Trump continually saying the election was stolen. \u201cYes,\u201d Wilson said when asked if he thinks Trump should run again. Scalise, when pressed repeatedly by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, refused to say on Sunday whether he agreed with Trump that the election was stolen. Asked whether Trump played any role in the January 6 insurrection led by a mob of his supporters, Smith of Missouri pointed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even though the speaker is not in charge of Capitol security. \u201cNancy Pelosi should have never allowed the Capitol to be breached. No other Speaker has ever allowed the Capitol to be breached,\u201d he said. Former Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who was the subject of \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d chants that day for refusing to overturn the election results \u2013 recently blamed the media for focusing so much on the insurrection, dismissing it as \u201cone day in January.\u201d And some Republicans \u2013 like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and McConnell, who criticized Trump in the immediate aftermath of January 6 \u2013 are leery about taking aim at him now. Roy, who had railed against the effort to overturn the election in Congress, sidestepped questions on Tuesday when asked about Trump\u2019s persistent claim that the election was stolen. \u201cI think the former President is rightly pointing out that this administration\u2019s a complete disaster \u2013 a train wreck. But right now, we should just focus on what we need to do right now to stop the damage that they\u2019re inflicting on the country every single day. That\u2019s my job,\u201d Roy said. CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Presidents get into trouble when they are seen as controlled by events rather than the other way around. This is the situation now facing Joe Biden. The President is confronted by a slew of intractable domestic and global crises he has no power to quickly fix, a bunch of political crunches caused and exacerbated by his own choices and a deepening sense of a White House under siege. Rising gasoline prices and inflation, a global supply chain backup that could empty Santa\u2019s sled, and a pandemic Biden was elected to end but that won\u2019t go away dominate a testing political environment. The economy seems to have forgotten how to get people back to work. That\u2019s largely due to a summer Covid-19 surge powered mostly by conservatives who refuse to get vaccines and who view masking and mandates as an act of government oppression. Biden has been in Washington nearly 50 years, so he may be more sanguine than most about the boom and bust cycle of presidencies that has been rendered more extreme by social media and corrosive national polarization. Yet with his approval ratings slipping fast, the President faces a political imperative to impose his authority amid a nagging national sense that a lot is going wrong. Democrats already fear midterm elections next year will be a Republican rout. And ex-President Donald Trump is prowling, gleefully painting a horror show about Biden\u2019s struggles to fuel the sense of chaos in which his demagoguery thrives ahead of a potential 2024 campaign. Even the White House admits things aren\u2019t going great. \u201cThis is a really tough time in our country. We\u2019re still battling Covid, and a lot of people thought we\u2019d be through it, including us,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki admitted on Friday. Successful presidents are able to rebound, to dig deep in crises and turn around their fortunes, and not get defined by nightmares as happened to Jimmy Carter with the Iran hostage crisis or George W. Bush with the foundering Iraq war.   But the pile of challenges on Biden\u2019s Oval Office desk is daunting \u2013 and they extend overseas, where Beijing\u2019s relentless pressure on Taiwan is worsening an already tense multi-front standoff between the US and China. On at least one domestic issue, Biden\u2019s hands appear tied. No amount of pleading, cajoling or hectoring by Biden, for example, would have worked with conservatives who have refused to get the vaccine or follow basic public health guidance. The President betrayed his frustration anyway last week, telling vaccine holdouts: \u201cOur patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us.\u201d Biden\u2019s huge political agenda \u2013 including a historic $3.5 trillion spending package on health care, education and climate change \u2013 and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan is, meanwhile, stalled. Feuding Democrats, not obstructionist Republicans, are the problem here. A sense by progressives that the spending plan must count comes as their other priorities \u2013 including a failed bipartisan police reform bid, changes to immigration law and a sweeping voting rights bill \u2013 have been blocked by Senate Republicans. And a Democratic loss in a tighter-than-expected Virginia governor\u2019s race next month could trigger all out panic in the party. It could also identify problems connecting with the suburban moderates and independents that helped Biden realize his life-long dream of the presidency. Biden also faces an unprecedented challenge from a Republican Party that has largely given up on democracy itself. While he tried to unite the nation, Trump attempted a coup and convinced millions of supporters of the lie that the election was a fraud because his fragile ego could not bear the truth. A relentless conservative propaganda machine pumps out falsehoods about the alternative reality in which Trump supporters prefer to dwell 24 hours a day. And fears are rising the now autocratic party of Lincoln will succeed in stealing the White House in 2024. In a sign they will do anything for power, Senate Republicans all but sent the economy spinning into default last week to score political points and may do so for real in December after warning they won\u2019t acquiesce in raising the federal borrowing limit again to pay for Trump\u2019s massive debts. A government shutdown also looms if Biden can\u2019t pass a funding bill by then. But it\u2019s not all on everyone else. Biden and his Democratic Party also have to share a large part of the blame for their current plight. The President presided over a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in which American service members died. His rhetoric was at odds with events and he tried to blame others for the mess that allowed the GOP to portray him as weak. The harrowing scenes seem to have robbed him of any credit for ending America\u2019s longest war \u2013 a distinction that eluded three previous presidents. Even if his leadership contrasts with Trump\u2019s benign neglect, Biden hasn\u2019t been perfect on the pandemic either. His White House has sometimes spun mixed messaging on masks and public health guidance. Even as he declared partial victory over the virus on July Fourth, it was already clear that the invading Delta variant meant his \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d moment was premature. The failure of the administration to nominate a commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration remains a mystery in the depths of a pandemic. Virginia's gubernatorial election is more important than ever as a national barometer Biden and Democrats in Washington \u2013 after the success of an early $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill \u2013 haven\u2019t so far effectively wielded power. House progressives made a power play, but haven\u2019t yet shown they understand government is about compromise. Moderate Senate Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema adopted a my-way-or-the-highway approach that left Biden\u2019s agenda on a knife-edge. The President may need to be far more proactive. His laid-back \u2013 critics might say absent leadership style \u2013 that helped him in 2020 doesn\u2019t fill the bully pulpit. And questions about his rigor will always be sensitive since, at 78, he\u2019s the oldest US President. If the bills fail, Democrats may also rue their tactics. Since Biden was seen by many 2020 voters as a moderate, was he wise to author a multi-trillion dollar spending spree easy for the GOP to portray as radical? And was such a gamble asking too much of tiny congressional majorities that always meant comparisons to Lyndon Johnson and Franklin Roosevelt were overwrought? Biden\u2019s big bet was rooted in a need to show working-class Americans \u2013 including those seduced by Trump\u2019s populist nationalism \u2013 that the government they believe ignored them can still help. Democrats, who are favorites to lose the House next year and have an unappealing slate of Senate seats to defend, were always going to go for broke if they had the chance, fearing their lease on Washington power may be short. But unless Biden can unite his party soon, he may have alienated more moderate voters who picked him in 2020 for nothing. And the idea that voters will reward Democrats even if the bills do pass remains an untested theory. The administration\u2019s handling of immigration \u2013 one of the most toxic political issues \u2013 has also been haphazard. An influx of undocumented migrants pouring toward the US southern border offers an opening for Republicans almost every day. GOP claims that millions make it across are outlandish. But the White House often seems to ignore a serious situation. And Vice President Kamala Harris has apparently had little impact on conditions in Central America that spur migration \u2013 in a mission assigned by Biden. The deportation, meanwhile, of hundreds of Haitian refugees back to a violence-plagued homeland many left years ago ripped divisions inside the administration and caused angry splits inside the Democratic Party. As did the failure of a bipartisan police reform push in memory of George Floyd. All of this plays into Trump\u2019s hands. The ex-President may be a grave threat to American democracy, but he remains unequalled at spinning dire events into a base-pleasing political message. Here's why you should be worried about US democracy right now \u201cViolent criminals and bloodthirsty gangs are taking over our streets, illegal aliens and deadly drug cartels are taking over our borders, inflation is taking over our economy, China\u2019s taking over our jobs, the Taliban has taken over Afghanistan, lunatic leftists are taking over our schools and radical socialists are taking over our country,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Iowa Saturday night that underscored his continuing grip on the Republican Party. Trump has no governing power, so it\u2019s easy to carp. Biden, however, faces a situation all presidents encounter. Whereas in the campaign he was the foil to Trump\u2019s failed presidency, contempt for democratic values and volcanic temperament that rocked the world, Biden is now being judged on his own terms. Therefore, outside events he can\u2019t control can be especially damaging, and leave little room for missteps on situations that should be within his control. Still, there is more than a year before the midterms, even if prevailing public sentiment does tend to get baked in months ahead of time. Presidents of both parties often get frustrated at media narratives of decline and of their White Houses being under siege, viewing Beltway journalists as score keepers who miss deeper trends and the reality of life in the country. But news coverage does help shape impressions of a presidency \u2013 one reason politicians spend so much time trying to shape it \u2013 especially for voters who don\u2019t spend all their time following events. But if the President can crack heads in his party and get infrastructure and a smaller but still meaningful social spending program passed, he will construct a legacy that eluded several predecessors. Most crucially, his political standing depends on the pandemic finally easing. If vaccines for kids and new treatments kick in, ease infections and perhaps even mitigate Covid-fueled political fury, his fortunes could rebound. A true pandemic end game would boost the economy and hiring just in time for the midterms \u2013 and an ebbing of the disease worldwide could untangle broader economic kinks. If that happens, the environment may not seem quite so primed for a GOP midterm sweep and a Trump comeback. \u201cOur focus is on getting the pandemic under control, returning to life \u2013 a version of normal \u2013 so people can have security in going into work and dropping their kids off and knowing people will be safe,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we think we should spend our time and energy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nearly a year after the US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested a Mexican former defense minister and charged him with being a drug cartel boss, the Biden administration is deploying three Cabinet members and White House officials to Mexico to mend ties that are crucial for grappling with cross-border flows of migrants and drug and gun trafficking. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland will visit Mexico later this week for what the White House bills as the first US-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue, an indication of the priority the Biden administration is placing on restoring security cooperation, after months of behind-the-scenes wrangling. Outgoing State Department official says US border policy is illegal and inhumane President Joe Biden, who took office promising allies that \u201cAmerica is back\u201d after four years of tensions with the previous administration, has faced headwinds with some of the US\u2019s closest friends amid a series of crises. These include the clumsy coordination with allies on the Afghanistan troop withdrawal and the recent US deal with Britain to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, which prompted protests by France. With the Mexico relationship, the Biden administration is eager for help to resolve crises that are closely tied to US domestic politics: the surge of tens of thousands of migrants at the US southern border, and the Mexican drug cartels\u2019 move to flood the US with fake prescription medications laced with the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is fueling a historic number of drug overdoses on American streets. \u201cA concern I have is that with everything that\u2019s going on Afghanistan, now this diplomatic snafu \u2013 if we can call it that \u2013 with the French, and an administration that clearly is recalibrating policy towards China, is that the danger, the pervasive danger of Mexico being taken for granted,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the US. \u201cAnd of not enough strategic bandwidth dedicated to one relationship, which plays a critically important role for the well-being and security of the United States, which is the relationship with Mexico.\u201d Over the summer Vice President Kamala Harris visited Mexico and said she strongly believes the US and Mexico are \u201cembarking on a new era,\u201d which makes clear the interdependence and interconnectedness between the countries. The vice president\u2019s visit didn\u2019t produce the anticipated thaw in relations. More than 800 arrests made in DEA crackdown on fentanyl-laced fake pills The tensions at least partially are blamed on a years-long DEA operation that led to the arrest last October of Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Mexico\u2019s secretary of national defense from 2012 to 2018, while he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles. The Mexican government\u2019s anger at how the arrest was handled, with no notice to Mexican authorities, exposed a long undercurrent of resentment over how the US approached the relationship. In Mexico, there\u2019s widespread irritation that the US largely focuses the security collaboration on migration and drugs going north and not on the endemic violence Mexican citizens suffer because of the flow of illegal guns from the US. Mexico retaliated by largely suspending DEA operations in the country and US officials say Mexican authorities threatened to pull back from migration agreements that the Trump administration viewed as key to stemming border crossings. Then-Attorney General William Barr quickly called Mexican authorities to say that he himself was surprised at the Cienfuegos arrest and promised to return the general to Mexico, according to people briefed on the discussions. A month later, the Justice Department dropped charges against Cienfuegos and sent him home. Some Trump administration officials worried that Mexican authorities would allow a flood of migrants amid the US presidential election campaign. Inside the Justice Department, top officials viewed the Cienfuegos case as not worth the disruption to ties with Mexico. Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard later said he spoke to Barr following Cienfuegos\u2019 arrest and expressed Mexico\u2019s \u201cdiscontent.\u201d Climate change is intensifying the US border crisis. It will only get worse \u201cWe have an alliance against organized crime and it was not, for us, the government of Mexico, understandable that being allies we would not be notified,\u201d Erbard told reporters. But despite the return of Cienfuegos, there was no return to normal. The change of administrations in the US added new complications: With Donald Trump gone, so were threats that the former President had regularly made to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Those threats, which the Mexican government feared would lead to upheaval between the two countries, had prompted Mexico to extradite dozens of cartel suspects wanted on charges by the US Justice Department, former and current US officials say. While the designation threat was never treated seriously by US government officials, the threats worked and Barr was able to secure Mexican help against cartel operatives. Biden administration officials took office to find no such leverage with Mexico. Extraditions have stopped, US officials say. And Mexico has not approved any visas for DEA agents this year, officials added. Normally the process to obtain visas takes about a month, but many of these DEA agents have been waiting for upward of six months, the sources said. \u201cThe security and law enforcement collaboration has been scaled back to levels that we hadn\u2019t seen since probably the first half of the first decade of the century,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cIf the security relationship continues creating noise and friction points, it could wreak havoc and contaminate the bilateral relationship as a whole.\u201d A State Department spokesperson said, \u201cMexico remains a critical US security partner and we are committed to working with the Lopez Obrador administration to advance shared priorities, strengthen Mexico\u2019s ability to fight corruption and impunity, and implement more effective strategies to dismantle transnational organized crime, including through operational law enforcement cooperation in Mexico.\u201d The DEA is still unable to conduct most operations in Mexico, and the issue has been discussed in talks between senior officials of the two countries in recent months, US officials said. Even though the DEA has extended the stays of some agents who were already in the country, the visa issue is affecting almost two dozen agents, US officials said, and is hampering the work with informants, according to two sources familiar with the situation. 'Is there a contradiction?': Acosta presses DHS secretary about policy In the wake of the Cienfuegos operation, Mexican authorities acknowledged they had long wanted to revisit the broad discretion they had allowed the DEA for operations in their country. Because of US concerns about widespread corruption problems in Mexico, the DEA works with specially vetted Mexican security and law enforcement units, which limits the Mexican government\u2019s visibility on sensitive intelligence and operations the US agency is seeking to carry out. The challenges and distrust in the arrangement were made clear in 2014, when Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, Sinaloa cartel leader and one of the US\u2019s most-wanted drug traffickers, was arrested by Mexican authorities with the help of the DEA, only to escape a year later from Mexico\u2019s high security prison. In 2016, the US provided intelligence and other help to a specially vetted force of Mexican marines to re-arrest Guzman. This time, he was extradited to the US, where he was convicted and is now serving a life sentence. But Mexico\u2019s refusal to grant visas for the DEA agents is one of the small but significant irritants to the relationship right now, which is contributing to a decay in the security relationship between the bordering countries. The Biden administration has struggled to contain new crises for which Mexican help is crucial: a spiraling migrant crisis on the southern border and a burgeoning trade by Mexican cartels flooding the US with fake prescription pills laced with fentanyl, which US authorities say is fueling overdose deaths. The Biden administration, like those before it, is in part relying on Mexico to tackle the flow of migrants to the US border and officials are expected to discuss Mexico\u2019s immigration enforcement during this week\u2019s visit, according to an administration official. Migration will continue as long as inequality persists, says Haiti's prime minister as Del Rio bridge crisis ends The pace at which migrants, primarily Haitians, arrived at the US southern border last month caught the Biden administration by surprise. The migrants primarily moved by bus, cutting down travel time, and appeared to easily move through Mexico, according to a Customs and Border Protection official. Mexico later stepped up enforcement on migrants journeying through the country, stopping dozens of buses of Haitians moving toward the US border after thousands massed under the Del Rio International Bridge. A Department of Homeland Security official told reporters the US is \u201cworking closely\u201d with the government of Mexico to try to enhance visibility into organized movements of migrants. USAID Administrator Samantha Power met with Mexico Ambassador Esteban Moctezuma Barrag\u00e1n to discuss linked priorities, including migration. \u201cLack of economic opportunity is a root cause of irregular migration; (USAID) is proud to partner with the Mexican people to achieve sustainable, long-term development goals,\u201d Power said in a tweet. Also looming over US-Mexico discussions is a lower court ruling ordering the Biden administration to revive a Trump-era border policy that forces migrants to stay in Mexico until their US immigration court date \u2013 and as a result requires some buy-in from Mexico. During the Trump years, that policy resulted in thousands of people setting up camp along Mexico\u2019s northern border, often waiting in squalid conditions. Within the administration, there\u2019s been a heightened sense of urgency about the so-called \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy amid ongoing litigation over a public health authority allowing the expulsion of migrants, according to a source familiar with discussions. Last week, DHS said it\u2019s engaged in \u201chigh-level diplomatic discussions\u201d with Mexico about restarting the policy, while saying it planned to reissue a memo terminating the program.",

            "article_content": "Democratic hopes for passing big legislation through the Senate rely on Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Both have made things difficult for Senate Democrats because they are moderates who have been hesitant to pass big spending packages. But while Democrats are lucky to have a Democrat of any ideological persuasion representing West Virginia, they may not be getting the best bang for their buck from Sinema. Sinema has, for the last few years, had the same ideological record as Manchin. As I\u2019ve noted before, Manchin\u2019s ideological record is about the best Democrats can hope for from West Virginia. But Democrats can hope for more from an Arizona Democrat. Their party has a much easier time winning in Arizona than West Virginia. Start with what happened in last year\u2019s presidential election. President Joe Biden won the state of Arizona by 0.3 points. West Virginia, unlike Arizona, is a red state. Biden lost the state by 39 points. This came after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lost the state by more than 40 points in 2016. Arizona, on the other hand, is purple and has been chugging to the left. Biden did 4 points better than Clinton, who in turn did 6 points better than Barack Obama in 2012. Part of what may be happening is that Sinema thinks that Arizona is a redder state than it actually is. That\u2019s understandable insofar as Democrats have only started winning statewide races there with regularity recently. Sinema became the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate race since 1988. This feat, however, was repeated by Mark Kelly in 2020. Kelly won by basically the same margin against the same opponent as Sinema and in a tougher political environment. Biden, too, became the first Democrat to win the state on the presidential level since 1996. Beyond Kelly and Biden, Democrats in Arizona now control two of the five seats on the state\u2019s corporation commission, the secretary of state\u2019s office and superintendent of public instruction office. They also hold five of the nine US House seats. Compare that to Manchin. He is literally the only Democrat to be representing West Virginia in any statewide or federal office. Arizona\u2019s electoral environment is more similar to Georgia, which has become more purple in recent years as well. Biden won the state by about the same amount as he did Arizona. The state just elected Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock to the Senate. They haven\u2019t obstructed Biden\u2019s agenda to anywhere near the same degree. So what else might explain Sinema\u2019s ways? It\u2019s been reported that Sinema holds up former Arizona Sen. John McCain as a role model. McCain was, of course, a thorn in former President Donald Trump\u2019s side and didn\u2019t always vote in-line with his party. If she\u2019s trying to copy McCain\u2019s ways, Sinema isn\u2019t doing a great job. McCain usually voted with his party. In his final full year in the Senate, he voted with his party more than 90% of the time on party unity votes (i.e. those where at least 50% of one party voted a different way from 50% of the other party). This was about on par for him. McCain voted with his party less than the median senator, but not that much less. Sinema is an entirely different legislator. She votes against her party far more than the median legislator on party unity votes, according to the CQ Almanac. From 2013 to 2019, she\u2019s never voted with her party more than 75% of the time. There is one way though in which Sinema is similar to McCain: She\u2019s upsetting her party\u2019s base. A viral video from over the weekend shows a few of Sinema\u2019s constituents following her down a hall and into a bathroom, calling on her to keep her promises to support Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan and telling her they need immigration reform. (She doesn\u2019t specifically respond to their questions on camera.) By voting the way she does, Sinema may be leaving herself open to a primary challenge \u2013 a possibility certain liberal groups are already eyeing. And unlike Manchin, who has beaten back primary challenges easily, Sinema isn\u2019t going to face a primary electorate where less than 40% of registered Democrats call themselves liberal. Democrats in Arizona are about as liberal as the national average, according to both the 2020 primary exit polls and CES. More than 60% of Democrats called themselves liberal in both surveys. The bottom line is that Sinema may be unnecessarily moderate for her own electoral good. Maybe it\u2019ll work out for her. Still, It\u2019s possible though that not only is she making Biden\u2019s life more difficult, but her own electoral future more difficult as well.",

            "article_content": "With just over a year until the 2022 midterm elections, NextGen America \u2013 the progressive youth voter engagement organization \u2013 is launching a $32 million program to engage young voters across eight states. NextGen will organize in Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada with a goal to \u201cregister, inform and mobilize\u201d hundreds of thousands of young voters, the group says. The organization wants to register more than 288,000 voters across the country, including 150,000 in Texas, and reach more than 9 million young people between the ages of 18 and 35 with information about voting in the midterms. Already this month, NextGen has started to contact potential voters with voter registration mail. Between September and October, the group aims to reach nearly 99,000 young voters nation wide with mail and will text and call 1.4 million more. \u201cI think we\u2019ve won a lot already with the power and turnout of young voters. But ultimately what we care about at NextGen is delivering on real change,\u201d NextGen Executive Director Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez told CNN, adding that NextGen hopes to deliver a message to any legislator who is \u201ctrying to cling to the past.\u201d \u201cIf they want to do that, they can cling to the past, but the future belongs to us,\u201d she said. NextGen\u2019s investment comes following high levels of youth civic engagement in recent years, leading to historic youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections and one of the highest youth voter turnout rates in the 2020 general election. In 2020, half of young people ages 18-29 voted, according to research from Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts (CIRCLE), an 11-point jump from the 39% of young people ages 18-29 who voted in 2016. Ahead of the 2020 election, NextGen, founded by businessman Tom Steyer in 2013, contacted more than 10.5 million people, the organization said. To kick off its 2022 initiative, NextGen this week is holding in-person events in Texas, where the group is organizing for the first time. The organization will host events in both McAllen and Houston. \u201cWe are investing early and to scale in young people and young people of color in the largest battleground in the country,\u201d Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, who is from Texas, said. In Texas, young people of color accounted for a majority of everyone who has turned 18 since the 2016 election, according to census figures. Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez said that the group is expanding to the Lone Star state in part because of its youth and diversity. Yet she stressed that while \u201cdemographics are an ingredient for change,\u201d they alone are not the difference maker and concerted organizing efforts are necessary for progress. \u201cAs one of the youngest states in the country, young people in Texas have the power to determine an entire new direction not just for our home state, but the nation,\u201d she said, adding that she believes controversial policy decisions made by the Republican majority in the Texas state legislature over access to the ballot box, abortion and immigration do not correspond with the will of young people in the state. \u201cIf the legislature of Texas actually enacted the will of young Texans we wouldn\u2019t be banning abortion, we wouldn\u2019t be trying to build a useless border wall and we wouldn\u2019t be passing voter suppression bills,\u201d Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez said. Currently, NextGen has a volunteer base of 25,000 people across the country. To implement its new initiative, the group will have organizing staff on the ground in Texas, Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania and will do distributed digital organizing in New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada. In addition to mailing, calling and texting potential voters, the group said it aims to reach young people through social media and its influencer program. Asked why he is committed to investing in young people, Steyer told CNN he believes the youth vote is critical to getting progressives elected. \u201cThere is an increasing recognition of a threat to democracy, and we are basically an organization dedicated to the broadest most reflective democracy, specifically by making sure people who vote the least, under age 35, show up, make their voices heard and are counted. They will change the nation,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "After a rough month for President Joe Biden, Republicans think they have more than historical precedent on their side to retake the Senate in 2022. Traditionally, the party out of the White House does better in the midterms. But the surging Delta variant, a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and intra-party fissures on Capitol Hill have all threatened Biden\u2019s agenda \u2013 and his ability to communicate it throughout the summer \u2013 giving Republicans more to work with as they try to retake the Senate. Biden\u2019s approval rating stood at 52% in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS, with 69% of Americans saying things are going badly in this country. Sixty-two percent of Americans said that economic conditions in the US are poor \u2013 up from 45% in April. That\u2019s bad news for Democrats, who only enjoy a majority because Vice President Kamala Harris is the tie-breaking vote in the chamber. But it\u2019s far too early to assume that the national mood heading into the fall will look anything like the political climate of November 2022. And the worsening atmosphere for Biden hasn\u2019t yet altered which Senate races are most competitive. Pennsylvania, where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring, is still the seat most likely to flip partisan control \u2013 for the sixth month of CNN\u2019s Senate race ranking. The top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, more polling and advertising spending data will become factors. Despite the roadblocks on Capitol Hill \u2013 many from within their own party, as moderates and progressives in both chambers squabble over timing, scope and size of legislation \u2013 Democrats are hoping to have significant accomplishments to tout by this time next year. The Senate has already passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, while a much more expansive economic package, if passed, would enact much of Biden\u2019s economic agenda. Republicans see a massive spending bill they can attack Democrats over, but Democrats are hoping it\u2019ll give them tangible kitchen table benefits to talk about, like lower prescription drug costs and paid family leave. Republicans have also given Democrats some ammunition to fire up their base in an off-year election where turnout, on both sides, is an open question without former President Donald Trump on the ballot. Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban has reinjected reproductive rights and the Supreme Court into the national conversation. Nationally, public opinion is firmly on the side of abortion rights \u2013 fewer than one-third of Americans want to see the Roe v. Wade decision overturned, according to a set of three polls released over the past week. It depends what state they\u2019re running in, but Democrats may look to use this issue to paint their GOP opponents as out of touch, especially in places like Nevada and New Hampshire. The map of competitive Senate races doesn\u2019t look anything like California, which Biden carried by nearly 30 points last year, but Democrats have been heartened to see that running on Covid restrictions can be an effective message after this month\u2019s GOP-driven recall of California Gov. Gavin Newsom failed. About 48% \u2013 a plurality in the California exit poll \u2013 said that the Democratic governor\u2019s coronavirus policies were \u201cabout right.\u201d Another 18% said they were \u201cnot strict enough.\u201d Nationally, support for vaccine mandates has grown, with more than half of Americans supporting them for the workplace, in-person classes and concerts and sporting events, according to CNN\u2019s recent poll. One reason, Democratic and Republican strategists agreed, that Newsom was able to capitalize on that message is he had a foil in Republican Larry Elder and was able to credibly tie him to Trump. And while that may have worked uniquely well in California, Trump \u2013 even without a social media presence \u2013 is still leaving his footprint on primaries as he hand-picks some candidates and torches others. The former President, who had already endorsed in North Carolina earlier this summer, made endorsements in open GOP primaries in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada over the past month, while Republicans in Ohio, Arizona and Missouri are still duking it out over fealty to him. It remains to be seen, however, just how much those endorsements matter. Here are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip next fall. Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) The biggest development in the Keystone State, which remains the seat most likely to flip partisan control, was Trump earlier this month wading into the GOP primary to replace retiring Sen. Pat Toomey. He backed Army veteran Sean Parnell, who lost a 2020 House bid to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb (who\u2019s running for the Democratic nod for this seat). Parnell already had support from the former President\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., so getting the elder Trump\u2019s backing wasn\u2019t a big surprise. But rather than doing anything to clear the field, the endorsement may be making this race more ugly, with businessman Jeff Bartos launching personal attacks on Parnell. Democrats are happy to see Republicans go after each other, while they attack the GOP on issues ranging from partisan audits to abortion restrictions. Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh, for example, who\u2019s running with the backing of EMILY\u2019s List and 314 Action, has been outspoken about the threat to abortion rights and the importance of the Supreme Court. \u201cA woman physician has never served in the U.S. Senate before \u2013 ever,\u201d she wrote in a recent op-ed touting her science background. Republicans, however, think a national environment that looks worse for Biden could help them hold onto this seat, especially with the biggest fundraiser in the race pushing the party to the left on some issues. \u201cStop apologizing for the space we take up as a party and ram some stuff through and get it done,\u201d Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman told CNN in a recent interview about his strong belief in eliminating the filibuster. That\u2019s just what Republicans want to hear as they look to attack him as too extreme for this purple state. Still, Democrats have the edge in a state that Biden carried in 2020. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock Former football star Herschel Walker, the man who was freezing the Republican field in Georgia for months, finally launched his Senate campaign late last month, which was quickly followed by an unsurprising Trump endorsement. The former President is holding a rally in the Peach State this weekend, where he\u2019s sure to share his thoughts on candidates up and down the ballot there as he seeks revenge on Republicans whom he thinks were insufficiently supportive of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who\u2019s tried to attack Walker, is still running for the GOP nomination, as are a handful of others. It remains to be seen how much establishment Republicans worried about Walker\u2019s candidacy can do about it now that he\u2019s in the race with Trump\u2019s backing. But Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\u2019s running for a full six-year term, is glad to have the Democratic field to himself as he raises money for what\u2019s sure to be a hotly competitive general election race, regardless of how the GOP primary shakes out. After winning the presidential contest here, as well as two Senate runoffs that flipped the balance of the chamber, Democrats are hopeful that a competitive governor\u2019s race \u2013 and especially a potential Stacey Abrams candidacy \u2013 will help juice turnout in a non-presidential election year. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson It\u2019s the question that no one seems to know the answer to \u2013 except, maybe, the senior senator from Wisconsin himself: Is Ron Johnson running for a third term? At this point, given his penchant for saying controversial things about the 2020 election, the January 6 insurrection, the coronavirus and vaccines, Democrats seem to be just as happy running against the two-term Republican as they would be if he retired and this were an open seat. Only 35% of Wisconsin voters viewed Johnson favorably in a Marquette University Law School poll from mid-August, while 42% viewed him unfavorably. But his lowest net favorability was in November 2015, the year before he came from behind to win a second term. Republicans point to that 2016 election to argue that Johnson, who previously promised to serve only two terms, has been discounted before. While ambitious Republicans wait in the wings to see what Johnson will do, Democrats have a very crowded field. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes recently picked up a high-profile progressive endorsement in Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Nearly a year after Biden won Arizona and Democrat Mark Kelly unseated GOP Sen. Martha McSally, Republicans are still litigating the 2020 election here. Attorney General Mark Brnovich had earned Trump\u2019s ire for not doing enough to audit the state\u2019s election results, despite there being no evidence of fraud. \u201cHopefully he\u2019s going to do what everybody knows has to be done,\u201d Trump said of the attorney general at a late June rally in the state. Since then, Brnovich has leaned into the partisan review pushed by the GOP-led state Senate, threatening to withhold funds from Maricopa County because he alleged the county\u2019s supervisors did not fully respond to a subpoena for the so-called audit. And earlier this month, Brnovich announced the state is suing the Biden administration for \u201cfederal overreach\u201d over the President\u2019s vaccine mandates. Meanwhile, a super PAC supporting Blake Masters, the president of the Thiel Foundation, went up with an ad earlier this month hitting Brnovich for \u201csaying President Trump is wrong on voter fraud\u201d and \u201cmaking excuses instead of standing with our president.\u201d Democrats are happy to have Republicans attacking each other \u2013 and pushing each other to the right \u2013 as Kelly wracks up money. They\u2019re hoping that 2020 election denialism, while perhaps an important litmus test in the GOP primary, will be unpalatable to general election voters next November. Republicans, however, contend that issues like immigration will be of far greater importance next fall, which is why they\u2019ve been attacking Kelly on the border and trying to use fellow Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema as a moderate foil to make him look too liberal. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) Trump endorsed in the GOP primary to replace retiring Sen. Richard Burr back in June, throwing his support behind Rep. Ted Budd in a surprise announcement in front of other contenders. But former Gov. Pat McCrory and former Rep. Mark Walker aren\u2019t backing down. Meanwhile, the political arm of the Conservative Club for Growth, which has stood by Budd since helping him emerge from a 17-way House primary in 2016, is taking the airwaves to attack McCrory, arguing that he cannot win because he lost reelection in 2016 when Trump won the state. Walker has tried to make a similar argument about McCrory, while both he and McCrory have piled on Budd. Trump carried the Tar Heel State by just over a point in 2020, making this potentially competitive terrain even if Republicans start with the early advantage. State Sen. Jeff Jackson, who\u2019s been in the race since January, had raised the most money on the Democratic side by the end of the second quarter. But former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who joined the race in late April, raised $1.3 million during the second quarter. Besides EMILY\u2019s List, she has the backing of Higher Heights PAC, which works to elect progressive Black women, and the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus, reflecting the enthusiasm for a non-White male candidate helping turn out minority voters in a non-presidential year, especially in some of the rural areas where Republicans have continued to hold an advantage. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan As Republicans grow more excited about Gov. Chris Sununu possibly running for Senate, Democrats are finding more reasons to argue that electing a Republican at the federal level in New Hampshire isn\u2019t the same as electing one to serve in Concord. They\u2019re largely turning to abortion to make that case, highlighting a budget the governor signed that included abortion restrictions and the Executive Council\u2019s recent vote to defund Planned Parenthood and family planning providers. (Sununu does not have a vote on the council and called the vote \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d in a statement.) Despite the state trending blue at the federal level, Republicans are convinced that first-term Sen. Maggie Hassan is highly vulnerable, and both sides admit this race isn\u2019t likely to look like 2020, when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen won reelection by nearly 16 points. But Sununu keeps pushing back his timeline for making a decision about running, so, for now, Hassan has the race largely to herself. She released her first TV ad earlier this month \u2013 a positive spot that touches on her father\u2019s service in World War II and her own work for veterans. Even if the governor doesn\u2019t run, however, Hassan could have a strong challenger in former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, whom the Democrat beat by just over 1,000 votes in 2016. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto finally has a high-profile opponent in former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, whom national Republicans had long eyed as the top challenger but who officially launched his campaign at the end of August. He\u2019s the rare GOP candidate who was recruited by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and has Trump\u2019s endorsement, making it more likely he\u2019ll have the GOP field mostly to himself as other ambitious Republicans jockey for the gubernatorial nomination. As Tump\u2019s campaign co-chair in the Silver State, Laxalt followed the former President\u2019s lead on false charges of voter fraud, for which Trump praised him in offering his endorsement last month, and he\u2019s already made some noise about filing lawsuits in 2022. Democrats are hoping his embrace of Trump\u2019s election fraud narrative will help tie him to the former President and turn off voters in a state that Biden carried last fall. His position on abortion could be also be litigated in the general election, especially since Nevada has a history of GOP leaders who have been more supportive of abortion rights, like former GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval. Democrats hope to argue that Laxalt is out of touch with voters on the issue. Still, Biden only carried the Silver State by just over 2 points, and Cortez Masto is running for her first reelection, so Democrats aren\u2019t taking anything for granted here, especially with an uncertain post-pandemic electorate. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio GOP Sen. Marco Rubio starts with the advantage in this state that Trump carried by 3 points last year. But Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who outraised Rubio in the second quarter, is proving to be a strong fundraiser who could give the Republican senator a real race. Rubio is trying to tie Demings to \u201cthe socialist squad\u201d and Democrats\u2019 physical and human infrastructure bills. (Rubio voted against the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill in the Senate last month.) Demings has attacked Rubio for traveling to Iowa late last month while Florida is dealing with the Delta variant surge. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) GOP Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s decision to retire has opened up a crowded GOP primary, with most contenders trying to \u201coutTrump\u201d each other in a state the former President won by 8 points. State Sen. Matt Dolan, who entered the race this week, cuts a more moderate profile. He supports the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Portman negotiated, according to an interview with Cleveland.com, and has been critical of Trump\u2019s election lies. But it\u2019s unclear how much traction he can get in a GOP primary where the former President\u2019s influence is king with the base. Trump already attacked Dolan, whose family owns Cleveland\u2019s baseball team, for \u201ccancel culture\u201d because they decided to change the team\u2019s name. Former state treasurer Josh Mandel has been courting that conservative base hard, attacking refugees despite his own family history. JD Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d has been leading in earned media attention and is wracking up endorsements from conservative leaders like Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, the chair of the largest conservative caucus in the House. Those endorsements could help compensate for his prior criticism of Trump, which his opponents are eager to use against him. Former state party chair Jane Timken, businessmen Mike Gibbons and Bernie Moreno are also running. On the Democratic side, Rep. Tim Ryan recently got a challenge from his left in Morgan Harper, who\u2019s arguing that she can drive the minority turnout needed to turn Ohio blue. Harper lost a 2020 primary challenge to Rep. Joyce Beatty, who\u2019s now the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and has backed Ryan. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) Missouri continues to occupy the 10th spot on this list because of the chance that the Republican nominee to replace retiring Sen. Roy Blunt will give Democrats an opening. But it would be a massively uphill climb for Democrats to flip this seat blue in a state that Trump won by 15 points. Their best hope is former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, winning the GOP nomination and creating a Todd Akin situation. The 2012 Senate nominee\u2019s \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost Republicans the Missouri Senate seat and imperiled GOP nominees across the country. Greitens, who has been picking up endorsements from Trump world \u2013 recently former national security adviser Michael Flynn, for example \u2013 hardly has the field to himself. Attorney General Eric Schmitt is running, with his super PAC allies leaning into his suit against mask mandates in schools to tout his candidacy. Reps. Billy Long and Vicky Hartzler are also running, as is Mark McCloskey, whom the Republican governor pardoned last month after he and his wife had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges for pointing guns at protesters near their home last summer. While GOP voters will have plenty of candidates to choose from, more candidates means a more splintered vote, which could lower the threshold it takes for Greitens to win the nomination.",

            "article_content": "The closely watched California gubernatorial recall election on Tuesday is poised to send precisely the opposite political message that its proponents initially intended. It was a strong gust of discontent in the state\u2019s most conservative regions last year over Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s stringent measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic that allowed the recall to qualify for the ballot at all. But now a swell of support in the broader statewide electorate for the more recent steps Newsom has taken to combat the Delta variant outbreak \u2013 particularly the vaccine mandates he\u2019s imposed for educators, health care workers and state employees \u2013 has positioned him for a potentially resounding victory, according to the latest polls. Recall proponents had hoped to demonstrate the political potency of the backlash against tough Covid regulations and discourage other states from implementing them; instead, the race now seems more likely to embolden Democrats in California and beyond by documenting the existence of a new \u201csilent majority\u201d of vaccinated Americans ready for tougher measures against the minority of adults who have resisted the shot. \u201cWhat we were able to do is take the governor\u2019s clear national leadership on vaccine mandates and drive it as the core contrast in the election,\u201d says Sean Clegg, a strategist for the Newsom campaign. \u201cI hope what we\u2019ve shown Democrats \u2026 is to embrace [mandates] as a partisan question, put up our dukes and get Republicans on the wrong side of the fence on this thing.\u201d How a sharp contrast on Covid has reshaped the California recall race Solidly blue California may be uniquely favorable terrain for Democrats to contest this argument. But Newsom\u2019s success in gaining the upper hand over the recall by leaning into his support for vaccine mandates may be seen in retrospect as a turning point in the Democratic approach to the pandemic. Already, Gov. Phil Murphy and Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidates in this November\u2019s New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races, have also emphatically embraced mandates \u2013 and sharpened their contrast on the issue with their GOP opponents, who are rejecting them. Most dramatically, President Joe Biden last week pivoted from a strategy of relying primarily on inducements and persuasion to increase vaccination rates to a more confrontational approach centered on proposals to require health care workers and employees at larger firms to obtain the vaccine or undergo weekly testing. Almost uniformly, Republicans have condemned these mandate proposals, with a succession of GOP governors promising to sue Biden once he finalizes his plan. But rather than shrinking from this fight, more Democrats appear to welcome it, believing that Republicans are isolating themselves by agitating so unreservedly for the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cchoices\u201d of the one-quarter of adults who remain unvaccinated when the three-fourths of adults who have received at least one dose are increasingly exasperated with them, polls show. A substantial win for Newsom on Tuesday would likely solidify the resolve among many Democrats that mask and vaccine mandates represent a sound strategy not only for public health but also the next elections. \u201cAround the issue of mandates there is a lot of support because people want this thing to be over,\u201d says Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, which conducts regular statewide surveys. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going to allow us to go back to a situation where we\u2019re not in fear of getting and spreading this disease. And I think a lot of Democrats and a lot of moderate voters in California, are saying, \u2018If it\u2019s mandates, then so be it.\u2019 \u201c Even if Newsom survives the recall election, the process could still signal some looming problems for Democrats. A big Election Day surge of GOP voters reluctant to vote by mail could produce a somewhat tighter finish than polls are forecasting. Democrats have been hurt in previous midterm elections by lagging turnout among young people and Latinos, two key party constituencies, and early returns show they are returning ballots at much lower rates than other groups in California; some, though not all, polls have also shown Newsom\u2019s support among Latinos eroding compared with his initial 2018 victory. \u201cThe data that we have worked off of illustrates that there is something happening in the Latino community in California that is not receptive to the traditional Democratic playbook and the buttons that they are used to pushing,\u201d says former California GOP Chairman Ron Nehring, who is now advising former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, one of the Republicans running to replace Newsom. Yet a Newsom victory at anywhere near the level that polls are now indicating would underscore the continuing obstacles Republicans face with the voters who compose the core of the modern Democratic coalition not only in California but also nationally: young people, non-White voters and college-educated Whites, particularly those in each group concentrated in the largest metropolitan areas. Especially telling is how Newsom\u2019s Covid response has evolved from his greatest vulnerability to his most powerful motivator for that Democratic coalition. What you need to know about the California recall \u201cThis is the Covid election, and it has been from the beginning,\u201d says Dan Schnur, a former Republican communications adviser who teaches political communications at the University of Southern California and the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t exist without Covid, and assuming Newsom survives, it\u2019ll be because of Covid.\u201d Conservatives had launched multiple efforts to recall Newsom even before the pandemic struck last year, focusing on issues such as taxes, crime and undocumented immigration. But those efforts all foundered until Covid \u2013 and Newsom himself \u2013 provided a bolt of lightning. Last November, while the state was still largely in lockdown, the governor attended a dinner for a close political ally at the exclusive Napa Valley restaurant French Laundry; almost simultaneously a state judge, citing the logistical challenges Covid created, gave recall proponents more time to gather enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Newsom\u2019s ill-advised dinner \u2013 at a time when his children were already attending an in-person private school \u2013 crystallized enough frustration over the state\u2019s lengthy lockdowns and shifting policies to attract national Republicans to pour in fundraising help to the recall effort, and with the added time and resources, proponents met California\u2019s low bar to qualify the recall. (To qualify for the ballot, the state requires a recall to attract signatures equal to just 12% of the votes in the previous governor\u2019s election, the lowest level necessary in any of the 19 states with recall laws for governors.) \u201cThere were several recall attempts at Newsom earlier in his term, but none of them really went anywhere until you had Covid,\u201d says Nehring. \u201cIt was \u2026 the frustration with that erratic response that helped drive the recall to qualify.\u201d With the recall drawing its strength from voters opposed to Newsom\u2019s stringent Covid measures, the governor initially sought to emphasize the state\u2019s movement away from those restrictions. As vaccines became widely available, he set June 15 as a reopening day for the state, lifted most public health mandates and regularly touted what he called \u201cthe California comeback.\u201d \u201cWe had a trajectory that looked very good for us in the sense that Biden was talking about Independence Day [as a turning point], we had a clear stake in the ground to open the state on June 15, people\u2019s attitudes were improving \u2026 and in May and June there was a pervasive feeling of optimism,\u201d says Clegg, the strategist for Newsom\u2019s campaign. But the Covid surge driven by the Delta variant early this summer upended those plans. Once Delta emerged, Clegg says, the optimistic message of moving beyond Covid increasingly seemed \u201ctone deaf\u201d to the growing public concern, as well as to the public health reality of caseloads and hospitalization numbers that were again rapidly rising. In response, Newsom made a fateful policy and political pivot. Following recommendations from his health advisers, Newsom imposed new mandates for vaccinations or regular testing on state employees and health care workers in late July, and a first-in-the-nation requirement for all K-12 teachers and staff in early August. In July he also imposed a statewide requirement for indoor mask-wearing at K-12 schools (while leaving implementation to local school boards). And he moved his support for those mandates \u2013 and the opposition to them from all the leading GOP candidates \u2013 to the center of his messaging against the recall, both in television advertising and public appearances. Leaning into tough vaccine mandates amid a recall that was initially boosted by opposition to his stringent Covid responses represented a political gamble for Newsom. But unless all of the latest polls in the state are spectacularly wrong, it\u2019s a gamble that has paid off \u2013 with potentially broad implications for the national debate over vaccine mandates. Newsom\u2019s response to the Delta wave, says Clegg, \u201ccreated a new line of scrimmage\u201d in the contest that shifted the advantage toward the governor. Polls suggest the debate over mandates has helped to solve the greatest problem Newsom always faced in the recall: the risk that Democrats \u2013 who outnumber Republicans in the state by about 2 to 1 \u2013 would slumber through it. That danger was underscored by a late July poll from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California (Berkeley) that sent shock waves through the state by showing nearly half of likely voters backing the recall and Republicans far more engaged than Democrats. Now the latest surveys from Berkeley and the Public Policy Institute of California have found about three-fifths of likely voters opposing the recall and Democrats far more engaged than earlier this year. Five places to watch in the California recall Newsom\u2019s huge spending blitz on advertising and organizing partly explains that shift, but California analysts also point to the governor\u2019s success at converting the race primarily into a referendum on his policies to combat Covid. What were for Republican voters \u201cthe reasons to remove the governor became for the Democrats the reason to keep him,\u201d says Baldassare. \u201cFor Democratic voters \u2026 the Delta variant wave has created a sense of urgency and importance to this [recall] that it otherwise would not have had.\u201d Nehring believes the pivot point in the race wasn\u2019t the governor\u2019s embrace of Covid mandates, but the emergence of firebrand conservative talk radio host Larry Elder as the front-runner in the GOP field. \u201cWhat helped Gavin Newsom regain his footing is Larry Elder, more than anything else,\u201d Nehring says. \u201cYou can literally see the trend line shift when Elder gets in the race and becomes the leading alternative. That forced people to reconsider how they would vote on [recalling Newsom]. Republicans were already energized against Newsom. But when Larry Elder got in the race it served to energize the Democrats.\u201d But others note that, even amid all of Elder\u2019s other conservative positions that present tempting targets in left-leaning California, Newsom has focused above all on the opposition from him (and the other top GOP contenders) to mask and vaccine mandates, while linking them to GOP Govs. Ron DeSantis in Florida and Greg Abbott in Texas, who have aggressively fought such requirements. \u201cDespite the fact that Elder is to the right of most Californians on many issues, it\u2019s his approach to the pandemic that has helped Newsom more than anything,\u201d says Schnur. \u201cNewsom isn\u2019t just running against Larry Elder and Donald Trump; he\u2019s running against Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis. He\u2019s framed this as a choice not just between two candidates but between two very different approaches the states have taken in response to the pandemic.\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis threatens to fine state counties and cities over vaccine mandates That\u2019s clearly struck a chord, most powerfully for Democratic voters, but also for many independents (most of whom oppose the recall in the latest surveys) and even a sliver of Republicans. Both the latest Public Policy Institute of California and Berkeley polls found Newsom winning about two-thirds of likely voters who have been vaccinated, and the latter survey found that only about one-third of voters now say the state is doing \u201ctoo much\u201d to combat the coronavirus, the complaint that initially boosted the recall. That\u2019s roughly the same meager share of the vote that Trump won in California while losing the state by more than 5 million votes. Maybe the most striking thing about Newsom\u2019s revival is that it\u2019s come even as the Public Policy Institute of California surveys have found that the share of Californians who believe the state is on the wrong track has increased. That defies the usual laws of political gravity, which hold that incumbents almost always decline as \u201cwrong track\u201d rises. Newsom\u2019s reversal of that trend points to his success at focusing voters\u2019 attention not only on his own performance and current conditions but also on what Republicans would do if given power in the state, particularly in responding to the persistent coronavirus outbreak. What California's homelessness crisis has to do with the recall effort against Gavin Newsom Newsom\u2019s ability to shift voters\u2019 attention toward the GOP alternative may present the race\u2019s most important lesson for other Democrats. In the most immediate sense, despite all the visibility of vaccine opponents, he may offer more evidence that the GOP leaders almost uniformly condemning vaccine mandates are playing to the short side of public opinion. Even if California is particularly favorable terrain to contest that argument, the latest CNN national poll conducted by SRSS found roughly 55% majorities supporting vaccine mandates for students, office workers and attendance at large events such as concerts or sporting events. On each front, mandate support rose to about 70% among adults who have been vaccinated; that included more than 40% of vaccinated Republicans, according to figures provided by CNN\u2019s polling unit. More broadly, a solid Newsom victory might move the needle in the internal Democratic debate over how to run in 2022. The dominant view in the White House and the party leadership is that Democrats should run next year primarily by stressing their legislative successes: the new programs for infrastructure, clean energy, education and health care, as well as the expanded tax assistance for families with children, that they hope to pass this fall. A minority view in the party says Democrats are more likely to prevent the usual midterm turnout falloff among voters in the president\u2019s party by stressing what Republicans will do if they regain power. Clegg says Newsom\u2019s recovery in the recall lays down a clear marker for the latter approach: \u201cWe really did wake up this blue giant, and that\u2019s what we have to do in 2022.\u201d Clegg wants Democrats to focus next year not only on the Republican opposition to mask and vaccine requirements for Covid but also on the risk that a congressional GOP majority would take steps that could allow Trump or another Republican nominee to steal the 2024 presidential election. \u201cPut me,\u201d he says, \u201cviolently in the camp that says Democrats really need to make this cycle about the stakes if these guys win.\u201d More Democrats may join him there if Newsom decisively turns back the recall on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Earlier this year, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom was searching for the right message to convince disengaged Democrats to vote against the effort to oust him in Tuesday\u2019s recall election, it would have been impossible to imagine a more perfect foil than conservative talk radio host Larry Elder. In this deep blue state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2 to 1 and only one governor has successfully been recalled, few progressive voters had viewed the recall of their governor as a real possibility until late July, when the polls tightened. The Delta coronavirus variant was taking hold, angering many vaccinated Californians, who had thought the worst was behind them. And Elder, who had announced his candidacy earlier that month, emerged as Newsom\u2019s chief opponent, promising that one of his first acts would be to eliminate the governor\u2019s mandate for state workers to get vaccinated or else face weekly testing. Many Democratic voters in a state that President Joe Biden won by nearly 30 points had not engaged or paid much attention as Newsom made an amorphous argument that the recall was an attempted Republican takeover by acolytes of former President Donald Trump and a symbol of the enduring hold of \u201cTrumpism.\u201d   But in Elder, Newsom gained a direct target who he could argue was \u201cto the right of Donald Trump\u201d and who would take California \u201coff the Covid cliff,\u201d citing the experiences of Florida and Texas and their conservative anti-mask-mandate governors as the model Elder would follow in responding to the pandemic. Elder\u2019s long history on the radio and as a columnist provided reams of controversial statements for opposition researchers and journalists to scrutinize on other topics, like his disparaging comments about women \u2013 a key demographic for Newsom. The sharp contrast between Newsom and Elder, specifically on managing the virus, allowed the Democratic governor to crystallize the choice for his party\u2019s voters. He sounded the alarm that because of California\u2019s unusual recall rules, it would take a majority to recall him on the ballot\u2019s first question, but that if that effort succeeded, his replacement could be chosen by a small fraction of voters. (On the ballot\u2019s second question, voters are choosing from a list of more than 40 candidates, and Elder has maintained a wide lead within that field). Elder\u2019s threat changed the Newsom strategy \u2013 and the trajectory of the race. \u201cThere was a growing sense amongst political insiders that the anti-recall campaign\u2019s focus on Donald Trump as the evil force we had to defeat was losing traction,\u201d said Democratic strategist Darry Sragow, who is the publisher of the California Target Book, which tracks election and campaign finance data in the state. \u201cThen his alter ego shows up in a state where Donald Trump got about a third of the vote. \u2026 Somebody smiled on Gavin Newsom and presented California voters with the opportunity to listen to Larry Elder.\u201d California Democrats were aghast once they began hearing Elder\u2019s past remarks about women, his endorsement of pregnancy discrimination, his opposition to abortion rights and the minimum wage, and his skepticism of the climate crisis, among many other topics. But Democrats recoiled most virulently from his views on Covid and his opposition to mask and vaccine mandates \u2013 positions that are sharply at odds with the majority of Californians, including many independents and some Republicans. At the same time that Covid cases in children were growing at an exponential rate and hospitals in some Southern states were once again filling up with unvaccinated patients, Newsom was able to spend millions on television ads making the case that voters faced a \u201clife or death\u201d choice in the September 14 election. \u201cAfter all the years of hardcore far-right things that Larry had said, that reinforced the threat of what he was saying about Covid,\u201d said veteran California Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. \u201cEverybody believed he meant it.\u201d Anne Dunsmore, the campaign manager for the pro-recall group known as Rescue California, said Newsom\u2019s effort to villainize Elder halted some of the momentum that she had been seeing for the recall effort among voters of all political persuasions: \u201cHe was unsuccessful to that point painting the picture around a face \u2013 \u2018Here\u2019s the face of what you\u2019re going to have if you don\u2019t elect me,\u2019 \u201d she said. But with Elder, she added, Newsom \u201ccast major fear upon the electorate.\u201d Newsom acknowledged Saturday that Elder had helped galvanize and grab the attention of Democrats who might have otherwise skipped the election, calling him \u201cextreme even by extreme standards.\u201d \u201cSo I think people certainly have woken up to that,\u201d Newsom told reporters at a campaign event in Oakland. \u201cLarry Elder certainly makes the contrast with this campaign, this candidacy, much easier to express.\u201d Elder, 69, is vaccinated and claims that he is not \u201canti-vax,\u201d but he also says that the choice unvaccinated people are making should be respected. He has made inaccurate statements about vaccines and masking, including in a recent CNN interview, when he said he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve the science suggests that young people should be vaccinated\u201d or wear masks in school. The talk radio host has suggested that Democrats and the press are using the controversies to distract from what he views as Newsom\u2019s poor record as he blames the governor for steep job losses during the pandemic and the fact that many public school students could not attend class in person. \u201cThis is about California losing business; this is about California losing jobs,\u201d Elder said at a recent news conference. \u201cIt is about our poor government \u2013 schools where our kids were already behind a whole year, now they are behind another year, because Gavin Newsom ignored science and shut down schools even when the (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said that people can go back to school.\u201d For most of his career, Newsom, 53, had always been more tolerated than beloved by Democratic voters. He had championed a bold and forward-leaning agenda on progressive priorities like the climate crisis, universal health care and LGBTQ rights \u2013 entering the national spotlight when he issued the first marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco in 2004. But in interviews, voters often said they had difficulty relating to the impeccably coiffed scion of a politically connected San Francisco family who made millions by building an empire of wineries, restaurants and other businesses in partnership with philanthropist Gordon Getty. Newsom first ran for governor in 2009 but withdrew after failing to gain traction in the polls and raising little money as then-California Attorney General Jerry Brown loomed as the likely heavyweight in the race. Newsom ultimately ran for lieutenant governor, and in a 2018 New Yorker profile he described himself as \u201cundeserving\u201d in that first gubernatorial race. \u201cJerry was the better candidate,\u201d Newsom told the magazine. More seasoned when he ran for governor in 2018, Newsom clobbered GOP businessman John Cox, who is running this year to replace him in the recall, winning with more than 60% of the vote. Brown appeared at a rally with Newsom shortly before that year\u2019s election, praising his \u201cvision\u201d for California, but also joking that he\u2019d be watching from his ranch about an hour from Sacramento: \u201cSo, Gavin, do not screw up.\u201d The 2020 effort to recall the Democratic governor started small \u2013 and initially appeared to have little chance \u2013 when signature gathering began that June by a group of conservative activists who didn\u2019t like Newsom\u2019s positions on immigration, taxes and the death penalty and his handling of the state\u2019s homelessness crisis. But frustration was building among conservatives, business owners and some parents about what they viewed as Newsom\u2019s ever-changing pandemic regulations and shutdowns. In November, recall proponents got a major boost when a judge extended the deadline by four months for them to collect enough signature petitions to qualify for the ballot. That same month, Newsom attended an unmasked birthday dinner at the elite Napa Valley restaurant The French Laundry while urging Californians to stay home and avoid gatherings outside their households to stop the spread of Covid. The now-infamous misstep \u2013 for which Newsom has apologized \u2013 symbolized what many recall proponents disliked about the governor. Dunsmore said that at that point \u201cthe spigots turned on\u201d in both fundraising and signature collections for the pro-recall side. Newsom was their best asset, she said, because so many Californians were angry about what they perceived as his hypocrisy and shifting Covid regulations. \u201cThere was a wave of discontent. He turned it into a tsunami,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just channeled it.\u201d The recall qualified for the ballot in late April and, after many administrative steps, the lieutenant governor in July set the date for the fall election, kicking the recall campaign into high gear. As soon as they had a date, Newsom\u2019s \u201cStop the Republican Recall\u201d campaign joined forces with some 90 labor and community groups to call, text and knock on the doors of millions of voters to educate them about the ballot and the unusual timing of the September election. Newsom raised more than $70 million for the effort, dominating all of the candidates vying to replace him. Under California\u2019s fundraising rules, elected officials who are targeted by recalls are not subject to the contribution or expenditure limits that apply to candidates trying to replace them. All of the state\u2019s more than 22 million registered voters were mailed ballots this summer, and early in-person voting began as soon as September 4 in some areas of the state. More than 8.4 million preelection ballots had been cast as of Monday, according to data from Edison Research, which is 47% of the total votes cast in the state in 2020. Despite some earlier concerns from Democrats about a lack of interest in the election among their voters, they appear to be coming to Newsom\u2019s rescue, with 52% of the preelection ballots cast coming from registered Democratic voters and 25% from registered Republican voters, according to Edison\u2019s data. GOP strategists are counting on Republicans, some of whom have been skeptical of mail-in voting because of Trump\u2019s false claims, voting in person on Election Day. But because Republicans are so outnumbered \u2013 making up just 24.1% of the state\u2019s electorate to Democrats\u2019 46.5%  \u2013 the GOP\u2019s chances of ousting the governor hinge on a huge Republican turnout and meager Democratic participation once all the ballots are counted. That scenario has looked increasingly unlikely. Newsom\u2019s campaign advisers said that in the end, the anti-recall message could be distilled into one thought: that a \u201cyes\u201d vote for the recall meant electing \u201ca pro-Trump, anti-vaccine Republican who was going to reverse the mandates on day one.\u201d Republican strategist Rob Stutzman noted that Elder\u2019s position on vaccine and mask mandates has been at odds even with the views of a fair number of Republican voters. \u201cThe idea of vaccination mandates for health care workers, public employees \u2013 and of mask mandates \u2013 are popular, and even 40% of Republicans, according to a CBS poll a couple weeks ago, support that,\u201d he said, referring to a CBS News/YouGov survey question from August that asked whether a private business or employer should be allowed to mandate vaccines for its employees. More than 4 in 10 Republicans said yes. \u201cSo what Newsom is doing at the moment on Covid sits very well with the majority of voters.\u201d National Democratic leaders, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Vice President Kamala Harris and Biden, flocked to California to help Newsom frame the contrast on Covid, knowing that the recall election is an early test of the White House\u2019s and Democrats\u2019 pandemic management ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cThe eyes of the nation are on California,\u201d Biden said at a rally with Newsom Monday night, repeatedly linking Elder to Trump. It\u2019s a reality Newsom\u2019s team is well aware of. \u201cThe message that should be taken from this campaign is also a very simple message, which is: Don\u2019t be timid on Covid,\u201d said Newsom adviser Ace Smith. \u201cThe governor took bold action on mandates and masks, and the campaign seized on that and used it to literally create a simple decision for voters: \u2018Do you want to be safe? Do you want your communities to be safe? Do you want your schools to stay open?\u2019 \u201c \u201cI believe on Election Day, you\u2019re going to see a clear mandate not only against the recall, but for sanity on something as important as health,\u201d Smith said. Tuesday\u2019s turnout \u2013 and the eventual results \u2013 will prove whether that theory holds.",

            "article_content": "On the day when the United Nations warned Afghans were facing starvation in a country on the verge of total collapse, Washington\u2019s political rivals were fixated on wringing political gain from the chaotic end to the longest US war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken became the first senior Biden administration official to testify to Congress about the hurried, bloody and humiliating US final exit from Kabul last month after two decades of conflict. As an exercise in finding out what went wrong in the war and the withdrawal, the often incoherent and politically charged hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee provided few answers. But it did offer clear pointers to how the Biden administration and its Republican opponents will square off over the war\u2019s messy ending in the coming congressional election year. And it showed \u2013 as was the case during the US withdrawal and years of battle \u2013 that the perception of events in Afghanistan as seen from Washington often differs from the pitiful reality in a failed state again controlled by fundamentalist rulers. The hearing went ahead after the grave state of Afghanistan following the US withdrawal and failed nation building effort came into sharper focus in a warning from UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. The secretary general said that Afghans were facing the \u201ccollapse of an entire country\u201d and, as a severe drought bites, were already experiencing \u201cone of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\u201d \u201cToday, one in three Afghans do not know where their next meal will come from. The poverty rate is spiraling, and basic public services are close to collapse,\u201d Guterres warned at a UN aid conference in Geneva, a grim a reminder that as US leaders engage in political point scoring over a lost US conflict, Afghans remain cursed by the dire consequences of the US departure and decades of war before that. The hearing, set to be followed by Blinken\u2019s appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, represented a test for the secretary of state and his capacity to blunt political criticism of President Joe Biden over the US pullout. The deaths of 13 US service personnel in a suicide bombing outside Kabul\u2019s airport, along with dozens of Afghans, crystalized the spectacle of a retreat from the country. The chaotic withdrawal saw Biden\u2019s assurances of a safe and stable departure repeatedly confounded, helping to damage the President\u2019s political standing. Republicans sought to build on that perception of a crisis of competence at the hearing with searing attacks on the administration, as the GOP forges a narrative of a weak White House that surrenders to terrorists \u2013 following the lead of ex-President Donald Trump as he tries to revive his own political fortunes. While there was some tepid Democratic criticism of the administration\u2019s record, the hearing was mostly an example of how the hyper partisanship of current politics \u2013 whichever party is in control \u2013 is hardly conducive to Congress\u2019 role of providing accountability and oversight of the White House. In many ways, Blinken\u2019s performance mirrored that of Biden himself after the fall of Kabul necessitated an emergency evacuation that rescued more than 120,000 US citizens and Afghans who helped US forces over the 20-year war. He apportioned plenty of blame. But he made few admissions that the administration itself erred. In fact, the secretary of state left the impression that the evacuation could hardly have gone better, terming it \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Blinken also rebuked the Trump administration for its deal with the Taliban last year, which he said set the US on an inexorable path to a withdrawal. \u201cWe inherited a deadline. We did not inherit a plan,\u201d Blinken said, in a reference to Trump\u2019s agreement last year to get all troops out by May 1, a timeline that Biden extended by four months. Blinken\u2019s statements were anchored in fact. But they also ignored the fact that Biden has reversed many other Trump foreign policies and had been in office for seven months when the Afghan evacuation took place. The secretary of state argued that there had been no indication that the Afghan army, under Taliban assault, would collapse in as little as 11 days. And he said that there was no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces \u201cany more resilient or self-sustaining.\u201d Regarding the slow pace of the operation to process Afghan special immigrant visas, he blamed the Trump administration and its hardline immigration policy. After entering the hearing under heavy political pressure, it appeared Blinken mostly weathered the storm. His experience in a past life as a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer prepared him well as he flattered his questioners, even Republicans who denounced the administration\u2019s conduct. Blinken also argued against the idea advanced by some military strategists that the US could have stayed in Afghanistan for longer with a small garrison, saying that such a move would have led to clashes with the Taliban and American troops being killed. Most controversially, Blinken claimed that had Biden extended the mission, he would have effectively \u201creupped the war in Afghanistan for another five, 10 or 20 years.\u201d The comment was the latest sign of a tactical assumption by the Biden administration that while the American people may not have been impressed by the chaotic end to 20 years of war, there was vast public support for bringing home all troops out of harm\u2019s way two decades after the September 11 attacks. Republicans largely tried to create an impression that everything that went wrong in the evacuation was down to Biden\u2019s management, rather than the corrosive impact of a 20-year war that had been going poorly for years. They also ignored the fact that Trump and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had set the stage for the US exit with a deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban prisoners and in many ways locked in Biden \u2013 a fact that the ex-President has publicly boasted about. The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, accused the Biden team of presiding over \u201can unmitigated disaster of epic proportions.\u201d He said later on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d that some of the US\u2019 Afghan allies who were left behind by the evacuation had already been executed by the Taliban. \u201cThe American people don\u2019t like to lose, especially not to the terrorists. But this is exactly what has happened,\u201d said McCaul, coining a line likely to be heard often during the midterm election campaign next year. The committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, sought to head off many of the Republican attacks in his opening statement, even while expressing concern for those Americans and Afghan allies of the US armed forces who wanted to leave. \u201cAre there things the administration could have done differently?\u201d Meeks asked. \u201cAbsolutely, yes as always,\u201d he said, but added that he had not heard any \u201cclean withdrawal option\u201d that would work in Afghanistan. At times, the hearing degenerated into the kind of political sideshow that often overtakes such testimony by senior officials, as members of Congress played to the camera. GOP Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry slammed Blinken for not appearing in person in the hearing room. \u201cOh, couldn\u2019t be bothered to come down here and see Congress, alright, that\u2019s great,\u201d Perry said. Meeks said that Blinken \u2013 who testified over a video link from the State Department \u2013 was not obliged to appear in person since the hearing was a hybrid event. Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia meanwhile blasted Republican attacks on Blinken as a \u201csalad mix of selective\u201d facts. Blinken can expect another rough ride when he appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. The Democratic chairman of the panel, Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday that his hearing would be one of a number that would get to the \u201ctruth.\u201d \u201cI believe that the exit was poorly executed,\u201d Menendez said, though qualified his remark by saying the Biden team was handed a \u201cbad situation\u201d by Trump. Biden is also set to face an investigation from within his own party over one tragic aspect of the US withdrawal \u2013 an airstrike in Kabul last month \u2013 by Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee. The strike killed 10 civilian members of the same family including seven children, a relative of the dead told CNN. At the time, US Central Command said that it carried out what it called a defensive airstrike on a car, targeting a suspected ISIS-K suicide bomber who posed an \u201cimminent\u201d threat to the airport. A House Intelligence Committee official told CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb Monday that Schiff plans to examine the airstrike following investigations by the Washington Post and the New York Times that raised doubt about claims the vehicle contained explosives.",

            "article_content": "America went into battle on September 11, 2001, united in defense of its values and way of life. Twenty years on, it is at war with itself, its democracy threatened from within in a way Osama bin Laden never managed. In the moment, the 9/11 attacks that came from a blue sky on a crisp, clear morning stretched credulity in their horror and dastardly conception and proved that vast oceans could no longer shield the US from the terror of the outside world. But for a few weeks at least, everyone \u2013 liberal, conservative, no matter the race or creed \u2013 was as one in mourning nearly 3,000 dead and fearing more strikes. In hindsight, however, the attacks heralded the dawn of an era of political trauma and turbulence that snuffed out a brief period when a prosperous US had basked in a post-Cold War glow of peace, standing as a lone superpower. History gives events clarity that they lacked in real time. But it cannot record the pain, panic and disorientation of those terrible, aching days after 9/11 that drove the decisions of political leaders. In retrospect, it\u2019s now clear that despite the heroism of thousands of troops killed or maimed in post-9/11 wars, the excesses of the US political response caused as much, if not more, upheaval as the attacks themselves. September 11, 2001, doesn\u2019t explain everything. But the war on terror took America in a political direction from which there was no coming back. A sharp, successful war in Afghanistan bogged down into a 20-year quagmire that ended only last month. Another war in Iraq, fought on false pretenses, was its own early version of a Big Lie. A new government security state designed to thwart follow-on attacks endures. Trust in Washington was buckled by vast surveillance programs. America\u2019s name was soiled by torture. The judicial war on terror stretched the Constitution. President George W. Bush went from being a champion on the rubble at Ground Zero to a leader destroyed by his own war. His successor, Barack Obama, spent two terms struggling to bring the anti-terror campaign within the law and international morality, but his use of lethal drone strikes to take out terror targets also caused civilian casualties and was condemned by human rights advocates. All the while, the thousands of deaths and injuries in foreign wars, the trillions of dollars spent on nation building, fury at Washington elites and prejudice against Islam brewed a pool of resentment ripe for a demagogue. And along came Donald Trump, vowing to ban Muslims from entering the US and boasting he was smarter than all the generals who led years of draining combat. The political wounds of the post-9/11 years were exposed yet again in recent days, as the chaotic final withdrawal from Kabul brought history full circle: The fundamentalist Taliban \u2013 who welcomed al Qaeda \u2013 rule Afghanistan again. Bin Laden \u2013 who sent suicide hijackers to steer fuel-laden jetliners at icons of US political, economic and military power \u2013 believed the US was corrupt, weak and immoral. But even he would be surprised to observe the bitter internal estrangement he helped to unleash. A walk through the lush, grassy avenues between the graves of America\u2019s post-9/11 war dead in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery \u2013 within sight of the flight path of the hijacked jet that screeched into the Pentagon \u2013 poses a haunting question: Was the war on terror worth the cost? Rows of white headstones \u2013 some bearing tokens like unit badges, photos or even bottles of beer \u2013 commemorate those lost in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire of two decades of American war have no memorials in Washington. Robert Gates, the former Bush and Obama defense secretary, reflected Thursday on what had been won and lost. \u201cNobody on September 12, 2001, would have dreamed that we would go 20 years without another major attack on the United States,\u201d Gates said at an Aspen Security Forum event. \u201cBy the same token, I think that the costs of these wars in lives lost, in lives changed forever on the part of our military and many of our civilians who served and the cost to the country in terms of treasure and everything else have been enormous.\u201d In the furor over the mismanaged withdrawal from Afghanistan, it was often forgotten that the first battles of the war on terror succeeded, as the US crushed al Qaeda \u2013 though bin Laden escaped through Tora Bora\u2019s caves. \u201cGoing into Afghanistan for its stated purposes at the time made it worth it,\u201d said Obama\u2019s former Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, arguing at a Bipartisan Policy Center forum that three administrations had degraded al Qaeda\u2019s capacity to hit the US. While underscoring that it could never be \u201cworth it\u201d to lose a son or daughter in war, Johnson said: \u201cIt was obviously costly, very costly. We ended up in a place where the Taliban is in charge again, but a lot has happened in that 20-year period that I think has made the homeland safer.\u201d But what can be said of the years long after the attacks on New York and the Pentagon and the crash of a plane believed to be heading to the US Capitol brought down by passengers in Pennsylvania? With al Qaeda routed, Americans were still dying in a futile effort to build a functioning Afghan state. Were their deaths in vain in a war that ended in US defeat? Was their service betrayed by political leaders? Tony Brooks \u2013 who served as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 insisted that despite the recent US exit, the sacrifices of those who served gifted freedom to a generation of Afghans, citing the case of any young girl there. \u201cShe lived her life for 20 years. To say it\u2019s all for nothing is just discarding the children and the women of Afghanistan, in my opinion,\u201d Brooks said. Brooks, who left college and joined up after 9/11, also pointed out that the burdens of the war on terror were not equally shared and said media coverage did not fully reflect the reality of losses across the country. \u201cThese wars were very unique in the fact that they were 100% volunteer,\u201d said Brooks, adding that the fighting happened in the \u201cshadows\u201d and got news coverage only when something went wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t think (the troops) were ever honored, to be honest, ever. Because of the all-volunteer army, it was easy to dismiss. If we were forcing people to go it would be a different story.\u201d President Joe Biden understood the toll inflicted on small towns and cities across America \u2013 one that undoubtably factored into the politics of the last 20 years. \u201cHow many thousands more of America\u2019s daughters and sons are you willing to risk?\u201d he asked when explaining his decision to leave Afghanistan. \u201cHow long would you have them stay? Would you send your own son or daughter?\u201d If the 9/11 attacks were a failure of imagination by US authorities \u2013 who would have thought a terror gang armed only with box cutters could humble a superpower? \u2013 Iraq was a case of overimagination, as political leaders shocked by the mass casualties of 9/11 fretted about what a tyrant with nuclear weapons could do. But the Bush administration\u2019s invasion was also an example of US hubris, as it sought new targets after al Qaeda. The failure to find weapons of mass destruction, the miscalculation that the US troops would be greeted as liberators instead of targets for insurgents and the malfunctioning Iran-influenced state that the US left behind dealt a devastating blow to trust in government \u2013 and the credibility of the mainstream media, which was insufficiently skeptical about the war. Further, the power vacuum left in the wake of dictator Saddam Hussein\u2019s overthrow, capture and execution spawned a terror group more ruthless than al Qaeda: ISIS. These were all factors that thickened the stew of mistrust Trump later exploited. Without the disaster of Iraq, America might not yet have had its first Black president. Back when he was still an Illinois state lawmaker, Obama said he was not a pacifist but opposed \u201cdumb wars.\u201d The message resonated in 2008, and his creed of hope offered relief from the Bush years, when the post-9/11 wars were going bad. And if Obama had not been in the Oval Office, Trump would have lacked fuel for a backlash campaign rooted in the racist claim that the 44th President was not born in the United States. But in 2016, Trump also touched a national mood, channeling supporters who believed that the political, economic, military and media establishments ignored a great swath of a hurting country. Trump ran as a classic strongman, exploiting weariness with 9/11 wars, hollowed-out rural economies and a feeling that the world was taking America for a free ride. His call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslim immigration played on suspicion of outsiders left over from 9/11 and mirrored his demonization of Mexican immigrants. His claim that he was spied on by the Obama administration would have found less traction but for revelations about government surveillance by Edward Snowden. Where Obama outlawed torture, Trump championed it. After Obama built bridges with the Muslim world, his successor complained that the US didn\u2019t steal the oil in Iraq. \u201cYou have to fight fire with fire,\u201d Trump said, backing waterboarding. \u201cWe have to be so strong. We have to fight so viciously. And violently, because we\u2019re dealing with violent people.\u201d In retrospect, Trump\u2019s rhetoric foreshadowed his introduction of violence into political debate, which culminated in his incitement of the mob that invaded the US Capitol inspired by his lies about election fraud. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor, said Trump fused elements of the new security state \u2013 like a tough Department of Homeland Security and torture of terror suspects \u2013 into his own brand. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to draw a direct line from the reaction to 9/11 to Trump, but he weaponized the illiberal policies and attitudes that flourished in those years,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cHe takes all those seeds disseminated in those years and he puts them in a package of authoritarian-style politics.\u201d Twenty years on, the emotive power of September 11 has eased, though not for the bereaved. And small moments can bring memories of that day of infamy rushing back \u2013 like the glint of an airliner flying above city skyscrapers or a watch showing 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. A generation of Americans has grown up in the world that 9/11 made. Babies born weeks after the attacks are now college sophomores. Some of the first Americans to fight have now sent their own kids to foreign battlefields. Bush once warned of a multigenerational struggle against terrorism. But climate change and the rise of China are now seen as bigger threats. And the most acute danger from terrorists is now homegrown. Al Qaeda may have failed to hit the Capitol, but the building was attacked by extremists who confirmed government warnings that White supremacy is now the country\u2019s top terrorism threat. After 9/11, America united to defend itself. It failed to do the same when confronted by a president who mounted an assault on democracy. Divides also cleaved the country in another national crisis \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic, which kills more people every two days than died on September 11, 2001. If a new 9/11 happens, it\u2019s difficult to believe the national and political unity forged by the first one would be repeated. Beyond politics, and as he contemplates 9/11 on the 20th anniversary, Brooks \u2013 who now practices chiropractic medicine and authored a book, \u201cLeave No Man Behind,\u201d about his wartime service \u2013 laments a loss of national togetherness. \u201cThat was the most unifying event in my lifetime, and since then it felt like every major event that happens in the world just divides us even more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same world, where the mission was greater than self. It was all about us, not me. I think right now it\u2019s about me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "California voters head to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Millions of voters have already cast their ballots \u2013 all registered voters in the state were mailed one \u2013 and so far, Democrats have outpaced their registration advantage in the overwhelmingly blue state. But Republicans are counting on doing better on Election Day because of their party\u2019s preference for voting in-person. The first and only successful gubernatorial recall in the state was in 2003, when Californians voted to oust Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and replace him with Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. The grassroots effort to oust Newsom, who was elected in 2018, was launched last year by a group of conservative Californians critical of the Democratic governor\u2019s record on immigration, taxes, the death penalty and the state\u2019s homelessness crisis, among other issues.   But their quest to collect enough signature petitions to force a recall election took off late last year amid anger about Newsom\u2019s Covid-19 stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. The resurgence of the pandemic and frustration with the state\u2019s wildfire, drought and homelessness crises injected an unexpected level of volatility into the race over the summer, leading to concerns among Newsom allies about the lack of awareness about the recall election among Democrats, while GOP voters were highly enthusiastic and motivated to vote. But in the end, it may be the fears about the surge of the Delta variant that allow Newsom to keep his job. The contrast he and top Democratic surrogates haves painted between himself and the leading GOP replacement candidate \u2013 conservative talk radio host Larry Elder \u2013 on managing Covid has allowed Newsom to shift the trajectory of the race. In the most recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California, conducted at the end of August, only 39% of likely voters said they would vote \u201cyes\u201d on recalling Newsom, while 58% said they\u2019d vote \u201cno.\u201d Voters will be asked two questions on the recall ballot: First, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on whether they want to recall Newsom. Second, they will be asked to select from a list of candidates from all parties who wish to replace him. Forty-six contenders have qualified for the ballot, but there is no well-known Democrat vying to replace him. (Newsom is not allowed to run as a replacement candidate). If a majority vote \u201cyes\u201d on the first question, Newsom is removed from office and the top candidate on the second question takes over, even if that person receives only a fraction of the vote. If a majority votes against recalling Newsom, he keeps his job and the results of the second question are irrelevant. There are no other initiatives or referenda on the ballot. County officials have up to 30 days after the election to finish tallying the vote count. If the recall of Newsom is successful, the secretary of state would certify the results on the 38th day after the election and the new governor would take the oath of office. The new governor would serve the remainder of Newsom\u2019s term through January 2, 2023. The state\u2019s recall mechanism has been part of the law since 1911. But in that time, only one governor was successfully recalled, when Davis was ousted in 2003 and replaced by Schwarzenegger. The most prominent candidates vying to replace Newsom are Republicans, but most were so little known that rank-and-file Republican voters often had trouble naming them in interviews with CNN for much of this year. That changed when Elder made a late entry into the field in July. He has galvanized Republican support around his candidacy, according to polls. Of those who expressed a preference in the recent Public Policy Institute of California survey, 26% favored Elder while the other prominent replacement candidates were in single digits: former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer at 5%, businessman John Cox at 3%, state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley at 3% and reality TV star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner at 1%. (The other potential replacement candidates were not named, according to PPIC.) There are nine Democrats listed among the replacement candidates, but Newsom and the state Democratic Party have urged voters to skip the second question altogether. The governor\u2019s ability to keep his job rests on getting Democratic voters to return their ballots, so they\u2019re hoping to avoid any confusion about the list of more than 40 names on the flip-side of the ballot. That strategy, however, has frustrated some Democratic replacement candidates. The recall gathered steam late last year at a time when many Californians were frustrated with Newsom\u2019s restrictive response to the pandemic and what some viewed as erratic rules and regulations for businesses and restaurants. The major turning point for recall organizers came in November when Newsom attended a friend\u2019s birthday party at a lavish French restaurant in Napa Valley at a time when he was urging Californians to stay home and avoid large gatherings with multiple households. Newsom apologized, calling the dinner \u201ca bad mistake,\u201d but it was widely perceived as hypocritical and grossly out of touch when many Californians were struggling. Also in November, the pro-recall forces got a boost when a judge agreed to give them an extra four months to collect signatures due to the impact of Covid. Both fundraising and signature petition-gathering accelerated for recall proponents, who had to gather 1,495,709 valid petition signatures to qualify (the equivalent of 12% of the votes cast for the office of governor in 2018). At that opportune time for Republicans in mid-November, a judge extended the deadline for recall supporters to collect signatures by four months. Ultimately, they easily surpassed the total needed for the recall to qualify. After a series of procedural steps \u2013 including the verification of the signatures on the petitions by county election officials \u2013 the state\u2019s lieutenant governor called the election for September 14. The state\u2019s Department of Finance has estimated the cost will be $276 million. Democrats outnumber Republicans in California by nearly 2 to 1 and Newsom won the governor\u2019s office in 2018 with 62% of the vote. But many Democrats were not even aware that the election was happening and during a frustrating year as the pandemic continued, Democratic strategists worried about the level of apathy among their voters. For months, polls had shown that most of the excitement and enthusiasm was on the Republican side among voters who want to recall Newsom. In a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early August, 72% of Republican registered voters said they were \u201cvery motivated to vote\u201d compared with 61% of Democrats. Newsom has been trying to nationalize the race, with top Democrats like Vice President Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren joining him on the trail to talk about everything from managing the pandemic to protecting voting and abortion rights in the wake of Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban going into effect earlier this month. President Joe Biden is also expected to join him in the final stretch. Elder has served as a crucial foil for Newsom and his allies in that strategy, with the governor framing the election as \u201ca choice about life and death\u201d because of how differently each would approach the fight against the coronavirus. Newsom has touted the state\u2019s vaccination rate \u2013 about 57% of Californians are fully vaccinated \u2013 and he has directed part of the state\u2019s $75.7 billion budget surplus toward stimulus checks to lower and middle-class residents if they had not received an earlier check from the state. In the recent Public Policy Institute of California\u2019s survey, Californians named Covid-19 as the top issue facing the state, outpacing jobs and the economy, homelessness and housing. Among likely voters, 58% approved of the way Newsom was handling the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cYour vote could be the difference between protecting our kids and putting them at risk,\u201d former President Barack Obama said in a TV ad for Newsom released the week before the election. All of that messaging is geared toward energizing Democratic voters in hopes of overcoming the enthusiasm gap \u2013 and so far, it seems to be working. As of Thursday, about 7.3 million pre-Election Day ballots had been cast \u2013 about 53% by registered Democrats and 25% by registered Republicans, according to Political Data Inc., a firm that does work for Democratic candidates, progressive organizations and nonpartisan campaigns. That means Democrats are overperforming their registration rate in the state (46.5%, according to the California secretary of state\u2019s office), but GOP strategists have expected more Republican voters \u2013 some of whom are skeptical of mail-in voting because of former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims \u2013 to vote in-person on Election Day. The total votes cast so far is about 41% of the total votes cast in the 2020 general election in California. California voters can return their ballots via the United States Postal Service or any official vote-by-mail drop box, or drop them off at any participating vote center in certain counties. No postage is necessary, but voters must sign the back of the vote-by-mail envelope. Ballots returned by mail must be postmarked on or before Election Day and be received by county election officials by September 21. Californians also have the option to vote, or register, in person either early or on Election Day. While dates, times and locations for early voting vary by county, polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. PST on Election Day. This story has been updated Friday with further developments.",

            "article_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been doing everything he can to persuade women to vote \u201cno\u201d on the Republican effort to oust him in Tuesday\u2019s recall election, and in Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday he got his most high-profile surrogate to date to help deliver that message. The former California senator, who remains enormously popular among Democratic women and progressive voters of color, argued that the national consequences of this election could be huge if Newsom is replaced by a Republican. \u201cYou have to understand that this recall campaign is about California, and it\u2019s about a whole lot more,\u201d Harris said, trying to nationalize the race by voicing her outrage about the conservative agenda, particularly Texas\u2019 restrictive abortion law that went into effect last week. In her biggest political event since she and President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, Wednesday\u2019s rally also gave the vice president the chance to test-drive a midterm election message for the White House, following weeks of tumult for the administration and some early criticism of her performance.   She repeatedly denounced the efforts of GOP-controlled legislatures curtailing voting and abortion rights, pointing to \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Texas, what\u2019s happening in Georgia, what\u2019s happening around our country with these policies that are attacking women\u2019s rights, reproductive rights and voting rights, workers\u2019 rights. They think if they can win in California, they can do this anywhere.\u201d For Newsom, this race is all about turnout, not persuasion, and he has long had a strong advantage among women. With Harris\u2019 help Wednesday, his team is trying to get Democratic women to return their ballots in droves to maintain the strong advantage they are already seeing in the partisan registration of the more than 6.4 million pre-Election Day ballots cast so far. In the face of concerns about Democratic apathy, nationalizing the race has been a key Newsom strategy, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota carrying that message when they campaigned with him last weekend. Conservative talk radio host Larry Elder, the leading GOP candidate to replace him, has given Newsom a distinct foil in making that nationalized argument. The hope among Newsom allies is that registered Democratic voters, who outnumber GOP voters by nearly 2 to 1 in the state, will be turned off by Elder\u2019s positions and will return their ballots, making up for the enthusiasm advantage Republicans have enjoyed in this contest. Newsom delved into Elder\u2019s past derogatory comments about women on Wednesday, including his denial that there is a glass ceiling \u2013 and said Harris would be surprised to hear those views: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a glass ceiling \u2013 tell that to Kamala Harris, who did shatter the glass ceiling for vice president,\u201d Newsom said. The governor asked the crowd to imagine what would have happened when Harris vacated her US Senate seat to join the Biden administration \u2013 a nod to the power he had, as governor, to replace her with another Democrat in the Senate. \u201cWhat kind of judges would Larry Elder appoint as Governor of California? Who would he have appointed 10 months ago to replace Kamala Harris when she became vice president? What would that have done in Washington DC today? Would there have been (a) stimulus? Would there be Majority Leader Chuck Schumer? Think of the consequences, California. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d In the final days of the campaign, Newsom is driving the message that this is \u201ca life or death\u201d choice because of the spread of the Delta variant and Elder\u2019s opposition to vaccine and mask mandates. Advisers to Newsom argue that contrast has dramatically changed the contours of the race, because most Californians agree with Newsom about the need for vaccine and mask mandates in certain situations. Schwarzenegger says atmosphere of this year's California recall looks 'exactly the same' as when he won in 2003 Alluding to Elder\u2019s opposition to such mandates, Newsom said on Wednesday that Elder would \u201cwalk us off that same Covid cliff as Texas, and Florida, Tennessee and Alabama and Georgia.\u201d He suggested that Elder would sign an executive order eliminating vaccine verification for health care workers and mask-wearing for kids in public schools. (Elder said in an interview with CNN last week that he would not have power over the mask rules of local school districts). \u201cThis election is a choice about life and death. It\u2019s true California has among the lowest case rates in America, and among the highest vaccination rates in America. Because we believe in science. We believe in public health,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThat is on the ballot in the next week.\u201d Newsom advisers think that message is working. Democrats, who might have otherwise tossed their ballots in the trash ahead of an odd-year election with the resurgence of the pandemic and wildfires coursing across the state, have been alarmed by Elder\u2019s opposition to mask and vaccine mandates, his support for former President Donald Trump and his past comments about immigration, LGBTQ rights and racism. Right now \u2013 as a snapshot in time \u2013 Newsom\u2019s advisers say that turnout could be on pace to match a presidential election if voters keep returning ballots at the current pace. That could be a boon for Newsom in a state where President Joe Biden beat Trump by almost 30 points. But Newsom\u2019s advisers are still bracing for huge Election Day turnout among Republicans \u2013 and that has kept the race unpredictable. So far, about 53% about of the ballots cast before Election Day have come from registered Democrats and 25% from registered Republicans, according to the latest data from Political Data Inc., a firm that does work for Democrats, nonpartisan and progressive groups.

Gavin Newsom\u00a0ahead of the September 14 recall election, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. Newsom is attempting to stave off a Republican-backed effort to oust him, which is motivated in part by anger toward his pandemic restrictions. Biden\u2019s visit would come in the final hours of an election in which most of the voting is expected to be done by mail. Psaki said more details on the trip would be released by the White House later on Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris will also travel to her home state this week to campaign for Newsom. Other high-profile Democrats, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have also stumped for the governor in recent days. Harris\u2019 trip, which is now taking place on Wednesday, was previously postponed following the terrorist attack that killed 13 and wounded 18 US service members in Afghanistan. CNN\u2019s Harry Enten reported last week that the chance of Newsom getting recalled was declining. The latest polls, Enten reported, showed an increasing percentage of voters saying they would vote \u201cno\u201d on the recall. But Enten noted there was the possibility that the race could tighten. Every registered voter in California was sent a ballot in the mail for the recall election. Early returns have been coming more from Democrats, but they outnumber Republicans 2-1 in the state and Republicans may be waiting to vote on Election Day. The effort to oust Newsom, who was elected in 2018, was launched last year by a group of conservative Republicans who opposed the governor on a number of issues, including immigration, taxes, the death penalty and the state\u2019s homelessness crisis.

            "article_content": "It was approaching a sweltering 100 degrees when California Gov. Gavin Newsom jumped into the back of a flatbed truck to thank dozens of laborers for their work to keep him in office. \u201cI know what you are thinking,\u201d said Newsom in shirtsleeves and a tie. \u201cHe better be short, it is 100 degrees out here.\u201d Labor has been central to Newsom\u2019s effort to keep his job, and if he is able to stave off a Republican-backed recall effort on September 14, he could have the scores of labor unions backing him to thank for it. The union workers in California have not only become Newsom\u2019s base because of their ties to labor, but because Newsom is also benefiting from deep support among voters of color \u2013 many of whom made up the audience for the governor\u2019s speech on Sunday. \u201cYour family is here in the federation,\u201d Ron Herrera, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, said to Newsom, as union workers from across the county picked through barbeque provided by the Sheet Metal Local 105. In Los Angeles County, where Newsom rallied on Sunday, the entire affiliation of labor unions through the AFL-CIO has spent at least $2 million to protect Newsom, according to the organization\u2019s spokesman Christian Castro. They have coordinated over 1,100 volunteer shifts, making over 550,000 phone calls and knocking on over 60,000 doors, with the goal of hitting a total of 100,000 doors by Election Day. It\u2019s an effort Newsom was clearly aware of as he stood sweating on the Chevrolet flatbed. \u201cI just want to, from the bottom of my heart, say thank you to all working folks out here, all those essential workers here in the state of California,\u201d Newsom said, lauding the workers for their efforts during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOne thing I am resolved to do is not forget\u2026 You had our backs, and I want you to know, I will have your back.\u201d Newsom told CNN after the event that the reason labor is so critical to him is simply because \u201cno one knows how to organize better than labor.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about boots on the ground, door knocking. It\u2019s about text messaging,\u201d said Newsom, whose campaign is primarily concerned about getting Democrats to the polls, not that they are supportive of this recall. \u201cIt\u2019s not a persuasion campaign. I mean, you\u2019ll still find people that may be on the fence, but it\u2019s really about turnout. Labor knows how to turn out.\u201d In addition to the manpower, unions have helped propel the anti-recall effort. Newsom\u2019s campaign told CNN on Sunday that local chapters of the Service Employees International Union, California Teachers Association, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, State Building & Construction Trades Council, Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and The United Association have contributed a combined $14 million to fight the recall and protect Newsom. Newsom\u2019s primary opponent, Republican Larry Elder, has sought to turn Newsom\u2019s union support \u2013 particularly from unions representing teachers \u2013 into a potent attack against him. Elder has argued the teachers\u2019 union is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of his plans to introduce more school choice to improve the education of California\u2019s children. He has been sharply critical of the way that Newsom shut down California\u2019s schools during the pandemic, arguing that it has had a disproportionately negative effect on Black and brown students, and has criticized Newsom\u2019s close relationship with the teachers\u2019 union \u2013 calling the governor \u201cbeholden to the unions\u201d \u2013 as a reason that he went along with those plans. \u201cThe number one obstacle to school choice is the teacher\u2019s union,\u201d Elder said at an event in Ontario, California, on Saturday. \u201cWho is the number one funder of my opponent? Teachers Union!\u201d And in an interview with CNN last week, Elder slammed the money Newsom has raised from unions: \u201cMy opponent can raise an unlimited amount of money \u2013 already he\u2019s raised about $50 million from the usual suspects: teachers Union, public sector unions.\u201d But as the recall enters its final stretch, Newsom is not at all shying away from his labor ties, knowing that the potent organizations \u2013 which enjoy a notably high approval rating at 65%, according to Gallup \u2013 will be critical for his biggest issue: turnout. Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1 in a state that President Joe Biden won by nearly 30 points. But polls throughout the summer showed that Republican voters were much more fired up than Democratic voters about casting their ballots in the recall. Still, in order to overcome their math problem in the Golden State, Republicans would have to post a massive turnout while Democratic turnout remained relatively low. Early ballot returns suggest that Newsom has made some headway in convincing Democrats that there is a real risk to their agenda if they don\u2019t participate. For the union workers who spent Sunday afternoon munching on tacos, dancing to Selena and listening to Newsom, the recall effort was not only an affront to the work they did to elect Newsom a few short years ago, but an effort that is inextricably tied to race and immigration. \u201cOrganized labor has been key in making sure that this becomes a deep blue state,\u201d said Hugo Soto-Martinez, a 38-year-old hotel worker who is represented by Unite Here Local 11. \u201cThe values of the state reflect the union values and those are workers, those are immigrants, those are people who work for a paycheck in this country.\u201d Laborers like Soto-Martinez have been committing considerable time to keeping Newsom in office, either by knocking on doors or working the phones to connect with people about the looming recall. Shavon Moore-Cage, a worker represented by AFSCME District Council 36, told CNN she calls voters at least three nights a week after she cooks dinner. The reason: Her union is diverse, and she wants to make sure that diversity is celebrated in California, not attacked. \u201cThe unions here in California, we are like a melting pot of people. We represent every culture, we represent every race, we represent all ethnic groups,\u201d said Moore-Cage. Asked about Elder, the response was blunt: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t represent all colors and all nationality. He may say he does, but his action speaks louder than words.\u201d Elder\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on this story. In addition to labor, Newsom has also leaned on national Democratic figures to boost interest from the party\u2019s base \u2013 rallying with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Saturday in Los Angeles, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday in Orange County and is set to rally with Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday in Northern California. The rush of top Democrats flooding to California has given the recall effort a national tone, with Newsom stoking that sentiment as an effort to make the recall more of a referendum on national Republicans \u2013 and the legacy of former President Donald Trump \u2013 and less on his leadership of California. But for the labor leaders Newsom rallied with on Sunday, the recall is as much about Newsom as it is about their union rights. \u201cThis is not an attack on the governor only,\u201d Gloria Alvarado, executive director of the Orange County Labor Federation, said during her speech at an event with Newsom and Klobuchar in Orange County on Sunday. \u201cThis is an attack on the house of labor.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Larry Elder, the leading GOP candidate vying to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for young people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 or for children to wear masks at school, and he vowed to repeal any mask or vaccine mandates for California\u2019s state workers if he is elected to replace the Democratic governor in the September 14 special election. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the science suggests that young people should be vaccinated. I don\u2019t believe the science suggests that young people should have to wear masks at school,\u201d Elder told CNN\u2019s Joe Johns during a wide-ranging interview Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. Even though some pediatric ICUs faced a shortage of beds in areas that were hard hit by Covid-19 this summer, he went on to make the misleading assertion that \u201cyoung people are not likely to contract the coronavirus, and when they do, their symptoms are likely to be mild, and they\u2019re not likely to be hospitalized, and certainly not likely to die.\u201d RELATED: What you need to know about the California recall The conservative talk radio host\u2019s statements stand in sharp contradiction to the patterns that many doctors and medical officials are warning about as the highly transmissible Delta variant has spread across the country, sickening more young people who are unvaccinated than the earlier phases of the virus last year. At a time when coronavirus infections are surging in children across the United States, the Biden administration has engaged in an intensive campaign to get teens and young adults vaccinated. It has been a particularly frightening time for parents sending their children back to in-person schooling, because a Covid-19 vaccine is not yet available to children younger than 12. Underscoring that risk, health officials in Houston last week reported a pediatric Covid-19 death of a youth who did not have underlying health conditions. More than 49,000 children have been hospitalized with Covid-19 since August of 2020, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though Elder is correct that younger people are less at risk of severe illness and death than older people, that does not mean that the disease has been without dangers for the younger population. Among children who are younger than 18 years old, 496 have died from Covid-19, according to data from the CDC website as of Monday. And 3,031 Covid-19 patients between the ages of 18 and 29 years old have died, according to the agency\u2019s data. Elder insisted that he is \u201cnot anti-vax,\u201d noting that he has been vaccinated and that he urges others to get the Covid-19 vaccine. But he said as governor he \u201ccertainly will not\u201d require California state workers to get vaccinated, or to get tested once a week, or to wear masks at work, as Newsom has mandated. He rejected the idea that there are increasing numbers of young people who are being hospitalized with Covid-19. That position contradicts the facts. In mid-August, data from the CDC showed that every age group under the age of 50 had surpassed its previous record of hospitalizations, which were recorded in January. And among those groups, the biggest increase in hospitalizations occurred among adults ages 30 to 39 and children under 18. RELATED: The California recall is another quirk of American democracy \u201cI think the science is all over the place about young people,\u201d Elder said in the interview. \u201cI would have to dispute your notion that young people are dying.\u201d When it comes to cities, local jurisdictions or private businesses who want to mandate masks or vaccines, Elder said he \u201cwon\u2019t have very much power\u201d over their policies as governor. When asked whether he approved of the punitive approach taken by other governors who reject mask mandates in schools \u2013 namely GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who banned mask mandates in schools and then threatened to withhold funding from school districts who defied his order \u2013 Elder said, \u201cI have no plans on doing that, no.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended universal masking in schools for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status. The Republican-led effort to force the Democratic governor from office has been driven, in part, by GOP anger at Newsom for his management of the pandemic and what they viewed as overly restrictive rules and regulations to slow the spread of the virus. Newsom had been in a strong position for most of the summer, but the resurgence of Covid-19 and the wildfires ravaging the state have led to worries among state and national Democrats that there is a very real possibility of him getting recalled and replaced by Elder or one of the more than 40 candidates seeking to replace him. Vote-by-mail ballots have been sent to all of the state\u2019s 22 million registered voters, who will be asked two questions on the ballot. The first is a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question on whether they want to recall the governor, who was elected with more than 60% of the vote in 2018 but is now facing a very tight race on that question. Voters are then asked to choose from the list of potential replacement candidates, including Elder. If Newsom is ousted by a majority on question No. 1, his replacement will be chosen by a simple plurality. Elder has adopted many staunchly conservative positions on the issues, often influenced by his libertarian approach to some of California\u2019s most pressing problems. But he seemed eager to assure Californians that he would not follow through on a few of his most controversial ideas. The talk radio host and columnist, for example, has argued that the minimum wage should be zero. But he told CNN on Monday that he had no plans to try to make that happen: \u201cAm I opposed to the minimum wage? Yes. \u2026 Am I going to do anything about it? Absolutely not. That\u2019s not even close to anything on my agenda list.\u201d Over the years, Elder has also taken some hard-right positions on immigration, including in 2010 when he advocated for amending the Constitution to deny citizenship to the children of undocumented immigrants. \u201cThe 14th Amendment was meant only to confer citizenship on newly freed slaves, not on illegal aliens,\u201d he wrote in a column. But when asked whether he would take steps to deny medical care and education to undocumented immigrants in California, Elder replied: \u201cAgain, not even close to anything on my agenda.\u201d (California\u2019s voters attempted to deny immigrants basic government services through a 1994 ballot measure known as Proposition 187, but the policy was struck down by the courts.) Elder also pushed back on the controversy over his derogatory past comments about women, which were chronicled by CNN\u2019s KFile. He argued that he has also highlighted women\u2019s intelligence and increasing prominence in the workforce in his writings over the years. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the campaign trail \u2013 and I meet a lot of women \u2013 nobody says to me, \u2018You know, Larry, I\u2019m concerned about what you\u2019re going to do about women.\u2019 Just you guys,\u201d he said, referring to the media. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. I\u2019m going to be fair to everybody. I\u2019ve got common sense. I\u2019ve got good judgment. \u2026 I\u2019m going to be fair to everybody, male and female. They shouldn\u2019t have any concern whatsoever,\u201d he said when asked what he would tell voters concerned about his past comments. Though Elder supported former President Donald Trump and developed a close relationship over many years with Trump\u2019s former senior adviser Stephen Miller, he has berated reporters for focusing on his association with the former President \u2013 who is deeply unpopular with voters in California and was defeated by President Joe Biden in the Golden State 63% to 34%. He has shrugged off his support for Trump in interviews with CNN and other media outlets \u2013 noting that he hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat since 1976 \u2013 and has seemed to hedge his position on Trump\u2019s big lie about election fraud in the 2020 presidential race. When asked whether he wants the former President to endorse him, he replied that he is \u201cindifferent.\u201d \u201cIf he would like to give me the endorsement, fine. If he does not want to give me an endorsement, that\u2019s fine too. I haven\u2019t asked him. I haven\u2019t requested it,\u201d Elder told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve not encouraged anybody from the outside (of California) to endorse me, no matter who he or she is.\u201d In past comments, Elder has appeared to shift his stance on the 2020 election results, telling the Sacramento Bee editorial board that Biden won the election \u201cfairly and squarely,\u201d but then complaining that coverage of that remark \u2013 which sparked outrage among some high-profile supporters of Trump on Twitter \u2013 did not include the full context of what he has said about alleged voting irregularities. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election. When asked by CNN whether he believes the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d as Trump has claimed, Elder replied: \u201cDo I believe there were shenanigans? Oh yes.\u201d When pressed on whether he believes Biden was legitimately elected, he sidestepped the question. \u201cBiden is in the White House,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. California\u2019s recall process ranks right up there with the Electoral College when it comes to quirks in US democracy that give \u2013 or take away \u2013 Americans\u2019 leaders. But while the the Electoral College is a buffer between the people and their leader \u2013 it routinely allows the person with fewer overall votes to gain control of the White House \u2013 the recall process is a cattle prod to the system, allowing a fraction of voters, through signature petitions, to force a special election in an off year, when voters might be less likely to show up. The rules are many, detailed and confusing, but the bottom line is that if any less than half of the voters who take part oppose the recall of Gov. Gavin Newsom, he\u2019ll be out of office. The top vote-getter of the 46 people running to replace Newsom, no matter how few votes that person gets, will be in. Bottom line: Millions more Californians could vote to oppose the recall than vote to select its next governor, a strange outcome for a process that\u2019s supposed to bring people closer to direct democracy. Recall efforts are common. They rarely get on the ballot. There have been 55 aimed at California governors since 1913. But the one against Newsom is only the second attempt to recall a sitting governor in California history to reach the ballot after voters recalled Gray Davis, a Democrat, in 2003 and replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger, a movie star and the state\u2019s most recent Republican leader. None of the would-be Newsom replacements have caught fire like Schwarzenegger did in 2003, when 55% of voters supported the recall and 48% selected Schwarzenegger. What\u2019s different today? Most of the voting will be done by mail. In fact, every registered voter was sent a ballot in the mail. That could give Democrats an advantage since 22 million ballots have been mailed out. Early returns are coming more from Democrats, but they outnumber Republicans 2-1 in the state and Republicans may be waiting to vote on Election Day. Another advantage for Newsom is that California\u2019s fundraising rules allow him to raise unlimited funds, treating the recall as a ballot question. But the candidates running to replace him are treated as candidates and can raise far less. I\u2019m going to borrow some passages from reports by CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston, who has been following this recall and Newsom the whole way. How does this process work? As Reston recently wrote, \u201cVoters will be asked just two questions on the recall ballot: First, \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 on whether they want to recall Newsom. Second, they will be asked to select from a list of candidates from all parties who wish to replace him. Forty-six contenders have qualified for the ballot, but there is no well-known Democrat vying to replace him. (Newsom is not allowed to run as a replacement candidate.)\u201d What does the ballot look like? A friend in California and What Matters subscriber sent in an image of her mail-in ballot. It\u2019s a long piece of paper with the recall question at the bottom of the first side. I can see how it would be easy for some people to miss. The rest of the names are on the flip side of the page. Who else is running? Most of the more than 40 candidates vying to replace Newsom are Republicans and several have gotten more attention than others. Larry Elder is a conservative radio host and would be the state\u2019s first Black governor. But he\u2019s run into some major scrutiny for previous comments about women and has been accused of domestic violence and brandishing a gun in 2015. He denies the allegation made by his then-fianc\u00e9e and former employee Alexandra Datig. Businessman John Cox, who lost to Newsom in the 2018 election, has been touring the state with a Kodiak bear. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, also a Republican, has criticized Elder and said he would be more supportive of women during a recent debate. Neither Elder, Newsom, nor Caitlyn Jenner, the reality TV star and former Olympian, went to the debate this week. Former Congressman Doug Ose, who was one of the 46 candidates who had qualified for the recall ballot, dropped out of the race after he was treated for a heart attack. He said in a statement that he is expecting a full recovery but ended his campaign because he needs to focus on rehabilitation. He has endorsed Assemblyman Kevin Kiley. Is there a backup to Newsom? There are a number of Democrats on the ballot, but the governor\u2019s strategy has been to encourage people to vote \u201cno\u201d on recall. Full stop. Keep it simple. That all-or-nothing strategy is either going to be widely criticized in hindsight if someone like Elder, the conservative radio host, is suddenly governor of the biggest blue state in the nation, or smart politics if Newsom survives. Why is Newsom facing this recall? I\u2019ll borrow a succinct two paragraphs from Reston and CNN\u2019s Ethan Cohen: The grassroots effort to oust Newsom, who was elected in 2018, was launched last year by a group of conservative Californians critical of the Democratic governor\u2019s record on immigration, taxes, the death penalty and the state\u2019s homelessness crisis, among other issues. But their quest to collect enough signature petitions to force a recall election took off late last year amid anger about Newsom\u2019s Covid-19 stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. And while the governor appeared to be in a strong position to withstand the effort for much of this year, the resurgence of the pandemic and frustration with the state\u2019s wildfire, drought and homelessness crises has injected an unexpected level of volatility into the race in an overwhelmingly blue state. And I\u2019ll add, in case you have forgotten, that he went to the French Laundry, one of the fanciest restaurants in the country, for a party when Californians were supposed to be staying home, which was the 21st century Covid-19 version of \u201clet them eat cake.\u201d The election is about so much more than that one dinner, but it will be the detail that follows him into history if he loses. It\u2019s also important to remember that while California is a big, blue state, there are a lot of Republicans who live there. More people voted for Donald Trump in California than in Texas in 2020. In this off-year election, with a governor like Newsom who might draw stronger feelings of anger from Republicans than love from Democrats, all bets are off. Newsom has recovered from his French Laundry snafu from a policy perspective and has support in public opinion polls as he carefully navigated issues like requirements for masks in schools. He also found a way to pass two rounds of stimulus payments \u2013 checks of up to $500 \u2013 for Californians, the second of which is going out now, as voters consider his recall. But the state is in far from perfect shape. Here\u2019s how Kim Boj\u00f3rquez put it in the Sacramento Bee: \u201cWildfires burn. Utilities warn against too much electricity use. Drought devastates California farms. Hospital ICUS hold largely unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. Even those who got vaccines now contemplate the prospect of a third shot.\u201d What are the odds he\u2019ll survive? This is from Reston: \u201cIn raw numbers, Democrats have a clear advantage in a state where they outnumber Republicans by nearly two-to-one. But many longtime California strategists say it is difficult to predict what the turnout universe will look like in an off-year election in September where every single registered voter in the state will receive a ballot.\u201d She also included this bit of data from the firm Political Data Inc., which works with Democratic candidates: Of the 1.5 million ballots sent back so far, 57% of them were Democratic ballots, while only 21% were GOP ballots, according to its tracker.

            "article_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has enlisted Sen. Bernie Sanders in his fight to remain in office, with the progressive icon urging voters to reject a \u201cbold-faced Republican power grab\u201d in a new recall ad. The spot released on Monday by Stop the Republican Recall, a countereffort launched by Newsom\u2019s team, features the Vermont independent asking voters to support the Democratic governor in the recall effort and making a thinly veiled attack on conservative talk show radio host Larry Elder, who poses a serious threat to Newsom\u2019s tenure. \u201cAt this unprecedented moment in American history, when we\u2019re trying to address the crisis of climate change, guarantee health care for all and pass real immigration reform, the last thing we need is to have some right-wing Republican governor in California,\u201d Sanders,tacitly referring to Elder, says in the new ad. RELATED: The California recall is another quirk of American democracy \u201cThe September 14 recall of Gov. Newsom is a bold-faced Republican power grab.\u201d The use of Sanders by Newsom and his allies shows just how worried his camp is about the upcoming recall \u2013 and how urgently they are trying to activate progressive voters who might be tempted to sit out the special election on September 14 because of their frustrations about the pandemic. Newsom was in a strong position for most of the summer, but the resurgence of Covid-19 and the wildfires ravaging the state have led to worries among state and national Democrats that there is a very real possibility of him getting recalled. Polls show that on the question of whether voters want to oust Newsom or keep him, the race is within the margin of error. The Stop the Republican Recall group also released an ad in late July featuring Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another noted progressive, who charged Republicans in California with \u201cabusing the recall process\u201d in an effort to \u201cgrab power\u201d in the state. And last week, Vice President Kamala Harris canceled a rally with Newsom, with the former California senator avoiding the highly political moment in the wake of a terrorist attack in Afghanistan that killed 13 American service members as the US raced to withdraw troops from the country. RELATED: What you need to know about the California recall The recall effort was launched earlier this year after some Californians criticized Newsom\u2019s handling of the state\u2019s homelessness problem, devastating wildfires and the Covid-19 crisis. There are two questions on the ballot, asking whether Newsom should be removed from office, and if so, replaced by whom. There are more than 40 candidates running against Newsom, including a number of Republicans: Elder, businessman John Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley and Caitlyn Jenner.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden was likely to lose Democratic control of Congress before last week\u2019s carnage in Afghanistan. That\u2019s more likely now. But the imminent loss of power makes politicians act with greater urgency. For Biden and his party, that just happens to represent their best hope of ultimately not losing it. That dynamic came into view at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue last week. With an assist from Biden and his aides, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi overcame intra-party conflict to keep Congress on track for enacting mammoth investments to upgrade America\u2019s infrastructure, help struggling families climb the economic ladder, and respond to climate change. The $3.5 trillion, Democrats-only \u201chuman infrastructure\u201d package survived a harrowing legislative test in the House, as the $1.2 trillion, bipartisan \u201cphysical infrastructure\u201d package had earlier in the Senate. The tests ahead promise to be more harrowing. Yet progress on both fronts so far gives Biden reason to expect a reasonable facsimile of his \u201cBuild Back Better Agenda\u201d will eventually clear Congress and reach his desk. To avoid surrendering control to Republicans after next year, the White House and Democratic strategists see no other choice. Midterm election losses for the party holding the White House have generally proven as predictable as the tides. To seize Pelosi\u2019s gavel, Republicans need to gain only five seats \u2013 a fraction of the opposition party\u2019s recent historical average. They only need one additional Senate seat to once again make Mitch McConnell the majority leader. The decennial redistricting that follows a new Census smooths the Republican path. They control the state-level line-drawing for many more congressional districts than Democrats.   Earlier this year, Biden\u2019s political team dismissed old patterns as irrelevant to the unique backdrop for his presidency: a once-in-a-century pandemic, the world\u2019s largest economy turned off and then back on again, a violent insurrection incited by a historically divisive, defeated President. Swift passage of Covid relief spending, a quick vaccination ramp-up, and resurgent growth helped keep Biden consistently above the 50% approval mark Donald Trump never reached. Biden\u2019s advantages haven\u2019t entirely vanished. His economic advisers last week forecast 2021 economic growth of 7%. The Census recorded a higher-than-expected increase in the non-white population, which favors Democrats politically. The unpopular ex-President remains at the center of Republican politics. While Trump has a weak track record for lifting Republican candidates when he\u2019s not on the ballot, he helps motivate Democratic voters. But Biden\u2019s standing has sagged under the weight of events, from rising coronavirus levels due to the Delta variant to heightened fears of inflation. The frenzied evacuations and military withdrawal from Afghanistan add a new political burden. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a visual world, and the visuals are pretty tough,\u201d one Biden adviser said last week. Then the suicide bombing at Kabul\u2019s airport added a nightmarish punctuation mark, killing 13 US troops and scores of innocent Afghans. Throughout the year, White House officials have made two domestic priorities touching every American \u2013 taming the pandemic and lifting the nation\u2019s long-term economic trajectory \u2013 the core of their agenda. They tried to sustain that focus last week through the downpour of bad news from Afghanistan and resulting bipartisan criticism. Why Biden's Afghanistan exit wasn't about good politics In remarks at the White House on Tuesday, Biden hailed House passage of his economic investment framework before addressing evacuation efforts in Kabul. His pandemic response team pressed businesses and other institutions to overcome lingering resistance by mandating vaccinations for employment and services. The political value of those efforts, aside from their merits for public health and economic vitality, is in unifying the Democratic electoral coalition while Republicans aim to splinter it with cultural wedge issues. Their longshot hopes of surviving in power next November depend on maximizing unity. \u201cWinning a midterm is extremely difficult,\u201d said David Shor, an influential Democratic strategist. \u201cBig picture, the Biden administration is making all the right strategic decisions.\u201d The Afghanistan withdrawal complicates Biden\u2019s domestic agenda even as the evacuation effort has flown tens of thousands out of Kabul to safety. Republicans who see immigration as a central Democratic vulnerability have already begun assailing the specter of Afghan allies resettling in the US. Biden\u2019s economic agenda can offset those attacks in concrete ways. It includes large tax credits for families with children and new subsidies for health insurance that have already started flowing on a temporary basis.   Other elements involve spending on longer-term projects such as improving roads and bridges and expanding early childhood education. If Democrats manage to enact them, near-term political credit turns on how much public attention they receive by Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how much the media decides to cover it,\u201d Shor observed. To the White House and Democratic leaders, the critical variable is action. Mobilizing bare majorities to break through years of stalemate, they say, can give Democrats a fighting chance despite the President\u2019s political bruises. \u201cVictories that help real people \u2013 working families and small businesses,\u201d the Biden adviser said. \u201cNot about what we want to do, about what we\u2019ve done.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As the Biden administration scrambles to coordinate the evacuations of Americans and vulnerable Afghans from Afghanistan, the next political battle is already shaping up over how expansive the US role should be in helping to resettle tens of thousands of Afghans amid new ripples of anti-immigrant sentiment from the far right. Biden\u2019s compassion and empathy for those in need has been a hallmark of his career \u2013 and it was one of his central appeals in the 2020 campaign. But he now finds himself constrained by the looming pressures of election year politics and the corrosive, nativist rhetoric of a former President who may well challenge him in 2024 and is already looking for any opportunity to claim that his successor did not put America first \u2013 as he did at an Alabama rally Saturday night. Long before the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, refugee intake in the US had become a volatile political issue for the Biden administration, one complicated by the humanitarian crisis at the US-Mexico border and the opposing pressures from conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats who demanded that Biden follow through on his campaign promise to increase the US cap on refugees. Biden's reassurances on Afghanistan contradict chaotic images on the ground, capping week of bad optics for his administration Former President Donald Trump, who rose to power often using racist rhetoric to describe immigrants, set the stage for that debate during his presidency by dramatically scaling back the number of refugees that the US was willing to accept \u2013 ultimately slashing the cap to 15,000 for the 2021 fiscal year. He then weaponized Biden\u2019s more welcoming stance to refugees during the 2020 campaign, falsely alleging at one late September rally that Biden would turn Minnesota \u201cinto a refugee camp\u201d and open \u201cthe flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Trump, still the GOP\u2019s most influential figure, dug into that language Saturday night alongside his endorsed candidate for the state\u2019s 2022 Senate race, Rep. Mo Brooks. The images of desperation from inside Afghanistan are creating complex new fault lines in that debate as US lawmakers attempt to define the scope of American responsibility for getting vulnerable Afghans out of the country and finding them a place to go. There is an emerging divide within the Republican Party \u2013 fueled in part by anti-immigrant rhetoric on Fox News and from Trump loyalists \u2013 that is certain to heat up as more Afghans are loaded onto planes seeking permanent homes in the US and other nations. In the past week, many Republican governors and senators have spoken up about America\u2019s obligation to assist in relocating Afghans \u2013 particularly those who helped the US war effort \u2013 including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, Texas Sen. John Cornyn and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who told a Kentucky TV station that \u201cwe need to care for them.\u201d Ernst told Iowa\u2019s KCCI 8 that she and other lawmakers are pushing to get as many at-risk Afghans out as possible \u201cand we\u2019d love to have them here in Iowa.\u201d Earlier this month, GOP Utah Sen. Mitt Romney tweeted about \u201cour Afghan friends,\u201d calling on Biden to \u201curgently rush to defend, rescue, and give and expand asylum.\u201d As Afghanistan falls to the Taliban, US groups prepare for a wave of migrants Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois also shed light on the US\u2019 longstanding commitment to refugees on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cAmerica\u2019s always been the country that opens our heart.\u201d \u201cRefugees to this country have always been the ones that are extremely entrepreneurial,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we all know that. They come here. They work hard. They fight hard for success. And so if anybody wants to go out and fear monger and continue that darkness in your heart and speak in it so you can win an election, A, you\u2019re either evil at your heart yourself or, B, you\u2019re a charlatan who\u2019s only interested in winning reelection.\u201d But some staunch Trump loyalists \u2013 and the former President himself \u2013 have spent the past week engaging in revisionist history about their own role in Afghanistan\u2019s crisis, including their relentless advocacy for drastic cuts to the overall number of refugees accepted by the United States \u2013 a major factor in the current visa processing backlog. Trump\u2019s former senior adviser Stephen Miller tweeted last week that the focus should be \u201con regional resettlement \u2013 not mass relocation inside the United States.\u201d If the US is not careful, Miller warned, \u201call we could have to show for 20 years in Afghanistan is a failed terror state, a humanitarian catastrophe, and an immigration policy that has brought the threat of jihadism inside our shores.\u201d Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes tweeted an image of a plane full of people leaving Afghanistan with the caption: \u201cRaise your hand if you want this plane landing in your town?\u201d Trump at first seemed sympathetic to at-risk Afghans on Monday, asking why the US military was leaving before civilians \u201cand others who have been good to our country and should be allowed to seek refuge.\u201d But by Wednesday, he issued a statement critical of an image of Afghans leaving the country in US military aircraft: \u201cThis plane should have been full of Americans. America First!\u201d ISIS terror threat forces US military to establish alternate routes to Kabul airport On Saturday night, Trump suggested that some desperate Afghans deserved to be helped by the US, but he did not articulate a clear position on how many should be relocated in the US. The former President went on to boast about how his administration \u201cdramatically reduced refugee admissions and kept radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\u201d He also faulted Biden for reversing his travel ban restricting entry to the United States from predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cBiden revoked that beautiful, wonderful travel ban and has surged refugee resettlement from the most dangerous countries in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe most dangerous terrorists in the world, they come into our country now, with no problem. \u2018Come on in, love to have you.\u2019 This is a sick culture and our country is a disaster, and it\u2019s going to die before your very eyes if this craziness isn\u2019t stopped.\u201d Amid questions about whether the US will expand its Special Immigrant Visa program, Biden has been most focused on the immediate crisis of getting Americans citizens and Afghans who helped the US war effort out of Kabul. Speaking from the White House Sunday, he admitted there are discussions about extending the August 31 deadline for US troops to leave Afghanistan and said the safe zone around the Kabul airport has been extended. But an administration official later told CNN that US military operations at the airport in Kabul have not changed or expanded. The Taliban are going to be setting up some additional entry points along the outer perimeter that they control as part of an effort to thin out the crowds in certain areas, the official explained. In an interview with ABC News last week, Biden said he believed that the US would need to help evacuate \u201csomewhere between 50,000 and 65,000\u201d Afghans in total, a figure that includes the Afghan visa and refugee applicants plus their families. Last month, the State Department announced that it was expanding access to the US refugee program for certain Afghans who did not qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa program, which was created to help Afghans and Iraqis who assisted the US war effort relocate to the US if they were being targeted because of that work. But some aid groups have argued that the rapid fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban means that the US needs to vastly expand its efforts to help tens of thousands of additional Afghans at risk \u2013 and the discussions about how many can be housed in the US and other countries are still very much in flux. Fact check: Trump administration officials try to rewrite their own Afghanistan history In a letter to Biden last week, the president of Refugees International said the US should express its willingness initially to resettle up to 200,000 Afghan refugees \u201cas part of an international responsibility-sharing effort to rescue and resettle Afghans at risk.\u201d When asked about the widely varying estimates of the number of Afghans who will need to be evacuated during a briefing on Friday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US government is still trying to determine the number of people who wish to be relocated and to make contact with those individuals. \u201cWe are going to do as much as we can for as long as we can for as many people as we can,\u201d he said. But Price was reluctant to estimate how many Afghans the US government could assist before Biden\u2019s self-imposed deadline for withdrawal of August 31. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has authorized the use of Fort Bliss in Texas and Fort McCoy in Wisconsin to provide temporary housing and support for up to 22,000 Special Immigrant Visa applicants, their families and \u201cother at-risk individuals,\u201d Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. Fort Lee Army in Virginia had already begun hosting Afghan citizens as part of \u201cOperation Allies Refuge.\u201d At least 38,000 people, including Afghans and foreign nationals, have been evacuated from Afghanistan since the Taliban began its advance on Kabul, according to data analyzed by CNN Sunday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview on Fox News Sunday that about 8,000 people were evacuated from Kabul on about 60 flights in the past 24 hours. The US has now evacuated around 25,100 people since August 14, a day before Kabul fell into Taliban hands. But the flood of people desperate to leave the country is continuing, a point underscored by the death of seven Afghan civilians in the crushes of people near the airport in Kabul, according to a spokesperson for the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defense. At-risk Afghans have been flown to Doha, Qatar, which has hosted them while they are processed and prepare for travel to final destinations, and the first flights with evacuees from Afghanistan have arrived at Ramstein Air Base in Germany \u2013 which is building out capacity to temporarily accommodate as many as 7,500 people by Sunday evening. The details about where they will be permanently housed have been much harder to come by. In a statement on Friday evening, Blinken thanked twelve nations \u2013 Bahrain, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey, the UAE, the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan \u2013 for partnering with the US to help transit Americans and others \u201cthrough their territories to safety.\u201d Blinken also said that 13 nations have \u201cmade generous offers regarding the relocation efforts for at-risk Afghans,\u201d including Albania, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Mexico, Poland, Qatar, Rwanda, Ukraine and Uganda. But there is still very little clarity about how the coordination will work among those many nations and whether public opinion in the United States could influence Biden and his willingness to accept a greater number of Afghans than originally planned. This story has been updated with comments from an administration official about the Taliban opening additional entry points near the airport.",

            "article_content": "When a group of 22 senators negotiates a $1 trillion bill, conversations can go off track. And when they did \u2014 \u201cfar too many (times) to recount,\u201d joked one senior staffer \u2014 Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema would urge them to finish the job, even if that required some liquid courage. \u201cI would say, \u2018it is unacceptable for us to give up here,\u2019\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHave a glass of wine.\u201d And so, after months of negotiating, the group toasted this week to striking the largest infrastructure deal since the Interstate Highway System, making investments in public transit, passenger rail, clean drinking water, bridges, and electric vehicles that the White House said were either the largest ever or in several decades. The agreement is the crest of Sinema\u2019s eight-year career in Congress. As the lead Senate Democratic negotiator, she has been in regular contact with Biden by phone or seated across from him in the Oval Office. But for some Democrats, Sinema\u2019s bill is far from enough, noting that it comprises about a quarter of President Joe Biden\u2019s initial American Jobs Plan, which included much greater incentives for research and development, manufacturing and clean energy. These progressives said that Sinema\u2019s bill advancing through the Senate now is just the latest offense, after she publicly defended the filibuster and opposed the price tag of a $3.5 trillion bill expanding the social safety net. Steven Slugocki, the former Democratic Party chairman for Arizona\u2019s Phoenix-based Maricopa County, said that while Sinema promised to \u201cget stuff done,\u201d she \u201chas so far not held up to those promises\u201d and said the bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t go far enough for what this historic opportunity calls for.\u201d \u201cHer constituents are frustrated, disappointed and angry \u2014 and rightfully so,\u201d Slugocki said. \u201cVoters are looking for leadership and action, not upholding old unnecessary Senate traditions. The time for real results has come.\u201d Sinema has, however, earned rapturous praise from many of her colleagues; the deal\u2019s $550 billion in new federal spending united business and labor groups like the Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO. But the applause for Sinema appears to be louder from the right than the left. The title of a recent op-ed from Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, is: \u201cSenate infrastructure deal is a win for bipartisanship, thanks to Sen. Sinema.\u201d The Arizona Republic editorial board, which before Donald Trump only endorsed Republican presidents, took on the left in a new op-ed, writing that \u201cperhaps it\u2019s time for the fire-breathers to reconsider that maybe, just maybe, the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona in 30 years actually knows what she is doing.\u201d Garrick Taylor, a top official at the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, told CNN that the bill included a number of wins: expanding access to high-speed internet, upgrading border stations along the US-Mexico border and improving technology to aid water management. The state Chamber tweeted a \u201cthank you\u201d to Sinema, noting that the bill doesn\u2019t increase taxes on \u201cjob creators.\u201d Sinema\u2019s relationships with Republicans proved to be a crucial when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would force a vote to get on the bill last week, before they had written it or even struck an agreement. Republicans blasted the decision, saying the group wasn\u2019t ready. Without the support from 10 Republicans, the bill was stuck. Asked by reporters what she was going to do, Sinema said she simply was going to keep working as if nothing had really changed. \u201cWhat other people do is less important than what we do,\u201d she said. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a member of the bipartisan group said that Sinema played a vital role in advancing the talks. \u201cThere were several times when we got bogged down and started relitigating things that had been resolved a long time ago \u2014 and she basically just said \u2018stop,\u2019\u201d said Murkowski. \u201cShe called it out.\u201d The White House also came to appreciate Sinema\u2019s approach. In the first weeks of the administration, Biden\u2019s team worked to get a read of the first term senator, according to multiple officials. She simply wasn\u2019t as well-known of a commodity as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, another critical, centrist Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, they said. But her role in the Democratic caucus was no mystery. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear from Day One that we always need to make sure we know where Sen. Sinema is, no matter the issue,\u201d said one administration official. A test came in January, when Vice President Kamala Harris conducted local television interviews in West Virginia and Arizona to tout the emerging Covid relief legislation. It was perceived by Democrats on Capitol Hill to be a deliberate effort to press Sinema and Manchin to support the legislation. Manchin quickly voiced his displeasure with the administration for failing to reach out to him in advance. Sinema, notably, said nothing in public. That decision was noted inside the White House, and served as a window into what has been a key piece of her relationship with Biden: she will share her views and, critically, ensure the White House won\u2019t be surprised by her position on an issue. It just won\u2019t show up in the press first. It\u2019s an approach, officials say, shared by Biden, who never wavered from his direct assurances to Sinema that he was committed to the bipartisan talks and would see them through \u2013 even as progressive Democrats increasingly urged him to end them when an outcome appeared in doubt. The President reached out in person or on the phone to her at key points throughout the infrastructure negotiations: when Biden\u2019s initial talks with Republicans broke down, when a framework was about to be struck in June and when Biden appeared to throw that agreement into doubt by tying its passage to a separate, sweeping $3.5 trillion bill. When the negotiations floundered this week, Sinema was once again in the Oval Office. The deal was reached on Wednesday. \u201cThroughout the negotiations, Senator Sinema was candid and transparent with the bipartisan group and the President,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN. \u201cShe showed determination at every stage, working to keep everyone in the room and focused on the goal.\u201d It\u2019s a dynamic that will only become more critical in the weeks ahead, as the White House and Democratic leaders press to navigate the arduous intraparty battles that will determine whether the entirety of the President\u2019s sweeping agenda can get across the finish line. Biden, for his part, has always been candid with Sinema about how integral he views the second piece of that agenda, packed with progressive priorities, for the country. While Sinema, 45, is now reaping plaudits from the right, her career began two decades ago working for the Green Party during Ralph Nader\u2019s 2000 presidential run. She then became a pink tutu-wearing anti-war activist, and lost her first bid for the Arizona House as an independent in 2002. She then ran as a Democrat in 2004 \u2014 and won \u2014 and served there until 2010 before jumping up to the state Senate. Alejandra Gomez, a progressive activist at the Arizona Center for Empowerment, told CNN that she remembered when Sinema brought her pizza in 2010 as she was organizing a protest against a state bill that let police check a person\u2019s immigration status if there was a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the person was illegally in the United States. Critics said the bill led to racial profiling. \u201cThis is a very different Sinema from the Sinema that was with us protesting SB 1070 in 2010,\u201d said Gomez, a reference to a strict immigration law in Arizona that energized many Democratic activists in the state to protest the measure. \u201cJust to see this transformation has been incredibly disappointing.\u201d In 2012, Sinema ran for a competitive House district in suburban Phoenix, won and joined centrist committees in Congress. She voted against California Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House Democratic leader and built a reputation of working across the aisle on the Financial Services Committee. But she also had a background that appealed to the Left, as she rose from her impoverished roots, and in 2018, Sinema became the first Democrat in Arizona to be elected senator since Dennis DeConcini was reelected in 1988. She\u2019s also the state\u2019s first senator to be a woman, to be openly bisexual and to describe her religion as \u201cnone.\u201d Her victory speech heavily alluded to the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who died months before her election, and she now spends a significant amount of time during votes hobnobbing with her Republican colleagues rather than sitting with those in her own Democratic caucus. In some ways, Sinema\u2019s blunt style and propensity to take on her own party emulates McCain. But her centrist positions have infuriated some Democrats, who say the state faces a series of crises \u2014 water shortages, climate change, evictions\u2014that she\u2019s not up to facing. Sinema is one of the most outspoken members when it comes to preserving the filibuster, which prevents radical change by forcing 60 votes for most legislation. The image of her thumbs-down vote to raising the minimum wage as part of a massive pandemic aid bill in March also drew the ire of the left. And she\u2019s come out swinging against passing a $3.5 trillion bill that would fund climate initiatives, universal prekindergarten and community college, establish paid family and medical leave, expand the child tax credit, and add dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare, among many other proposals. She is open to passing the budget but not a bill that costs that much. \u201cI thought there was agreement among Democrats, but evidently not,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Some Democrats are looking for someone to run a campaign against Sinema when she runs for reelection in 2024. \u201cIf we need to find a new candidate, we are prepared to do so as Arizonans,\u201d Gomez said. A few strategists who helped launch New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 2018 upset campaign have already set their sights on the senator through a new PAC called No Excuses. Corbin Trent told CNN that the PAC plans on airing radio and digital ads next week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start ramping up and making sure folks are aware of just how little she gives a damn to not just Arizona, but this country,\u201d Trent said.

            "article_content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland threatened legal action against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s executive order targeting migrants in a Thursday letter, calling it \u201cboth dangerous and unlawful\u201d and urging the governor to immediately rescind it. On Wednesday, Abbott issued an executive order restricting ground transportation of migrants \u201cwho pose a risk of carrying Covid-19 into Texas communities\u201d and directing Texas Department of Public Safety to stop any vehicle it finds suspicious, marking the governor\u2019s latest attack against the administration\u2019s immigration policies. CNN first reported that the Biden administration was considering challenging the move and that the Department of Homeland Security is also reviewing it. Abbott, a Republican who\u2019s up for re-election in 2022, has repeatedly tried to link a rise of Covid-19 cases to migration, though he\u2019s stalled efforts by the Biden administration to provide federal funds for Covid-19 tests for migrants released from custody. Immigrant advocacy groups pull out of US effort on border amid standstill over restrictions In his letter, Garland said the order violates federal law \u201cin numerous respects\u201d and warned of its implications, saying that Texas has no authority to interfere with US immigration enforcement. \u201cThe Order would jeopardize the health and safety of noncitizens in federal government custody, federal law enforcement personnel and their families, and our communities. Among other harms, the Order would exacerbate and prolong overcrowding in facilities and shelters and obstruct the federal government\u2019s arrangements with state, local, and nongovernmental partners to ensure that released individuals are transported for appropriate COVID-19 testing to address public health concerns,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cAdditionally, because federal law requires individuals processed for release to appear before immigration courts or report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices throughout the country, the Order directly interferes with the implementation of federal immigration law,\u201d it continues. The Department of Homeland Security also sent Wednesday\u2019s order to its attorneys to get their assessment, according to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who spoke to department officials. In a statement Thursday afternoon, Abbott said he would fight any effort from the Justice Department. \u201c(T)he Biden Administration is jeopardizing the health and safety of Texans on a daily basis by refusing to follow the law,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just Texans; these irresponsible policies and actions by the Biden Administration are endangering the lives of many Americans as well as the unlawful immigrants themselves. I will take every available step consistent with the law to fulfill my duty to protect the health and safety of all Texans.\u201d Liberals may end up liking much of Garland's Justice Department after all Federal officials say Abbott\u2019s actions risk worsening the situation along the US southern border despite his pronouncements that the directives will strengthen security. The executive order doesn\u2019t apply to federal, state or local law enforcement, but it could put US Customs and Border Protection in a bind because the agency relies in part on non-governmental organizations to assist in transporting migrants to their next destination, a CBP official told CNN. Losing support from NGOs could take agents away from processing to provide transport, the official added. \u201cThis is intentionally trying to mess things up,\u201d the CBP official said. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas called the order \u201cvery disruptive.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a violation of many people\u2019s civil rights. I think it\u2019s going to lead to racial profiling,\u201d Gonzalez told CNN, referring to Abbott. \u201cThis executive order wasn\u2019t very thoughtful. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really thinking about the end game of where this is going to take us.\u201d Gonzalez said he\u2019s spoken with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the order and is organizing a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about next steps. READ: Garland letter to Texas Gov. Abbott on migrant executive order It\u2019s not the first time Abbott\u2019s directives have threatened to disrupt federal operations. Earlier this year, Abbott ordered state health officials to stop licensing child-care facilities that house migrant children operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency under the Department of Health and Human Services tasked with the care of migrant children. HHS responded by sending a letter threatening legal action. Immigrant advocates and legal observers have also questioned the legality of Abbott\u2019s directives and cast his actions as trying to score political points. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, called Wednesday\u2019s order \u201cunconstitutional on its face.\u201d \u201cIt also strongly increases the risk of unconstitutional racial profiling by calling on Texas DPS to pull over any vehicle that they have reasonable suspicion is transporting migrants,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said, noting that the order could affect ongoing efforts between the administration and organizations. \u201cThat could severely disrupt the Biden administration\u2019s effort to create a public and private partnership to ensure migrants released by government custody are not simply dropped off at the bus station with no idea where to go,\u201d he added. Nongovernmental organizations often help transport migrants who are released from company, using companies, like Greyhound, to get people around. Asked about the Texas order, Greyhound said in a statement that the company \u201ccomplies with all federal and state laws.\u201d White House outlines 'hard-nosed approach' to tackling root causes of migration While rolling out its immigration agenda, the Biden administration has also contended with a high number of arrests at the US southern border. In June, US Border Patrol apprehended 178,416 migrants at the US-Mexico border, some of whom were repeat crossers, according to the latest available CBP data. In the latest indication of the administration\u2019s wariness over migrants, including those seeking asylum, journeying to the US southern border, officials scratched plans to wind down a Trump-era border policy linked to the pandemic at the end of this month, angering advocates who say it puts migrants in harm\u2019s way. This week, the administration also announced plans to speed up deportations for some migrant families who cross the US-Mexico border. This story has been updated with a statement from Gov. Abbott. CNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s effort to restore public trust in the Justice Department quietly may be turning into one progressive Democrats like, after months of handwringing among some critics on the left that he would block accountability for Trump-era abuses. In a court filing Tuesday, the Justice Department rejected pro-Trump Republican Rep. Mo Brooks\u2019s request to be shielded from a lawsuit related to his incendiary comments before the January 6 Capitol attack. The decision, which Justice officials said Garland was deeply involved in finalizing, followed a move Monday to waive executive privilege for former Trump Justice officials and pave the way for them to testify about events that led to the insurrection. Two memos issued Wednesday showed a more muscular effort on civil rights law enforcement, an issue Garland said was a priority upon taking office. The memos were a signal to states that the department was closely watching efforts to curtail voting access and to use post-election \u201caudits\u201d to intimidate voters. DOJ won't protect GOP Rep. Mo Brooks in insurrection lawsuit From civil rights enforcement to an antitrust lawsuit blocking one of the biggest Wall Street mergers of 2020 to reversals on Trump-era immigration court guidelines, Garland appears to be rewriting the early narrative portrayed by critics mostly on the political left. His first weeks in office were decidedly rocky with some of President Joe Biden\u2019s supporters, who interpreted Garland\u2019s reverence for the Justice Department\u2019s institution as a sign that Garland wants to sweep aside alleged abuses of the Trump era. Two decisions early in his tenure set the tone for critics: Garland continued the department\u2019s Trump-era defense of the former President in a lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll, and the department sought to block release of an internal memo related to former Attorney General William Barr\u2019s handling of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Opinion columns and cable news hosts argued that maybe Biden erred by tapping a judge after 24 years on the bench to serve as attorney general. People close to Garland say the criticism was exaggerated and that the attorney general has tried to hold true to his promise to avoid the taint of politics in his decisions. Amid the criticism, Garland also announced lawsuits against Louisville over police practices following the killing of Breonna Taylor and against Georgia for voting law changes that followed Trump criticism of the 2020 election results. Even if the string of recent decisions are more likely to please progressives, aides say, that\u2019s not his goal. Justice Department puts states on notice about post-election audits and election law changes Instead, some Justice officials say that even on decisions that sided with the former administration: \u201cthis is what restoring norms look like.\u201d After decades on the bench, Garland\u2019s instinct is to project an air divorced from politics, which itself presents difficulties in a hyper-partisan era during which everything from public health advice to national security is seen through a political lens. Denied a Supreme Court seat under President Barack Obama \u2013 many Republicans refused even to meet with him \u2013 Garland described walking into the Justice Department after his attorney general confirmation in March as \u201ccoming home.\u201d In his first public remarks after becoming attorney general, Garland spoke about his goal to try to turn the page after four years during which the former president regularly publicly attacked the department and raised questions about the fairness of the department\u2019s work. \u201cThe only way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people is to adhere to the norms that have become part of the DNA of every Justice Department employee,\u201d Garland said. In contrast to Barr who last year compared career Justice Department employees to Montessori pre-schoolers, Garland has gone out of his way to hail the work of career officials. Some critics saw that instinct in some of his earlier decisions on the Carroll lawsuit and refusing to release internal documents on the Mueller probe. But Garland has also shown a willingness to tangle with some career officials. In recent months one of those struggles behind the scenes has focused on the department\u2019s National Security Division, where career lawyers vehemently opposed Garland\u2019s decision to broadly prohibit prosecutors from seeking reporters\u2019 communications records in leak investigations. The change came after the department disclosed that as part of national security investigations seeking to uncover sources for reporters\u2019 stories on Russia, a top source of annoyance to the former president, prosecutors had obtained communications of reporters from CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post. They also seized records of two Democratic members of Congress who were prominent Trump critics. At an internal ceremony earlier this summer with Garland in attendance, one career national security lawyer joked that he expected comments in the room to be leaked to reporters, especially since \u201cwe can\u2019t go after their records anymore,\u201d according to a person in attendance. Garland didn\u2019t crack a smile as laughter filled the room. CNN lawyer describes gag order and secretive process where Justice Department sought reporter's email records Garland told reporters that he was motivated in part because he believed that targeting reporters in leak investigations was having an impact on the ability of reporters to do the type of reporting to hold government officials accountable, an important part of US democracy. Justice officials note that the department is still prosecuting government officials for illegal leaks. In recent days, Justice lawyers argued for a stiff sentence against a former US Air Force intelligence analyst for disclosing to a reporter documents on the US drone program. People close to the attorney general describe a former judge very much learning his new role. He\u2019s known to ask lots of questions while being briefed and wants time to read every memorandum presented to him. He has been slow to make decisions \u2013 a sharp change for career lawyers who were used to rapid-fire decision-making from Barr. Some officials complain that there\u2019s a bottleneck at the attorney general\u2019s office, with major and politically sensitive decisions being delayed while they wait for the attorney general. Some also complain about a sometimes risk-averse climate, with top officials attuned to \u201cwinning\u201d cases and trying to avoid close calls. Defenders of the attorney general say that he\u2019s aware of the political pendulum swings that come with the job. \u201cHe is going to disappoint progressives\u201d again, one Justice official said. \u201cBut people should know he is serious about sticking with the law.\u201d",

Kushner\u2019s transition to finance means he will not be involved in politics in the foreseeable future, the source confirms. Reuters was first to report Kushner\u2019s plans. No information is available yet as to whose funds Kushner will be investing, and where those investments will be made. Prior to working in the White House, Kushner had no political experience. He served as CEO of his family\u2019s real estate development firm, Kushner Properties. During Trump\u2019s White House tenure, Kushner\u2019s fingerprints were on many, if not all, of the administration\u2019s agenda items \u2013 from the border wall and immigration to relations with China, criminal justice, trade agreements between Mexico and Canada and the United States, the Middle East and, ultimately, the White House\u2019s coronavirus response. He also headed up the White House Office of American Innovation, which was supposed to have modernized government technology. Kushner married Ivanka Trump in 2009. He has been living in Miami since departing Washington in January. CNN has reported the strained relationship that has emerged between Trump and Kushner, which several sources have said began after Trump lost the election. Trump\u2019s son-in-law has been working on a book about his time in the White House, slated to be released in 2022. The person familiar with his plan tells CNN that Kushner received a \u201cseven-figure deal\u201d for the book.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in his bid for re-election, snubbing George P. Bush despite his firm support after Trump has belittled some members of the Bush family. \u201cKen is strong on Crime, Border Security, the Second Amendment, Election Integrity and, above all, our Constitution,\u201d Trump said in a statement released Monday, adding that Paxton is a \u201ctrue Texan who will keep Texas safe.\u201d While the Bush family and Trump have clashed over the years \u2013 most notably when Trump and former Florida Gov.  Jeb Bush battled it out in the 2016 presidential primary \u2013 George P. Bush supported the former President in 2016 and 2020 and told reporters when he launched his campaign in June that he had asked Trump for his endorsement and \u201cwould love to have his support.\u201d Bush, who is the current Texas land commissioner, is the son of Jeb Bush, nephew of former President George W. Bush and the grandson of the late former President George H.W. Bush. Asked by CNN at that event about the attacks Trump has made on his family, Bush conceded that \u201cpolitics is a contact sport.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at a stage in our state where, you know, we can\u2019t let a mean tweet get in the way of doing the right thing,\u201d he said. Trump, who continues to have a strong hold on the GOP, said in May he liked both candidates \u201cvery much\u201d and that he would make an endorsement in future. But a source with knowledge of the meeting also told CNN that when Bush met with Trump in New York, the 45th President assured Bush that he would stay out of the race and that he wouldn\u2019t make an endorsement but the source added that was never going to happen. One source called Bush naive. According to a GOP source, Trump endorsing Paxton is like Lucy and the football and Charlie Brown. Even sources close to Bush believed this is exactly what would happen and warned him not to publicly play up to the former President because Trump would once again take glee in embarrassing the Bush family. Trump remains influential in GOP primary races and Paxton has been the target of controversy, but a senior GOP source in Texas said barring a bombshell, Trump\u2019s endorsement means Paxton will win. Bush had made the phrase \u201chonor and integrity\u201d a theme of his announcement speech, echoing a refrain often used by his uncle. Asked at his announcement if he thought that message will work in his campaign, he said: \u201cAbsolutely, I can take all the tips I can get, whether it\u2019s W. or Trump.\u201d The Point: George P. Bush just learned a very important lesson about Donald Trump As land commissioner since 2015, Bush has been viewed by political observers as a rising star in the Republican Party. He speaks Spanish and was involved in the founding of the political group Hispanic Republicans of Texas. He was also an officer in the Navy Reserves and a former businessman, with a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law. Paxton, a staunch ally of Trump, has been state attorney general since 2015 and was highly active in filing federal lawsuits during the Obama administration. He notably led a 20-state challenge against the Affordable Care Act, has filed multiple suits against the Biden administration over a range of issues from immigration to Medicaid and led the lawsuit contesting election results in four states that Trump lost in November. The Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit. Paxton also is currently under indictment for securities fraud and, separately, facing an FBI investigation for abuse of office. He has denied the charges and allegations. CNN\u2019s Brian Rokus and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s influence with Texas Republicans faces a stern test on Tuesday as voters in the state\u2019s 6th Congressional District choose between a pair of GOP candidates in a runoff to fill the late Rep. Ron Wright\u2019s seat. Susan Wright, the widow of the congressman \u2013 who had cancer and died following a Covid-19 diagnosis in February \u2013 finished first in the May 1 special election after picking up Trump\u2019s support shortly before the end of early voting. But the former aide to GOP state lawmakers failed to win a majority, which spurred a one-on-one contest with the second-place candidate, state Rep. Jake Ellzey. The district includes Ellis, Navarro and parts of Tarrant counties. The campaign has turned less on any specific issue \u2013 both are in line on all major conservative policy priorities \u2013 than on clashing endorsements. Wright has Trump\u2019s support, while Ellzey enjoys the backing of some high-profile Texas Republicans with ties to the former President. And because Democrats were locked out of this final round, the results on Tuesday will not make any immediate impact on President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in Washington, where Democrats hold a narrow House majority. Despite the diminished national stakes, Trump dialed up his involvement as the race reached its final stages, recording a late robocall for Wright that touts her as \u201cstrong on immigration\u201d and promises she will \u201ccut your taxes and cut them even further than we\u2019ve done.\u201d His super PAC, Make America Great Again Action, spent $100,000 as early voting ended and Election Day approached. And on Monday, Trump released a new statement of support and took part in a virtual event for Wright\u2019s campaign. Wright also has the backing of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, which has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars questioning Ellzey\u2019s conservative credentials. Texas\u2019 Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Wright in early May. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, a Trump favorite and the third-ranking Republican in the US House, has been a booster. Ellzey, a decorated former Navy pilot and veteran who lost a 2018 primary to Ron Wright, also has considerable GOP firepower on his side. He outraised Susan Wright by more than 2-to-1 and has the backing of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s first energy secretary, and US Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas, who recorded a video for the campaign in late June responding to a series of what he called \u201cdishonest\u201d attacks, including the suggestion that Ellzey is a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d \u201cThis is not true. He has always supported President Trump, voted for him twice, long supported him,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying this because he got a donation from somebody who\u2019s a \u2018Never Trumper.\u2019 He can\u2019t control that. What\u2019s he supposed to do, just return money?\u201d Ellzey, who has sidestepped direct criticism of Wright, posted an ad earlier this month titled \u201cTrump Supporters Love Jake Ellzey.\u201d The nearly three-minute video features Trump voters from the 6th District talking up Ellzey and connecting him to Trump\u2019s legacy \u2013 though it notably does not make mention of Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Earlier this month, Ellzey joined Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a group of Republican House members from around the country and other GOP leaders at the southern border, where the former President mixed criticism of his successor\u2019s immigration policies with more false charges about his general election defeat last year. Early voting in the special election runoff began on July 19 and ended on Friday. As of Thursday, turnout \u2013 including early and mail-in votes \u2013 was a little more than 12,000. Polls close on Tuesday at 7 p.m. CT. The total for the initial round, completed on May 1, was about 78,500. Wright captured less than 20% of that vote. Ellzey finished with 13.85%. While Trump\u2019s popularity with Texas Republicans remains strong, the former President won the Republican-leaning 6th District by only 3 percentage points in 2020, down from 12 points four years earlier. Despite that sign of Democratic momentum in the district, the top Democratic candidate in May\u2019s first round of voting placed third, missing out on the runoff by fewer than 400 votes, guaranteeing that the seat would remain in GOP hands. The winner, though, will not have much time to get comfortable on Capitol Hill. The seat will be up for grabs again during next year\u2019s midterm elections, with the primary scheduled for March 1.

President Joe Biden will participate in a CNN town hall on Wednesday, July 21 in Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 a little more than six months after being sworn into office. CNN anchor Don Lemon will moderate the live, internationally broadcast event that will air at 8 p.m. ET and is expected to focus on a wide range of issues facing the nation ranging from Covid-19 to the economy. The event comes as the administration has made progress in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic with a strong vaccine rollout, but concerns are rising over the slowing the pace of vaccinations in recent weeks. The US now faces an uptick in Covid-19 cases, driven in large part by the highly transmissible Delta variant. Forty-five states are experiencing a surge in new cases \u2013 the vast majority among unvaccinated people \u2013 and the daily pace of people becoming fully vaccinated is down 84% since mid-April, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The town hall will come at a critical time in Biden\u2019s presidency as the administration faces a number of congressional hurdles, including on immigration, police reform and infrastructure. The event will take place in the hometown of Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, who was one of the senators who signed on to a bipartisan infrastructure deal with the President last month at the White House and has been making the case for the GOP to work with Biden on key legislative priorities. Portman is a key Republican to watch throughout Biden\u2019s first two years in office as he is retiring at the end of 2022 and could be a potential bipartisan dealmaker. The event will take place in the traditional battleground state of Ohio, which has often been a key bellwether in presidential elections. The state has a Republican governor, Mike DeWine, who has been a key ally in the fight against Covid for Biden and has joined the President in multiple virtual events promoting Covid-19 vaccines. Biden won Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, in the 2020 election \u2013 one of just seven Ohio counties he took from former President Donald Trump in that race. Ohio as a state went for Trump 53.3% to 45.2%. The President has been traveling around the country in recent months selling his infrastructure proposal, often hitting Midwestern cities in key states and districts that will play a key role in both the 2022 and 2024 elections. The President has gone to these areas touting his \u201cBlue Collar Blueprint for America,\u201d attempting to reach voters who may have swung toward Trump in previous elections but have traditionally voted for Democrats. A CNN spokesperson said an invitation-only audience will be present at the town hall and the network will follow all local and state Covid-19 guidance and regulations to ensure a safe event. The town hall will be held at Mount St. Joseph University. The one-hour event will stream live on CNN.com\u2019s homepage and across mobile devices via CNN\u2019s apps for iOS and Android with a log-in to a cable provider. It can also be viewed on CNNgo (at CNN.com/go on your desktop, smartphone, and iPad, and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Android TV, Chromecast, Roku and Samsung Smart TV). The special will also be available on demand to subscribers via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidency is only six months old, but the mood inside the White House can often feel like a race against time. \u201cThe clock is running. We all know that,\u201d a senior adviser to Biden said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe President certainly knows that.\u201d Biden has three-and-a-half years remaining in his term, but his senior advisers speak frequently about the sense of urgency facing his presidency, with the next year almost certain to be dominated by midterm elections that could take away the Democratic majorities in Congress he needs to pass his agenda. In West Wing meetings lately, White House chief of staff Ron Klain has impressed upon aides the critical importance of the next few weeks. Recognizing the stakes, Biden and his team are sharpening their strategy to confront an epic set of challenges that some of his allies fear could impart lasting political damage: Covid cases are spiking, inflation is up, border crossings are rising, the Taliban are taking over Afghanistan and a much-touted bipartisan infrastructure agreement is teetering on the brink. If Biden ever had a honeymoon period \u2013 after inheriting a raging global pandemic, there is a good argument he did not \u2013 it is clear at the six-month point of his presidency that it is over. At the White House and on the road, the President has begun adopting a more aggressive stance against Republicans and other critics, including on voting rights and the Afghanistan withdrawal. The administration recently launched an offensive against vaccine disinformation it believes is helping to drive Covid cases among the unvaccinated, inadvertently sparking a tiff with Facebook. And Biden himself plans to tighten his focus in coming weeks on popular elements of a sweeping legislative agenda that hangs in the balance, according to officials, hoping to sway Americans in red-leaning areas. Still, internal divides persist among officials in some fraught areas, like immigration and Covid reopening plans, with heightened debate over how single decisions could resonate politically. And Biden\u2019s penchant for going off-script has thrown his team into cleanup mode at multiple points so far. For all of his focus on returning a semblance of normalcy to the presidency, Biden has now entered the familiar territory of his predecessors: a period of uncertainty and events transpiring far outside of best-laid plans. How he and his team manage those events will have repercussions beyond a single piece of legislation or foreign policy decision. Instead, they could determine his ability to navigate a sweeping legislative agenda, tenuous House and Senate majorities and, to a degree, his entire first term. The coming weeks will play a considerable role in defining the success of the Biden presidency, particularly whether the White House is able to keep a bipartisan coalition together on the first piece of his infrastructure plan and keep Democrats united on a broader package that would dramatically remake the nation\u2019s social safety network by touching all facets of American life. But other forces are also gathering that Biden\u2019s aides are eyeing closely, wary of their potential to distract from or consume his agenda. Chief among them is the issue of rising Covid cases, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, which has been tearing through communities where vaccination rates remain low. The average of new daily cases this week is up 66% from last week and 145% from two weeks ago, as cases surge in 44 states, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In addition, hospitalizations are up 26% from last week. Officials are also watching with concern as border crossings tick back up, mindful of Biden\u2019s relatively low approval ratings on immigration and the struggle the administration faced earlier this year when waves of migrants arrived at the border, overwhelming federal resources. US border authorities in June arrested or turned away the highest monthly number of migrants at the US-Mexico border in at least a decade. The two issues have converged in discussions over how and when to reopen US borders to travel, leading to tense conversations among officials over the health and political risks of opening up too soon. Biden and his team insist that little in their current predicament comes as a surprise. And they point to major strides against the pandemic and to an economic resurgence as signs of the President\u2019s capacity to lead the nation from a place of darkness. \u201cHe identified, when he took office, four big priorities or crises of his presidency: health, the pandemic, climate \u2026 and addressing racial injustice,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. \u201cThose are crises and those are challenges he will continue to spend his time working toward and making progress on.\u201d In many areas, administration officials also believe, dire numbers paint a gloomier portrait than reality. Rising Covid caseloads have not prompted a similarly grave spike in hospitalizations or deaths, though both are still increasing among unvaccinated people. And while prices are rising, causing anxiety over inflation, administration officials have firmly rejected the idea that price increases are here to stay or represent a broader threat to the economy. Still, there was a recognition, officials said, that a one-off pushback against inflation attacks wasn\u2019t having a substantial effect. The issue had also started to elevate in polling, both publicly and in internal polls, according to officials, something that carried risks to Biden\u2019s sweeping legislative proposals. That was the driving force behind the White House decision to proactively address inflation concerns in scheduled economic remarks this week \u2013 remarks that sought to flip the attack on its head by citing the design of Biden\u2019s spending proposals as a long-term balm to price instability. \u201cIf your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more enthusiastic about this plan,\u201d Biden said in the remarks. Still, officials have reiterated they are keeping a close eye on the subject and have put a particular focus on efforts to ease supply-chain issues, both in the near term and in laying the groundwork for longer-term solutions. In an acknowledgment of the uncertainty at the heart of economic data in this moment, Biden also added, \u201cMy administration understands that if we were to ever experience unchecked inflation over the long term, that would pose a real challenge to our economy. So while we\u2019re confident that isn\u2019t what we\u2019re seeing today, we\u2019re going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed.\u201d Biden\u2019s role in the days and weeks ahead will be to sell the public on his most popular proposals, according to officials. He has voiced repeatedly a desire to avoid what he saw as a mistake during his tenure as vice president, when he said his advice to then-President Barack Obama to better explain his agenda went unheard. Internally, there is a recognition that individual pieces of Biden\u2019s plans \u2013 from child and home care to education and paid leave \u2013 poll well in isolation. Highlighting those pieces, instead of a broad focus on the entirety of what would be a transformative agenda, will be a focal point. It\u2019s an open question whether the President will deliver on his quest to reach a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure or police reform, but the White House is intent on showing the country that he is trying. The White House selected Ohio as the site of a Wednesday town hall meeting on CNN, following in the line of several recent Biden trips to areas that are more red than blue. Bill Stearns, a Cincinnati lawyer, said the opening months of the Biden administration have exceeded his expectations, given the myriad challenges facing the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s such a relief to be able to wake up in the morning, know that the nation is in safe hands,\u201d Stearns said in an interview this week, reflecting on the last six months. \u201cI think it\u2019s even better than I thought, doing what he\u2019s attempting to do with the economy and trying to get out of the pandemic.\u201d For Biden, a salesmanship strategy tracks closely to his own stated desire to find the best ways to message his plans. In private meetings, he\u2019s constantly asking advisers for the best way to explain, in layman\u2019s terms, why the proposals should garner support across the country, two officials said. That was on display when he defended his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan this month, insisting forcefully that no amount of sustained American presence there could resolve the country\u2019s intractable problems. Still, just as often, the result turns into remarks that can be detail-laden and even long-winded. Biden himself has taken to acknowledging that in real time, apologizing when he thinks he\u2019s getting too in the weeds on a specific issue or tacitly acknowledging that the details of tax or paid-leave policy may not exactly set the crowd on fire. \u201cI know that\u2019s a boring speech,\u201d Biden said after a half-hour address on infrastructure in the Chicago suburbs. But he quickly followed with a key point: \u201cBut it\u2019s an important speech.\u201d Aides doubt there is a way to pull the President away from the details-oriented approach, and many believe explaining why specific policies matter to the broader public is his strong suit. Still, moves to sharpen the focus on narrow pieces of the plan are likely to become a more central element of his public appearances, according to people familiar with the plans. Behind the scenes, White House officials have been deeply engaged in negotiations over both elements of Biden\u2019s legislative agenda: the bipartisan infrastructure plan and a more partisan budget bill. They have turned in recent days to the arduous process of turning the bipartisan framework into legislative text. As Senate Democrats set a procedural vote this week as a deadline to help jump-start the talks \u2013 and as some progressive Democrats in both chambers anxiously warned of wasting too much time in pursuit of a final agreement \u2013 the White House has remained steadfast in its efforts, officials said. They view the deal as a linchpin for Biden\u2019s overall agenda: critical to securing a major bipartisan win he deeply wants, while also providing a key element that moderate Democrats have made clear they must have in order to go along with the second proposal. In Congress, Biden\u2019s challenges are rooted in the narrow majorities held by Democrats in both chambers \u2013 the same margins that Democrats fear could be at stake if the current turbulence extends into midterm election season. Biden, whose own campaign last year was drastically altered due to the pandemic, is set to resume in-person politicking this week when he stumps in Northern Virginia for Terry McAuliffe, who is looking to return to the governor\u2019s mansion in elections later this year. Officials said they expected his message to underscore the progress the country has made against the virus \u2013 while also taking apart Republicans for standing in his way. Democrats are fighting to maintain control of Congress in 2022 in contests that historically fare poorly for the sitting president\u2019s party. Biden has visited several House battlegrounds in recent weeks where Democrats hope to either hang on to vulnerable seats or defeat Republicans who won narrowly last year. So far, Biden hasn\u2019t ventured further west than Texas, where he visited in February to tour the site of devastating storms. And he has not spent a night at a hotel in the United States, limiting his travel to states where he can return home at the end of the day. The close-to-home itineraries are partly due to the pandemic, which limited travel options in the early months of Biden\u2019s presidency. But Biden has also expressed a penchant for returning home at the end of the day, a trait he shares with his predecessor. By this point in their presidencies, Trump and Barack Obama had each traveled to a relatively similar number of states: Trump had visited 15 at the six-month mark, while Obama had been to 17. Like Biden, Trump stuck close to the East Coast, traveling only as far as Iowa during his first half-year in office. Obama had ventured farther afield, making stops in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and California. One thing the White House has no plans to depart from is Biden\u2019s regular public remarks on the pandemic. They serve a dual purpose, officials say: reminding the country, particularly as the Delta variant ravages unvaccinated portions of the country, that despite the administration\u2019s success in delivering vaccinations, the pandemic is very much still ongoing. But it\u2019s also an area where Biden has consistently held high marks in polling for his administration\u2019s efforts \u2013 success that administration officials stress was not a sure thing when he first set foot in the White House. It\u2019s not a small consideration inside the White House, where officials have varying levels of concern that progress on the economic and public health fronts could be forgotten or dismissed amid new challenges or crises that confront Biden \u2013 a natural occurrence for any president, but one that officials have pushed to counter by repeatedly harking back to where the country stood when he was inaugurated. It\u2019s what drives the top of most of Biden\u2019s remarks \u2013 a deliberate effort to walk back through where things were, and where things are now, officials say. At this point it almost feels pro forma \u2013 yet the explicit recaps are viewed internally as an essential public reminder as Biden drives into a moment of his presidency that is, in many ways, out of his control. Gone are the 100-day plans, the leveraging of underutilized or atrophied executive branch authorities or powers to boost advances or sweeping reviews to forestall definitive action on complex issues. In place of those actions are tenuous negotiations with fickle lawmakers and the narrowest of majorities, geopolitical forces constantly probing and testing, and crises both man-made and natural \u2013 lying in wait. \u201cI really do believe that, temperamentally, the President is thinking more in terms of years and decades than his predecessor was ever even remotely capable of doing,\u201d said Jon Meacham, the presidential historian who has advised Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that we have a 78-year-old American President who thought his political career was done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet history and fate have brought this man back to try to manage a pandemic, manage a deep crisis in democracy, manage what I think of is a crisis of trust.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After navigating life in the US for 17 years without legal status, Yazmin Bruno-Valdez was ushered into the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program less than a month ago, granting her long-awaited protection from deportation and opening potentially bright new pathways for jobs, scholarships and travel. The 20-year-old college junior found herself in tears of joy last Monday after getting her drivers\u2019 license in Kansas \u2013 marveling at how it felt to drive home, free from the fear that one harmless traffic infraction could lead to an encounter with immigration officials who could eject her from the country. What to know about DACA being ruled illegal But that brief sense of freedom and possibility vanished on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the 2012 DACA program created by former President Barack Obama was illegal. US District Judge Andrew Hanen, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, said DACA recipients can maintain their status for now and may continue to renew it every two years. But the program will cease to exist for the tens of thousands of applicants who were waiting in the DACA pipeline It was another cruel twist of fate in Bruno-Valdez\u2019s journey, one that has left her awash in fear, guilt and uncertainty. When the ruling came down Friday night, she said she felt as though she had been granted Willy Wonka\u2019s \u201cgolden ticket\u201d just before that privilege was snatched away from so many others who she feels deserved it just as much. \u201cI am so angry that so much of this was based off of luck,\u201d Bruno-Valdez said in an interview Saturday. \u201cI just feel terrible. I feel so much guilt. I feel like I pushed so many people to apply.\u201d Even though Bruno-Valdez made it into the program before it was ruled illegal, that doesn\u2019t give her much piece of mind. \u201cWhat if the (DACA) program ends completely and now they have our exact location,\u201d Bruno-Valdez said. \u201cThey have our address. They have every bit of information that they can possibly need to deport us on. And what if there is another ruling that just takes away these protections?\u201d Many of the more than 600,000 DACA recipients are now contemplating those same \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios as they find their lives upended by yet another court ruling. They are angry about the countless promises by members of Congress from both parties who said they would find a permanent legislative solution for a program that was always intended to be temporary. The shock of the ruling has been heightened by the fact that many DACA recipients believed they were safe when President Joe Biden was elected in 2020 after four years of former President Donald Trump\u2019s hostility and demonization of immigrants. Though Trump tried to end the DACA program in 2017, he was ultimately blocked from doing so by the Supreme Court. But with the court\u2019s more conservative makeup after Trump appointed his third justice last year, it is impossible to predict whether it would do so again. \u201cFor a moment, there was like a sheet of light that shined through the dark times \u2013 and it was like, \u2018OK, things are really going to get better now,\u2019\u201d said Frida Adame, a 25-year-old DACA recipient from Houston whose sister applied for DACA a few months ago and is now among those who were cut off by the decision Friday night. \u201cBut then with this ruling, the light that was going through just dimmed and now it\u2019s dark again. \u2026 We have absolutely no idea of what will happen next and that\u2019s scary.\u201d Adame noted that after she became a DACA recipient in 2015, she was able to take better care of her family members who are undocumented. \u201cAll the apartments and places that we\u2019ve ever been in \u2013 they\u2019re under my name,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a way it was really hard, because I was 19 with a whole family on top of me, on my back.\u201d She worries now about how her sister will make her way and find a good-paying job without documents. Federal judge's DACA ruling underscores the human cost of congressional inaction \u201cMaybe 10 years ago it was easy to get a job anywhere without documents. Nowadays they won\u2019t even hire you at a Walmart,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point, we just need Congress to act \u2013 and the Democrats to act. \u2026 Without help from Congress, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not even in this country. It\u2019s like they are trying to erase us.\u201d Many of the so-called Dreamers hope that Democrats, who have the tie-breaking vote in the evenly divided Senate, will create permanent protections for them and certain other groups of immigrants through the budget process known as reconciliation \u2013 which would only need the support of 50 Democrats. But there are many hurdles ahead in that process, including whether the Senate parliamentarian would consider the immigration provisions to be germane to that special budget process. While some Republican senators have expressed interest in helping DACA recipients, it is unclear whether Hanen\u2019s ruling will create more bipartisan support for the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021 in the 50-50 Senate at a time when the two parties are warring over the dramatic influx in migrants across the Southern Border. The bill \u2013 which would create a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to this country as children, as well as Temporary Protected Status recipients and others \u2013 passed the US House in March with the support of nine Republicans. Biden, who took some intermediary steps to strengthen the DACA program when he entered the White House, called Hanen\u2019s ruling \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d Saturday and said the US Department of Justice would appeal the decision. But the legal prospects look challenging as the case works its way up to the staunchly conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. For the tens of thousands of first-time applicants who began applying to the program after a federal judge in New York ruled last December that the federal government must accept new DACA applications, the ruling is devastating. Valeria Mata, a 17-year-old DACA applicant from Illinois, said she waited to apply until after Trump was out of office because his policies \u201cmade us almost want to go into hiding.\u201d Biden\u2019s election, she said, \u201cwas like a sliver of hope.\u201d But Hanen\u2019s ruling crushed her. \u201cI was really kind of basing my whole future on this opportunity,\u201d Mata said after finishing her Saturday night shift at a perfume store. \u201cI had so many different plans and things I wanted to do that seem so much further away now.\u201d An aspiring psychologist who hopes to work in the field of mental health helping erase the stigma among people of color, Mata has watched with frustration as her younger brother, who\u2019s a citizen, has entered the workforce, immediately earning higher wages and better benefits while she is forced to settle for what employers will give her. \u201cI know that Biden is going to continue fighting and that we will continue fighting for DACA,\u201d Mata said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always that fear of being deported. That\u2019s really scary because my entire life is here. I\u2019ve only met like 10% of the people that are related to me in Mexico. So it\u2019s pretty scary to think that I would have to get used to a completely different environment. I\u2019ve been here since I was two years old, so I don\u2019t know anything other than life in the US.\u201d After Hanen\u2019s ruling, many DACA recipients are unsure of how long the program will exist or when the next court ruling could reshape their fates. Some say the Biden administration should have moved more quickly to address the backlog of applications \u2013 because the delay in processing the applications of so many in the DACA pipeline now means those young people have missed their chance to get DACA protections. Immigration advocates note that one portion of Hanen\u2019s ruling underscores how tenuous the stay he granted is when it comes to protecting current DACA recipients. In his order of permanent injunction, Hanen wrote that his stay hinged on the government\u2019s willingness to address his concerns about the program. \u201cIf the Government fails to take the appropriate steps to remedy the shortfalls in DACA within a reasonable time given the complexities inherent in such a process, the Court will reconsider its decision to stay portions of the relief that it has granted,\u201d the judge wrote. Ju Hong, a DACA recipient who recently lost his job at the Alameda County Public Health Department as well as his health insurance after his work permits expired due to the backlog in processing DACA renewals, said the language of the ruling underscored the uncertainty so many are feeling. Though his status has now been renewed, he worries for those who have seen their plans shattered. \u201cWe need the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress to come through on their promises to deliver citizenship for all, for everyone, so we don\u2019t have to be in this limbo every two years,\u201d Hong said in an interview Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of living like this \u2013 with this fear, anxiety and stress. I cannot wait any more. Enough is enough.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In one of next year\u2019s most consequential Senate races, the Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is turning on a question: Who won the 2020 presidential election? Former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud, including his promotion of a controversial, partisan audit of the vote in Maricopa County, has dominated the debate within the Arizona GOP for months, as it recovers from Trump\u2019s and Republican Sen. Martha McSally\u2019s close losses to Joe Biden and Kelly last year. While some Republican Senate candidates say they have accepted Biden\u2019s victory in Arizona and in the Electoral College, others have continued to question it \u2013 defending the ongoing, Republican-driven audit in Maricopa, which is home to Phoenix and nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s vote \u2013 and called for \u201celection integrity\u201d measures. They are vying for the chance to oust Kelly, the former astronaut and fundraising powerhouse who is seeking a six-year term in 2022. The newest entrant into the GOP Senate primary is Blake Masters, a 34-year-old venture capitalist and protege of tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who officially announced his candidacy this week. Thiel is expected to spend $10 million on a Super PAC supporting Masters\u2019 campaign. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Masters said so-called election integrity \u201cmay be the top priority\u201d of his campaign and said, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to know\u201d who won the presidential race. Masters said he believed Biden is president since he was sworn-in and certified by Congress but that the election raised questions. He joins a Republican field that already includes Arizona\u2019s attorney general Mark Brnovich; solar-energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon; and retired Maj. General Michael \u201cMick\u201d McGuire, the state\u2019s top National Guard officer who also headed Arizona\u2019s emergency response department during the pandemic. All of them have embraced some level of rhetoric about shoring up confidence in US elections. But some Republicans are worried that embracing Trump\u2019s falsehoods could hurt their eventual nominee in the party\u2019s effort to take back the Senate in 2022. \u201cThe audit is an albatross around the neck for every Republican running in the state of Arizona,\u201d said Chris DeRose, the former clerk of the superior court in Maricopa County and a Republican lawyer. As Arizona\u2019s top law enforcement officer, Brnovich has claimed early frontrunner status among operatives in the state, boosted by his 6-3 victory at the Supreme Court to uphold Arizona law discarding in-person ballots cast at the wrong precinct and restricting \u201cballot collection\u201d requiring that family caregivers, mail carriers and election officials can deliver another person\u2019s completed ballot to a polling place. He has also sued the Biden administration over its immigration policies and secured multi-million dollar payments for consumers in cases against telecommunications company CenturyLink, electric utility Arizona Public Service Company and General Motors. While Brnovich is running on his record, and is the only Republican in the primary who has won a statewide race, he has faced some blowback from Trump. Brnovich was one of the state officials who certified Biden\u2019s 10,457-vote .3% victory over Trump in 2020, and in May, Trump said that \u201cBrnovich is nowhere to be found\u201d while the \u201cmassive crime in the 2020 Election is becoming more and more evident and obvious.\u201d Brnovich has since spoken with Trump and defended the audit, telling the Justice Department that his office would \u201cnot tolerate any effort to undermine\u201d it. \u201cMark Brnovich is the clear choice for this time to ensure that the people of Arizona have a fighter in Washington, DC,\u201d said Brnovich spokesperson Joanna Duka. \u201cThe attorney general has a record of pushing back against the Biden Administration\u2019s disastrous border policy, fighting for election integrity, life, and defending the rule of law. He is on the front lines of the fights that matter most for hardworking Arizona taxpayers.\u201d Masters and Lamon have sown more doubt about the results of the 2020 election even as they accept that Congress certified Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cDo I look back at what happened in November and see a really crazy, opaque, messy process that we shouldn\u2019t be making excuses for? Absolutely,\u201d Masters told CNN Tuesday. \u201cI think it was messed up.\u201d Lamon has donated millions of dollars to a voter registration group affiliated with prominent election fraud conspiracy theorists, according to Axios. He has taken to the airwaves in a bid for Trump\u2019s attention and possible endorsement, airing a TV ad on enhanced border security in New Jersey, where Trump is spending the summer at his Bedminster golf club. Lamon told CNN in a statement that the election review would \u201chelp ensure that the American people have full confidence that all eligible Arizonans who cast ballots had their votes accurately counted.\u201d When asked who won the 2020 election, Lamon adviser Stephen Puetz wrote, \u201cCongress has certified Joe Biden as the winner and he was sworn in. That\u2019s our process. \u2026 AZ conducting an audit is part of the process as well.\u201d Some Arizona Republicans worry that the state\u2019s election review and questions over the 2020 race will hurt whoever emerges to take on Kelly. McGuire has attempted to separate himself from the others, touting himself as a non-self funder who never has served in elected office. But he also has been the only Republican Senate candidate willing to question the election review. In an interview, McGuire told CNN that Biden was the \u201cduly elected\u201d president and said \u201cthere is no outcome that I see where there is a reversal\u201d of the election because of the audit. He acknowledged that Trump did \u201cvery poorly\u201d among women voters in the Phoenix and Tucson suburbs. He allowed that not all Arizonans have confidence in the integrity of their elections but expressed ambivalence about whether Maricopa\u2019s audit will help or hurt the public\u2019s perception of the state\u2019s election integrity. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this audit will create greater confidence,\u201d he added. The Republican candidates are running on similar platforms warning of price inflation, strengthening border security, and stopping the spread of critical race theory, which was an obscure academic framework for examining how racism is ingrained in American institutions until Trump declared it a villain last year. They all knock Kelly for saying he would be an independent, moderate voice, and link him to Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. That leaves the 2020 election and the candidates\u2019 personal background as the main points of contrast in the primary. \u201cThe party apparatus is deeply entrenched in MAGA and it\u2019s the only litmus test that seems to matter at the moment,\u201d said an Arizona Republican operative. Democrats hope that whoever emerges from the GOP field will be bruised by the primary. Kelly\u2019s fundraising machine is surging, raising $6 million in the second quarter of the year, and stockpiling nearly $7.6 million in a war chest. Republicans are far behind, although some can bank on outside Super PACs or the ability to fund their campaigns. After about a month in the race, Brnovich raised about $438,000, while McGuire raised $226,500 and loaned his campaign another $200,000. Lamon raised $223,000 and loaned his campaign $2 million. Masters announced after the June filing deadline but can rely upon Thiel\u2019s largesse. \u201cThe issues that we\u2019re facing in the state and across the country are significant,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis is a distraction.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s no secret that America\u2019s partisan divide runs deep. And among all 14 of the country\u2019s major institutions, Americans\u2019 political affiliations have the biggest impact on their confidence in the presidency, according to a recent Gallup poll. There\u2019s a whopping 49-point difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to confidence in the presidency. Among Democrats, 61% say they have confidence in the president, while a meager 13% of Republicans say they have confidence in the highest office in the land. The poll gauged confidence in America\u2019s major institutions like the police, Congress, the criminal justice system and organized religion. All have partisan splits, but none as great as the divide over the presidency. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Here\u2019s how Gallup\u2019s Megan Brenan puts it: Confidence in the presidency has become increasingly linked to the party affiliation of the president, with supporters of the president\u2019s party much more confident than supporters of the opposition party, consistent with the greater party polarization in presidential job approval ratings. Between 1993 and 2004, the average party gap in confidence in the presidency was 34 points. Since then, it has averaged 50 points. That tracks! This stark polarization is playing out in other aspects of our lives. Just look at a state-based map of vaccinated Americans next to the 2020 presidential election results. There\u2019s a real connection between Trump-supporting states and lower rates of vaccination compared with Biden-supporting states with higher rates of vaccination. But that polarization goes far, far beyond Covid-19. Some red states are passing laws to restrict voting rights while blue states move in the opposite direction. Other red-state governors have sent National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border as immigration continues to be a hot-button issue on the state level. Then there\u2019s legislation to counter the GOP\u2019s lighting-rod social issues like critical race theory and transgender representation in sports. This poll is just the latest example that Americans with different political affiliations have increasingly divergent views on \u2026 just about everything. The Point: This goes to show President Joe Biden faces major (and worsening) inertia in his efforts to unite the country. He has a lot of work to do specifically to overcome that lack of confidence from Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat who is running for a second term next year, has been working behind the scenes to help craft a bipartisan infrastructure deal that could be popular in her swing state. But she soon will have to make a decision that is bound to be much more divisive: whether to endorse the Democrats\u2019 more sweeping $3.5 trillion proposal to expand the social safety net, overhaul immigration laws, grow Medicare and Obamacare, combat climate change and raise corporate taxes to help pay for it. \u201cI\u2019ve just been focusing on the bipartisan infrastructure negotiations right now,\u201d Hassan said when asked about the massive price tag, sidestepping questions about her party\u2019s $3.5 trillion proposal \u2013 just as a number of her more moderate colleagues have done so far. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has set a Wednesday deadline to get all 50 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus on board behind their party\u2019s plan, which would fulfill much of President Joe Biden\u2019s economic agenda. But while liberals are mostly falling in line behind the partisan approach, the caucus\u2019s more centrist members have yet to commit, a sign of the land mines facing a Democratic leader who has no margin for error. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who has already said he\u2019s \u201cvery, very disturbed\u201d by the climate provisions in the proposal, was blunt when asked if he would be able to agree to the $3.5 trillion plan by Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Manchin said. Every Democratic vote will be necessary for Schumer to pass more than $4 trillion worth of Biden\u2019s agenda along two separate tracks. Schumer also set a first procedural vote for Wednesday to take up a smaller, bipartisan plan with roughly $600 billion in new spending focused mainly on \u201chard\u201d infrastructure \u2013 such as roads, bridges and broadband. Those talks are still ongoing with negotiators struggling with finalizing ways to finance the plan without raising taxes. At the same time, Schumer has asked all 50 Democrats to give some level of assurance that they\u2019d support moving ahead with a budget resolution that would set the stage for passing the larger $3.5 trillion package this fall. A Democratic source familiar with the planning said there\u2019s a reason for the request: Some of the Senate\u2019s progressives are wary of backing the bipartisan deal and will do so only if all 50 members of their caucus agree to the larger, party-line approach. With time ticking before the August recess, and midterm campaigning soon to get into full swing, Schumer needed to amp up pressure to get the bipartisan deal done \u2013 while urging his colleagues to fall in line in an attempt to get both bills to Biden\u2019s desk in September. While Schumer wants total party unity on both approaches, the budget resolution has not yet been written, with only rough outlines released so far, making it hard for some members of the caucus to commit to backing it. The bipartisan talks have not concluded either, with Republicans threatening to revolt against Schumer\u2019s deadline if the negotiations aren\u2019t finished by Wednesday. For the bipartisan plan to succeed, they\u2019ll need all 50 Democrats to back it \u2013 along with at least 10 Republicans \u2013 to break a filibuster attempt. But the partisan approach is different: It is moving through a budget process \u2013 known on Capitol Hill as reconciliation \u2013 and that requires only a simple majority, meaning it can pass along straight party-lines in the 50-50 Senate. Biden's bipartisan infrastructure deal could face key Senate GOP defections Yet any Democrat can defect and kill it. How some of the more moderate members will come down remains a key question. \u201cI\u2019ve been focused on a bipartisan compromise,\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, a freshman from Arizona who faces reelection next year, when asked about the $3.5 trillion plan. \u201cAnything that\u2019s going to be proposed I\u2019ll have to look at the details of what\u2019s in it.\u201d His counterpart from Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, who is helping lead the bipartisan talks, pointedly refused to answer questions about the $3.5 trillion price tag when asked repeatedly on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Sinema said when asked about Schumer\u2019s Wednesday deadline. Sinema\u2019s office told CNN she\u2019ll be looking at the details of the reconciliation proposal, rather than any specific top-line dollar amount, to determine if she\u2019ll back the measure and consider it good for her state. Even if Schumer can get support for an initial vote on the budget, that\u2019s just the first step. The budget itself will not include all that much detail on what will actually be a part of the Democrats\u2019 own bill, which will head to the floor in September. Instead the budget resolution sets a top-line spending target for each committee to write its own legislation. That means Democrats would ultimately have to go back and vote again after the final bill is finished, when all the intricate details that can make or break a bill will be included. But they first have to approve the budget resolution, which Schumer wants to pass the Senate before the August recess. In the lead-up to the announcement of a budget deal earlier in the week, talks had already begun in earnest with moderate Democrats. Schumer knew his colleagues couldn\u2019t be blindsided, and Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the Budget Committee and is seen as a close ally to the moderates, took the helm as a leader in helping communicate their point of view in the negotiations. In a nod to more centrist members, Democrats are vowing that their plan will be fully paid for, an assurance that helped win the backing of the 11 Democratic members of the committee whose views span the ideological spectrum of the caucus. Yet despite a series of informal discussions, an aide familiar with the matter tells CNN, moderate Democrats never promised they\u2019d back the committee\u2019s proposal. They did make it clear they would not back the initial proposal from Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders that totaled a whopping $6 trillion, a major reason why that number was pulled back. The uncertainty on the budget comes as Democrats are just weeks from their scheduled August recess. When lawmakers return in September, they\u2019ll be confronted with a spending deadline and a looming need to increase the debt ceiling. The efforts will also be bumping up against the unofficial start of the 2022 midterm election cycle, which may make it harder for members on the ballot to vote for tax increases even if they would affect only those who make more than $400,000 a year. Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who referred to the $3.5 trillion as a \u201cs\u2014 pile of dough\u201d earlier this week, suggested he\u2019s open to the price tag but needs to look at the details more closely. But the moderate Democrat didn\u2019t seem too concerned about the pressure Schumer is placing on his members. \u201cI think he\u2019s pushing,\u201d Tester said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.",

            "article_content": "Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the bestselling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d disparaged then-President Donald Trump as a \u201cmoral disaster\u201d whose administration had \u201cno domestic policy agenda besides tax cuts\u201d in Twitter direct messages from summer 2017. Vance made the comments, which were sent to a former friend from law school and obtained and verified by CNN\u2019s KFile, in the context of stating his opposition to the American Health Care Act \u2013 the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, which passed the House but not the Senate. Vance said he would attempt to personally lobby members of Congress to kill the bill. \u201cCan you imagine running as an anti-AHCA populist who thinks Trump is a moral disaster,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cWhere\u2019s my constituency?\u201d In other anti-Trump comments from 2016, 2017 and 2018 found by CNN\u2019s KFile in a review of Vance\u2019s media appearances, he agreed that then-candidate Trump was a fraud who he didn\u2019t think cared about people and said he might vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 if he really believed Trump could win. \u201cI cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud. Well, I think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people,\u201d Kentucky radio host Matt Jones said to Vance in August 2016. \u201cI do too,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cI agree with you on Trump, because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks. I think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored. They feel left out and they feel very frustrated. And I think of course in a lot of ways they feel that way for totally justifiable reasons. So it\u2019s a problem that Trump has been the vessel of a lot of that frustration.\u201d Vance entered the crowded primary to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman in early July. The field already included former State Treasurer Josh Mandel, former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons. But after his announcement, Vance had to immediately apologize for now-deleted tweets sent in 2016, uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile, in which he disparaged Trump as \u201creprehensible\u201d and said he would be voting for third-party candidate Evan McMullin. Vance declined to comment for this story. In an interview with NPR in August 2016, Vance said he might even vote for Clinton. \u201cI think there\u2019s a chance, if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Vance said. Trump\u2019s policies related to immigration were overly simplistic, Vance said in September 2016, citing Trump\u2019s message on building a wall on the southern US border. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d After Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Vance\u2019s public criticisms of Trump\u2019s moral behavior became less frequent, but he continued to criticize him on policy and predicted a scandal-ridden presidency. \u201cI think we\u2019re in for quite a ride,\u201d Vance wrote in a since-deleted January 2017 tweet, available through the Internet Archive, when asked about potential scandals. \u201cCan\u2019t be repeated enough,\u201d Vance added in February 2017 on the same day Trump spoke about America\u2019s trade policies. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about America\u2019s economic interest, focus more on automation/education than trade protectionism.\u201d In January 2018, Vance announced that he would not seek to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in that year\u2019s election, saying that \u201cit\u2019s just not a good time\u201d and he had \u201cthought seriously about running in August 2017.\u201d A month after his announcement, he still said he wasn\u2019t sure the Trump administration had long-term policies that would improve people\u2019s lives. \u201cThe part that is forward-looking and answers the question \u2018What do we do now?\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s just not there yet,\u201d Vance told the Financial Times in February 2018, suggesting  Trump relied too much on standard Republican orthodoxy from the Reagan years. But by 2019, Vance\u2019s views on Trump began to shift to be more publicly supportive of him on policy. In June 2019, Vance said he thought Trump had been a \u201cwild success\u201d with his China and Middle East foreign policy. He said Trump completely transformed American policy regarding China by taking a harsher stance against the country and that, unlike former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, Trump had avoided getting the US into any \u201cstupid\u201d wars in the Middle East. Vance, however, was still critical of Republican health care legislation. \u201cI think about the healthcare legislation, which I think was genuinely a moral and political disaster and I\u2019m glad that it never passed,\u201d he said. In March 2021, before launching his Senate campaign, Vance publicly declared that his support for Trump was based on policy. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the policy was going to be that good, and the policy was much better than I thought it was going to be,\u201d he told radio host Sebastian Gorka. \u201cI was really happy with the policy. And so, that\u2019s what caused me to become a Trump supporter.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden took office vowing to chart a different course on immigration than his predecessor. He repealed Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, halted construction on the border wall and proposed a path to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. He ended the Trump-era program that forced asylum seekers to remain in Mexico until their court hearings in the US, and set up a task force to reunite families previously separated at the southern border. But during all of Biden\u2019s attempts to roll back the restrictive immigration policies and anti-immigrant rhetoric of the Trump administration, one state has stood ready to counter him at nearly every turn: Texas. Since January, Texas has filed five lawsuits against the Biden administration challenging its immigration policies. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, has announced a plan to arrest more migrants and build his own border wall, and recently hosted Trump at the southern border. When it comes to immigration, Texas has long been \u201ca thorn in the side of the federal government,\u201d says Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. But while the state traditionally waged its battles in court, Abbott\u2019s latest actions signal something different. \u201cThe political optics of this new chapter cannot be underestimated,\u201d Chishti said. Here are some of the ways Texas has tried to block Biden on immigration \u2013 and what they mean for the border and beyond. On his very first day in office, Biden announced a 100-day pause on deportations. The moratorium, which included some exceptions, was intended to allow time for federal immigration agencies to review their policies, evaluate how resources were being directed and set new priorities for enforcement, according to a memo from the Department of Homeland Security. Two days after the announcement, Texas sued the Biden administration over the decision. In the lawsuit, state attorney general Ken Paxton argued, in part, that the move violated an 11th-hour agreement between Texas and the Trump administration that required the Department of Homeland Security to consult with the state before changing or modifying policies. A federal judge in Texas has since blocked Biden\u2019s pause on deportations indefinitely. In March, the Biden administration announced it had stopped implementing a Trump-era rule that allowed the government to deny legal status to immigrants who need, or are likely to need, public assistance. The 2019 policy, known as the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, had been met with legal challenges from advocates, states and localities, who argued that it penalized those who used government assistance. After Biden took office, his administration also said it would no longer defend the rule in court. Texas and 13 other Republican-led states responded by filing a bid with the Supreme Court seeking to uphold the rule. The Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear the case, saying the states would first have to go to the lower court to make their request. On April 6, Texas sued the Biden administration over its new immigration enforcement guidelines, specifically policies around deporting undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of crimes. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton alleged the federal government was \u201crefusing to take custody\u201d of immigrants with felony convictions and that it had implemented unlawful guidance allowing them to \u201croam free.\u201d The Biden administration had directed officials earlier in the year to prioritize deporting immigrants who pose threats to national security, border security or public safety. Paxton alleged that the policy change led the federal government to release immigrants convicted of drug offenses or \u201ccrimes of moral turpitude,\u201d saying it rescinded detainer requests against several people in Texas. Texas asked the court to halt the policy change and require the federal government to take immigrants with criminal records into custody. The case is currently pending in a federal district court. A week after the April 6 lawsuit, Texas sued the Biden administration again \u2013 this time seeking to reinstate a Trump-era policy that required asylum seekers at the southern border to remain in Mexico until their court hearings in the US. Those subject to the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols, were often forced to wait months, if not years, in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. Texas, along with Missouri, alleged in the lawsuit that the Biden administration\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious decision\u201d to end the policy resulted in a surge of Central American migrants at the border which is straining federal immigration resources, posing public safety risks and inflicting costs on both states. The border is still operating under a Trump-era pandemic policy that\u2019s allowed border authorities to turn away migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border, barring some exceptions. On April 22, Texas sued the Biden administration over its immigration policies a fifth time. That lawsuit argued that the federal government was putting Texans at risk by allowing migrants \u201cpotentially affected with Covid-19\u201d to cross into the US, where they could end up in crowded facilities. Paxton accused the Biden administration of failing to apply a Trump-era policy, still in effect, that permitted officials to swiftly expel migrants. He also argued the administration failed to enforce a federal law that required immigrants who might transmit diseases of \u201cpublic health significance\u201d to be detained. While its legal challenges played out in court, Texas began ramping up migrant arrests. In March, Abbott launched what he called Operation Lone Star, an initiative that deployed state troopers and National Guard members to the southern border. State law enforcement made more than 1,000 arrests in the months after, according to Abbott\u2019s office. The governor continued to expand on those efforts, issuing a disaster declaration at the end of May over the increase in migrants crossing the border. In it, he directed state law enforcement to \u201cenforce all federal and state criminal laws, including criminal trespassing, smuggling, and human trafficking.\u201d In June, Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey asked other states to send their own law enforcement resources to the border \u2013 a call that many Republican leaders across the country answered. That same month, Abbott announced the state would start arresting migrants who trespass on private property. To detain all the people arrested as a result of this increased enforcement, Texas began emptying out a prison that holds up to 1,000 people, the Texas Tribune reported. As part of his disaster declaration, Abbott also directed a state agency to revoke the licenses of shelters that contract with the federal government to house migrant children. Shortly after, Texas officials sent notices to the state-licensed facilities that serve unaccompanied minors, asking them to \u201cwind down\u201d operations by August 30, Houston Public Media and CNN reported. The state has up to 52 such facilities that house about 4,200 children as of mid-May, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The Biden administration threatened to sue Texas over the move. But in a June 11 letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, Abbott indicated he had no intention of backing down. Biden halted construction on Trump\u2019s border wall on his first day in office. He also moved to end the national emergency declaration that had allowed Trump to dip into additional federal funds for the wall. That wouldn\u2019t be the end of the project, however. Abbott assumed the mantle in June when he announced Texas would begin building its own barrier between the state and Mexico. Later that month, Abbott, Trump and other Republicans paid a visit to the border and discussed efforts to build the wall. The governor said the state would direct about $250 million from its budget toward the wall as a \u201cdown payment,\u201d while more than $450,000 had come in from private donations as of late June, the Texas Tribune reported. Abbott hasn\u2019t yet said how much the project will cost in total or when and how exactly it would be constructed, and significant practical and legal questions remain. But he\u2019s making every effort to keep Trump\u2019s border wall dream alive. Abbott\u2019s office says that his challenges to the federal government are \u201cnothing new, dating back to the Obama administration\u201d and that border security is simply a matter of public safety. \u201cIn just five months, the Biden Administration has done everything it can to reverse President Trump\u2019s border strategy, and President Biden\u2019s reckless open border policies have led to a disaster at our southern border,\u201d the governor\u2019s press secretary Renae Eze said in a statement to CNN. \u201cUntil the Biden Administration starts doing their job, Texas is stepping up to secure our southern border and protect Texans.\u201d Indeed, if you consider how much Texans care about immigration and border security, the state\u2019s recent actions might not be so surprising. Texas voters in June named immigration and border security as the two most important issues facing the state, according to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll. That\u2019s even more true for Republican voters. It\u2019s also difficult to ignore that Abbott is up for re-election in 2022 and faces primary challenges from within his party. Those realities may help explain some of his more recent actions, including moving to revoke licenses for shelters housing migrant children and deploying more state police to the border, which don\u2019t necessarily carry a broad appeal. \u201cWhen I see behavior like that anywhere, when somebody takes these very public positions on something where they\u2019re tacking to the right, it\u2019s because they\u2019re worried about a primary,\u201d said Ruth Wasem, a professor of public policy practice at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. Some political observers believe Abbott is also setting the stage for a 2024 presidential run if Trump stays out of the race. It\u2019s why he\u2019s gone further than just anti-immigrant rhetoric, said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University and a longtime expert on Texas politics. \u201cAbbott has taken the view that while talk is an important and necessary part of performative politics, of capturing the attention and retaining the support of your Republican base, since Trump became president you actually benefit by doing something,\u201d he said. But whether Abbott\u2019s plans can meaningfully be implemented is another story, Chishti said. Building a contiguous border wall would require Texas to acquire land from private landowners \u2013 something that the state\u2019s laws on eminent domain could make difficult. And a wall would do little to deter the increasing number of families and unaccompanied children arriving at the border to seek asylum. Revoking the state licenses of facilities that house migrant children, meanwhile, wouldn\u2019t affect levels of unauthorized immigration. What\u2019s clear to the experts CNN spoke to is that Texas\u2019 recent actions around the border have a lot to do with politics. And in Texas, getting tough on immigration is often a way to score political points. CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, Ariane de Vogue and Geneva Sands contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A California judge on Monday denied Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s request to have his party affiliation listed on the state\u2019s upcoming recall election ballot. Newsom had sued his own secretary of state last month to be listed as a Democrat on the ballot following what he called a filing \u201cmistake\u201d by his election attorney last year. The California Democrat was supposed to mark his party affiliation in February 2020 pursuant to the state\u2019s recall election law, but \u201cdue to an inadvertent but good faith mistake on the part of his election attorney, Newsom timely filed his answer but did not include his party-preference election,\u201d the lawsuit said. Sacramento Superior Court Judge James Arguelles wrote in his ruling Monday that the \u201ccircumstances do not justify excuse from the deadline.\u201d It is clear, he wrote, \u201cfrom both the text and the legislative history that SB 151 does not consider information about an elected officer\u2019s party affiliation so vital to voters that it must be included on the ballot.\u201d The ruling brings a new wrinkle to Newsom\u2019s efforts to stay in office as he faces the second election in state history to recall a sitting governor. State officials confirmed last month that a recall election would proceed after just 43 people withdrew their signatures from petitions to recall the governor during a 30-day window required by state law. The recall election is scheduled for September 14. The recall drive has been fueled by anger over the restrictions Newsom put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 throughout last year and during an alarming surge in cases in California during the winter holiday months. Critics of Newsom had met the state\u2019s threshold for a recall election in April following a sprawling effort to gather signatures in every county that was backed by key Republican strategists. But Newsom and his team have framed the recall as an effort by supporters of former President Donald Trump and right-wing extremists to wrest control of the government from progressives. \u201cIt is what it is. This is a Republican recall,\u201d Newsom said in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year. \u201cAn RNC-backed Republican recall of White supremacists, anti-Semites and people who are opposed to immigration and immigrants is an accurate assessment of who\u2019s behind this recall.\u201d Elected officials subject to recall elections in California historically had not been authorized to include their political party preferences until Newsom signed a law in 2019 that enabled them to do so. In September, the state\u2019s voters will be asked two questions on the recall ballot. First, do they want to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on recalling Newsom, who was elected in 2018 with nearly 62% of the vote. The second question is which candidate they would like to replace Newsom. Voters will choose from what is likely to be a very long list of names. By law, Newsom is not permitted to add his name to the ballot as an option.",

            "article_content": "Nothing can destroy former President Donald Trump in the eyes of those who love him, one reason why his hold on American politics remains formidable. The ex-President showed this weekend that defeat after a single term, the disgrace of his insurrection against American democracy and the deaths of 400,000 Americans on his watch in a pandemic he downplayed don\u2019t hurt his appeal to Republicans. In fact, the efforts of potential 2024 rivals to replicate his extremism show Trump\u2019s strange magic is only validated by his transgressions. The former President was the star turn at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas Sunday \u2014 an organization that once lionized a champion of global democracy, President Ronald Reagan, yet has morphed into a Trump cult. \u201cWe were doing so well until the rigged election happened to come along,\u201d Trump said, voicing the lie at the center of the conference that he has made the entry point for GOP candidates in 2022, potentially poisoning US elections for years. There is an argument that a former President who is out of power but still desperate for attention should just be ignored. Certainly, a rambling, vain and lie-filled speech by Trump lacked coherence and any kind of aspirational appeal, instead highlighting his characteristic cocktail of racial demagoguery, personal swipes at enemies, mountainous falsehoods and desperate trawling for personal adulation. To an outsider, it may have come across as tedious and a pale imitation of the rollicking and sometimes even humorous appearances that paved Trump\u2019s path to power in 2016. But in hitting every sensitive hot spot in the conservative media canon \u2014 from law and order to \u201ccancel culture\u201d to immigration, to complaints that all the media speaks about is \u201crace, race, race,\u201d Trump demonstrated his still unmatched capacity to sell outrage politics. But more than that, he demonstrated his ability to conjure an alternative belief system that is divorced from reality but that his supporters immediately adopt \u2014 the hallmark of strongmen leaders throughout history. Trump wins the CPAC straw poll as attendees clamor for him to run again He for instance launched into a searing attack against former Attorney General William Barr, who for most of his time in office acted as a political shield for Trump\u2019s crushing of political norms but drew the line at his election lies. \u201cI said, \u2018Bill, you got to move your ass. Our country is under attack,\u2019 \u201d the former President said, thus confirming his own unprecedented assault on US democratic institutions while complaining that Barr had not authorized investigations into false claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania. His admission underscored yet again that even the most zealous enablers who fail to buy into his abuses of power are sooner or later branded by the ex-President as heretics. Trump is not just popular at CPAC where the crowd greeted his speech with glee. That his populist extremism is now being implemented by GOP governors across states he won shows his enduring power. So do the countrywide efforts by Republican state lawmakers to restrict voting based on his lies about a stolen election. Trump\u2019s capacity to orchestrate the behavior of Republicans is almost as intact as it was when he was sitting in the Oval Office \u2014 his derailing of a bipartisan, independent probe of the January 6 outrage is proof of that. All these are reasons why Trump cannot be just disregarded. Six months after his supporters ransacked the US Capitol \u2014 amid an effort by top GOP officials to reinvent the history of that moment, the former President\u2019s threat to American democracy remains extreme. And even if Trump never runs for President again \u2014 and he gives every impression of already being launched on a four-year campaign \u2014 the brand of grievance politics he invented and maintains will be on the ballot \u2014 as his list of possible heirs, from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, shows. So while much of Trump\u2019s speech was backward looking, providing a rosy and untrue picture of an administration that left his country deeply divided, the false belief system that has captured the hearts and minds of millions of voters is real. The crucial question is whether the message that is so electric to Trump\u2019s supporters will still cause the kind of revulsion among suburban and more moderate voters who deserted Trump\u2019s GOP and saw him lose the House, the Senate and the White House over a single four-year term. Trump's false election claims persist at conservative gathering in Texas And could another messenger like DeSantis or Noem, or Texas Gov. Greg Abbott make it quite so bewitching to the conservative base? The former President is relentless on targeting issues like undocumented migration, the calls by some liberals to defund the police and the rising crime wave to paint the country as out of control and under the sway of far left wingers \u2013 as a possible route to broadening his appeal. But his continued torching of truth comes at a time when President Joe Biden is noticeably all but ignoring his predecessor, positioning himself as a moderate, traditional commander-in-chief. This week, Biden will discuss gun violence and crime in the cities that has spiked as the pandemic eases its grip. He will likely plead with Americans again to get vaccinated to finally defeat Covid-19 \u2014 even as Trump acolytes like Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado claim the government vaccine effort is akin to Nazism. But even as Biden tries to carry out his vow to unite the country and to work across the aisle with Republicans on infrastructure reform for instance, it\u2019s clear that ultimately the biggest impediment he faces is from Trump\u2019s undiminished power. CPAC was for instance an example in microcosm of the fact that much of America\u2019s voting public now lives in an alternative reality in which Trump won the election and Biden lost. Speaker after speaker alluded to election fraud \u2014 despite the lack of any evidence that stood up in any of Trump\u2019s failed legal and political attempts to overturn a free and fair elections. His behavior underscored yet again that the regular battle between conservatism and liberalism over the meaning of America itself has been superseded. One political party is still deep in thrall of a leader who never stops lying and is dedicated to overturning the US democratic political system itself. At one moment on Saturday, which exemplified the grip of ideology on the right, the CPAC crowd cheered the fact that Biden missed his vaccine goal, with more than 30% of adults \u2013 most of them in conservative states being hit by the Delta variant of Covid-19, still yet to get at least one dose. That reaction shocked the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been made a scapegoat by conservatives keen to cover up Trump\u2019s own disastrous handling of the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying. They are cheering about someone saying that it\u2019s a good thing for people not to try and save their lives,\u201d Fauci told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Fauci says Americans who are fully vaccinated do not need booster shots at this time It was noticeable that while Trump demanded rightful recognition for the vaccine that was developed under his administration \u2014 as he claimed to have saved 100 million lives \u2014 he made no call for people to get vaccinated. The ex-President\u2019s reluctance to spend his political capital on a matter that conflicts with the orthodoxy of many conservatives and that could save thousands of lives remains striking, even after he spent months during the early stages of the pandemic trashing science-based public health guidance. And Trump had the power to change minds at the CPAC gathering since 70% of attendees who took part in an unscientific straw poll chose him as their preferred candidate for 2024. The worst public health crisis in 100 years has now fallen prey to the same relentless churn of misinformation and lies which has stifled the truth of what happened last November in conservative circles. Trump bills his multiple failures in a crisis which he promised would simply \u201cgo away\u201d as a massive triumph. And the potential candidate many conservatives would like to see on a ticket with him in 2024, Noem of South Dakota, is billing her refusal to adopt basic public health guidelines that save lives as a political virtue. Kristi Noem criticizes GOP governors who enacted Covid-19 mandates while accusing some of rewriting their history \u201cWe\u2019ve got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn\u2019t shut down their states; that they didn\u2019t close their regions; that they didn\u2019t mandate masks,\u201d Noem said at CPAC. She appeared to be drawing a contrast with DeSantis and Abbott \u2014 who took a more restrictive but still lax approach \u2014 with a future Republican primary debate in mind. \u201cNow I\u2019m not picking fights with Republican governors. All I\u2019m saying is that we need leaders with grit.\u201d The fact that her largely rural state, with few of the big cities that helped Covid spread quickly, had 230 deaths per 100,000 people, according to data from Johns Hopkins University \u2013 ranking it 10th in that metric among the 50 states \u2014 raises serious questions about Noem\u2019s record. As does the reality that South Dakota also had 14,090 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people, giving it the third highest rate in the nation. But as Trump has shown, an ability to reinvent the truth and to ignore reality might be the most important asset in a potential presidential candidate, in the Republican Party, three years before the next election.

            "article_content": "While July Fourth is the holiday that most directly celebrates Americans\u2019 common heritage, this year it comes as their extreme divides underscore how difficult it has become for any president to set a unified direction for the country. From vaccination rates to voting rights, from immigration policy to racial equity, blue and red states are hurtling in antithetical directions at staggering speed, even amid President Joe Biden\u2019s persistent calls for greater national unity and his attempts to foster more bipartisan agreement in Washington. Across all of these issues, and more, Republican-controlled states are pursuing policies that amount to a wholesale effort to counter Biden\u2019s direction at the national level \u2013 even as they look to block some of his key initiatives with lawsuits. In some ways, the red state recoil from Biden\u2019s agenda echoes the \u201cresistance\u201d that exploded in Democratic-controlled states to Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous presidency; in other ways, today\u2019s actions in red states may constitute even greater evidence of the country pulling apart. Especially striking is that, as during last year\u2019s lockdowns and mask mandates, the separation between red and blue America is occurring not only at the level of government policy, but also in individual behavior, with all studies showing Republicans are being vaccinated against the coronavirus at a much lower rate than Democrats. Taken together, these centrifugal pressures call into question not only the ability of any president to unify the nation, but also his or her ability even to chart a common course for more than roughly half of the country \u2013 either red or blue America. This divergence, across a wide range of issues and personal choices, is rooted in the continuing political re-sorting that has divided the parties more sharply than ever along demographic and geographic lines and produced two political coalitions holding inimical views on the fundamental social and economic changes remaking America. And that destabilizing process shows no signs of slowing, much less reversing, even after Trump \u2013 who fomented division as a central component of his political strategy \u2013 has left the White House. \u201cThis is the long arc of history,\u201d says Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at UCLA and one of the founders of the NationScape polling project studying American attitudes. \u201cThere are these moments that exacerbate things, like Trump running for that nomination in 2016: If he hadn\u2019t run, the sorting would probably be taking a little longer. But it was always marching in that direction. You try to just ask yourself what stops it, or what reverses it, or what slows it? \u2026 I can\u2019t come up with a good answer to that question.\u201d The most common way to measure the daunting distance between red and blue America is through voting behavior and attitudes in public opinion polls. Polling has shown that the gap between voters from the two parties in their approval ratings for a newly elected president has steadily widened over recent decades. For Biden, despite all his efforts to govern as a unifying figure, that gap has reached a mountainous height: an ABC/Washington Post poll released on Saturday found that his approval rating among Democrats (at 94%) was 86 points above his rating among Republicans (8%). These results came even as the nonpartisan Pew Research Center last week released its \u201cvalidated voters\u201d study, one of the most respected efforts to quantify how the key groups in the electorate voted in last November\u2019s presidential election. Although the study found some shifts from the 2016 election (with Trump, for instance, improving among Hispanics and Biden gaining some ground among White men both with and without college degrees), mostly it recorded extraordinary stability in the lines of division between the parties over both elections. Other studies of the electorate\u2019s behavior, from the media exit polls to the Cooperative Election Study sponsored by a consortium of academic researchers, have also concluded that continuity far exceeded change when comparing 2020 with 2016. \u201cTo the extent we see differences between 2016 and 2020 we are talking about very marginal ones,\u201d says Tufts University political scientist Brian Schaffner, a co-director of the Cooperative Election Study. One of the most important reasons why Democrats and Republicans intensely dislike each other is that they intensely disagree on a wide range of issues including the size and scope of the welfare state, abortion, gay and transgender rights, race relations, climate change, gun control and immigration. Alan Abramowitz, Emory University political scientist This stability may seem surprising after all the emotional and even unprecedented events of the Trump presidency, capped by a once-in-a-century pandemic that disrupted every aspect of daily life. But political scientists like Vavreck and Alan Abramowitz of Emory University say the continuity between the two elections reflects the intractability of the differences between voters in the two partisan coalitions. Reinforcing that picture is the striking finding that Biden\u2019s current approval rating, both overall and among the electorate\u2019s major groups, hasn\u2019t really changed much from his vote among them last fall, even though Americans are expressing much more optimism about the country\u2019s direction as society reopens and the economy recovers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to see an election anymore where a president wins with 52 or 53% of the vote and then has a 62% approval rating,\u201d says Republican pollster Glen Bolger. While some analysts have asserted that political polarization is driven primarily by leaders like Trump who encourage it, Abramowitz argues that today it is grounded in a much more intractable dynamic: As the electorate has sorted between the parties on lines of race, education, generation, religion and geography, the rank and file of each coalition now holds more ideologically consistent views on the core questions facing America \u2013 and those views are more consistently hostile to the perspective on the other side. In an upcoming paper he shared with CNN, Abramowitz notes that long-term survey data shows that compared with the 1970s, voters in each party now hold much more negative views of the other party and its presidential nominee. That hostility, he argues, is rooted in these fundamentally clashing worldviews. \u201cOne of the most important reasons why Democrats and Republicans intensely dislike each other is that they intensely disagree on a wide range of issues including the size and scope of the welfare state, abortion, gay and transgender rights, race relations, climate change, gun control and immigration,\u201d Abramowitz writes. \u201cAs long as the parties remain on the opposite sides of almost all of the major issues facing the country, feelings of mistrust and animosity are unlikely to diminish even if Donald Trump ceases to play a major role in the political process.\u201d This year\u2019s sharp turn to the right in red states has provided immediate evidence to support that prediction. Red states have erupted in what looks like a spasm of resistance to the left-leaning tilt in national policy that Democrats are executing through their unified control of Washington. As I\u2019ve written, Republican-controlled states this year are advancing aggressively conservative initiatives across a panoramic array of issues. Among other things, red states are moving to loosen restrictions on gun owners and tighten (or even potentially eliminate) access to legal abortion; toughen penalties on public protesters; block transgender teens from competing in school sports; bar local governments from reducing their police budgets; and ban school curriculums that look to examine racism in American history. School board members in New York wanted to embrace diversity, but hecklers had other plans Most of these policies steer in precisely the opposite direction that Biden is trying to set at the national level. Nine red states, for instance, have passed laws limiting or entirely blocking the ability of local law enforcement officials to enforce federal gun laws. But nowhere is this red state attempt to counter the President\u2019s national direction more tangible than on immigration. As Biden has moved to reverse many of Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies, Republican attorneys general led by Texas\u2019 Ken Paxton have already sued to block several of the new administration\u2019s immigration initiatives. Even more provocatively, Republican governors from states including Florida, Arkansas, Ohio and Tennessee have deployed National Guard troops or other law enforcement from their states to Texas\u2019 border with Mexico in response to requests from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, even though the federal government retains sole enforcement power there and National Guard members cannot apprehend undocumented migrants. \u201cThis is definitely red states saying we want the kind of restrictive policies that Biden is dismantling,\u201d says Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service for President Bill Clinton.   Meissner says it\u2019s possible to interpret these deployments as the mirror image of the \u201csanctuary\u201d policies that Democratic-controlled cities and the state of California instituted to limit their cooperation with Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement agenda. But Republicans have taken their resistance to a new level, she notes, in also seeking to counter Biden\u2019s plan by mobilizing private resources from politically sympathetic supporters. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, like Abbott a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, announced last week that a conservative billionaire was funding the deployment of the South Dakota Guard to the Texas border. Abbott has already set up a website to solicit public donations to continue building the wall along the Texas border that Trump pursued but Biden has abandoned. As on immigration, red states are directly confronting Biden on voting rights. Republican-controlled states from Florida, Georgia and Arkansas to Iowa, Montana and Arizona this year have approved a torrent of measures making it more difficult to vote, almost all of them with virtually every state legislative Republican voting yes and nearly every Democrat voting no. Democrats have responded both by advancing legislation to establish a nationwide floor of voting rights \u2013 such as guaranteed early voting and on-demand absentee balloting \u2013 and with a Justice Department lawsuit against the Georgia law. But after a GOP filibuster recently blocked the Democrats\u2019 federal voting rights legislation, it\u2019s uncertain whether the Democratic Senate majority will revise the chamber\u2019s rules to enable them to pass a modified version of it. And the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices raised huge obstacles to the legal efforts to block the red state offensive on voting with their ruling last week weakening the Voting Rights Act. What Manchin and Sinema can learn from the Lincoln Republicans on voting rights Those twin barriers to national action raise the prospect that the months ahead will see the continued emergence of a two-tier system of American voting, with access becoming increasingly curtailed in red states even as blue states from Virginia to Washington take steps to expand it. A two-tier system is exactly what\u2019s already apparent in utilization of the coronavirus vaccine. All of the 20 states (plus the District of Columbia) where the highest shares of adults have received at least one shot were won last fall by Biden; 20 of the 21 states where the lowest percentage have obtained at least one shot were won by Trump (Georgia, the sole exception, is controlled by a Republican state government). The latest surveys \u2013 including polls from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and the new ABC/Washington Post poll \u2013 find an enormous gulf between the share of Democrats (86% in the ABC/WP) and Republicans (45%) who say they have received at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Stunningly, almost all of the remaining Republicans say they do not expect to get vaccinated at any point. A new study released last week by researchers at UCLA underscores how head-spinning these contrasts are. The paper, from a team of researchers led by anthropology professor Daniel Fessler and graduate student Theodore Samore, notes that studies typically have found that individuals who express socially conservative views typically display more, not less, concern than social liberals about threats like a virus outbreak. But that pattern shattered for the coronavirus outbreak: While the small number of Democrats who identified as social conservatives showed heightened sensitivity to the threat \u2013 measured by their willingness to take steps such as wearing masks and washing hands \u2013 socially conservative Republicans were less willing to engage in any of those behaviors.   The researchers, Samore said, found that rejection of those safety precautions was linked most closely with distrust of scientists, distrust of the mainstream media (and lack of exposure to it) and attitudes of economic conservatism (which may have translated into greater priority on reopening the economy than combating the virus). All of those, of course, are attitudes now common in the modern Republican coalition. \u201cWhat we think is going on here is a clash between people\u2019s inclinations \u2026 and their political beliefs about trusting science or exposure to different media sources,\u201d says Samore. Fessler says these tendencies are reinforced by the social and political sorting that has diminished Americans\u2019 exposure to neighbors of contrasting political views. \u201cYou might be a liberal 20-something, and you might feel not particularly threatened, but if everyone around is saying, \u2018I got vaxxed,\u2019 you can get tipping point effects\u201d that encourage you to do so as well, he says; the opposite, he adds, works in reducing appetite for the vaccine among conservatives. The latest Kaiser poll dramatically underlines Fessler\u2019s observation. Kaiser found that while two-thirds of Democrats say they live in households where everyone has been vaccinated, that\u2019s true for less than 40% of Republicans; nearly that many Republicans, in fact, say they live in households where no one has been vaccinated. The 2021 vaccination map looks like the 2020 election map Fessler says these diverging attitudes on the value of vaccines, despite all the evidence of their effectiveness and safety, encapsulates a much larger problem: the development of information \u201cniches\u201d that allow falsehoods to take root for a large audience. The key \u201cchallenge facing democracies in the 21st century,\u201d he argues, is that \u201cwhile the internet promised the democratization of knowledge \u2013 the idea anyone can learn anything, and the connection of people regardless of geography and personal characteristics \u2013 instead the perverse result has been that it\u2019s possible to occupy one\u2019s own little niche in the information environment.\u201d Because \u201cthere are lots of other people occupying that\u201d same space, he adds, no matter how implausible the ideas being presented in those circles, \u201cour evolved psychology tells us this must be reality because everyone I am interacting with thinks the way that I do.\u201d That dynamic likely helps explain why such a staggeringly large percentage of Republicans accept Trump\u2019s claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though courts uniformly have dismissed his \u201cevidence.\u201d It also helps explain why an ominously large share of Republican voters (especially those who most rely on far-right media sources) even accept the byzantine QAnon conspiracy theory. Divergent information flows are not the only reason that red and blue America are pulling apart; the preference for contrasting information sources, in fact, may be more symptom than cause of the underlying demographic, generational and geographic separation of the parties. Taken together, all of these factors produced an Independence Day weekend when foundational questions of American unity and commitment to democracy seemed more fraught than at any time since the Civil War. The Declaration of Independence that Americans celebrated over the weekend begins with the confident assertion that it is \u201cThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.\u201d Today, it is unclear what set of principles, if any, America\u2019s fractious 50 states might agree on across the widening red-blue divide.",

            "article_content": "Democrats might control the White House and Congress, but Donald Trump-style conservatism is on a roll in Republican states and Washington, raising the stakes for Joe Biden in a summer critical to his goal of a transformational presidency. GOP governors such as Greg Abbott of Texas and Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis are flexing power to implement America First policies as Democrats struggle to maximize their 2020 national mandate to enact their own ambitious reforms. Their aggressive moves on immigration, easing gun restrictions, targeting social media giants and adding restrictive voting laws seem tailored to please the ex-President and, more importantly, to tap into his support base as they prep reelection races that could merge seamlessly into 2024 White House runs. Republican-led state legislatures, meanwhile, are drafting and passing a slew of election laws that discriminate against Democratic voters and threaten nonpartisan election certifications. Changes from Arizona to Texas and Michigan to Florida are all built on Trump\u2019s lies that last year\u2019s election was stolen. While elected GOP officials are implementing Trump brand policies even without him in the Oval Office, the consequences of his presidency are being felt as the new conservative Supreme Court majority shows its colors. The top bench, remade by Trump, again reprieved Obamacare. But it gave the first glimpses of a new era of right-wing jurisprudence by further gutting the Voting Rights Act last week. The decision suggested that Democratic efforts to challenge restrictive GOP voting laws will struggle in court. And it underscored the inability of the majority party in Washington to counter the measures with broad voting rights legislation halted by Senate Republicans with a filibuster blockade. The court\u2019s aggressive tone is leaving progressives even more desperate for 82-year-old liberal justice Stephen Breyer to retire while Senate Democrats have a chance to confirm a replacement. Across the street, Senate Republicans still in thrall to the former President have managed to again block Democratic efforts to subject him to accountability, killing a bipartisan, independent commission to look into the Capitol insurrection. Democrats have since decided to create their own select committee to investigate the deadly riot, though some of Trump\u2019s closest allies in the House are openly vying for a seat on the panel to embolden the ex-President\u2019s defense and derail the probe. Trump is meanwhile cementing his hold on the Republican Party by conducting auditions for the 2022 midterm primaries, as candidates line up to pay the price of admission: perpetuating his democracy-staining lies about voter fraud. The strength of America First policies in the red half of the United States underscores the nation\u2019s gaping political divide since it comes at a time when Biden is more popular than Trump ever was nationally. With an approval rating around 50%, the President has so far appeared to retain the grip on the political middle ground that helped him defeat Trump last November. He used July Fourth celebrations to hail a national rebound after the pandemic, even if a new Delta viral variant and skepticism of vaccines among conservatives made it impossible to declare full independence from Covid-19. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 \u201cOver the past year, we\u2019ve lived through some of our darkest days,\u201d Biden said at a White House party Sunday. \u201cNow I truly believe \u2026 we\u2019re about to see our brightest future,\u201d he added. The success of GOP policymaking outside Washington is piling even more pressure on the White House and Capitol Hill Democrats to make the most of what might be a narrow window of power before the midterm elections next year to pass one of the most ambitious party programs in decades. Biden is seeking quick action on his bipartisan infrastructure deal with Republicans \u2013 a promise kept to voters who bought into his vow to bridge partisan divides. But the deal is fragile, since many Senate Republicans are balking at the complex choreography that will see it moved alongside a huge Democratic spending bill worth up to $6 trillion needed to buy progressive votes. The second bill would include many measures defined by the White House as \u201chuman infrastructure,\u201d including home health care for sick and elderly Americans, and it would likely be financed by a rise in corporate tax rates. The bill has the potential to be one of the most transformative pieces of social legislation passed in years and could significantly tilt the balance of the economy toward less well-off Americans \u2013 a process started by Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue bill. With its practical and ideological impact the measure would be more than a match for the conservative policy engine whirring in the states. But first Biden has to pass it. One question that will be answered over the next couple of years is whether the dive right by Republicans \u2013 which delights the party base \u2013 will further alienate suburban voters who deserted Trump in 2020. At the same time, if Biden can deliver on his agenda he might not only excite his core voters \u2013 whom Democrats badly need to show up en masse in the midterms \u2013 it might also validate his own appeal to centrist voters and even anti-Trump Republicans. The enthusiasm with which Republicans are extending Trump\u2019s political legacy is meanwhile an early indicator that whether the ex-President runs in 2024 or not, his political inheritance will again be on the ballot. In Texas, for instance, Abbott is leading the charge among Republicans seeking to paint a picture of a nation in crisis, riddled by crime and plagued by a tide of undocumented migrants in a bid to wound the Biden presidency. \u201cMr. President, things have changed so quickly and so dramatically under the Biden administration. It\u2019s been amazing and disastrous,\u201d Abbott told Trump last week when the twice-impeached ex-commander in chief visited Texas to accompany the governor on a trip to the US-Mexico border. Abbott has called back the state legislature for a special session in a new bid to pass restrictive voting laws. Democrats initially managed to stall the bills by walking off the floor to deprive Republicans of a quorum needed to hold votes. As he leads Texas in Trump\u2019s image, Abbott has also vowed to build the border wall that the ex-President promised Mexico would pay for, and is soliciting private donations. He will likely fail to raise the billions of dollars needed but his plan is a sign of how electric the issue of immigration remains for GOP voters. In another building block of a potential GOP presidential primary campaign, Abbott made a huge show of signing a bill that allows holstered handguns to be carried in Texas without a permit. Texas is also among Republican-led states that have passed tough new limits on abortion \u2013 part of an apparent wider effort by the conservative movement to elevate the issue to a Supreme Court seen likely to water down abortion rights. Abbott\u2019s border play has not gone unnoticed by other potential GOP presidential primary rivals. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem \u2013 a Trump favorite \u2013 sent a detachment of National Guard troops to a border that conservatives say is insufficiently defended by the Biden administration, using cash from Republican donors. DeSantis grabbed his own headline by announcing last month that he was sending local and state law enforcement officers to Texas and Arizona, saying, \u201cAmerica\u2019s border security crisis impacts every state and every American.\u201d He may have made the most progress of any potential 2024 presidential candidate not named Donald Trump in aligning himself with the issues that electrify the party. From his position in Tallahassee, he emerged as a hero during the pandemic for conservatives who chafed against the masking and social distancing advice of federal health officials. By taking on the cruise industry, DeSantis made a stand against \u201cvaccine passports\u201d \u2013 a hot-button issue on the right. DeSantis and Biden make nice on the national stage But the Florida governor showed a deft touch in putting politics aside when Biden visited bereaved relatives of the victims of the collapsed condo building near Miami, potentially showing he could carve out more moderate appeal. DeSantis is not just implementing policies that Trump might like. He also appears to be trying to move out of the shadow of the former President, who once regarded him as a protege \u2013 a potential cause of future tensions between the two. The Florida governor, for example, recently signed a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in female sports. GOP strategists see the issue as one with appeal wider than their own grass roots as the midterm elections loom. He also gained kudos among voters who believe that Trump has been \u201ccanceled\u201d by social media platforms. In May, DeSantis signed a measure that would allow Floridians to sue Silicon Valley giants that they believe infringe their rights to freedom of speech. And any Big Tech company that \u201cde-platforms any candidate for statewide office\u201d will face fines of $250,000 per day. DeSantis also signed a measure that opponents say grievously curtails the right to demonstrate, as he aimed for a piece of Trump\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d constituency. It is a record that makes DeSantis an emerging hero of the conservative movement \u2013 and a key player in the intensifying ideological battle that will help define Biden\u2019s presidency and the fate of the next two national elections.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump still wants a wall on the southern border. And he said it\u2019s Democrats\u2019 fault it hasn\u2019t happened yet. On this wet, humid Wednesday on the South Texas border, Trump met with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and more than 20 House Republicans and local border officials to discuss efforts to build a wall, an echo of years and campaigns past. The visit served Trump a public space to vent his frustrations, and served as an act of loyalty of sorts for the Republicans clustered around him. It also highlighted Republicans\u2019 desire to push immigration to the forefront amid the ongoing border crisis. Trump flew into the Rio Grande Valley in the morning and sat next to Abbott for a roundtable with Republicans and Texas leaders on efforts to build the wall. He mostly stayed on message during his remarks at the roundtable, touting his administration\u2019s immigration policies, such as building the border wall and his \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. But moments of his past frustrations, including the Russia investigation and his loss in the 2020 presidential election, also popped up during his remarks. Along with the Texas GOP leaders, more than 20 House Republicans traveled to South Texas to participate in the border visit with the former President to make clear they still stand with him, with a handful even not participating in the vote on legislation to create a select committee to investigate the January 6 insurrection. Before the meeting with Trump on Wednesday, the majority of House Republicans arrived at McAllen, Texas, on Tuesday night and visited part of the porous border wall on a tour led by Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. One by one, the House Republicans took turns taking photos and doing livestream interviews with conservative media at an open spot of the border wall near La Joya at midnight Tuesday. Some migrants, mostly young women and children, could be seen walking to turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents near the wall. Conservative Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, translated by a conservative media reporter who spoke Spanish, spoke to women about why they were crossing into the United States and where they originally came from. It\u2019s clear Republicans see the issue on the border as a major talking point ahead of the midterm elections, with hopes to regain control of the House. And Trump is going to help them. The surrounding area of McAllen, made up of four counties in Texas and populated by more than 1 million people who identify predominantly as Hispanic, has seen a dramatic shift in politics in the last year. Republicans came closer than in previous decades to winning a House seat in the district in the 2020 election, giving the party hope they can turn the area red. Democrats in the area and across the country are baffled by the switch. They wonder what\u2019s driving voters to lean Republican when the area has been staunchly Democrat for decades. The shift became clear when Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez came within 4 points of losing his seat to the Republican candidate, Monica De La Cruz-Hernandez, who is again challenging him in the 2022 election. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans, is targeting a handful of vulnerable Democrats, including Gonzalez. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 policies have created a crisis along the border, caused the price of everyday goods to skyrocket, and pursued a damaging socialist agenda that threatens Texas families. The McAllen mayor\u2019s race was the canary in the coal mine for Vicente Gonzalez, who is doomed in 2022,\u201d Michael McAdams, spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN in a statement. Another Democratic congressman who represents a district in the area, Filemon Vela, announced earlier this year he would not run for reelection after he won his last race by 55% in November. A spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, told CNN they are committed to helping Gonzalez. \u201cNot a single Republican can take credit for the economic comeback that is creating jobs and boosting business across Texas right now, and voters will remember,\u201d said spokesperson Monica Robinson. \u201cWith a toxic brand like that, winning seats in South Texas is nothing more than a Republican pipe dream. Democrats are focused on the issues Texans care about, and we\u2019re investing earlier than ever to deliver that message door-to-door and mobilize our voters across South Texas.\u201d Most notable is the new McAllen mayor, Javier Villalobos, a Republican who was praised by Republican state and national lawmakers and voices for becoming the first GOP mayor in the city in recent history, even though the race was a nonpartisan election. Gonzalez slammed Trump\u2019s visit with Abbott in a statement, arguing that he\u2019s dividing the border community. \u201cInviting the former President, who incited the January 6th insurrection in an effort to overthrow the government and prevent the peaceful transition of power, is nothing short of a slap in the face to South Texans,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cInstead of coming down to try and divide people by misrepresenting the border community on the national stage, I urge the Governor to work together to enact meaningful policy solutions that will bring real border security.\u201d This shift is not lost on Trump, who referenced Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 visit to El Paso last week, a border city that\u2019s more than 750 miles away. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the real border with real problems, not a part where you look around and don\u2019t see anything,\u201d Trump said, referencing GOP criticism of Harris\u2019 visit. The Biden administration appointed Harris to lead diplomatic efforts with the Northern Triangle, amid an influx of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the US-Mexico border. She visited El Paso to see a migrant processing center, after increased criticism for not having visited the US-Mexico border and a rocky first foreign trip to Guatemala and Mexico earlier this month. A record number of unaccompanied children crossed into the US this spring, further intensifying GOP criticism of the Biden administration\u2019s handling of border issues. US Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 180,000 migrants at the southern border in May, putting the US on track to surpass the number of border crossings in fiscal year 2019. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday that the administration has made \u201cextraordinary progress\u201d in dealing with the situation at the border since March. But it\u2019s still politics. The Democratic National Committee was quick to slam Trump\u2019s visit. \u201cDonald Trump and Republicans are bringing their clown show on the road in a desperate attempt to try to spin their cruel border policies to mislead voters. For four years, Republicans were silent as Trump sabotaged our immigration system and threw it into chaos. If Republicans were serious about addressing issues at the border, they\u2019d join President Biden and Democrats in working to clean up the mess they left behind, create a safe and humane immigration system, and finally pass immigration reform. Anything less is political theatre,\u201d DNC spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement to CNN. Meanwhile, more than 1,700 miles away, as Trump was speaking about the border in a choreographed event by a section of unfinished border wall, the House passed a resolution to create a select committee to investigate the January 6 insurrection after efforts for a bipartisan panel to investigate the events of the day failed in the Senate. Trump was flanked by Abbott, the House Republicans, former acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, senior adviser Stephen Miller and newly added spokesperson Liz Harrington. Out of the more than two dozen House Republicans who made the border visit, only a handful submitted proxy votes on creation of the select committee \u2013 a move meant to be used only for reasons related to the Covid-19 pandemic. If there\u2019s any indication, however, of where the Republican Party stands on the Capitol attack, this moment was one of them. At the end of the event, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta asked Trump whether he should apologize for the January 6 insurrection as he exited the riser after his remarks. The audience, filled with House Republicans and other Trump allies, booed in response and didn\u2019t let Trump respond. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Alexander Hunter contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday sued his own secretary of state in an effort to have his party affiliation listed on the state\u2019s upcoming recall election ballot following what he called a filing \u201cmistake\u201d by his election attorney last year. Newsom wants to \u201crequire all recall ballots to include either next to or below Newsom\u2019s name his party preference as follows: \u2018Party Preference: Democratic,\u2019\u201d according to the lawsuit filed against California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who Newsom nominated and swore in earlier this year. The California Democrat was supposed to mark his party affiliation in February 2020 pursuant to the state\u2019s recall election law, but \u201cdue to an inadvertent but good faith mistake on the part of his election attorney, Newsom timely filed his answer but did not include his party-preference election,\u201d the lawsuit said. Newsom corrected the mistake with Weber\u2019s office this month, but she \u201cdeclined to accept the notice, necessitating this action,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Weber\u2019s office told CNN in a statement that \u201cthe Secretary of State\u2019s office has a ministerial duty to accept timely filed documents. Acceptance of filings beyond a deadline requires judicial resolution.\u201d The filing argues that the secretary of state can accept changes to the recall ballot at least 59 days before the election, when the nomination period for replacement candidates ends. The date for the recall election has not been determined. The lawsuit, which was first reported by Courthouse News Service, brings a notable wrinkle to Newsom\u2019s efforts to stay in office as he faces the second election in state history to recall a sitting governor. State officials confirmed last week that a recall election would proceed after just 43 people withdrew their signatures from petitions to recall the governor during a 30-day window required by state law. The recall drive has been fueled by anger over the restrictions Newsom put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 throughout last year and during an alarming surge in cases in California during the winter holiday months. Critics of Newsom had met the state\u2019s threshold for a recall election in April following a sprawling effort to gather signatures in every county that was backed by key Republican strategists. But Newsom and his team have framed the recall as an effort by supporters of former President Donald Trump and right-wing extremists to wrest control of the government from progressives. \u201cIt is what it is. This is a Republican recall,\u201d Newsom said in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year. \u201cAn RNC-backed Republican recall of White supremacists, anti-Semites and people who are opposed to immigration and immigrants is an accurate assessment of who\u2019s behind this recall.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Thursday night, the impossibility of being Mike Pence came into sharp relief. Speaking to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, the former vice president did everything he could to talk about the accomplishments of the \u201cTrump-Pence\u201d administration on everything from immigration to trade to foreign policy. \u201cPresident Donald Trump is also one of a kind,\u201d Pence said at one point. \u201cHe, too, disrupted the status quo. He challenged the establishment. He invigorated our movement, and he set a bold new course for America in the 21st century. And now, as then, there is no going back.\u201d Except that, on the one thing Trump cares the most about \u2013 his fantasy that the 2020 election was stolen from him \u2013 Pence continued to defend his own unwillingness to overturn the election during the certification process on January 6. \u201cNow, there are those in our party who believe that in my position as presiding officer over the joint session, that I possessed the authority to reject or return electoral votes certified by states,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut the Constitution provides the vice president with no such authority before the joint session of Congress. And the truth is, there\u2019s almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Which is the only part of Pence\u2019s speech that Trump \u2013 or his most ardent fans \u2013 will care about. Which means that all of Pence\u2019s attempts to link himself to Trump\u2019s accomplishments (and the former president personally) will be for absolutely naught. Trump has repeatedly attacked Pence for not blocking the certification of the Electoral College results on January 6; \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,\u201d Trump tweeted in the immediate aftermath of the certification as rioters gathered near the US Capitol. (Pence was not, in fact, empowered in any way, shape or form to influence the certification.) Some of those same rioters \u2013 hours later \u2013 were chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as they steamrolled through the Capitol building \u2013 even as a gallows was being constructed outside. For Trump, Pence\u2019s unwillingness to break the law to overturn the election erased all of the good things the vice president had done for him over the past four years. Which is a remarkable erasure, given that there was no more loyal ally for Trump than Pence \u2013 seemingly at the President\u2019s side for, well, everything. Pence, in this speech and a few others he has delivered since emerging after the January 6 debacle, appears to be walking an impossibly fine line. He wants to be Trump\u2019s legislative heir. But he also knows he can\u2019t rewrite history on his role on January 6. Nor can he make Trump like him again. So, Pence\u2019s case in 2024 \u2013 and, to be clear, he\u2019s planning to run \u2013 is that he is Donald Trump, without the full-on election denial that sparked January 6. Which, really, isn\u2019t a thing. Because Trumpism isn\u2019t really about policies. It\u2019s about tone and feel. And at least now, about fighting the facts on the 2020 election. It\u2019s like saying that you love baseball, except for the pitching part. Or that you love Italian food \u2013 just not spaghetti or lasagna. There\u2019s not one without the other. Trump has so fused his personality (and his following) with election rejection that there is no space for someone like Pence to embrace the policy end of Trumpism, such as it exists, but reject the core passion of the former President and his movement. Pence will keep trying, of course. But he\u2019s literally in an impossible political situation.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence rebuked former President Donald Trump on Thursday night on the question of overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election. Pence also said he will \u201calways be proud\u201d of his role in affirming the election results on January 6 following a deadly riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol. The former vice president\u2019s remarks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, focused primarily on laying out a pro-Trump platform for a potential White House run of his own. But Pence also offered a harsh assessment of the former President\u2019s claims, in the days and weeks leading up to January 6, about changing the results of the election during the official counting of electoral votes in Congress. \u201cThe Constitution affords the vice president no authority to reject or return electoral votes submitted to the Congress by the states,\u201d said Pence, contradicting Trump\u2019s claim at his January 6 rally that his vice president could \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and reject the vote count. Without mentioning Trump by name, Pence said there are \u201cthose in our party\u201d who believe that \u201cany one person\u201d could select the president. \u201cTruth is, there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,\u201d he said. Trump continues to insist the election was stolen, and just this week told an interviewer that he \u201cnever admitted defeat\u201d and was \u201cvery disappointed that (Pence) didn\u2019t send it back to the legislatures.\u201d By contrast, Pence acknowledged the \u201cdisappointment\u201d of defeat in 2020. \u201cNow, I understand the disappointment many feel about the last election,\u201d he said. \u201cI can relate. I was on the ballot. But you know, there\u2019s more at stake than our party and our political fortunes in this moment. If we lose faith in the Constitution, we won\u2019t just lose elections \u2013 we\u2019ll lose our country.\u201d It was the only clear break Pence made from the President he served loyally for four years \u2013 and whose mantle he\u2019d like to take up for himself in the 2024 presidential race. That goal is complicated by the open possibility Trump could run again himself, and the blame that Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters ascribe to Pence for failing to overturn the election. Pence\u2019s task is to distinguish himself from Trump when necessary while still aligning himself with the Trump administration achievements that are most popular with the Republican base. He began that effort at a speech in South Carolina in April, which were his first public remarks since leaving the vice presidency. Pence isn\u2019t the only potential 2024 contender navigating around Trump\u2019s legacy. Nikki Haley, who criticized Trump after January 6, addressed the party faithful in Iowa on Thursday night, repeatedly sharing warm anecdotes about how she\u2019d collaborated with him as the ambassador to the UN. While Pence had largely avoided speaking about January 6 in April, his remarks on Thursday night attempted to address, however delicately, the false claims made by Trump. But on all else, Pence appears to be hewing closely to Trump and a Republican Party made more in the 45th President\u2019s image. Throughout his 45-minute speech, the Indiana Republican identified himself with Trump\u2019s agenda on issues such as immigration, border security, trade, China and public safety. He spoke proudly of the \u201cTrump-Pence administration\u2019s\u201d accomplishments in office, calling on Republicans to fuse their \u201ctraditional conservative priorities\u201d with the \u201cnew pillars\u201d of Trump\u2019s agenda. He also tried to reconcile Trump with Ronald Reagan, the former Republican President and movement conservative whom Pence credits for persuading him to defect from the Democratic Party in his youth. \u201cPresident Donald Trump is also one of a kind,\u201d Pence said. \u201cHe too disrupted the status quo. He challenged the establishment. He invigorated our movement, and he set a bold new course for America in the 21st century. And now, as then, there is no going back.\u201d Elsewhere in his remarks, Pence directed plenty of criticism at Democrats, including President Joe Biden\u2019s record on immigration and his spending proposals. He went after the \u201cmyths of the left,\u201d criticizing cancel culture and efforts to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d He also went after critical race theory\u2019s use in school curriculums \u2013 a popular target of Republican governors and lawmakers across the country. \u201cOur party must ensure that critical race theory is expelled from our schools, our military and our public institutions,\u201d Pence said. But beside taking a shot at Democrats for \u201cdemeaning\u201d the American founding, Pence offered a subtle warning for Republicans to remain what he referred to as the \u201clast line of defense\u201d for the Constitution. \u201cWe must make it clear that the Republican Party will always defend the principles at the heart of our republic,\u201d Pence said, before segueing into the defense of his actions on January 6, which he called a \u201cdark day in the history of the United States Capitol.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom will face a recall election, marking just the second time in state history that a special election will be held to recall a sitting governor. State officials confirmed Wednesday that a recall election will proceed after just 43 people withdrew their signatures from petitions to recall the governor during a 30-day window required by state law. As a result, California\u2019s Department of Finance will now begin estimating the costs of the recall \u2013 including costs of holding it as a special election or as part of the next regularly scheduled election \u2013 which will then be submitted to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state and the chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee by August 5, according to a letter outlining the process from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber. A spokesperson for California\u2019s Department of Finance previously told CNN the recall would cost about $215.2 million. A date has not yet been set. The recall drive has been fueled by anger over the restrictions Newsom put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 throughout last year and during an alarming surge in cases in California during the winter holiday months. Critics of Newsom had met the state\u2019s threshold for a recall election in April following a sprawling effort to gather signatures in every county that was backed by key Republican strategists. But Newsom and his team have framed the recall as an effort by supporters of former President Donald Trump and right-wing extremists to wrest control of the government from progressives. \u201cIt is what it is. This is a Republican recall,\u201d Newsom said in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year. \u201cAn RNC-backed Republican recall of White supremacists, anti-Semites and people who are opposed to immigration and immigrants is an accurate assessment of who\u2019s behind this recall.\u201d The state\u2019s voters will be asked two questions on the recall ballot. First, do they want to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on recalling Newsom, who was elected in 2018 with nearly 62% of the vote. The second question is which candidate they would like to replace Newsom, and they will choose from what is likely to be a very long list of names (candidates from different parties will appear on the same list). By law, Newsom is not permitted to add his name to the ballot as an option. When then-California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, was recalled in 2003, more than 125 candidates \u2013 including Davis\u2019 eventual replacement, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 leapt into the race, creating a circus-like political environment for months.",

            "article_content": "Whoever wins the Democratic primary race for Manhattan district attorney on Tuesday isn\u2019t just poised to take the helm of one of the most legendary prosecutors offices in New York. They also will inherit perhaps the highest profile investigation in the country: that of former President Donald Trump and his company. The outgoing district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., is likely to decide whether to charge a case against the former President, the Trump Organization or company executives by the end of his term in December, CNN previously reported. If that happens, the next district attorney \u2013 most likely the winner of Tuesday\u2019s primary, given the overwhelmingly Democratic makeup of Manhattan \u2013 will oversee the prosecution. With eight contenders, the Democratic primary race for district attorney is a crowded one, and unlike the New York City mayoral primary, it doesn\u2019t have ranked-choice voting. Whoever wins is likely to incur Trump\u2019s ire if they continue Vance\u2019s work, since the former President has been quick to accuse Democrats investigating him, including Vance and New York state Attorney General Letitia James, of pursuing political prosecutions. \u201cIf you can run for a prosecutor\u2019s office pledging to take out your enemies, and be elected to that job by partisan voters who wish to enact political retribution,\u201d Trump said in May, after James disclosed her office was working with the district attorney on its criminal investigation, \u201cthen we are no longer a free constitutional democracy.\u201d Some of the candidates have already expressed their views on the former President. Alvin Bragg, widely seen as a leading contender in the race, has boasted of having sued the Trump administration more than 100 times while he was in the state attorney general\u2019s office, where he was chief deputy. He has also noted that he led the team that sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which resulted in Trump personally paying $2 million to an array of charities. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him up front and have seen the lawlessness that he can do,\u201d Bragg said on the radio show \u201cEbro in the Morning,\u201d in January. \u201cI believe we have to hold him accountable. I haven\u2019t seen all the facts beyond the public but I\u2019ve litigated with him and so I\u2019m prepared to go where the facts take me once I see them, and hold him accountable.\u201d Another leading candidate, Tali Farhadian Weinstein, has said comparatively little about Trump, saying it would be improper to comment on the subject of an ongoing investigation. In 2017, Farhadian Weinstein interviewed with members of Trump\u2019s White House Counsel\u2019s office for a federal judgeship, a position for which she had also applied during the Obama administration, according to The New York Times. In the final debate last week, Farhadian Weinstein defended having sought the judgeship, saying: \u201cIt is not factual to say that federal judges, which are a separate part of the federal government, would work for the president. And so, to have been considered to be appointed to the federal bench while Mr. Trump or anyone else was president, doesn\u2019t mean that I would have been working for his administration.\u201d She worked as counsel to Attorney General Eric Holder and later as general counsel in the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, where she successfully sued the Trump administration to get Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers out of courthouses in Brooklyn, after finding that female victims of domestic violence were too afraid to come to court for fear of finding officers present. Other contenders in the race also have history with Trump or his policies. Tahanie Aboushi, a civil rights lawyer, touts her experience spending four days at John F. Kennedy International Airport in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2017 travel ban on Muslim-majority countries, where she supplied legal assistance to people detained by US Customs and Border Protection. Candidate Lucy Lang, a veteran of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, counts as one of her senior advisers a former colleague who led the office\u2019s investigation into Trump SoHo, which examined whether or not the Trump Organization misled potential buyers about the values of units, a probe Lang has said shouldn\u2019t have been shuttered. In November, she tweeted: \u201cToday I called for the #ManhattanDA investigations into Donald Trump to continue. Immunity is not a consolation prize to losing and election, and no one is above the law. We can\u2019t allow Donald Trump\u2019s failed presidential campaign to absolve him of responsibility.\u201d But she has also taken pains to distance herself from Trump-related commentary, saying in June that \u201cI think that one of the worst things the next District Attorney could do would be to say something on the campaign trail that would suggest anything other than complete impartiality when it comes to investigating all the cases in front of the office and putting themselves in a position where they might face a recusal motion or a removal of jurisdiction.\u201d Another candidate, public defender Eliza Orlins, has been more blunt in her criticism of the former President. In December, she publicly cheered Trump\u2019s election loss, tweeting: \u201cWe did it! We got rid of Donald Trump. But that won\u2019t change the fact that our systems inherently favor the rich and powerful and oppress the poor.\u201d New York state Assemblyman Dan Quart, also vying for the office, has split the difference, saying in February, \u201cI\u2019ve been very active and vocal on my feelings on Trump\u2019s abuses of the rule of law, of his terrible policies, of his indecency, but that\u2019s different than being a district attorney who has to judge each case on the merits.\u201d Diana Florence, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA\u2019s office who left the office in January 2020 after a judge dismissed one of her cases when she failed to turn over evidence to defense attorneys, has suggested she believes Trump is due for retribution. \u201cI think what\u2019s amazing about Donald Trump is that he ascended to the highest office in our nation and even before that had tremendous success and that was while doing whatever the heck he wanteds to do,\u201d she told Forbes in November. \u201cHe will now face the ability to be prosecuted. He had a brief immunity while a sitting president, but as I just talked about he had a defacto immunity for being a wealthy and powerful man for many many years. And I believe that time will be changing.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sonia Moghe contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Former vice president Mike Pence on Friday was heckled at a conference for religious conservatives, ahead of a speech that took aim at his successor. Shouts of \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d were heard coming from a small group within the audience as Pence took the stage. Wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d ball caps, they were immediately escorted out of the conference hall by law enforcement. One of the hecklers later told CNN that she interrupted Pence \u201cbecause he\u2019s a traitor,\u201d presumably referring to Pence\u2019s role in validating the 2020 election results during Congress\u2019 certification vote on January 6. Pence has previously been criticized by Trump for proceeding with the certification, which took place after Trump-aligned protesters stormed the US Capitol, including some who threatened to \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d A police officer did not reply when CNN asked if the female heckler at Friday\u2019s speech was under arrest. Pence\u2019s team also declined to comment on the incident. The moment came before Pence criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for declining to visit the US-Mexico border during a recent immigration-focused trip to Central America. Echoing a complaint lodged by other Republicans in recent weeks, Pence said it was \u201cpast time for our current vice president to go to the border, put our policies back into effect and end the Biden border crisis today.\u201d \u201cLiterally, in five months they turned the most secure border in the world into the worst border crisis in American history,\u201d he charged in a speech lasting about 30 minutes at The Faith & Freedom Coalition\u2019s annual Road to Majority Conference. Pence, who only recently reemerged onto the public stage with appearances in South Carolina and New Hampshire, used the occasion on Friday to embrace former President Donald Trump and argue that Republicans are well-positioned to retake control of Congress and the White House in the November midterm elections and in 2024. A rumored presidential hopeful himself, much of Pence\u2019s remarks focused on Biden and his policy agenda \u2013 including a critique of the Democratic president\u2019s \u201cweak leadership abroad\u201d that Pence claimed was on display during Biden\u2019s first foreign trip over the past week. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think in 2020 Joe Biden actually campaigned as a moderate and he\u2019s governed as one of the most liberal presidents in history,\u201d Pence argued, adding that the Biden-Harris administration is \u201cintent on transforming our country along the agenda of the radical left.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have to exchange the American dream for a socialist nightmare,\u201d Pence said. Despite facing ongoing criticism from Trump over his refusal to back the former president\u2019s unconstitutional ploy to overturn the 2020 election outcome, Pence weaved praise of his former boss into his remarks. At one point, he said it was \u201cthe greatest honor of my life\u201d to serve as vice president alongside Trump. \u201cPresident Trump taught us what Republicans can accomplish when we stand firm on conservative principles and don\u2019t back down,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 48 months, the Trump-Pence administration achieved the lowest unemployment, the most secure border and the strongest military in the history of the world.\u201d Unlike his most recent public appearance at a Republican fundraiser in New Hampshire, Pence did not specifically mention the January 6 riots at the US Capitol during his speech in Kissimmee, Florida. Rather, the former vice president stuck to a familiar script filled with references to religion, cultural flashpoints and his own political identity. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order and I am honored to stand before you today,\u201d Pence said at the outset of his appearance, borrowing a line from his stump speech as a then-vice presidential contender in 2016.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden now turns to a puzzle almost as thankless as negotiating with Vladimir Putin \u2013 pushing his stalled agenda through a deadlocked Congress. Air Force One delivered Biden back to Washington after his talks with the Russian President that capped his European tour. He now gets to wrestle with the limits of a 50-50 Senate, Republican obstruction and splits between moderate and progressive Democrats that threaten his ambitious plans to rebuild the nation\u2019s physical infrastructure, tackle the climate crisis and expand the social safety net. After successfully enacting a massive Covid-19 rescue bill and rolling out an unprecedented vaccination drive, the President is now under increasing pressure to satisfy Democratic hopes of transformative reform in a fast narrowing window for action. Biden may also be contending with the crosswinds of the mounting pressure from progressives on Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer to retire, so that Biden would be in position to name a replacement before Democrats potentially lose their majorities in the midterms. The White House rejected assessments that Biden\u2019s agenda was in trouble when the President left for Europe last week. And while the political equation in Washington is challenging, the President\u2019s hopes of solving his legislative Rubik\u2019s cube may have improved slightly while he was abroad. There were signs of movement, for instance, as the latest bipartisan group trying to hash out a deal on infrastructure met Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Members and leaders, however, acknowledged there is still a long way to go as they try to find consensus on how to pay for the improvements. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters the group has done a good job trying to address the concerns of both parties but said \u201ca lot of details \u2026 need to be filled in.\u201d   In another potentially positive sign for the President, conservative West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, a major impediment to progressive dreams of a transformational presidency, is circulating changes and proposed additions to two voting rights bills. Those bills are seen by Democrats as the best hope of countering scores of statehouse measures drawn up by Republicans that make it harder to vote and easier to rig the results of elections. Manchin\u2019s efforts earned a significant boost on Thursday morning from former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights champion Stacey Abrams, who told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that Manchin was offering \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d for a deal. But the glimmers of hope for the Democratic agenda pale in comparison to Biden\u2019s task of keeping his own party united, and dealing with the reality that Republicans can put the brakes on his plans because of the Senate requirement for a supermajority of 60 votes to pass major legislation. To pass an infrastructure bill for instance, the President will first have to secure a deal among 20 bipartisan senators now looking for common ground. Any deal will be well short of the original $2 trillion bill he had originally envisaged and will center on traditional projects like roads and bridges while removing controversial social spending he had packed into his original blueprint. Another issue is how to pay for the package, with Republicans refusing to scale back tax cuts introduced in the 2017 law passed by then-President Donald Trump. Complicating Biden\u2019s challenge, progressive Democrats are skeptical that any Senate compromise will satisfy their priorities. And they warn that they would not agree to such a pared back compromise without a commitment to pass items like home health care and climate change mitigation measures, which were in the original infrastructure bill, through the Senate by using a simple majority device used for budget legislation known as reconciliation. \u201cWe\u2019ve already wasted three weeks of bipartisan negotiations only for them to lead nowhere,\u201d Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington told reporters on a press call. \u201cI have been saying for weeks that we are not going to be able to get the votes for a smaller package unless there is simultaneous movement of an agreed-upon reconciliation package that includes everything.\u201d Democratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon similarly said this week that they will not support a bipartisan infrastructure package unless they have a guarantee that climate action will be included in a separate reconciliation package. Markey said \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d to move beyond bipartisan infrastructure negotiations and for Democrats to \u201cgo our own way.\u201d He underscored the urgency of getting something done before the August recess, a key deadline that is looming for Biden. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave here until we get it done. We cannot let Republican calls for bipartisanship deny the American people the climate action that they have been demanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a guarantee, an absolute unbreakable guarantee that climate is going to be at the center of any infrastructure deal which we cut.\u201d Bipartisan group has miles to go on infrastructure talks Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has already started a dual track process by conferring with members of the Budget Committee about the package that Democrats would try to advance on their own through reconciliation. It remains unclear whether moderate Democrats like Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema would support such an approach, which would require agreement among all 50 Democrats. Schumer emerged from a meeting with Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee Wednesday night calling it a \u201cgreat first discussion.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the first votes could come in July and that the group discussed including climate and immigration provisions. Kaine acknowledged that it will be difficult to build consensus among all 50 Democrats: \u201cYou can\u2019t say we\u2019re unified because we haven\u2019t discussed all the details and there are 50 people.\u201d Biden appeared to indicate, however, that he believes that a two-track process could unlock both a new infrastructure bill as well as progressive goals. \u201cI know that Schumer and Nancy have moved forward on a reconciliation provision as well. So I\u2019m still hoping we could put together the two bookends here,\u201d the President said in Geneva, also referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. A small group of Democrats senators also met with White House officials to brief them on the bipartisan framework for the infrastructure plan, and Manchin said the group hoped to release more details next week. Steven J. Ricchetti, a counselor to Biden, said the discussion was \u201cvery cordial and productive.\u201d But Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the group is trying to navigate \u201clots of preconditions from our Republican friends\u201d as well as those of the President, \u201cso it makes it challenging.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previewed the challenges in winning GOP support on Tuesday when he laid out his requirements for a deal: \u201cPut me down as listening and hopeful that somehow, some way, we\u2019ll be able to move forward with an infrastructure bill that does two things.\u201d McConnell has a choice to make. There are a number of Republicans who want an infrastructure deal to show their constituents they can get something done ahead of midterm elections. But given that a compromise would be a huge accomplishment for a President who has made unity and bipartisanship an unlikely theme of his administration in fraught partisan times, Republicans may ultimately be unwilling to give Biden the win. Throughout the early months of Biden\u2019s presidency, Democrats have maintained a fragile peace within their fractured party even as progressives clamor for Biden to go bigger and bolder in tackling the climate crisis and addressing income inequality, which he attempted to do in part with some of his proposals to improve the lot of home health care workers in the broad, initial infrastructure bill Progressives are also fighting for two pieces of legislation \u2013 the \u201cFor the People Act\u201d and the \u201cJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act\u201d \u2013 that they see as crucial to reversing state laws based on Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud in the last election which in many cases discriminate against minority voters and introduce partisan control of elections. Some moderate Democrats are uneasy with the scope of the bills. And Republicans are adamantly opposed. That means they cannot pass in their current form without an effort to abolish the 60-vote filibuster threshold, a step Manchin for instance says he will refuse to take. Democrats woo Manchin on major voting bill in bid to win unified party support But on Wednesday, Manchin also circulated changes and proposed additions to both the \u201cFor the People\u201d act and \u201cJohn Lewis Voting Rights Act\u201d that he could live with as Democrats strategize about how they can overcome the steep hurdle of getting 60 votes on a voting bill. Manchin has also been reaching out to GOP senators, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported Wednesday, holding a Zoom meeting Monday night with Republicans to see if they could reach consensus, a source familiar with the talks told CNN. Still, signs of optimism in an institution as polarized as Congress are often only the prelude to disappointment. And given the narrowing window for Biden to capitalize on the apex of his power and influence with midterm elections looming next year, and with only a few weeks before lawmakers go home for the summer, the pieces need to come together soon. Republicans are looking ahead to the 2022 elections, promising a blockade of Biden\u2019s agenda. Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso noted at an event this week that McConnell came under criticism during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency by saying that he wanted to make sure Obama was \u201ca one-term president.\u201d \u201cI want to make Joe Biden a one-half-term president,\u201d Barrasso said in an appearance before The Ripon Society. \u201cAnd I want to do that by making sure they no longer have House, Senate, White House.\u201d Biden\u2019s dwindling moment for fundamental reform was also underscored this week when McConnell refused to guarantee that he would confirm a Supreme Court nominee if the GOP wins back control of the US Senate. When the President was asked about McConnell\u2019s comments during his foreign trip, his answer encapsulated the shadow that Republican obstruction cast over his entire agenda. \u201cMitch has been nothing but \u2018No\u2019 for a long time and I\u2019m sure he means exactly what he says, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Republican answer is no. What\u2019s the question? Just about anything important a Democratic president is asking. Last week the issue was infrastructure. President Joe Biden asked a few Republican senators to compromise within shouting distance of his plan to dramatically boost investment in America\u2019s infrastructure, financed by taxes on corporations or wealthy individuals. The answer was no. Before that, it was the deadly January 6 insurrection inspired by then-President Donald Trump to stop Congress from affirming Biden\u2019s November 2020 victory. Biden supported Democrats\u2019 quest for an independent bipartisan commission to investigate it. Republicans said no. That became less-than-surprising after Republicans had considered whether a person telling the truth about Biden\u2019s victory could serve in their House leadership. The person was Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney; the answer was no. In fact, GOP-led states are using election lies to erect procedural barriers against future defeats by a diversifying American electorate that has moved away from their party. So it\u2019s hardly worth asking whether congressional Republicans will heed Biden\u2019s call for federal voting rights safeguards. Ditto Biden\u2019s quest to strengthen background checks of potential gun owners in response to mass shootings, and to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender identity. As state-level counterparts rush in the opposite direction, the answer from Republicans in Washington is no. Resistance to change is, to be sure, expected from the nation\u2019s conservative political party. An intellectual icon of the modern GOP, William F. Buckley, once described a conservative\u2019s role as to \u201cstand athwart history, yelling \u2018Stop!\u2019\u201d But in the era of partisan polarization, that impulse has hardened into resistance to governance itself. On issues that rile them most \u2013 the changing face of America, domestic spending programs, tax increases \u2013 congressional Republicans have flashed red lights at Democratic and Republican White Houses alike. In 1990, most voted no when President George H.W. Bush compromised with Democrats on a deficit-reduction bill including tax increases. Three years later, all of them voted no on a deficit-reduction package signed by President Bill Clinton. The following decade, Republican opposition sank President George W. Bush\u2019s call for an immigration reform measure providing legal status to undocumented immigrants. The same thing happened a few years later to President Barack Obama, which helps explain why Biden hasn\u2019t dived into the issue this year. Having squelched Clinton\u2019s government-heavy national health care proposal 15 years before, congressional Republicans voted unanimously against Obama\u2019s market-based approach. No matter that the Affordable Care Act was modeled after a conservative think-tank idea that then-Gov. Mitt Romney had turned into a Republican plan for Massachusetts. The details of what Democratic presidents propose explain only part of Republican resistance. As Senate Leader Mitch McConnell once explained, withholding all GOP support denies Democratic initiatives the bipartisan label that might \u201cconvey to the public that this is OK.\u201d When events left little alternative during the Obama years, McConnell negotiated deals with then-Vice President Biden, his long-time Senate colleague. One ended a debt-crisis in which House Republican had forced the first-ever downgrade in America\u2019s credit rating; another let previously-enacted tax-cuts for wealthy Americans expire to avoid a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d that would have raised taxes on everyone. Biden opened his term as President by proposing a $1.9 trillion \u201crescue plan\u201d to combat the coronavirus pandemic that turned America upside down. Every House and Senate Republican said no. Now he seeks a deal on infrastructure. The popularity of new roads and bridges makes that, in theory, a ripe target for bipartisan compromise. But because infrastructure investments involve a lot of government spending, congressional Republicans didn\u2019t act even when Trump rhetorically embraced a major program. Not only does Biden want to spend more than Trump, he proposes higher taxes to pay for it. To that, the Republican answer is unequivocally no. After Biden\u2019s talks with GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia collapsed last week, five Senate Republicans and five Democrats announced a compromise infrastructure \u201cframework.\u201d It, too, rejected tax increases but proposed more spending than Capito had. The White House did not reject it. Though tax hikes represent Biden\u2019s first option, he has signaled that he considers some one-time infrastructure investments worth adding to near-term deficits because they will enhance the nation\u2019s long-run productive capacity. Yet most remain pessimistic that a deficit-financed infrastructure compromise can attract support from at least 10 GOP senators, the minimum needed to join Democrats in surmounting a filibuster. Though congressional Republicans readily swelled the deficit to enact Trump\u2019s tax cuts, for Democratic spending programs their answer tends to be no. The failure of bipartisan compromise need not quash Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda, which in addition to infrastructure investments includes expensive new programs to help struggling families up the economic ladder. Biden could advance it through the special budget process known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d which requires only a simple majority vote rather than a filibuster-proof 60 ayes in the Senate. That route, which Democratic leaders have already set in motion, would not require any Republican votes. It would require every Senate Democrat and nearly every House Democrat to say yes.",

            "article_content": "Since his presidency ended, Donald Trump has issued more statements lying about the 2020 election than statements talking about any other subject. Banned from Twitter since early January, Trump has communicated his post-presidency musings in written statements that are emailed to journalists and posted on his website. These missives, many of which were initially featured on his now-shuttered blog, have replaced his tweets as the most comprehensive public record of his day-to-day thinking. And after crunching the numbers, what\u2019s clear is that Trump\u2019s primary focus is the election he lost. Forty-three of the 132 post-presidency statements Trump had issued through June 9 included a lie about the election. That\u2019s about 33%. These lies range from vague claims that the election was \u201cstolen\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d to specific false assertions about what happened in various states he lost. Trump\u2019s second-favorite post-presidency topic has been bashing fellow Republicans. About 24% percent of Trump\u2019s post-presidency statements have castigated other members of his party \u2013 sometimes for failing to support his dishonest attempt to get the election overturned, other times for generally failing to be sufficiently loyal to him. Another 23% of Trump\u2019s post-presidency statements have been endorsements of Republican candidates. (These endorsements tend to be more formulaic and less personal than his other commentary.) About 15% of the statements have featured criticism of media outlets or social media companies. About 10% have involved criticism of President Joe Biden or Biden\u2019s administration. About 10% have discussed economic subjects. (We didn\u2019t include endorsement statements in which Trump passingly said that the candidate was good on the economy.) About 9% have involved Trump touting his own popularity or influence. About 8% have involved criticism of specific Democrats other than Biden or of Democrats in general. And about 7% have involved praise of Trump\u2019s political allies. What the numbers show The numbers show just how frequently the former president is still \u2013 a full seven months after his fair-and-square defeat \u2013 promoting baseless nonsense that is destructive to American democracy. And the numbers help explain why so many Republican politicians continue to utter and defend these lies themselves. If the de facto leader of the party is making them an ongoing priority, elected officials who feel the need to stay in his good graces are not abandoning them too fast, either. The numbers also corroborate what CNN reported last week: people close to Trump say he is fixated on the election and less interested in the policy issues his advisers prefer him to discuss. Only a small percentage of the 132 statements addressed the Covid-19 pandemic (about 5%) or foreign policy or national security (about 2%). A meager 2% of the statements discussed immigration in any detail. And some of the references to the economy were delivered in the course of criticizing someone rather than as their standalone point of emphasis. A note about the data: the percentages in this story do not add to 100% because we assigned each statement to multiple categories as appropriate. For example, this statement included an election lie, criticism of the media, and criticism of a Republican foe.",

            "article_content": "In style and in substance, President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson are two very different men leading two countries whose relationship makes up one of the most important global alliances. Biden rode into the White House last year on a record that spanned nearly 50 years in public service. And while the President ran as an antidote to then-President Donald Trump, Johnson has often been compared to the 45th President for his populist message and often brash comments. The similarities between Trump and Johnson aren\u2019t lost on Biden, who on the 2020 campaign trail once called Johnson a \u201cphysical and emotional clone\u201d of Trump. Given the tight ties between the US and UK, observers expect the public portions of the meeting to be cordial and warm. But both men enter this weekend\u2019s diplomatic gathering under pressure to define their respective roles in the world and amongst other global powers. The official previews of their meeting were straightforward. The White House indicated Biden would touch on a number of issues during his engagements with Johnson, including the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, financing global infrastructure in the developing world, maintaining a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and other issues related to the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East. The UK government relayed that Johnson, the host of the G7 summit, would focus on ways for the world to \u201cbuild back better from coronavirus\u201d and tackling climate change.   But their meeting on Thursday also came at a time of tension over Northern Ireland\u2019s role in the UK\u2019s Brexit agreement with the European Union, which is a key issue for Biden. The meeting will set the tone for both US-UK relations over the next four years and Biden\u2019s diplomatic agenda as they confer in southwest England. It also kicks off Biden\u2019s swing across Europe for meetings with America\u2019s G7 partners, NATO allies, the European Union and, finally, Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden planned on pressing Johnson on Northern Ireland during their first face-to-face meeting on Thursday, according to senior administration officials. It\u2019s an issue he feels very strongly about, officials said. He has watched with trepidation as Brexit has caused new questions about the durability of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the violent conflict in Northern Ireland by bringing unionists and Irish republicans into a power-sharing government, and peace in the region. But the President didn\u2019t plan to adopt a confrontational tone with Johnson on the Northern Ireland issue during their meeting Thursday, a senior administration official said, instead intending to raise it as a topic of deep personal interest that he wants to see resolved. \u201cThe United States is not in those negotiations and not seeking to be in those negotiations,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt will not be confrontational or adversarial,\u201d the official said of Biden\u2019s plans. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come here to give a lecture. He came merely to communicate what he believes, very, very deeply about peace in Northern Ireland.\u201d Biden has raised the issue with Johnson in telephone calls ahead of the summit, and diplomats have discussed the matter with British counterparts in the lead-up to the two leaders\u2019 bilateral talks. But officials denied a report in British newspaper The Times that American diplomats held heated conversations with UK officials on the matter ahead of the summit, including issuing a formal reprimand, saying the discussions on the matter have not been \u201cheightened.\u201d Questions still remain about what the long-term future of the US-UK relationship will look like and whether it will be superseded by America\u2019s relationships with other allies in the west. European allies \u2013 reeling from Trump\u2019s America First-style diplomacy \u2013 are also still not clear if Biden\u2019s effort to bring American diplomacy back will result in a return to the status quo or result in something new. They\u2019re also not sure how long Biden\u2019s style of diplomacy will last, given that Trump might run for reelection. \u201cI think to me the defining question is how both sides use the next three and a half years, and if it\u2019s sort of a transformative period, or if it\u2019s more of a return to the status quo pre-Trump,\u201d said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get an answer to that at this summit, but I think that\u2019s sort of the defining choice that\u2019s out there.\u201d Why Biden's foreign trip is so unique and so important Biden and Johnson\u2019s relationship will no doubt be one to watch throughout the President\u2019s swing through Europe as he looks to reassure US allies that America will once again be conventional and reliable on the world stage. The two diverge on policy on several fronts, including Biden\u2019s opposition to Brexit and Northern Ireland\u2019s role as part of the Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. The part of the Brexit deal that creates a de facto trade border in the Irish Sea, the Northern Ireland Protocol, has contributed to rising tensions in the region this year. Biden has long been skeptical of Brexit and holds deep affection for Ireland, his ancestral homeland. In his first speech in the United Kingdom on Wednesday, he quoted a line from Yeats. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday that Biden planned to bring up Northern Ireland during his meeting with Johnson, but told reporters his comments would be reserved to making \u201cstatements of principle.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not issuing threats or ultimatums. He\u2019s going to simply convey his deep-seated belief that we need to stand behind and protect this protocol,\u201d Sullivan said. The two men also hold different views on immigration and foreign aid, which Johnson has opted to slash. A global minimum tax agreement among the G7\u2019s finance ministers kicked off the summit week on past weekend \u2013 marking an early win for the Biden administration ahead of the President\u2019s arrival. But even before Air Force One\u2019s wheels touched down on the tarmac in England, UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak indicated that he was pushing for a carveout for the city of London in the agreement \u2013 marking another potential rift in relations. Some of the differences are more visceral. In an op-ed while serving as London\u2019s mayor, Johnson insulted then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Kenyan heritage as part of a discussion about the President\u2019s opposition to Brexit. Biden, of course, was serving alongside Obama at the time as vice president. And there is, of course, Biden\u2019s crack about Johnson\u2019s resemblance to Trump. Charles Kupchan, a former senior director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council during the Obama administration, told CNN much of the discussion between Johnson and Biden in front of cameras is expected to be cordial. \u201cBiden is going to Europe as a rock star of sorts. Europeans are delighted that he\u2019s in and Trump is out. And as a consequence, I think this will be a week of smiles and back slapping and good atmospherics. So I don\u2019t expect to see any differences between Biden and Johnson emerge in public-facing events,\u201d Kuphan, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. Biden and Johnson relish the role of global good guys at G7. But bonhomie may be tested by hard reality The so-called \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the heads of the US and the UK, one of America\u2019s strongest allies, has played a key role in the countries\u2019 public diplomacy. The term was coined by Prime Minister Winston Churchill after World War II to describe the UK-US relationship, and it\u2019s often used to illustrate the warm personal dynamic between leaders of the two countries. But as the UK tries to forge its own path through Brexit, Johnson has expressed his distaste for the term publicly and, reportedly, with the President. The Atlantic reported this week that in an early call with Biden, Johnson told the President he disliked the phrase \u201cspecial relationship\u201d when Biden used it because it seemed needy and weak. But the White House and senior-level staff have continued to use the term following The Atlantic\u2019s report, including in press briefings. A recent schedule sent to the press also described the upcoming bilateral as an effort \u201cto affirm the enduring strength of the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.\u201d Downing Street has not confirmed that the Prime Minister made the comment on the call with Biden, but reiterated that Johnson \u201cis on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase, but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally.\u201d Interactions between two leaders during their meeting could set the tone for the relationship\u2019s future, said Leslie Vinjamuri, the director of the US and the Americas program at Chatham House, an independent policy institute. \u201cThis is an opportunity for Johnson and Biden to kind of show a different face than they\u2019ve showed in the past through their exchanges. And it\u2019s the first one, so it matters a lot,\u201d Vinjamuri said. \u201cYou know that \u2026 first impression for the public, I think, is really going to be so significant in terms of trying to move past what hasn\u2019t been the best for years,\u201d she added. Biden and Johnson expected to commit to lifting US-UK Covid-19 travel restrictions Despite the frequent comparisons to Trump, Johnson sometimes kept the former President at arm\u2019s length. When Trump came to the UK in 2019 for his state visit, Johnson declined to meet with him in person. The visit happened during the Conservative Party leadership contest, and numerous sources involved in the campaign told CNN at the time that it might not be in Johnson\u2019s best interest to be seen with the then-President. Johnson said Trump was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to encourage a mob to storm the Capitol building in Washington. He was also one of the first world leaders to congratulate Biden on his presidential win last November, despite Trump\u2019s refusal to concede the election. Additionally, Biden and Johnson share common victories on climate change and vaccine distribution. Johnson and Biden are both expected to push to make progress with other leaders on climate. The two men worked together when Biden hosted a virtual climate summit, which was meant to act as a precursor to Johnson\u2019s climate event, COP26, set for the fall. And this week the Biden administration will announce purchasing 500 million additional Pfizer vaccine doses to distribute to other countries \u2013 in line with Johnson\u2019s call for G7 leaders to vaccinate the world against Covid-19 by 2022. Biden has underscored that strengthening American alliances will be an overarching theme of his Europe trip. And Sullivan told reporters that the trip at its core will \u201cadvance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy, to rally the world\u2019s democracies to tackle the great challenges of our time.\u201d During their meeting, the President and the prime minister are expected to sign onto a range of agreements. Biden and Johnson are expected to agree to a new Atlantic Charter modeled on the historic declaration made by Roosevelt and Churchill in 1941 that set out American and British goals for the world after the end of World War II, according to the White House and 10 Downing Street. The new Atlantic Charter that Biden and Johnson will sign on Thursday is meant to reflect the shifting threats facing the world eighty years after the original document was signed following World War II. \u201cIt\u2019s been 80 years since the last one, it\u2019s about time that it gets refreshed,\u201d a senior administration official said ahead of the signing. \u201cThe original really outlined what the post-war world order could and should look like, this new charter will make clear what the coming decades of the 21st century can and should look like,\u201d the official said. Officials said the document was not designed to presage a new Cold War, as the original Atlantic Charter ended up doing. The leaders will also commit to working to open up travel between the US and the UK and lifting restrictions that were put in place to stop the spread of Covid-19. Sullivan said Wednesday the US has established two working groups of public health experts \u2013 one with the United Kingdom and one with the European Union. \u201cThe point of these working groups is to share data and set out both milestones and criteria to enable a reopening of travel between our two countries as swiftly as possible, consistent with public health guidance,\u201d Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. In addition, Biden and Johnson are expected to agree to pursue a bilateral technology agreement that will be signed next year, according to a source familiar with the matter. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Luke McGee, Kate Sullivan and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kamala Harris traveled to Guatemala and Mexico seeking a serious strategy for stemming migration from the Northern Triangle, but her efforts were quickly overshadowed by her flippant response about why she has not visited the US-Mexico border as vice president. Her defensive response to a question that was certain to come up on her first foreign trip since taking office is raising fresh questions about her political agility as she chafes at the efforts by the right to portray her as the administration\u2019s border czar, which is not the assignment that Biden gave her. In her few short months as vice president, Harris has become a lightning rod for Republicans \u2013 a useful foil for the GOP when their attacks on President Joe Biden haven\u2019t landed. Biden cranked up the heat on Harris by handing her a portfolio of immigration issues that is the political equivalent of dynamite at a time when her critics are parsing her every move, often vilifying her in the same way they made Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez their boogeymen in prior election cycles. The first foreign trip for any vice president is an acid test, and Harris was under more pressure than most as a potential future leader of the party and the first woman of color to hold the office. Harris spoke at length about the causes of mass migration like crime, corruption and climate change, and announced millions of dollars in aid and investment during her trip. She also issued a stark warning to undocumented migrants not to come to the border. But her political missteps overshadowed the policy progress on her trip. See Kamala Harris' response after Lester Holt corrects her The vice president has never been particularly adept when confronted with questions that she doesn\u2019t like or doesn\u2019t want to answer \u2013 as she demonstrated during 2020 primaries, when she repeatedly dodged and fumbled questions about her health care plan. In this case, she deflected a straightforward question from NBC\u2019s Lester Holt about why she hasn\u2019t visited the border by laughing it off and stating that she also hasn\u2019t been to Europe, adding that she didn\u2019t understand the point that Holt was making \u2013 even though everyone else did. It was a clumsy answer that came off as tone-deaf given that the situation at the US-Mexico border is one of the most troubling issues facing the administration. Finding a solution for stemming migration from Central America is a problem that has eluded multiple administrations for decades, but even some White House officials \u2013 who want her to succeed in this difficult endeavor \u2013 were perplexed. The exchange with Holt reflected the frustration that Harris and her team have felt for weeks as they labor to make it clear that Biden tasked her with handling diplomatic efforts to stem migration from the Northern Triangle, not solving the problem at the US-Mexico border. While it is true that many other government agencies are responsible for handling the border, that stance has been a difficult needle for her to thread, given that anyone with experience in the region will tell you that the two issues are inextricably entwined. During a news conference in Mexico, Harris clarified her comments by committing to visiting the border, which would have been a simple way to settle the issue the first time she was asked. Her shaky handling of the politics around the immigration issue drew new questions about her political dexterity both as vice president and as a future aspirant for the White House, because the trip this week was her first test at the highest levels of statecraft. Administration officials perplexed by Harris' border answer and worry it will overshadow her trip The right-wing media is trying to portray Harris as hopelessly inept when it comes to matters at the border \u2013 and she gave them an opening by appearing to try to distance herself from the problems there. The awkwardness of her answer to Holt came to dominate the storyline about her trip, leading to questions about her preparedness and sexist critiques of her readiness to take on these challenges. It also overshadowed her substantive answers about policy in the Northern Triangle and the intensive, hands-on efforts that she is making to dig deeply into the subject as she tries to shape the strategy for the region. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others GOP leaders \u2013 many of whom have taken high-profile trips to the border without managing to solve the problem \u2013 pounced on what they perceived as a gaffe: \u201cKamala Harris hasn\u2019t been to Europe, she hasn\u2019t been to Australia but we don\u2019t have an Australian border crisis or a European border crisis,\u201d Cruz tweeted. \u201cWe have a crisis on the southern border. She should come to Texas and see the crisis firsthand. #BidenBorderCrisis.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, piled on by tweeting that \u201cthe only thing Vice President Kamala Harris managed to achieve in the last 3 days was avoid actually dealing with the worsening crisis at America\u2019s border.\u201d It is clear that some of the criticism of Harris, especially in conservative media, is more acute because she is the first Black, female vice president. For example, Fox News commentator Katie Pavlich claimed Tuesday that Harris was chosen by Biden \u201cbased on gender and skin color rather than actual talent and expertise\u201d \u2013 an offensive comment that overlooks the record and achievements of the former prosecutor who served as California attorney general and a US senator. But success in politics hinges on the ability to be nimble both at home and on the world stage, to understand how to deflect criticism or unwelcome questions in a way that turns them to one\u2019s advantage. Harris has always struggled in that regard \u2013 even from her early days in California politics \u2013 and she knows she is facing greater scrutiny now because Biden said he was running as a \u201ctransitional figure\u201d and then tapped her to be the last person in the room whenever he was making important decisions. Precisely because she is being viewed as Biden\u2019s potential heir and a possible future Democratic nominee, she will face a relentless, years-long campaign by the right to discredit her. That means the spotlight on her will always be bright, and she will need a political operation that is always ready to react. The poor reviews of this first trip recalled some of the missteps of a 2020 campaign for the White House that did not live up to its early promise and whether she has learned from them. She has taken on two major assignments from Biden \u2013 both halting migration from the Northern Triangle and the assault on voting rights \u2013 that are among the thorniest issues facing the administration. Her first foray abroad raised questions of preparation and whether Harris has the kind of robust political team that vice presidents need \u2013 especially those who are relative novices on the world stage and are quite new to the constant scrutiny of top-line politics. Kamala Harris to lead Biden administration's efforts on voting rights For someone seen as potentially the first female president, who is a heartbeat away from the top job already, these issues are especially important. It will take time for Harris to develop the policy assurance and capacity to swat away pesky press questions \u2013 demonstrated, for example, by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton, who was less gifted than Harris at retail politics, nevertheless had the ability of the most accomplished global politicians of thinking several sentences ahead while sparring with the press or a foreign official \u2013 a skill Harris has yet to master. While it is not Harris\u2019 fault that immigration is an intractable issue that has defied presidents for decades, the notion that her staff has repeatedly advanced that her portfolio extends only to the international, diplomatic aspects of the problem is disingenuous. It\u2019s easy to see why her aides might see the border issues as a poisoned political chalice. But presidents, and by extension vice presidents, don\u2019t get to pick and choose areas of responsibility to suit them. The White House gets saddled with every problem that no one else can solve. Still, none of the damage that occurred to Harris on her trip is irreparable. And if the question is gaffes on a foreign trip, her wobbles pale in comparison with the behavior of former President Donald Trump, whose travel was an endless parade of insults to US friends and affronts to democratic values. Trump, for instance, used a summit in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin to trash US intelligence agencies on live television as he stood by the side of the former KGB officer who had interfered in a US election to help him. And he palled around with one of the world\u2019s most cruel dictators, Kim Jong Un of North Korea. It\u2019s safe to say that Harris would never replicate that conduct. And though this first trip was a rocky one, she has plenty of time left to prove herself. CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The first six-ish months of Kamala Harris\u2019 time as vice president have, generally speaking, gone according to her plan. She\u2019s been a consistent messenger for President Joe Biden while learning the possibilities (and limitations) that come with being second-in-command. That smooth ride ended this week, thanks to a confluence of events \u2013 some within her control, others not. * The White House made a big deal out of Harris\u2019 two-day trip to Central America earlier this week. And Harris\u2019 main goal was simple: To send a message to Central Americans to stop coming to the US southern border. Which she did, to the consternation of liberals but the satisfaction of Biden. But the visit wound up being overshadowed by her seemingly flippant answer to a question from NBC\u2019s Lester Holt about why she hadn\u2019t yet visited the southern border. (Biden has tasked Harris with leading the administration\u2019s response to stemming the flow of migration from Central America.) \u201cAt some point, you know, we are going to the border,\u201d Harris said in the interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the border. So this whole, this whole, this whole thing about the border. We\u2019ve been to the border. We\u2019ve been to the border.\u201d Holt responded: \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the border.\u201d \u201cI, and I haven\u2019t been to Europe,\u201d Harris replied to Holt, with a laugh. \u201cAnd I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t understand the point that you\u2019re making.\u201d Which, not great. As CNN reported on Tuesday: \u201cSeveral sources say there was a real hope inside the White House that Harris\u2019 first trip abroad would be a success, and worry that what looked like ill-prepared answers to that inevitable question would overshadow it.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! * Aside from immigration, Harris\u2019 other big job in the Biden administration is to work to expand voting rights \u2013 and push back against a series of laws being passed in GOP-controlled states that make it harder to vote. That effort took a massive body blow on Sunday, when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) announced that he would oppose the For the People Act, a major election reform package that Democratic leaders on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue had been advocating for. Manchin\u2019s opposition not only ensures the measure is DOA in the Senate but also that its potency as an issue to be used against Republicans in 2022 is much reduced. While Manchin sought to pivot \u2014 calling for passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2013 the prospects for passage of that legislation look decidedly dim. All of which means that passing any sort of major (or minor) election reform proposal in this Congress seems very unlikely at the moment. * Politico reported on Monday that Biden is growing increasingly likely to seek a second term in 2024 despite the fact that he would be in his early 80s at that time. \u201cAccording to his allies, Biden believes that he is the Democrat best equipped to take on Trump, just as he did in the lead up to 2020,\u201d Politico wrote. \u201cThey also say that is driven by the idea that his legacy could be that of the president who defeated Trump and Trumpism, which he sees as an ugly, corrosive movement.\u201d Add it all up and you get a bad week for Harris. And unfortunately for her, it\u2019s not likely to be just a bad week. Manchin\u2019s opposition to the For the People Act, coupled with the complex challenges at the border \u2013 there\u2019s a reason none of the last three presidents have been able to find a workable solution \u2013 raise the possibility that Harris\u2019 two main priorities may not deliver her the sorts of wins a vice president with an eye on the top job might want. Republicans are using this moment to ramp up their attacks on Harris. (Worth noting: Harris has been a regular target for Republicans since she began running for president \u2013 and the frequency of those attacks has only increased as the GOP has struggled to find a good hit on Biden.) \u201cThe only thing Vice President Kamala Harris managed to achieve in the last 3 days was avoid actually dealing with the worsening crisis at America\u2019s border,\u201d tweeted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Those attacks, however, won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) bother Harris \u2013 or Biden. The Trump wing of the Republican Party, which is the majority of the GOP base, is heavily invested in demonizing Harris, and will find ways to do so no matter what the vice president says or does. (Plus, the fact that Harris is the first woman and first person of color to serve as vice president shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone in this conversation.) What should concern Harris and her advisers is that her first foreign trip \u2013 a heavily touted one no less \u2013 did not go to plan. And her two domestic priorities, immigration and voting rights, appear to be stuck in neutral at best.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats, growing impatient as they watch their ambitious agenda imperiled in the evenly divided chamber, are prepared to go it alone on President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping infrastructure package \u2013 and pressure Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema into backing a Democratic-only approach. At a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, informed her caucus that she would try to get a bipartisan deal with Republicans on an infrastructure package and that she had Biden\u2019s blessing to make that attempt, according to three sources in the room. But after Sinema left the meeting, one Democrat after another teed off on the strategy and expressed deep frustration at what they viewed as a fruitless effort to find consensus with Senate Republicans \u2013 worried that any bipartisan deal would unlikely win the support of many in their caucus, reflecting the growing tension between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. \u201cThere is no way Manchin and Sinema are going to cut a deal that represents the view of the caucus,\u201d said one Democratic senator. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d Another Democratic senator added, \u201cA group of four or five people don\u2019t get to carry 50 Democratic votes on their back.\u201d Senate Democrats scramble after Manchin upends key progressive priorities The Democratic frustration centers on this fear: They may squander their best opportunity to pass much of Biden\u2019s agenda with their party controlling both chambers of Congress and their majority at stake in next year\u2019s midterms. And with the prospects of passing legislation only bound to get more bleak as the next elections draw nearer, Democrats say now is the moment to jettison Republicans and try to get an infrastructure bill done along straight party lines. But they need the support of Manchin and Sinema, who spent Tuesday evening in the basement of the Capitol trying to cut a deal with a handful of GOP senators \u2013 within hours of Biden ending talks with Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia after they hit an impasse following weeks of negotiations. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready to move on from bipartisanship for major priorities for the Biden administration for a while now,\u201d said Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said that Democrats have a bad history of wasting precious time, stemming from the Obama years. \u201cWe have a lousy record to live down,\u201d Whitehouse said. Already, Democrats are watching as their hopes collapse of passing a massive bill to rewrite the nation\u2019s election laws amid stiff opposition from Senate Republicans and the refusal of Manchin and a handful of other Democrats to gut the Senate\u2019s filibuster rules. Efforts to address growing episodes of gun violence have stalled. A push to change the nation\u2019s immigration laws continues to face an uphill climb. And even talks over enacting a new law to overhaul policing practices \u2013 long seen as the most likely bipartisan deal that might be reached \u2013 has hit roadblocks. But the quandary facing Democrats is this: They need the support of all 50 members of their caucus to successfully push through their economic agenda through the filibuster-proof budget process \u2013 and they don\u2019t have that support from Manchin and Sinema, among some others, who want to find a deal with Republicans instead. Top Democrats refused to say Tuesday if they had confidence that Manchin and Sinema could find a bipartisan deal that could win over their caucus. Senate fails to advance Paycheck Fairness Act amid GOP opposition \u201cThere\u2019s not a hell of a lot of time left in this session,\u201d Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats and one of the senators who pushed back at the Democratic lunch, said Tuesday. \u201cI have not seen any indication that Republicans are prepared to support the kind of serious legislation this country needs.\u201d Indeed, after he left the lunch, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also would not say if he had faith that the Sinema-Manchin effort could produce a bipartisan deal to the satisfaction of his caucus. Instead, he indicated that he would allow those bipartisan talks to continue, while pursuing a go-it-alone strategy to move an infrastructure bill along straight party lines. That would allow the talks to continue this month \u2013 to see if any bipartisan deal can be reached \u2013 before moving ahead next month by passing a bill through the budget reconciliation process, a tactic used by Democrats to enact the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law earlier this year without GOP support. But there are strict limits about what provisions can be included in such a package \u2013 since they must be budget-related in order to meet strict Senate rules \u2013 plus it would only pass if all 50 members of the Democratic Caucus agree. \u201cWe\u2019re pursuing, a two-path proposal,\u201d Schumer said when asked about the bipartisan talks. \u201cOn the one hand, there\u2019s bipartisan negotiations, and those are continuing. \u2026 We all know, as a caucus, we will not be able to do all the things the country needs in a totally bipartisan, a bipartisan way. \u2026 And so at the same time, we are pursuing the pursuit of reconciliation.\u201d Schumer\u2019s No. 2 made clear that the success of the rest of Biden\u2019s agenda rests on successfully navigating the reconciliation process. \u201cI hope,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin when asked if the agenda comes down to the reconciliation process. Schumer this month has set the stage for votes on hot-button issues that lack the support of 10 Republicans needed to break a filibuster \u2013 namely on elections legislation and House-passed bills stemming from gun violence. Plus, Schumer doesn\u2019t have the support within his caucus to change the filibuster rules and lower the 60-vote requirement for advancing legislation down to 51 votes. And the skepticism is broader than just Manchin and Sinema. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who could face a tough reelection next November, has not yet embraced calls to gut the filibuster\u2019s 60-vote threshold, though she backs some changes to how the tactic is used. Asked if she would support lowering the 60-vote threshold, Hassan would not answer directly but did say, \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to do as much as we can\u201d in a bipartisan way. Manchin defends bucking voting rights bill and digs in against eliminating the filibuster \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who also is involved in the bipartisan infrastructure talks, when asked if he backs gutting the filibuster. \u201cI think the filibuster does serve a purpose. On the other side, some people are using it just to, you know, block things. And that\u2019s not good.\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat up for reelection next year, indicated he hasn\u2019t decided if he backs lowering the 60-vote requirement or if his position is in line with Sinema\u2019s opposition to changing the rules. While Kelly said Tuesday he is \u201cgenerally a believer in change,\u201d the freshman Democrat said: \u201cI\u2019ll evaluate any change to our rules, regardless of what they are, based on what\u2019s in the best interest of Arizona, and the best interest of our country.\u201d To many Democrats \u2013 particularly progressives in the House \u2013 allowing the likes of moderates in the Senate dictate their party\u2019s ambitions, continues to enrage them. Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a leader of the progressive caucus in the House, said it\u2019s time for Biden to step up. \u201cThe reason we got the American Rescue plan done is because the President leaned in. The longer we let things sit around, the more time we give to opposition, the more time we give to people who just want to delay because they don\u2019t want to get anything done,\u201d Jayapal said. Others were equally as blunt in directing their anger at the Democratic-led Senate. \u201cI am very frustrated,\u201d Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThe Senate is not doing their job.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush announced Wednesday night that he\u2019s running for attorney general in Texas, setting up a GOP showdown with one of the most high-profile Republican attorneys general in the country, Ken Paxton. \u201cI am proud to announce I am a Republican candidate to be the next Texas attorney general,\u201d he said before supporters in Austin. Bush came out swinging in his campaign announcement, taking shots at Paxton, who is currently under indictment for securities fraud and, separately, facing an FBI investigation for abuse of office. \u201cEnough is enough, Ken. You\u2019ve brought way too much scandal and too little integrity to this office,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go.\u201d Bush \u2013 the son of former two-term Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the nephew of former President George W. Bush and the grandson of the late former President George H.W. Bush \u2013 is running as a supporter of former President Donald Trump, despite the at-times blistering feud between Trump and the Bush family. At a campaign kickoff event at Backyard Beer Garden in downtown Austin, supporters praised Bush as the future of the Republican Party in Texas and highlighted his support of Trump as a key credential. \u201cI think we can all agree that President Trump was one of the best things to happen to this country,\u201d Karen Newton, immediate past president of Texas Federation of Republican Women, said onstage as one of the introductory speakers before Bush. Joacim Hernandez, vice chair of the Texas Young Republican Federation, argued Bush is uniquely positioned to unite the GOP. \u201cHe has a track record of support for President Trump and his America First policies, but he also has a track record of character and integrity.\u201d As land commissioner since 2015, Bush has long been viewed by political observers as a rising star in the GOP. He speaks Spanish and was involved in the founding of the political group Hispanic Republicans of Texas. He was also an officer in the Navy Reserves and a former businessman, with a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law. Paxton, meanwhile, has been state attorney general since 2015 after serving in the Texas Legislature for more than a decade as both a state representative and state senator. He was highly active in filing federal lawsuits during the Obama administration \u2013 most notably, he led a 20-state challenge against the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and has filed multiple suits against the Biden administration over a range of issues from immigration to Medicaid. A staunch ally of Trump, Paxton also led the lawsuit contesting election results in four states that Trump lost in November. The Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit. Paxton previously said in a media interview that he\u2019s running for reelection. His campaign spokesman Ian Prior responded to Bush\u2019s announcement Wednesday by calling Paxton \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d in standing up for Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cTexans know Attorney General Paxton\u2019s rock-solid conservative record,\u201d Prior said in a statement. \u201cFrom defeating Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous executive order halting deportations of illegal aliens, to his willingness to stand up for secure elections, Ken Paxton has been and will continue to be the tip of the spear in protecting President Trump\u2019s America First principles.\u201d Clouding Paxton\u2019s run for reelection will be the FBI investigation and separate indictment. Paxton vehemently denies the charges and allegations. Bush made clear Wednesday night he won\u2019t be shy in going after Paxton\u2019s legal issues. \u201cWe have a web of corruption and lies that affect one of the highest offices in our land and it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d Bush said. Trump, who remains highly popular in Texas and influential in GOP primaries, has indicated he plans to make an endorsement in the race. Both men have sought support from Trump, and it\u2019s unclear yet who will get the coveted nod. While the Bush family and Trump have clashed over the years \u2013 most notably when Trump and Jeb Bush battled it out in the 2016 presidential primary \u2013 George P. Bush has supported the former President. He voted for Trump in the 2016 race against Hillary Clinton and supported him again in 2020. \u201cI like them both very much,\u201d Trump said in a statement last week to CNN. \u201cI\u2019ll be making my endorsement and recommendation to the great people of Texas in the not-so-distant future.\u201d Speaking to reporters after his speech Wednesday night, Bush said he has asked Trump for his endorsement and \u201cwould love to have his support.\u201d Asked by CNN about the attacks Trump has made on his family, Bush conceded that \u201cpolitics is a contact sport.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at a stage in our state where, you know, we can\u2019t let a mean tweet get in the way of doing the right thing,\u201d he said. Bush had made the phrase \u201chonor and integrity\u201d a theme of his announcement speech, echoing a refrain often used by his uncle. Asked if he thinks that message will work in his campaign, he said: \u201cAbsolutely, I can take all the tips I can get, whether it\u2019s W or Trump.\u201d As for his attacks on Paxton, Bush said he doesn\u2019t believe many Texas Republicans \u201cknow about his conduct\u201d and there will be \u201cplenty of opportunities\u201d to talk about it during the campaign. He confirmed that members of his family will hit the road for him \u201cat some point.\u201d Bush will make South Texas \u2013 where Trump made heavy inroads in November \u2013 a key part of his strategy, and he plans to make his first official campaign trip to the Rio Grande Valley on Thursday. Given his political connections and Paxton\u2019s legal troubles, Bush is expected to raise significant cash for the race. Matt Mackowiak, veteran GOP strategist in Texas, said the race is unusual given that two high-profile statewide officials are battling it out in a primary. \u201cI think George P. Bush sees an opportunity and believes he can be a more effective attorney general and that\u2019s the case he\u2019s going to make to voters,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the challenge is that Paxton is a solid conservative and the Republican primary electorate will have to be convinced that he\u2019s not.\u201d This story has been updated with further developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has turned herself into one of the most visible Republicans in the country \u2013 stoking an endless stream of controversies that has caused headaches for a defeated party trying to find its footing while she rakes in campaign cash without fear of consequences. Her most recent incendiary comments have followed her home to Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District in the northwest corner of the state and the publicity hasn\u2019t been welcome. \u201cGreene defends controversial Holocaust comments\u201d read a banner front-page headline in a newspaper box outside the Oakwood Caf\u00e9 in Dalton. Greene\u2019s political security in the district \u2013 where 75% of voters supported former President Donald Trump last November \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that all of her constituents are relishing her role as the GOP\u2019s flamethrower or that they approve of the recent anti-Semitic comments that she has used to rally her supporters. In interviews with nearly two dozen voters in the district this week, some Republicans who voted for the freshman congresswoman expressed dismay about her reckless comments comparing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s mask requirements in the House chamber to the actions that Nazi leaders used to target Jews during the Holocaust. Some questioned the motives behind Greene\u2019s attention-seeking maneuvers and said they were open to supporting a different Republican for her seat \u2013 though no formidable challenger has emerged yet. She\u2019s already been stripped of her committee assignments by a vote in the House, rendering her an essentially ineffective legislator, but she\u2019s largely gone undisciplined by party leadership in Washington, DC, as congressional Republicans bow to Trump. Just this week, the Senate GOP blocked the establishment of a commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol that was fueled by Trump\u2019s Big Lie. All of that underscores that while Greene may be among the loudest voices in the GOP right now, not all her views are entirely out of step: a majority of Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen and about a quarter, according to a new PRRI poll, agree with a set of conspiratorial beliefs linked to the QAnon movement that Greene has also expressed interest in. The crowd that flocked to Greene\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d rally Thursday night with imperiled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz in Dalton \u2013 the heart of Greene\u2019s conservative district \u2013 greeted her with adulation as she voiced her full-throated support of Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Unbowed by reprimands from her GOP colleagues, she made a fresh comparison between Democrats and Nazis, claimed that the cartels \u201clove\u201d President Joe Biden during a discourse on immigration, and then did a racist impression in what she described as her \u201creally bad Mexican accent.\u201d Inside the Oakwood Cafe that morning, 78-year-old Phil Neff, who supported Trump, paid for his breakfast amid the morning bustle. Afterward, he told CNN he believes that Greene \u201chas more interest in herself than serving the community,\u201d but added with a note of resignation: \u201cThat\u2019s what the people chose.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s helping herself. But from a political standpoint, I think her organization is growing. A lot of money is pouring into it from the national market, and so she may be so strong that nobody can defeat her,\u201d said Neff, who supported a different candidate in the GOP primary last year. He declined to say whether he voted for Greene last November and said he would \u201cconsider who the opposition is\u201d before he votes for her for reelection. Pulling into Dalton\u2019s historic downtown, about 30 miles southeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee, a large sign declares it the \u201ccarpet capital of the world.\u201d According to the city\u2019s visitors bureau, Dalton and the surrounding area produce 90% of the world\u2019s carpet, and the industry employs more than 30,000 people in Whitfield County alone. But downtown looks like most others in main street America: There are coffee shops and florists, restaurants and taverns, pawn shops, boutique clothing and home decor stores and auto repair shops. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the bad publicity that Dalton, Georgia, is getting,\u201d Neff said when asked about Greene\u2019s rising national profile. \u201cDalton, Georgia, is recognized throughout the world for the development of the carpet. That\u2019s what most people know it by. But now it\u2019s being known by the idea that everybody in Dalton was a supporter of Marjorie Greene \u2013 and they were not.\u201d Brandyn Parker is a 37-year-old Republican leather worker at a shop downtown. Standing outside the store Thursday with a possum on a leash, Parker said she too is concerned about how Greene\u2019s comments are shaping perceptions of the GOP and the 14th District. Parker voted for Trump in 2016, but skipped the 2020 election because she didn\u2019t feel like she had good choices at the top of the ticket. \u201cI feel like the things she thinks and says \u2013 and of course, the bigger following she has \u2013 that makes people think that everyone in the Republican Party feels and thinks that way when it\u2019s not true,\u201d said Parker. She added that she didn\u2019t understand Greene\u2019s invocation of Nazi Germany. \u201cWearing a mask is not anything compared to the Holocaust.\u201d Wayne White, a retired conservative who voted for Greene in November even though he did not support her during the GOP primary, said the Georgia congresswoman\u2019s comments were \u201cjust not appropriate.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be comparing anything for the Nazis and the Holocaust. It\u2019s different worlds,\u201d White said during an interview in Rome, Georgia, hours before Greene\u2019s rally. \u201cShe has been ineffective, and she\u2019ll continue to be ineffective as long as she is as controversial as she is. She doesn\u2019t garner support of other Republicans.\u201d But Greene also has plenty of defenders within the Republican base \u2013 despite her past embrace of QAnon and other conspiracy theories, racist and Islamophobic rhetoric, and past Facebook comments and videos unearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile in which she indicated support for executing prominent Democrats. The freshman congresswoman, who is attempting to carry Trump\u2019s banner of grievance while weaponizing his no-apology tactics, won her seat in 2020 after defeating neurosurgeon John Cowan in the GOP runoff after they both finished in the top two of a nine-person primary. Her Democratic opponent dropped out of the general election in September citing \u201cpersonal and family reasons.\u201d In the few short months she\u2019s been in Congress, Greene has created major headaches for her party, not just by lobbing her inflammatory criticisms at Democrats, but also by undermining Republican leaders in the GOP conference. Republican strategists both nationally and in Georgia worry about how her off-the-cuff remarks, as well as the attention to her embrace of violence and conspiracy theories, continually send other GOP politicians skittering off message as they are forced to answer for her fringe theories and opinions. Over the past week, Greene has defended her comparisons between the mask-wearing policies on the House floor and the Nazis, insisting she is simply saying aloud what \u201cregular people say at home at their kitchen table.\u201d Though House Republican leaders eventually condemned her remarks \u2013 with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calling them \u201cappalling\u201d \u2013 she has doubled down. During her Thursday rally with Gaetz, she went a step further by comparing the Democratic Party to Nazis during a tangent about the Biden administration\u2019s economic aid policies. Greene has been one of the fiercest defenders of Trump\u2019s lies that he won the 2020 election \u2013 and her presence with Gaetz in Dalton was meant to show their support for the continuing challenges to Georgia\u2019s results even though there is no widespread evidence of voter fraud. But just as Republican voters often excused Trump\u2019s outlandish statements as proof of his authenticity, some voters in this conservative Georgia district praise Greene for her candor. Robin Deal, who works in human resources and supported Greene in 2020, suggested that the congresswoman\u2019s remarks have been misunderstood. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with that statement,\u201d Deal said in an interview in Rome with CNN\u2019s Martin Savidge when asked about Greene\u2019s comparisons between mask requirements and the Holocaust. \u201cBut I do agree with her right to say it.\u201d \u201cI believe that she, like I said, is a representative of the people, she\u2019s speaking as a regular person, not as a politician,\u201d Deal said. Josalyn Shults, a 41-year-old nurse who voted for Greene and Trump in 2020, said no one should be making comparisons to Nazi Germany, but argued that Greene was raising a legitimate point about mask requirements. \u201cIt does feel like people are getting some of the rights taken away that they\u2019re used to,\u201d Shults said. Sandra Campbell, another Georgia voter, said she believes Greene and Trump are representative of the \u201creal America.\u201d \u201cI am a patriot. I love America. People have fought, bled and died for this country. It\u2019s time for people to get back to the real America,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd Marjorie Taylor Greene, people think she\u2019s outspoken, but she stands for what is right.\u201d When asked what Greene stands for, Campbell said: \u201cGod and country. And that\u2019s what we want for our children, our grandchildren.\u201d And when asked about Greene\u2019s recent comments comparing mask mandates to the Holocaust, Campbell replied: \u201cWell, you know what, we\u2019re all imperfect, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Campbell noted, however, that she didn\u2019t know exactly what Greene said about the Holocaust, but said the comparison could be applicable to Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines, which have been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Rome voter Steve Karakos, who is semi-retired but has worked as a construction contractor, was one of many Republicans who expressed misgivings about some of Greene\u2019s remarks \u2013 but said he is likely to continue supporting her. The Georgia congresswoman, he said, is \u201cvery outspoken like a pitbull.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s what we need on the Republican side,\u201d he said. He isn\u2019t comfortable with some of the comments that Greene has made, but that\u2019s unlikely to sway his vote. \u201cI would probably vote for her again,\u201d Karakos said. \u201cBecause the ones who make the biggest noise are the ones just getting heard right now.\u201d CNN\u2019s Martin Savidge and Donie O\u2019Sullivan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democratic activist Cam Ashling pulled out the stops ahead of Georgia\u2019s general election last year and its recent Senate runoffs. Her Georgia Advancing Progress PAC sent 12,000 handwritten postcards in an array of languages \u2013 Korean, Vietnamese, Urdu and more \u2013 to reach voters in Georgia\u2019s fast-growing Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Her team hosted a K-Pop dance rally near one early voting location in suburban Atlanta and served bubble tea near polling places in others. That effort and those of other activists paid off: AAPI turnout surged in Georgia with nearly 62,000 additional Asian American and Pacific Islanders casting ballots in 2020 general election than did so four years earlier, according to an analysis by Democratic data firm TargetSmart. That far exceeded President Joe Biden\u2019s 11,779-vote margin of victory in the state. But Ashling\u2019s exultation over the 2020 results was quickly tempered by concerns that a raft of new voting restrictions could blunt the political power of this burgeoning voting bloc. Georgia\u2019s new voting law, passed by the GOP-led state legislature and signed swiftly by the state\u2019s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in March, cuts the time allowed for voters to request absentee ballots, bars election officials from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters and imposes new identification requirements to receive a ballot by mail. It also makes it a misdemeanor for an outside group to approach voters in line to offer them refreshments, including water. \u201cI thought, \u2018Was this directed at us?\u2019 \u201d Ashling said of the Georgia law. \u201cThey saw we were giving bubble tea, and now we have a law that prohibits snacks and water at the polls.\u201d Around the country, AAPI activists are increasingly worried that new voting restrictions approved by Republican-controlled legislatures in recent months could undermine the gains made last year when pandemic-related rules made it easier for wide swaths of Americans cast their ballots. Many of the new laws seek to restrict access to ballot drop boxes or impose new requirements, such as identification, to vote by mail. Proponents said those restrictions are needed to guard against voter fraud, including an ineligible voter receiving a ballot by mail and illegally voting. In a recent speech, Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 the nation\u2019s highest-ranking Asian American elected official \u2013 noted that 64% of Asian Americans cast their ballots by mail and said efforts to restrict that form of voting take aim at the AAPI community. \u201cWe must see these efforts for what they are,\u201d she said during an appearance at the AAPI Victory Alliance Unity Summit. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear-eyed: They are an attempt to suppress the right to vote.\u201d Nationally, Asian Americans make up about 7% of the total US population. But they were the fastest-growing segment of eligible voters among all major racial or ethnic groups between 2000 and 2020, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census data. Some of the biggest population gains have come in the booming Sun Belt \u2013 places such as Georgia, Arizona and Texas \u2013 where changing demographics have made the states more politically competitive. Last year, Biden became the first Democratic presidential contender in more than two decades to win Georgia and Arizona. This year, Republicans in those states have moved to impose new voting restrictions, spurred on by former President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent falsehoods about a stolen election. (While there have been rare instances of voter fraud from mail-in balloting, experts agree that it is not a widespread problem in US elections. And a voter fraud commission that Trump established during his time in office disbanded without providing any proof to back up his claims of voter fraud in the 2016 presidential contest.) Asian American voters are more likely to be immigrants than other major racial or ethnic groups. Two-thirds of eligible Asian American voters in 2020 were naturalized citizens, compared to about 25% of Latinos, according to Pew\u2019s figures. As a result, Trump\u2019s immigration policies and his rhetoric about the coronavirus\u2019 origins proved a galvanizing force for these voters last year, said Varun Nikore, president of the AAPI Victory Fund, which mobilizes progressive voters. During his White House tenure, Trump used words such as \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d to refer the coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan, China. And during the pandemic, Asian Americans have faced escalating violence, with reported hate crimes against Asians in nearly two dozen of the nation\u2019s largest cities and counties up 194% in the first quarter this year over the same time period last year, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State University San Bernardino. \u201cThere is among certain AAPI cultures a sense of: \u201cLet\u2019s not stand up and rise above the crowd. Let\u2019s not get noticed. Let\u2019s just put our heads down and work,\u2019 \u201d Nikore said. \u201cBut there was kind of a collective realization during the pandemic that folks could not be silent and that we needed to be vocal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has turned many more people in the AAPI community into activists instead of passive watchers of politics on TV.\u201d Nationally, Asian American turnout soared to record levels \u2013 jumping from 49% in 2016 to 60% in 2020, according to an analysis by AAPI Data, which collects data and conducts policy research. Pacific Islander participation jumped from roughly 41% to nearly 56%. AAPI voters trend Democratic. But they are not a monolithic voting bloc, with party preferences varying by voter\u2019s country of origin and age, said Neil Ruiz, associate director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center. Krithi Vachaspati, an Indian-American graduate student who lives in the Phoenix area said, the \u201crise in racial tensions and hate crimes against Asian Americans, and really anybody, is activating more of our folks, for sure.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Biden and Harris have a lock on her support. The 25-year-old voted for the ticket, but she says she and her friends would have preferred a more progressive president in the mold of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Among her current concerns: US policy favoring Israel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like Trump,\u201d Vachaspati said. \u201cBut we\u2019re equally critical of the current administration, and we\u2019re not keeping our mouths shut.\u201d Back in Georgia, Asian American groups are challenging the new restrictions. Several advocacy groups have sued to block the law, arguing that new limits on ballot drop boxes and a shorter window for requesting an absentee ballot could harm AAPI voters, who disproportionately cast their ballots by mail in recent elections. Given the massacre of six Asian women in the Atlanta area in March and continued violence against Asians, \u201cthe accessibility of absentee voting has taken on particular importance for the AAPI community,\u201d Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, argued in its lawsuit.   Kemp has said the shorter window to request absentee ballots \u2013 starting 11 weeks before the election and ending 11 days before \u2013 was designed to accommodate requests from local elections officials. Previously, voters had a six-month period to request ballots, which AAPI activists said gave first-time Asian American voters and those who need language assistance time to study election materials. \u201cYou still have weeks and weeks to request your absentee ballot,\u201d Kemp said at a news conference earlier this year. \u201cBut now we are cutting that deadline a little bit shorter at 11 days prior to the election to make sure the voter has time to get their ballot back where it will be counted.\u201d In all, seven lawsuits are now pending against Georgia\u2019s new voting restrictions, according to a tally by Georgia Public Broadcasting. Ashling, who also worked on the campaigns of Biden and Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in the last election, said activists hope the law \u201cdies by a thousand cuts\u201d in court. But if it stands, Ashling said she and her team will start over with a new education campaign. And Georgia\u2019s newest group of AAPI voters, she said, \u201cwill have to re-learn stuff (they) just figured out how to do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, argued that propping up GOP Rep. Liz Cheney as \u201csome sort of hero\u201d for breaking with her party about former President Donald Trump \u201cis a bit misguided,\u201d criticizing her for not speaking up sooner. \u201cWe had four years where she could have stood up and said, \u2018There\u2019s a problem here. What Donald Trump is doing is wrong,\u2019\u201d Amash told CNN\u2019s David Axelrod in an episode of \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast released Thursday. During his time in office, Amash left the Republican Party in 2019 and became an independent as he argued that Trump had engaged in impeachable offenses. Amash said Cheney never came to his aid during that time when he was speaking out against Trump. \u201cFor a long time, I was warning that the president\u2019s approach could lead to things like violence, could lead to a lot of animosity and contempt, and all sorts of things that would be harmful to our country. She didn\u2019t stand up for that view,\u201d he said. Now, Cheney, a conservative who voted in line with Trump\u2019s agenda nearly 93% of the time, finds herself an outlier in her party for voting to impeach Trump over the January 6 Capitol insurrection and refusing to embrace the former Republican President and his falsehoods about the 2020 election, resulting in her ouster from her party leadership position last week. On \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, Amash questioned why Cheney chose now to speak up about Trump after years of backing the former president during his first impeachment trial and the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cI say that not as someone who\u2019s saying you can never change, you can never grow, you can never learn, but I\u2019d like to see some real development when people learn. Like, what is it that changed your mind? Liz Cheney, what is it that you saw that made it so different for you versus how Trump was behaving, say, before January 6th? I mean, I don\u2019t think there was any radical difference there. It was the same, what, because the outcome was different? Because that was the one time they stormed the Capitol?\u201d he said. He argued that \u201cone of the biggest problems we have in politics is that when someone is inconsistent like that, where they\u2019re doing the wrong thing for four years and then they flip on a dime, there\u2019s a tendency to turn them into heroes. And I think that\u2019s a huge problem because it lets people get away with things.\u201d \u201cWith that said, I also think we need to be careful, because you want to give people the room to learn and change,\u201d he added. Amash was a five-term GOP congressman from Michigan when he decided in 2019 to abandon the Republican Party after months of criticizing Trump and his Republican colleagues for not holding the president to account for the actions detailed in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the 2016 election. He later voted with Democrats that year to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress after a House investigation into allegations Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals while withholding US security assistance and a White House meeting. Having decided not to seek reelection in 2020, Amash retired from Congress at the end of his term. A few days after Amash left Congress, Trump supporters, fueled by Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him, stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s win in the 2020 election. Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, charging him with \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d She continued to publicly reject Trump\u2019s election lies, leading her House GOP colleagues last week to vote to remove the Wyoming Republican from her position as chair of the House Republican Conference. On the podcast, Amash theorized that Cheney made a \u201cmiscalculation\u201d in believing that the Republican Party was turning away from Trump after the January 6 insurrection, with several Trump allies in Congress like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham laying blame on Trump for the riots and denouncing him, only to backtrack. \u201cI really believe that if she had not seen the whole party moving, she would not have moved either. And that, to me, is indicative of the problem we have in Congress that people are waiting until they feel they\u2019re safe. I think she thought she was safe. She moved. Now she\u2019s got no choice, she can\u2019t backtrack,\u201d Amash said. When Axelrod pointed out that Cheney released a statement ahead of her impeachment vote, Amash suggested that Cheney did not grasp that others would not stand with her against Trump. Amash said that\u2019s why he respects Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez \u2013 for \u201cstaying true\u201d to herself \u2013 despite having very different views from the progressive New York congresswoman. \u201cI see her, like a few others in Congress, as people who will stick to their principles, stick to their guns, who are up front with people about who they are and are willing to challenge the leadership, are willing to stand up for their views and their principles and their constituents, regardless of the pressure they\u2019re facing. And I don\u2019t see many members of Congress like that,\u201d he said. He said he believes Ocasio-Cortez \u201chas a set of principles\u201d and \u201cbrings those to the House floor and tries to fight\u201d for policies. \u201cAnd there are other people who I think are mostly there for self aggrandizement, and to do a little bit of entertaining, and raise some money for their campaign committee,\u201d he said. During the podcast interview, Amash was critical of his former party, including its pivot to Trumpism and stance on immigration, and slammed the House Freedom Caucus he co-founded for morphing into a \u201ctool for one man,\u201d as its members became Trump\u2019s loudest defenders in Congress. Amash acknowledged that, as a libertarian, he was always an anomaly in the GOP and broke with Republican leadership at times, particularly on issues like surveillance and fiscal policy. He said he had a \u201ctendency to stick with the Republicans on committee votes,\u201d but was booted from the House Budget Committee for disagreeing with the GOP leadership at the time. \u201cToday you can say the most outrageous things. You can threaten other members. You can be, you know, spreading all sorts of lies and propaganda, smearing people, you can do all sorts of things and they won\u2019t boot you from the committee,\u201d he said. Asked by Axelrod why the GOP leadership appears \u201cfrightened\u201d by members like Georgia Republican Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene, who have espoused dangerous conspiracies and use inflammatory rhetoric, Amash replied, \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of Donald Trump\u2019s voters.\u201d \u201cIn a lot of districts in this country, if you\u2019re not, you know, totally aligned with Donald Trump, you\u2019re in trouble. You\u2019re going to get voted out of office,\u201d he said. He argued that Republicans have since embraced Trump because they attempted to maintain a distance from him during the 2018 midterm elections and \u201cgot wiped out.\u201d \u201cThat reinforced in their minds, maybe Trump has the formula,\u201d he said. Amash, who didn\u2019t support Trump for president, said he was also concerned about Biden becoming president, not because of his character nor \u201cso much about his policies.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s that I don\u2019t think he, like a lot of other people in politics, recognize what is the true problem in our politics \u2014 that concentrated power, centralized power has really done a lot of damage to our legislative system and to our representative system,\u201d he said. He argued that politics will remain partisan \u201cunless we correct that problem.\u201d \u201cLike, he can be the kindest, gentlest man in the world, but if we have a legislative body where members of Congress do not feel like they are active participants in it, where they feel beholden to just a few leaders, you will have massive partisanship, and it will permeate then into society and then it feeds back up,\u201d he said. He said, \u201cDemocrats are not understanding of why Trump rose up, why Republicans are so angry. It is because they do feel the system is totally broken, and they viewed Trump as a weapon against this broken system.\u201d During the 2020 campaign, Amash had explored a run for president as a Libertarian Party candidate, but decided not to jump into the race. Asked about whether he would run for president in 2024, Amash told Axelrod, \u201cI won\u2019t rule anything out like that.\u201d He also wouldn\u2019t rule out returning to politics, but said \u201cI\u2019ve been very happy with my non-Congress life.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story inaccurately transcribed Justin Amash\u2019s quotes.

This is the choice all Republicans must make when it comes to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories. Option 1: Stand up for the truth. Fewer and and fewer are doing what Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney has been doing since January 6 and what Arizona\u2019s Stephen Richer \u2013 the Maricopa County recorder \u2013 did this weekend, when he stood up to Trump on Twitter over the former President\u2019s false accusations that the county\u2019s \u201centire Database\u201d had been deleted. \u201cI\u2019m literally looking at our voter registration database on my other screen. Right now,\u201d Richer wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe can\u2019t indulge these insane lies any longer. As a party. As a state. As a country.\u201d You can apply that to so many different Trump claims about the 2020 vote, which helped fuel this latest and most farcical post-election audit in a key state Trump lost, promoted by state GOP leaders who are still looking for a conspiracy. My impression of people who work each day in state government, and particularly in elections \u2013 remember Georgia\u2019s Gabriel Sterling? \u2013 is they don\u2019t have time to engineer conspiracies. Richer seems to agree. \u201cAt some point, we are humans, it has to stop,\u201d Richer said to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d when asked why he had tweeted about Trump.  \u201cThere are good people working here at Maricopa County and I was tired of them being defamed. That\u2019s my team, that\u2019s my office.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner: Trump\u2019s statement amplified claims made by Arizona state Senate President Karen Fann in a letter last week that a screenshot offered evidence that election files had been deleted. Maricopa County\u2019s Board of Supervisors \u2013 four out of five of whom are Republicans \u2013 met Monday to respond to Fann\u2019s allegations, with board members offering harsh condemnations of the GOP-led Senate. You can see where this could go, and assume that Richer will face some backlash from Republicans pushing the conspiracy theories. \u201cThis has been a very rude awakening into what politics has become. And if I\u2019m not part of it four years from now, so be it. I do other things that\u2019ll make me happy,\u201d Richer said. Option 2: Develop amnesia. Then there\u2019s House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Following the prevailing winds in the GOP, he announced he would not support a 9/11-style commission for the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. McCarthy turned after months of slow capitulations by Democrats on the creation of a commission \u2013 they agreed to evenly split the nonpartisan members among those appointed by Democrats and Republicans, for instance \u2013 and after McCarthy\u2019s point person on the negotiations, New York Rep. John Katko, had announced a bipartisan deal. The agreement Katko reached, McCarthy complained, duplicates work being done by congressional committees and should be expanded to look at violence in US cities after racial justice protests. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza dug up these two McCarthy quotes to chart his anger and frustration immediately post-January 6 and his very different view today. Anger one week after January 6: \u201cThe President bears responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These facts require immediate action of President Trump.\u201d Forgetfulness by April. McCarthy had forgotten, or was trying to forget, that Trump had waited hours to put out a statement calling off rioters. \u201cWhat I talked to President Trump about, I was the first person to contact him when the riots was going on. He didn\u2019t see it. What he ended the call was saying \u2013 telling me, he\u2019ll put something out to make sure to stop this. And that\u2019s what he did, he put a video out later,\u201d McCarthy said on Fox News. Cillizza argues McCarthy very likely does not want to testify under oath about his January 6 phone call with Trump. While there are other things a low-level official like Richer could do that would make him happy, we can assume that McCarthy is laser-focused on becoming speaker of the House. He\u2019d very much like to put January 6 in the rearview mirror and focus on labeling Democrats as socialists, not constantly talking about Trump, between now and the 2022 midterms in order to get Republicans the seven House seats they need for a majority. The charitable view of McCarthy. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Richard Bond writes at CNN Opinion that McCarthy should be forgiven since he\u2019s in an impossible spot, which is true so long as he wants to be a party leader. \u201cOn the one hand,\u201d writes Bond, \u201cMcCarthy has to retain the loyalty of millions of Republican voters still wedded to former President Donald Trump. On the other hand, McCarthy needs to avoid going down the surreal and dangerous rabbit hole created by Trump and his \u2018Big Lie\u2019 of a stolen election.\u201d Bond argues that Trump\u2019s allure for Republicans is largely policy-based, including tax cuts President Joe Biden wants to undo for the wealthy and corporations, a hard line on immigration, opposition to Iran and all-in support for Israel. Trump\u2019s lies about the election, he argues, can be counterbalanced by Republicans\u2019 fears of Biden. This is probably good political advice, but it paints over the whole issue of the big lie being anti-democratic and wannabe authoritarian. No big whoop? McCarthy\u2019s amnesia is emblematic of a larger collective amnesia taking root, where Republican lawmakers are trying to recast the Capitol rioters as simple tourists (completely untrue), and deny that anyone actually talked seriously about overturning the election (look at the Arizona \u201crecount\u201d circus that is still going on!) Realpolitik. I tend to think McCarthy got Democrats to give up quite a bit in terms of how the commission will work and will still get to argue he always opposed it, assuming it ultimately happens. Democrats and some Republicans in the House will vote for it, but the legislation creating it must still pass the Senate, where it will require 10 Republican votes. That\u2019s something Democrats will have to consider as they wait for Republicans to work with them on Biden\u2019s top priority of a massive spending bill to repair the nation\u2019s infrastructure. Labor shortage. Usually it\u2019s unemployment that spells trouble for a President, but CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny has an excellent story about how in Biden\u2019s case, it\u2019s the persistent labor shortage, which is standing in the way of the country reopening. Zeleny: A labor shortage is one of the persistent headwinds facing President Joe Biden as he builds support for his economic agenda to invest trillions of dollars in new federal spending to move the country from relief to recovery. From restaurants and retail to manufacturing and construction, signs declaring \u201cNow Hiring\u201d hang outside businesses most everywhere you look. Lumber shortage. But the housing market is still red hot. Higher minimum wage. Bank of America upping to $25 an hour by 2025. \u201cIt costs us a few hundred million dollars a year \u2026 but it\u2019s an investment,\u201d the bank\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on Tuesday, adding that it\u2019s about maintaining a \u201cgreat standard of living for our teammates.\u201d Biden\u2019s \u2018sometimes ruthless\u2019 calculations. CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson explains Biden has held back on the conflict in the Middle East: Other presidents might have felt the need to appear on camera to call for calm or to at least offer public condolences for the deaths of civilians. Some administrations would have launched a Middle East peace shuttle by now. But in a region where the \u201cpeace process\u201d long ago expired \u2013 a region with complications that Biden had hoped to avoid, if possible \u2013 there\u2019s no easy payoff for spending limited US political or diplomatic capital. We have written a lot, in shorthand, about Democrats\u2019 vision for creating a national election framework. But it turns out there are a number of proposals on the table right now, and CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten has the full breakdown. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, issued a letter this week urging Congress to find a bipartisan path forward to reauthorize the decades-old Voting Rights Act. Here are the other options: For the People Act These sweeping measures, designated as S 1 in the Senate and HR 1 in the House, touch on everything from the ground rules for voting to new disclosure requirements for presidents and changes to campaign finance law. On elections, they would set a federal baseline for election rules and thwart some of the voting restrictions passed in key battleground states this year. Among other things: They would mandate 15 days of early voting and neuter states\u2019 strict voter ID requirements by allowing voters casting ballots in federal elections to submit sworn affidavits instead of identification. They also would require automatic and same-day voter registration and prepaid postage on absentee ballots. Republicans in Congress, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, call the push a partisan takeover of elections and show no signs of ever backing the bills \u2013 a problem in a Senate that\u2019s divided 50-50 along partisan lines. (Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, giving Democrats a narrow edge on some matters, such as confirming executive branch nominees.) \u201cOur democracy is not in crisis,\u201d McConnell declared last week during committee debate on the For the People Act, \u201cand we are not going to let one party take over our democracy under the false pretense of saving it.\u201d John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act This proposal, named after late Georgia Democratic Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, aims to restore enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It first became law in 1965, shortly after a bloody law enforcement attack on peaceful voting rights activists on a bridge in Selma, Alabama, shocked and shamed the nation into action. The Voting Rights Act\u2019s requirements \u2013 that nine states and parts of others with histories of racial discrimination win federal approval, or \u201cpreclearance,\u201d before changing their election procedures \u2013 were nullified by the Supreme Court in its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. (The court didn\u2019t strike down preclearance but said the law relied on an old formula that needed updating. Congress hasn\u2019t agreed on a new formula in the intervening years.) Soon after the ruling, states began erecting new barriers to voting, ranging from voter ID laws to signature-matching requirements. And those efforts ramped up this year with many Republican-controlled states proposing a raft of new restrictions, spurred on by Trump\u2019s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. A recent version of the new John Lewis Act would extend preclearance to states that have incurred multiple voting-rights violations in the last 25 years \u2013 an attempt to get around the Supreme Court majority\u2019s concern in Shelby that states were being punished for decades-old misdeeds, rather than current discriminatory practices. Although a version of the Voting Rights Act rewrite passed the House in an earlier Congress, the John Lewis Act is not actually a bill right now. Committee hearings to fine-tune its provisions are planned as a precursor to its reintroduction in the House.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris will serve as the keynote speaker for a virtual unity summit for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders this week, her latest outreach to a community that has faced a wave of racially motivated crimes during the pandemic and is growing as a voting bloc. Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, will address the AAPI Victory Alliance\u2019s first ever unity summit on Wednesday, the group told CNN. The virtual event, titled \u201cFrom Victory to Unity,\u201d will feature celebrities like Tan France and Simu Liu as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s time we call our communities together to discuss strategies for engaging and mobilizing in the future,\u201d said Varun Nikore, executive director of the AAPI Victory Alliance. \u201cVice President Harris is an inspiration for all of our AAPI children who now know that the sky\u2019s the limit and you can be anything in this country that they strive for.\u201d Reported hate crimes against Asians in 16 of the nation\u2019s largest cities and counties are up 164% since this time last year, according to a study from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State University San Bernardino. A separate study from Stop AAPI Hate released earlier this month found there were at least 2,410 anti-Asian hate incidents in the first three months of this year. Hate crimes against Asians often go underreported due to the lack of mandatory national reporting requirements by police agencies, but also because of other factors that could deter victims from calling the police, such as: longstanding distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status. Harris\u2019s appearance, which comes during AAPI Heritage Month, will be the vice president\u2019s latest expression of solidarity with the community. After an Atlanta area shooting spree killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, the vice president traveled with President Joe Biden to Atlanta to meet with leaders in the community. \u201cRacism is real in America. And it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism too,\u201d Harris said at the time. \u201cThe President and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination, wherever and whenever it occurs.\u201d Last week, Harris convened a meeting with members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus where she echoed similar sentiments. \u201cI want to say to every Asian American every Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. Our administration sees you, cares about you, and you will never be alone,\u201d Harris said. Rep. Judy Chu, the chair of CAPAC who attended the meeting, told CNN the group spoke about the rising violence against the AAPI community, voting rights, language access and expressed concern for the Covid-19 crisis in India. \u201cWe talked about the gravity of the situation,\u201d Chu said. Harris told the group she recently spoke with her aunt and uncle who still live there and said she was worried about them. The Biden administration is facing pressure to share excess US vaccine doses with the struggling country. Chu said Harris emphasized \u201cthat vaccines cannot just stay in Delhi,\u201d and called for even distribution among the various regions. Chu said Harris spoke at length about voting rights, highlighting the swell of AAPI voters in Georgia that cast their ballots for Biden and Harris, helping to flip the traditionally Republican state blue for the first time since 1992. \u201c[Harris] was very much pressing upon this, to talk about voting rights as a key to every issue we\u2019re facing,\u201d Chu said. \u201cShe said we have to go out there and draw the line between our voting rights and the way we impact people\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d Asian Americans represent the fasting growing population group in the United States and turned out in higher numbers in the 2020 election. While Harris serves as the highest ranking Asian American woman in the country, Asian American and Pacific Islander lawmakers make up 3% of Congress, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Only one Asian American serves in the President\u2019s Cabinet: US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Last month, the White House named Erika Moritsugu as AAPI senior liaison as it faced pressure from Duckworth and Hirono for greater AAPI representation within the White House. UPDATE: This story has been updated to identify who is hosting the summit.",

            "article_content": "Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates bemoaned House Republicans\u2019 decision to oust Rep. Liz Cheney from her leadership post for challenging former President Donald Trump\u2019s lie that he won the 2020 presidential election, saying she never thought she\u2019d cheer on the GOP congresswoman \u201cfor simply telling the truth.\u201d \u201cI never thought that I\u2019d be saying, \u2018Yeah, go Liz Cheney.\u2019 But I am. And again, isn\u2019t it a sad commentary that we\u2019re cheering her on for simply telling the truth and for refusing to be silent when others are not?\u201d Yates told CNN\u2019s David Axelrod on an episode of \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast released Thursday. \u201cShe is being punished for telling the truth. And I certainly never thought our country would come to that,\u201d she added. Cheney ousted from leadership post. The other 9 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have also faced a backlash. The comments from Yates, who was fired by Trump in the early days of his administration for refusing to defend a controversial immigration order from him, come a day after House Republicans voted to remove the Wyoming Republican from her position as chair of the House Republican Conference after publicly rejecting for months Trump\u2019s election lies. In a wide-ranging interview with Axelrod, Yates discussed a number of issues, including hostility toward US institutions and the truth, the January 6 Capitol insurrection, police reform and restrictive voting laws. Yates, who said in her interview that American institutions \u201care really the most important thing\u201d in the country\u2019s democracy, told Axelrod that she\u2019s \u201cnever seen an all-out assault on institutions and certainly in the course of my lifetime, like we saw over the four years of the Trump presidency.\u201d The former acting attorney general said that assault has now carried over into truth, with there being \u201can indifference to truth during part of that administration to outright hostility toward it now.\u201d \u201cAnd again, as I said, we can debate policies and we should, but it has to be based on a common set of facts, and the lack of any of even being loosely tethered to truth for some, I think is a really dangerous thing for our country,\u201d she said. Yates also offered a somber outlook on the deadly Capitol riot, saying that while it seemed like there was consensus around the fact that such an attack cannot happen again, that sentiment appears to have \u201cdissipated\u201d in the weeks following January 6. \u201cI will confess, I did not anticipate there that we would have a \u2013 literally a violent insurrection at the Capitol on January 6,\u201d Yates said. She continued: \u201cAnd I think all of us watched with horror that day at what was happening at our nation\u2019s Capitol with also a feeling of, OK, this has to be it. Regardless of where one is on the political spectrum, surely we can all agree that this can never happen again \u2013 that this is going at the very bedrock of our democracy. And it seemed like that lasted for maybe a week or so. Maybe a little bit longer than that. And then even there it is dissipated now. We can\u2019t even unify around that.\u201d Weighing in on the recent conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd last year, Yates said she believes the US is \u201cat an inflection point when it comes both to racial justice and specifically police reform.\u201d \u201cAgain, none of this is new either. We\u2019ve been struggling with these issues for not just years, but decades. But I think it has come to a point and it certainly came to the point with the Chauvin trial and with George Floyd where we all were confronted\u201d with the video showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, she said. \u201cWhile I think that verdict was essential for us going forward, it\u2019s certainly not sufficient. It was important to hold Chauvin responsible for his actions, but we\u2019ve got more work that needs to be done systemically in police departments,\u201d Yates added. Yates said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about GOP-led restrictive voting bills moving through state legislatures \u2013 including the recently passed election law in her home state of Georgia \u2013 and the \u201cgenesis of these changes\u201d having stemmed from Trump\u2019s lies about the election and to \u201costensibly protect against nonexistent voter fraud.\u201d \u201cTo me, this is really insidious to, again, be using this false narrative of widespread voter fraud to make it more difficult for people to vote,\u201d she said. She slammed Georgia\u2019s law for reducing the number of ballot drop boxes, making it illegal to send out absentee applications to all voters, and limiting voters\u2019 abilities to cast a provisional ballot in a different precinct from where they are registered. \u201cNo one element of this perhaps impacts that many votes, but collectively they can impact a fair number, and every single vote should count,\u201d she told Axelrod. Yates noted that some lawmakers cited a lack of authority when pressured to overturn election results. \u201cNow in Georgia, under certain circumstances, the state legislature would have the authority,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while, you know, in the past, it would have been impossible to imagine, you would actually have a situation where the state legislature would override the will of the people.\u201d Still, Yates said she is \u201chopeful\u201d that some of restrictive voting laws \u201ccan be beat back, but I think we probably all recognize that in 2022, it\u2019s going to be a different situation in a number of states.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details from the episode.

            "article_content": "Democrats faced with holding the party\u2019s majority in the House in 2022 watched with glee this week as Republican infighting reached its latest crescendo with the leadership ouster of Rep. Liz Cheney. But it\u2019s their own party that faces the most noteworthy headwinds in their bid to keep control of the legislative body. A sweep of factors \u2013 an already narrow majority, the history of the party controlling the White House ceding ground in the subsequent midterms, the uncertainty of Republican-dominated redistricting and Republicans nationwide pursuing restrictive voting bills \u2013 have Democrats anxious about their chances in 2022. Democrats are hopeful they can buck historic trends, primarily by spending millions to keep legislation signed by President Joe Biden popular over the next 18 months. But congressional Democrats, many of whom won their seats during the 2018 election that was seen as a rejection of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s first two years in office, acknowledge that no level of GOP drama will make running in swing districts any easier. \u201cNo one\u2019s talking about Liz Cheney in my district right now,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who represents a Michigan district that backed Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cThey want to know what\u2019s happening with their pocketbooks and their kids. \u2026 They know what\u2019s going on with the things that directly impact them, so we need to be able to speak to economic security.\u201d The party currently only has a seven-seat majority in the House, meaning even the slightest shift in November 2022 could cost the party their majority. And Republicans are already working to shift the public conversation from popular bills like the coronavirus relief package to more controversial issues like immigration, rising inflation and questions about Biden\u2019s handle on the economy. The most uncertain factor facing Democrats is redistricting, which will mean significant changes to districts across the country. The unclear process has frozen the field in some key areas, with would-be candidates waiting to decide whether to run for office until the new maps are released. The failure of Democrats to win back any state legislatures in 2020 and the near total Republican control in states like Florida, Texas and Ohio has only ratcheted up the pressure on this process. A raft of retirements \u2013 with more anticipated \u2013 has also further complicated the 2022 map for Democrats, turning seats that once benefited from Democratic incumbents into serious stretch races for the party. And hanging over all of this is history \u2013 the party that won the White House two years earlier often suffers significant losses in the subsequent midterms, a fact Democrats inside the  White House were considering mere weeks into President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cOur report card is going to be, are people living better lives a year from now. And if they are, I think we\u2019re going to be in good shape,\u201d said Rep. Josh Harder, a Democratic congressman from a battleground district in California. \u201cI think we\u2019re off to a good start. \u2026 The challenge is we have to keep it going.\u201d Biden is no stranger to midterm fights. He was vice president in 2010 when the Democratic Party took what then-President Barack Obama called a \u201cshellacking\u201d in the midterms and ceded the House majority to Republicans. People close to Biden tell CNN that the President has already expressed an eagerness to get out on the midterm campaign trail, believing that his policies \u2013 if touted effectively \u2013 will remain popular and help Democrats, something that was not the case in 2010 with the newly passed Affordable Care Act. The popularity of Biden himself and the bills he gets through Congress will be central to any chance Democrats may have at bucking history. The Democratic National Committee announced this month that they plan to spend $20 million this year to tout Biden\u2019s achievements and put people on the ground in key states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The committee, led by new chair Jaime Harrison, sees that money as a down payment for 2022, said party aides, adding it will only increase next year. All of this is aimed at keeping public sentiment on Biden\u2019s side. Top operatives argue that unlike the first years of the Trump presidency, where Republicans ventured to gut Obama\u2019s trademark healthcare law and successfully passed tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy Americans, Biden and Democrats began by passing a broadly popular coronavirus relief bill and are now working to pass a similarly popular infrastructure package. But Democrats know that Biden won\u2019t be able to focus solely on issues that are broadly popular, especially as their base demand action on thornier issues like immigration and police reform. And Republicans, no matter how popular Biden\u2019s plans may be, are set to seize on any break in the party or slight economic downturn to attack candidates in swing districts. The concern for someone like Slotkin, who could once again be tasked to run for reelection in an area that leans Republican, is that the power of the Democratic brand may not be strong enough to rebut those attacks. \u201cThe attacks are always going to be there,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cThe problem we have is that our brand is not strong, our underlying brand, so that when the latest attack comes out, a certain percentage of people believe it because they don\u2019t always know what we\u2019re about.\u201d She added: \u201cAnd this is where I get back to economic security and focusing like a laser on the things that keep people up at night and that\u2019s different from the beltway chatter.\u201d The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has initially released a narrower set of congressional targets for the midterms, including one open race and 21 seats currently held by Republicans. The heart of the Democratic efforts is in America\u2019s suburbs, the growing and diversifying communities around the country\u2019s largest cities where the party made headway under Trump and helped deliver the party the majority in 2018. Congressional retirements happen every year, but the uncertainty of a midterm election amid redistricting has both parties worried the departures could begin to stack up. Democrats have already seen a litany of swing seat retirements. The latest was Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos announcing she would not seek reelection, depriving Democrats of an incumbent to run in a district Trump won in both 2016 and 2020. Rep. Filemon Vela, a Texas congressman who represents an area in South Texas where Republicans made inroads in 2020, and Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a congresswoman who represents a South Arizona district that narrowly leans Democratic, also both announced they were retiring at the end of this Congress. In Florida, three Democratic members \u2013 Charlie Crist, Stephanie Murphy and Val Demings \u2013 are expected to leave the House to seek statewide office. And in Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan announced a Senate campaign. \u201cThe half-life of a swing district member of Congress is a lot shorter than the half-life of a member of Congress from a safe seat,\u201d said Harder, whose Central Valley district in California went for Biden in 2020 by less than 3 percentage points. \u201cPart of it is obviously the electoral headwinds \u2013 it\u2019s tough to defy gravity in swing districts indefinitely \u2013 but the other piece of it is it\u2019s just a really tough situation representing a community that\u2019s 50-50.\u201d Unlike redistricting, where Republicans acknowledge there is only so much help the process can provide, GOP party operatives are bullish that retirements could help them win districts like Bustos\u2019 in Illinois and Kirkpatrick\u2019s in Arizona. \u201cThese retirements can signal several things,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a Republican operative who worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2018, when retirements exposed his party to difficult open races. \u201cEither they see the writing on the wall or don\u2019t have the stomach for a tough campaign. Often, they believe it\u2019s better to bow out gracefully than run hard and lose.\u201d While Republicans have also faced retirements, these have come from solidly Republican districts that would almost certainly elect a Republican in 2022. Republican Reps. Tom Reed of New York, Jody Hice of Georgia and Kevin Brady of Texas have all announced plans to retire at the end of this Congress, but all represent solid red districts. And Rep. Steve Stivers, an Ohio Republican who represents parts of Columbus and rural areas south of the City, is set to leave Congress this month, but his district is also solidly Republican. The greatest uncertainty for Democrats comes from redistricting, the process where congressional lines in every state are redrawn each decade based on demographic changes. Initial numbers released by the US Census saw growth in states where Republicans dominate the redistricting process, like Florida and Texas, while more Democratic states like New York, California and Illinois are all slated to lose a seat in Congress. One of the greatest impacts of redistricting could be how it has frozen the field of possible candidates in numerous competitive congressional districts. Democratic operatives told CNN that they have heard from would-be candidates who are putting off declaring their candidacy \u2013 and thereby starting the fundraising and organizing process \u2013 because it is unclear how each district will be drawn. \u201cRedistricting has caused a great deal of unknown \u2013 candidates don\u2019t know what districts will look like, incumbents don\u2019t know what districts they will be running in,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic operative who worked at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for three cycles. \u201cThere are countless candidates out there who are thinking about running and planning to run but won\u2019t be able to move forward until they know what those districts actually will look like. This is particularly acute for someone like Slotkin, whose home state of Michigan is slated to lose a seat in Congress, almost ensuring that her district will look different once the state\u2019s independent commission is done drawing the new lines. \u201cI honestly do not know what my district will look like a year from now,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that is a big open question for a lot of us in Michigan and a lot of other places.\u201d For a party with a slim majority in the House already, this forced freeze has people worried. But even Republicans admit that redistricting will only get the party so far. To win back the House, Republican operatives said, it will be critical to make Biden\u2019s policies unpopular. \u201cRedistricting isn\u2019t going to deliver Republicans a majority,\u201d said Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cWe are going to have to run competitive races all across the country and if we have that mindset, we are going to be in a good spot come November 2022.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz claimed Tuesday that Democrats have intentionally \u201cdesigned\u201d their sweeping elections bill so that millions of undocumented immigrants would be registered to vote. Cruz said at a Senate Rules Committee meeting that the Democratic bill that proposes major changes to voting, campaign finance and government ethics rules, known as the For the People Act, \u201cdirects\u201d people \u201cto break the law and register millions of people to vote who are not eligible to vote because they are not United States citizens.\u201d Cruz said the bill \u201cwould register millions of illegal aliens to vote\u201d \u2013 and he said \u201cit is intended to do that\u201d because Democrats think these immigrants are likely to vote for Democratic candidates. Cruz also said the bill \u201cautomatically registers to vote anyone who interacts with the government,\u201d regardless of their immigration status. Facts First: All of these Cruz claims are false. There is no basis for the claim that the bill is intended to register millions of undocumented immigrants to vote. The bill does propose an automatic voter registration system, but its text repeatedly makes clear that only US citizens would be eligible to be registered under the system. It is just not true that the bill would register anyone at all who interacts with the government or that the bill directs people to break the law to register noncitizens. Automatic voter registration does not mean that everyone living in a jurisdiction is automatically registered if they have any dealings with the government. Rather, it means that eligible citizens are proactively registered unless they opt out, rather than requiring them to opt in. More than a third of US states already have automatic voter registration, and there is no evidence that undocumented immigrants are being registered to vote in large numbers there. That\u2019s not to say automatic voter registration is error-free. Some states with automatic voter registration have made mistakes that have resulted in noncitizens being registered to vote. But noncitizens have also sometimes gotten erroneously registered in states without automatic voter registration. And more to the point of this fact check, Cruz didn\u2019t merely claim that history shows that some undocumented people would get inadvertently registered under the Democrats\u2019 proposal. Instead, he repeatedly declared at the Tuesday meeting \u2013 and then suggested the same day on Twitter \u2013 that Democrats have deliberately written the bill to allow undocumented people to be registered in massive numbers. That\u2019s plain inaccurate. Just take a look at the part of the bill that discusses the proposed automatic voter registration system. The bill\u2019s language about automatic voter registration clearly explains that people would need to be US citizens, as is the case today, in order to get registered to vote. In fact, a four-part section explaining the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the system refers three times to \u201celigible citizens.\u201d The bill goes on to explain how automatic voter registration would work upon its implementation in 2023. The system\u2019s central feature is that citizens who are eligible to vote and who have dealings with various government agencies \u2013 from a state Department of Motor Vehicles to the federal Department of Veterans Affairs \u2013 would get automatically registered to vote unless they chose to opt out, rather than having to choose to opt in to get registered. The bill says that the government agencies would need to offer a voter registration opportunity each time someone applies \u201cfor service or assistance.\u201d (Universities would have to provide a registration opportunity when an in-state student initially enrolls.) Agencies that already ask people to affirm their US citizenship during their normal operations would have to inform the US citizens that, unless they choose to opt out or are found ineligible to register, they are going to get registered or have their existing registration updated. Agencies would also have to inform citizens of the criteria for being a lawful voter \u2013 one of which is being a citizen \u2013 and that they should opt out if they don\u2019t meet these requirements. Then, if citizens don\u2019t opt out, the agencies would have to electronically send their registration information to state election officials. The bill explains that the agencies would have to send along not only a person\u2019s name, birth date and address but \u201cinformation showing that the individual is a citizen of the United States.\u201d And the bill says the election officials then have to promptly ensure the person gets registered, but only \u201cif the individual is eligible.\u201d The steps are slightly different for government agencies that don\u2019t normally ask people to affirm US citizenship, but there, too, people would have to affirm that they are citizens before getting registered. A Cruz spokesman, Steve Guest, stood by the senator\u2019s claims. Guest noted that the bill does not require proof that someone is a citizen before registering them through automatic voter registration; someone\u2019s written declaration that they are a citizen is sufficient to send them through the registration process. If Democrats did not actually intend to register millions of undocumented people, Guest argued, they wouldn\u2019t have rejected Cruz\u2019s proposed amendment to require hard citizenship evidence. That\u2019s an unfounded leap of logic. Rejecting a Republican amendment to make would-be voters provide documentation of citizenship is not confirmation that Democrats are trying to get undocumented people registered \u2013 especially, again, given how their bill already emphasizes that only citizens are to be registered. There are obvious benign explanations for opposition to citizenship documentation requirements, which would make some citizens put in at least some extra effort to get signed up to vote and would place an extra administrative burden on government agencies. And here\u2019s a critical piece of context: Current federal law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also requires only an affirmation of citizenship for voter registration \u2013 in other words, no hard proof is required to register for federal elections now either \u2013 and there is no evidence of undocumented immigrants registering to vote in large numbers these days. Noncitizens face severe possible penalties, including prison time and deportation, for falsely claiming to be citizens in order to register or vote. Also, a key site for automatic voter registration is state DMV offices \u2013 which, under the federal REAL ID requirements that are being rolled out across the country, are required to obtain hard proof of at least lawful immigration status before providing someone a standard license. The DMV in Oregon, a state with automatic voter registration, only sends elections officials the registration information of people who have provided proof of citizenship. And the bill would not stop state and local election officials from inspecting their voter rolls. In Michigan, which has an automatic voter registration system, the Department of State does internal reviews and audits \u201cto identify, catch, and correct cases in which non-citizens may have become inappropriately registered to vote,\u201d said Aneta Kiersnowski, spokeswoman for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. At the Tuesday meeting, Cruz noted that the bill immunizes noncitizens from being prosecuted, or harmed in an immigration proceeding, if they are improperly registered to vote through the automatic voter registration system. He claimed that the existence of this immunity provision is evidence for his claim that the bill is designed to register millions of undocumented people. That\u2019s another illogical leap. Advocates of automatic voter registration say the immunity provision is in the bill to prevent a noncitizen from being arrested or deported in the unlikely event they are mistakenly registered because of a government error. \u201cThose provisions basically acknowledge the fact that there is some risk of the rare occasion where somebody is going to be registered inadvertently,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, deputy director of voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal organization that supports automatic voter registration. Morales-Doyle said \u201cwe know this hasn\u2019t been a widespread problem,\u201d but if it does happen, \u201cthose folks shouldn\u2019t be subject to deportation because the state made a mistake.\u201d The bill explicitly says the immunity clause doesn\u2019t apply to a noncitizen who deliberately makes a false statement to get registered or who casts a ballot even though they know they are breaking the law.",

            "article_content": "Watch Dana Bash\u2019s interview with Caitlyn Jenner on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d at 8 p.m. ET. Caitlyn Jenner is attempting to defy ideological definition as she runs to unseat Gov. Gavin Newsom in California\u2019s all-but-certain recall election, telling CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that she didn\u2019t vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election \u2013 and, in fact, didn\u2019t bother to vote at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t even vote,\u201d Jenner told Bash in a wide-ranging interview at her home in Malibu. \u201cOut here in California, it\u2019s like, why vote for a Republican president? It\u2019s just not going to work. I mean, it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d \u201cIt was voting day and I thought the only thing out here in California that I worry about, which affects people, is the propositions that were out there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t see any propositions that I really had one side or the other. And so it was Election Day and I just couldn\u2019t get excited about it. And I just wound up going to play golf and I said, \u2018I\u2019m not doing that.\u2019 \u201c Jenner did actually vote by mail in the 2020 elections, but she only voted on the ballot propositions and did not vote in the presidential race or other down ballot races, according to a campaign official. Jenner told Bash she is \u201ckind of on the Republican side\u201d but doesn\u2019t like \u201clabels.\u201d  Defending her lack of government experience, she said she was prepared to take on the role of managing a state that has the fifth largest economy in the world, in part by surrounding herself \u201cwith some really good people.\u201d \u201cI have been in the entrepreneurial world. People think \u2013 you\u2019ve been in show business, think of you as a reality star. Certainly, I\u2019ve done that, but entertainment is a business, and you have to run that business,\u201d Jenner told Bash when asked what kind of training she had to be governor of California. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also done other things. We sold a billion dollars\u2019 worth of exercise equipment on television. I\u2019ve had aviation companies. I\u2019ve just always been involved being an entrepreneur and tried to inspire my children to do the same thing. And they\u2019ve done very well in that department.\u201d Those life experiences, she argued, have helped develop her leadership skills. In an interview where she argued that Californians are overtaxed and overburdened by regulation, Jenner noted that she has been meeting with \u201cbudget people,\u201d but would not say whom because she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to expose anybody.\u201d The former Olympian is one of several prominent Republicans challenging Newsom in the likely election, which has not been officially called or scheduled because of the complex bureaucratic process to get it on the ballot. But because of her lack of experience in politics, Jenner\u2019s policy positions are unknown to many California voters \u2013 other than her advocacy for the rights of transgender people and her past support for Trump, which she rescinded in 2018 because she believed his administration enforced policies that were harmful to transgender people. At the same time, Jenner is clearly cognizant that Trump\u2019s base could serve as a wellspring of political donations in a state that requires tens of millions of dollars to compete. With that in mind, Jenner is attempting to create some distance from Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy positions \u2013 as well as his claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent \u2014 without alienating the voters who supported him. Her attempt to find a palatable middle ground on issues like homelessness, the environment and immigration is also a calculated political strategy in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2 to 1. While Trump continues to spread falsehoods about the 2020 election, Jenner told Bash that she does not believe the election was \u201cstolen,\u201d but argued there needs to be \u201cintegrity\u201d in the US election system. \u201cHe is our President. I respect that,\u201d Jenner said of President Joe Biden in the interview when asked whether Biden was \u201cduly elected.\u201d \u201cI realize there\u2019s a lot of frustration over that election. You know what? I\u2019m frustrated over what happened back then.\u201d She did not go into specifics about why she was frustrated by the election, which has created deep divisions in the Republican Party. Though she acknowledged that Biden is the President, she also aligned with Republicans who have suggested there is work to do to ensure \u201cintegrity\u201d in the election system. When asked about the scores of lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed to challenge the results despite the lack of evidence of any widespread voter fraud, Jenner said she believes \u201cin the system.\u201d \u201cWe are a democratic republic; we need to have integrity in our election system,\u201d Jenner said. Jenner\u2019s comments on the election come at the same time that Republican-controlled legislatures in many states are pushing bills that would restrict voting rights \u2013 using Trump\u2019s lies about fraud as justification. The Republican-led effort to recall Newsom last year was fueled by anger about the Democratic governor\u2019s strict policies during the dark days of the pandemic but also is a backlash to his far-left agenda. The California secretary of state reported in late April that proponents had turned in the requisite number of valid signatures to initiate the recall. During the next step of the process, voters have 30 business days in which they are allowed to withdraw their names from recall petitions. The quest by Newsom\u2019s opponents to unseat him, however, looks increasingly difficult. His approval ratings are steady at above 50% and only 4 in 10 likely voters said they supported recalling him in a recent Public Policy Institute of California poll. If the recall appears on the ballot, voters would be asked to answer two questions. The first would be whether they want to recall Newsom. The second would be who they want to replace him with, followed by a long list of names of candidates from all political parties, including Jenner\u2019s. Jenner, who is registered as a Republican in California, seemed particularly reluctant to wade into the controversy that Trump has created over the 2020 election and GOP efforts to restrict voting rights, leading Bash to note that it was important for Jenner to share her views because the party has continued to drive Trump\u2019s agenda forward in that area. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m asking you about this is because you are a Republican,\u201d Bash said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m kind of on the Republican side,\u201d Jenner interjected. \u201cWe label everybody. I don\u2019t like labels. I\u2019m me, OK?\u201d Jenner added. \u201cJust because I have conservative economic philosophy \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing that the Republicans are kind of on that I\u2019m on. \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Maybe you call me a libertarian. Maybe you call me in the middle. I really don\u2019t know because when it comes to social issues, I\u2019m much more progressive, much more liberal. So I\u2019m kind of a middle of the road.\u201d Jenner, whose bid for governor is one of the most high-profile campaigns by a transgender person in the country, also weighed in on the issue of trans athletes participating in school sports. The former Olympian created controversy during an impromptu interview with TMZ recently when asked for her opinion on the efforts by some Republican legislatures to ban transgender athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities. She replied that she does not support trans girls playing on girls\u2019 teams, because it is \u201ca question of fairness.\u201d When asked about that position during the CNN interview with Bash, Jenner said, \u201cThe most important thing for me is we protect women\u2019s sports. We can work the other issues out \u2013 for trans women to compete in sports, who are truly trans, who grew up trans and have been trans all their life.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m about protecting women\u2019s sports,\u201d she told Bash. \u201cMy statement was, I don\u2019t want biological boys playing in girls\u2019 sports.\u201d Jenner told Bash that she supports \u201clegal immigration\u201d and that \u201cthe bad ones have to leave.\u201d But she also said she supports a path to citizenship for 1.75 million undocumented immigrants in the state\u2019s labor force, a position that is at odds with core Republican voters nationally. She was sharply critical of Newsom\u2019s handling of the pandemic, though she said she doesn\u2019t blame the governor or the federal government for restrictions put of place at the start of the pandemic. \u201cI would have definitely done my best to open up as quick as possible,\u201d Jenner said when asked how she would have handled the pandemic differently. But at times during the interview, Jenner appeared to argue for more vigorous government intervention \u2014 on the issue of homelessness, for example. When asked whether the more than $2 billion that Newsom has proposed spending on homelessness and housing is enough, Jenner said she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cIt does sound like a lot of money. Is it enough? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a start,\u201d Jenner said. When asked what she would do to build more affordable housing, she said the \u201cbiggest problem is regulation\u201d and that she would consider changes to the California Environmental Quality Act. \u201cI am all for the environment, 100% for the environment, but we cannot destroy our states, OK?\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as regulations, I would freeze everything. Take a look at it. Some of these regulations have been on the books since before, I mean, honestly, the fax machine.\u201d The former Olympian also said she would take a hard look at environmental regulations in California and would \u201cprobably not\u201d keep in place California\u2019s goal of relying entirely on zero emission energy sources for electricity by 2045. Jenner praised her children and their entrepreneurial talents but said her family would not play a role in her gubernatorial campaign. She noted that she differs from her stepdaughter Kim Kardashian on halting the death penalty. \u201cI am in favor of the death penalty,\u201d she said. She emphasized that she and her kids have a great relationship and love each other, but that they were \u201cscared\u201d about the prospect of Jenner running for governor both for her safety and because they were \u201cscared of what the media is going to do.\u201d \u201cMy family has certainly been out in the media and they\u2019ve taken their shots and they don\u2019t need to take any more,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cI said, \u2018I am not going to ask you for one tweet. I\u2019m not going to ask you for one thing. You guys go live your life. This is my deal.\u2019 \u201c This story has been updated to reflect that Jenner did vote in the 2020 election.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans could vote as early as Wednesday to replace Rep. Liz Cheney as GOP conference chair, a move that would underscore former President Donald Trump\u2019s firm grip on the party months after leaving office. Cheney\u2019s refusal to embrace Trump\u2019s election lies, and her rebukes of his role in the US Capitol insurrection, has highlighted a tumultuous rift in a Republican Party grappling with its future without Trump in the White House. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who\u2019s less ideologically conservative than Cheney, appears poised to seize the Wyoming Republican\u2019s post. But even skeptics of Stefanik\u2019s conservative credentials say she\u2019s preferable to Cheney on the most important factor: her loyalty to the former President. The New York congresswoman became one of Trump\u2019s most visible defenders in Congress as part of his 2020 impeachment defense after initially criticizing Trump\u2019s rhetoric during the 2016 campaign and telling voters that she would be an \u201cindependent voice.\u201d One of just 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump in January, Cheney \u2013 the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney \u2013 survived a February vote to keep her leadership position by a wide margin, 145 to 61. But she hasn\u2019t backed down from her criticisms of Trump\u2019s election lies, and her continued arguments that the party should move on from the former President have become too much for House Republicans who see him as a crucial part of their winning coalition. Cheney, who has no intention of stepping aside, wrote in a fiery op-ed for The Washington Post this month, \u201cWe must be brave enough to defend the basic principles that underpin and protect our freedom and our democratic process.\u201d \u201cTrump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work \u2013 confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,\u201d Cheney wrote. \u201cThe Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.\u201d Here\u2019s what to watch as the vote approaches: While a lot of the strategizing to install Stefanik has happened behind closed doors, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy confirmed on Sunday that he\u2019s supporting her for the influential GOP leadership position. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo when asked if he supports the New York Republican for the No. 3 role. Stefanik thanked McCarthy for his support in a tweet later Sunday. CNN previously reported that McCarthy has been supporting Stefanik to replace Cheney, and the No. 2 member of House Republican leadership, Rep. Steve Scalise, publicly endorsed Stefanik\u2019s bid for the job last week. The former President also publicly endorsed Stefanik, saying in a statement last week that she \u201cis a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair.\u201d   McCarthy\u2019s evolution has been especially noteworthy. Last month, he was asked if Cheney was still a good fit for leadership. He declined to endorse her as he did in February. The California Republican instead said Cheney\u2019s future would be determined by the conference. A House GOP source who had been in contact with McCarthy said the GOP leader had been \u201cfurious\u201d at her for weeks amid her comments about Trump. Last week, McCarthy claimed Cheney\u2019s impeachment vote wouldn\u2019t cost her the job. Instead, he said that she has not done enough to keep the party unified behind a singular message to win back the majority next year. \u201cI have heard from members, concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News.\u201d While the GOP support to replace Cheney appears overwhelming, a select few Republicans have made their opposition known \u2013 and are likely to continue doing so as the vote draws closer. Rep. Adam Kinzinger said on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday that Cheney \u201cis saying exactly what Kevin McCarthy said the day of the insurrection,\u201d alluding to Trump\u2019s responsibility. \u201cShe\u2019s just consistently been saying it. And a few weeks later, Kevin McCarthy changed to attacking other people.\u201d \u201cAnd so I think what the reality is, is as a party, we have to have an internal look and a full accounting as to what led to January 6th. I mean, right now, it\u2019s basically the Titanic,\u201d the Illinois Republican said. GOP figures off Capitol Hill have pushed back on the vote too. \u201cIn terms of Liz Cheney, she\u2019s a conservative, she did a vote of conscience and she should not be ousted because of one vote of conscience,\u201d Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d of Cheney\u2019s vote to impeach Trump after the January 6 insurrection. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox raised concerns about the message Cheney\u2019s ouster sends to a party trying to grow. \u201cWell, it shows that we\u2019re very divided as a party, and that\u2019s no secret. I\u2019m not the first person to say that,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d when asked what it means. \u201cBut as we talk about broadening the tent and bringing in a new generation of Republicans \u2013 we really have to allow for those types of differences.\u201d Cindy McCain \u2013 widow of longtime Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona \u2013 has also warned that the GOP needs to exercise caution as it mulls ousting Cheney. Asked by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo this month for her thoughts on Stefanik, McCain said in part: \u201cWe do need to be careful.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t serve any good if we just oust someone who really is a good representative of the party.\u201d But even moderate Republican Rep. John Katko, who voted to impeach Trump and was an ally of Cheney, told a local newspaper last week he will back his fellow New Yorker for the job, a clear signal that Cheney\u2019s leadership tenure is coming to an end. \u201cI have every confidence that Elise will be a superb leader for all of our conference, not just some,\u201d Katko told The Auburn Citizen Friday. \u201cElise and I came in together and she knows me as well as she knows conservatives. She knows that I have a different type of district than a lot of conservatives.\u201d Stefanik is expected to address lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus at their gathering on Monday night after some members raised concerns about her voting record. During a Wednesday night conference call, multiple members of the far-right Freedom Caucus voiced deep reservations about Stefanik as the consensus choice for Republican conference chair \u2013 even as they conceded she has the votes to succeed Cheney. A House member on the call told CNN the caucus has concerns about Stefanik\u2019s moderate voting record and her uneven stance on a wide range of issues the group prioritizes, including immigration and LGBTQ rights. Stefanik has signaled to some of her colleagues that if she replaces Cheney, she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks. That assurance could help assuage concerns on the right over her more moderate voting record, though she\u2019s widely viewed as a virtual lock for the No. 3 job when the vote happens. McCarthy has the power to call for a quick vote that would effectively seek Cheney\u2019s removal from his leadership team. It can be approved by a simple majority of the full House GOP Conference. If McCarthy doesn\u2019t call for a vote, another Republican could. But there are also special procedures in place to ultimately force another vote, which could take more time. One path requires 20% of the House GOP conference \u2013 43 members \u2013 to submit a petition for a special meeting. They would then schedule that meeting within 10 \u201clegislative\u201d days, or days they\u2019re in session in the nation\u2019s capital. At the special meeting, the members can then bring up a resolution to remove Cheney. If two-thirds of the conference \u2013 142 members \u2013 want, they can immediately vote. Otherwise, the petition would be referred to a committee that can then either report the petition to the conference for a full vote or kill the resolution. Any leadership vote is a secret ballot cast behind closed doors. CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers, Manu Raju and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

President Joe Biden faces a daunting task as he embarks on a bipartisan push with top congressional leaders to advance several of his key priorities \u2013 which will advance or collapse depending on how the coming weeks shake out. CNN\u2019s Capitol Hill team reports that the ultimate outcome of these talks could help define Biden\u2019s first term since 2021 remains a crucial period for policymaking, while 2022 will be consumed with both parties focused on winning the midterms, a recipe unlikely to yield much legislative success.

Joe Manchin has said he does not want to see passed with only Democratic support absent a real effort at courting Republicans \u2013 includes intense discussions with top committee Republicans, including Manchin\u2019s colleague Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican. Biden is slated to host his first meeting with Republican and Democratic leadership from the House and Senate since taking office on May 12 at the White House. The talks are also expected to intensify as lawmakers return from recess and Capito is scheduled to visit the President once again. The focus? Finding out whether Republicans and Democrats could cut a more modest deal on infrastructure and then come back later using a special budget tool known as reconciliation to pass some of Biden\u2019s more ambitious reforms to paid family leave and extending the expanded child tax credit. Police reform Serious bipartisan talks over legislation to overhaul policing between Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California are also expected to continue this week as the lawmakers leading an effort to broker a deal say they are making progress, despite thorny unresolved issues. Tentative agreement reached on some key issues. A bipartisan group of lawmakers working on legislative efforts to overhaul policing appear to be nearing an agreement to set federal standards for: Two major issues remain. One of them is qualified immunity, which protects police officers from civil lawsuits. The other includes Section 242, a part of federal law which sets the standard for criminally prosecuting police officers. House Majority Whip urges compromise. South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn said Democrats should not delay new policing reform legislation even if a provision on ending civil lawsuit protections currently afforded to police officers is not included, arguing that the party can push to end qualified immunity at another time. Election overhaul and gun legislation In the Senate, Democrats also want to take action on a sweeping voting bill and gun legislation, though neither priority is on track to have the votes to overcome a filibuster and pass out of the chamber. Voting bill. While it won\u2019t have the 60 votes to pass out of the Senate, taking up the voting legislation will give Democrats an opportunity to tout the legislation, and will give some more liberal-leaning lawmakers the chance to once again argue that the filibuster should be eliminated. (Related: CNN\u2019s Brandon Tensley has a new piece looking at the long history of assaults on Black voting power.) Gun legislation. It also looks increasingly unlikely that a bipartisan deal will be reached on gun legislation, an issue which received renewed focus in the wake of recent shootings. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated he plans to move a House-passed gun bill to the Senate floor, though he has continued to hold out hope for the possibility of bipartisan action. Cheney\u2019s impending ouster looms large The bipartisan outreach on all of these issues will play out against the backdrop of escalating division in the GOP as House Republicans prepare to oust Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from her No. 3 leadership post \u2013 and potentially replace her with Rep. Elise Stefanik. The vote on the position could come as early as Wednesday. Kevin McCarthy confirms he\u2019s backing Stefanik. The House Minority Leader confirmed on Sunday that he backs Stefanik for the role of House Republican conference chair. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo when asked if he supports the New York Republican for the No. 3 role in the House Republican conference. Stefanik thanked McCarthy for his support in a tweet later Sunday. Short term solution? Stefanik has signaled to some of her colleagues that if she replaces Cheney, she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks. It\u2019s all about loyalty to Trump. As CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston writes, the drive to swap out Cheney for Stefanik, who has a far less conservative voting record but the golden calling card of loyalty to the former President, demonstrates that the GOP now values political expediency over the willingness to stand on principle in the post-Trump era. About 113 million people, or at least a third of the population, have been fully vaccinated, per CDC data. And about 45.6% of the population, or 151 million people, have received at least one dose of a vaccine. That\u2019s still well short of the 70-85% range that experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have estimated the US needs to reach to achieve herd immunity. But the progress is real, and the waning US cases and death numbers reflect that. What\u2019s more, our vaccine progress has provided three key things that can help address ongoing hesitancy, emergency medical physician Dr. Anand Swaminathan told CNN. GOP ready to kill the $300 pandemic unemployment boost. As the country seeks to emerge from the outbreak that has left millions of Americans out of work, a growing chorus of GOP officials and business owners say that it\u2019s time to end the historic enhancement in order to push more people to rejoin the labor force. The federal benefits not only include an extra $300 in unemployment payments, but also payments for freelancers, independent contractors, certain people affected by the virus and those who\u2019ve run out of their regular state benefits. At least three red-state governors have already moved to do so. Utah GOP governor defends push to end enhanced unemployment. Spencer Cox on Sunday defended Republicans\u2019 push to end enhanced unemployment, saying that although some families continue to struggle amid the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout, the benefit must be rolled back \u201cat some point.\u201d Cyberattack forces major US fuel pipeline to shut down.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy confirmed on Sunday that he backs Rep. Elise Stefanik for the role of House Republican conference chair, as Rep. Liz Cheney faces a vote to oust her from the influential GOP leadership post. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo when asked if he supports the New York Republican for the No. 3 role in the House Republican conference. Stefanik thanked McCarthy for his support in a tweet later Sunday. CNN reported last week that McCarthy has been privately supporting Stefanik to replace Cheney, and the No. 2 member of House Republican leadership, Rep. Steve Scalise, publicly endorsed Stefanik\u2019s bid for the job on Tuesday. Stefanik has signaled to some of her colleagues that if she replaces Cheney, she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks. The vote on the position could come as early as Wednesday. McCarthy argued the impending vote to oust Cheney, who represents Wyoming, is as an opportunity for the party to choose the most effective leader to take on the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. \u201cEveryone in leadership serves at the pleasure of the conference and as you know, there\u2019s a lot at stake. Democrats are destroying the nation,\u201d McCarthy said, citing immigration issues and Friday\u2019s less-than-satisfactory jobs report as top concerns. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will have a vote next week and we want to be united and looking \u2013 moving forward and I think that\u2019s what will take place,\u201d he added. Asked if Cheney\u2019s stance against former President Donald Trump hinders her from delivering the party\u2019s message, McCarthy said, \u201cNo, any member can take whatever position they believe in,\u201d but he went on to suggest that a leadership role is different than rank-and-file membership. \u201cWhat we are talking about, it\u2019s a position in leadership. We are in one of our biggest battles ever for this nation and the direction, whether this century will be ours. As conference chair, you have one of the most critical jobs of the messenger going forward,\u201d he explained. The former president also endorsed Stefanik, saying in a statement last week that she \u201cis a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair.\u201d But a few Republicans have warned against the party\u2019s intolerance of members who disagree with the former President. On Sunday, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d  that \u201cas we talk about broadening the tent and bringing in a new generation of Republicans, we really have to allow for those types of differences.\u201d Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent critic of the former President, said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the debate to oust Cheney is \u201cnot good for the future of this country.\u201d \u201cLiz Cheney is saying exactly what Kevin McCarthy said the day of the insurrection. She has just consistently been saying it. A few weeks later Kevin McCarthy changed to attacking other people. I think what the reality is, as a party, we need to have an internal look and a full accounting as to what led to January 6,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cRight now it is basically the Titanic. We\u2019re in the middle of this slow sink.\u201d Asked about Republican voters believing the election was stolen from Trump, Kinzinger said, \u201cYou cannot unify truth with lies.\u201d \u201cTruth matters,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "California Republican gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner said she favors granting a path to citizenship to the 1.75 million undocumented immigrants in the state\u2019s labor force, staking out a position that is more progressive than many voters in the GOP base nationally and at odds with former President Donald Trump, who Jenner supported until 2018. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that will air on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d at 8 p.m. ET Monday night, Jenner said that she decided to challenge California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the all-but-certain recall election after watching the crisis that has unfolded at the southern border where the Biden administration has been struggling to halt a surge in immigrants from South and Central America, many of them children. What Caitlyn Jenner's launch means for the brewing California recall \u201cI am for legal immigration, okay. What\u2019s been happening on the border was honestly one of the reasons I decided to run for governor,\u201d Jenner said in the interview. \u201cI was watching people dying come across the river, kids in cages \u2013 whatever you want to call them.\u201d \u201cThey should have a chance at citizenship?\u201d Bash asked. \u201cAbsolutely, yeah. They should. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of people, but personally I have met some of the most wonderful people who are immigrants, who have come to this country and they are just model citizens. They are just great people and I would fight for them to be US citizens,\u201d Jenner replied. The former Olympian and reality television personality is facing steep odds by running as a Republican in a state where Democrats outnumber GOP voters by two-to-one. But the immigration views she expressed in the new CNN interview align with those of the majority of California Republicans, who tend to be more progressive on social issues than the Republican voters nationally who flocked to Trump\u2019s candidacy. A late March survey by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 85% of Californians say there should be a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as long as they meet certain requirements, including 68% of the state\u2019s Republicans. In the likely recall election, which has yet to be officially called or scheduled, all of the state\u2019s voters will be asked two questions. The first will be whether they want to recall Newsom (yes or no); the second will be who they would like to replace him with, followed by a long list of candidates including Jenner. Jenner opposes transgender girls participating in girls' sports Despite the anger among many Californians about the restrictions that Newsom put in place to try to control the spread of Covid-19 last year \u2013 strict policies that fueled a grassroots movement to gather the more than 1.4 million valid signatures required to qualify the recall for the ballot \u2013 the Democratic governor\u2019s political position has remained strong. (The California secretary of state reported in late April that proponents had turned in the requisite number of valid signatures to initiate the recall of Newsom, but in the next step of the process, voters have 30 business days in which they are allowed to withdraw their names from recall petitions.) Newsom\u2019s approval rating held steady at 53% of likely voters in the March PPIC survey and only 40% of likely voters said they would vote \u201cyes\u201d on removing him, while 56% said they would vote no. In the months before Democratic Gov. Gray Davis was recalled in California in 2003 and replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger, about seven in ten likely voters disapproved of Davis\u2019 performance and ultimately 55% voted to recall him. When asked about deportations, Jenner told Bash that \u201cthe bad ones have to leave,\u201d defining that group as those with criminal records or those who are affiliated with the street gang MS-13, adding \u201cthe list goes on.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of bad people that are trying to cross our border illegally. I don\u2019t want those people in our country,\u201d Jenner said.",

            "article_content": "As Virginia Republicans try to win their first race for governor in more than a decade, the party is selecting their standardbearer this weekend \u2013 a decision that will suggest where the national party is heading as it seeks to gain back power in Washington after former President Donald Trump\u2019s defeat in November. The nomination for governor remains wide open as more than 50,000 delegates headed to what the state party calls an \u201cunassembled\u201d convention on Saturday, meeting at 39 locations across the state as necessitated by Covid-19 restrictions. At one site, in Fairfax County in suburban Northern Virginia, a steady line of cars snaked through the parking lot of a community college for most of the day. Delegates waited to collect, fill out and return their ballots \u2013 all without needing to leave their vehicles. The \u201cdrive-in\u201d process is unusual for a Republican nominating convention, and there were a few signs of confusion from delegates about how to cast their ballots. Volunteers at the Fairfax County site at times struggled to direct delegates\u2019 cars to the proper lane for turning in their filled ballots. For some drivers, the entire exercise \u2013 from getting in line to casting a ballot \u2013 took around one hour. Four of the seven gubernatorial candidates are considered those most likely to win the nomination and challenge the Democratic nominee this November. But with the party using a ranked-choice voting method that requires the winner to receive 50% of the vote, there remains no clear favorite. Among the top GOP candidates are businessmen Glenn Youngkin and Pete Snyder, both of whom have led the field in campaign spending \u2013 chiefly on ads going after each other as competing \u201coutsider\u201d candidates. Former state assembly speaker Kirk Cox has the most experience in elected office and, along with Snyder, has the most establishment support. And state Sen. Amanda Chase, a pro-Trump gadfly who revels in being known as a \u201cfirebrand\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d has a small, loyal following. The field also includes former think tank executive Peter Doran, former Roanoke sheriff Octavia Johnson and retired Army Col. Sergio de la Pe\u00f1a \u2013 all minor candidates. At the Fairfax County site, Stephanie Myers of Alexandria, a first-time delegate, told CNN she had been leaning toward Cox because she liked his decades of experience in the state assembly but that she had been convinced to give her top spot to Youngkin after hearing him speak to voters in Alexandria on Friday. \u201cHe had all the positive qualities of Donald Trump,\u201d Myers said of Youngkin, a former executive at the Carlyle Group, \u201cand none of the negative qualities.\u201d Myers said she would list Cox as her second choice. This year\u2019s race to replace Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who is prevented by Virginia\u2019s one-term limit from seeking re-election, will be seen as a test of the nation\u2019s political climate nearly one year into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. Virginia law allows parties to choose between selecting their nominees for statewide offices in party-run conventions or in state-run primaries. Democrats are holding a primary on June 8, where former Gov. Terry McAuliffe is among the leading candidates. The leftward shift of Virginia\u2019s suburbs around Washington, DC \u2013 a trend vividly on display in Northam\u2019s 2017 victory and in recent Democratic presidential wins in the state \u2013 is likely to make Democrats the favorites to hold the governor\u2019s office in Richmond. Despite this shift and the uncertainty about who the GOP nominee will be, observers say the Virginia party has an opportunity this year to win in a state that has frustrated Republicans for years. \u201cRepublicans are poised for a massive comeback in legislative races as long as Donald Trump stays off the headlines,\u201d said Chris Saxman, a former Republican state delegate who writes a political newsletter. Saxman and others say Republicans who can push back on the gains Democrats have made in Virginia\u2019s suburbs in Richmond and Northern Virginia can make the state competitive again for the GOP. \u201cIf this weekend produces a more \u2018center-right\u2019 nominee who can appeal to the suburbs, this race could be a lot closer than many anticipate,\u201d said Tucker Martin, a former aide to the last Republican governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. Nevertheless, the direction of the pre-convention campaign suggests support for Trump remains a core requirement for success in the Republican Party, even amid GOP fears that the association hurts the party in statewide elections. Trump will not endorse before the convention, said a person close to the former President, leaving the space for appealing to Trump\u2019s voters wide open. To that end, Youngkin, Snyder and Cox have all embraced some form of \u201celection integrity\u201d as an issue \u2013 threading the needle of acknowledging Republican concerns about the integrity of the vote without fully embracing Trump\u2019s false claims about a stolen 2020 election. Snyder has run TV ads, for instance, promising to \u201cstop liberals from rigging the system\u201d and supporting \u201cvoter ID and verification of all ballots.\u201d Cox has also talked up voter ID and has called for a bipartisan election board. And both Youngkin and Snyder in particular have tried to draw on support from figures in Trump\u2019s broader political world. Several members of Youngkin\u2019s staff are veterans of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns. He has also run a TV ad with footage of Trump praising Youngkin by name during a White House event on trade. Snyder, meanwhile, held an event this past week with former Trump press secretary and Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Chase, on the other hand, spoke at the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington that preceded the violent riot at the US Capitol, and she has aligned herself with the former President explicitly by calling herself \u201cTrump in heels.\u201d Republican observers say her extreme position limits her ability to gain a majority in a convention, but her connection to the party\u2019s pro-Trump base has pulled the rest of the field to the right. \u201cThe winner of the so-called convention could be the candidate with the best ability to package disinformation and culture wars into a digestible mental snack,\u201d said Denver Riggleman, a former Republican congressman from Virginia who has emerged as a critic of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Many of the Republican candidates for governor made unusual pitches ahead of the convention, asking to be delegates\u2019 second-favorite candidate if not their top choice. The Virginia GOP is using ranked-choice voting to select their candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. The method could make second- and third-place votes just as important in determining the nominee as first-place votes. Delegates cast a single ballot, with the candidates ranked one through seven. At a typical convention, low-performing candidates would be knocked out or withdraw, and the remaining candidates would make appeals to win over their supporters in the next round of voting. This time, though, several of the Republican candidates made appeals ahead of the voting to become the second-place preference of their rivals\u2019 supporters. \u201cI understand I might not be everyone\u2019s first choice,\u201d Cox said in a recent online ad. \u201cBut if I\u2019m not your first choice, I\u2019d really appreciate you putting me down as your second.\u201d Cox and Youngkin \u2013 who has told event attendees he\u2019d like to be their second choice if he isn\u2019t their first \u2013 have used public forums to muse about roles the other could serve in their administrations. Youngkin said he would want Cox as his education secretary, while Cox said he\u2019d tap Youngkin as secretary of commerce and trade. And Snyder recently sent supporters an email from Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general and Trump immigration official. \u201cEven if Pete is not your first choice, you can vote to make him your second choice,\u201d Cuccinelli\u2019s email said. Taking a difference approach is Chase, who urged her supporters to fill her name in on all seven lines \u2013 which is functionally the same as casting a first-place vote and nothing else. This year\u2019s convention follows a decade in which the GOP collapsed in Virginia. Republicans have not won a statewide election since 2009 and lost their state legislative majorities. One previous trend would have been in the GOP\u2019s favor: Since the 1970s, the winner of Virginia\u2019s off-year gubernatorial election always came from the opposite party of the previous year\u2019s winning presidential candidate. But that changed in 2013, when McAuliffe was elected Virginia\u2019s governor a year after Barack Obama won a second White House term. GOP party officials feuded in late 2020 and early 2021 over whether to hold a convention or a primary, leaving decisions about when and how to select a gubernatorial nominee unsettled for months. Some delegates in Fairfax County were still upset about the choice to use a convention. \u201cI\u2019m a primary guy,\u201d said one man from his car before speeding off to keep his place in line. The decision to hold a convention is seen as damaging to Chase, in particular. She\u2019s faced criticism in the state Senate for pushing Trump\u2019s lies about the outcome of the 2020 election and calling those who rioted at the Capitol on January 6 \u201cpatriots.\u201d She has been required to sit inside a plexiglass box on the Senate floor over her refusal to wear a mask. In a divided field in which only first-place votes mattered, she could have emerged with a plurality of support from die-hard Trump loyalists. Many Republicans do not expect Chase to be a dominant second-choice candidate, but the limited public polling of the race means the race to get a bare majority of delegates, and the GOP nomination, could be anyone\u2019s.

When I saw that CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny was in Arizona covering the senators there, I was a little confused. The next election is more than a year away. Plus, Arizona is currently home to the most distracting and strange sideshow in politics \u2013 an audit of 2020 votes forced by Republicans in the state and run by a company called Cyber Ninjas with ties to allies of former President Donald Trump. I reached out to Jeff to ask about his trip and what he\u2019s learning about Arizona and the country. WHAT MATTERS: Jeff. It\u2019s May of 2021 and the next election isn\u2019t until November of 2022. Why are you in Arizona covering senators? ZELENY: The Senate has been on a break all week, with senators back in their home states. Two of the most intriguing senators on the Democratic side happen to be from Arizona, so we came out for a few days to explore what voters, business leaders and party officials think about the Biden agenda. Without a single vote to spare, the White House knows that the outlook for President Joe Biden\u2019s ambitions runs straight through Arizona. Republicans continue their nationwide campaign to restrict voting WHAT MATTERS: With Republicans united against Biden\u2019s agenda (stopping the Biden agenda is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s top priority), Democrats are unlikely to get much done this year unless they all agree to change or work around Senate filibuster rules. Where do Arizona\u2019s senators stand on this key issue? ZELENY: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who in 2018 became Arizona\u2019s first Democrat to win a Senate seat in three decades, has emerged as the biggest defender of the Senate filibuster rules. She believes the senators should change how they work \u2013 negotiate, reach across the aisle, find consensus \u2013 rather than changing the rules of the Senate by allowing big items to pass on a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the current 60-vote threshold. This has sparked outrage from progressive activists who helped elect her, who believe she is standing in the way of voting rights, immigration and gun control legislation. Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat who was elected last fall, has taken a far less concrete stand against changing the Senate rules. He has walked a more careful line, saying he would make a judgment about how it affects his constituents in Arizona. WHAT MATTERS: Who are the Republicans thinking about getting into the 2022 race? What are we learning in Arizona about how tied the party is to Trump? ZELENY: Even though he just won last fall, Kelly is up for reelection in 2022. It\u2019s the consequence of being elected in a special election, since he is technically filling the remainder of the term won in 2016 by Sen. John McCain. Get all that? Anyway, Republicans are still on the hunt for a candidate. Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, has a far higher profile and more robust fundraising than your average freshman senator. All of that, along with turmoil inside the Arizona GOP, has complicated efforts to find a strong candidate to challenge him. But it\u2019s still early \u2013 the election isn\u2019t until November 2022. WHAT MATTERS: The other big political story in Arizona is the circus of an after-the-fact recount, forced by the state\u2019s GOP-led Senate and undertaken by a Florida-based company full of Trump supporters. Do people you talk to on the ground, despite all the evidence to the contrary, believe the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump? Justice Department warns Arizona Senate president of civil rights violations in 2020 election audit ZELENY: It\u2019s more of an audit or a review than an actual recount. And even that characterization comes with a string of qualifications and explanations. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, which Biden narrowly won, marking only the second time since 1948 that a Democratic presidential candidate carried Arizona. But the Republican-controlled Arizona Senate is commissioning a review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix and the sprawling metropolitan area. It feeds into the misinformation campaign that Trump and his allies are leading. Voters we talked to who are loyal followers of Trump say they support the review of the ballots, even with no evidence of fraud. Not all mainstream GOP officials agree, including Mesa Mayor John Giles, who dismissed the ballot drama as \u201cpolitical theater being forced on us by some political extremists.\u201d WHAT MATTERS: Arizona is the home of modern conservatism. Mark Kelly\u2019s US Senate seat was once held by both McCain and Barry Goldwater, both of whom lost general elections as the GOP presidential nominee, in 2008 and 1964. (Fun trivia: I can\u2019t think of another seat held by two losing general-election candidates). Goldwater\u2019s landslide loss represented a major shift in US politics \u2013 of the South away from Democrats over civil rights. What\u2019s the shift we\u2019re seeing now, at least in terms of your reporting on the ground there? ZELENY: It\u2019s a bit early to tell whether any major shifts are underway, but Arizona is a key laboratory for just how progressive the Biden agenda will be. Biden narrowly turned the state blue, but Sinema and Kelly are taking a far more pragmatic approach \u2013 rather than a progressive one \u2013 as they consider the President\u2019s sweeping ambitious plans. It\u2019s a fascinating test for the appetite for moderate Democratic views in a party that has become considerably more progressive in recent years. WHAT MATTERS: Some states, like Virginia or Colorado, go from red to blue. Others, like Florida, are perennial battlegrounds. Have the politics of Arizona materially changed or is it likely to be a battleground for years to come? ZELENY: There\u2019s no doubt that changing demographics in Arizona are fueling a change in the state\u2019s long-running conservative leanings. Younger voters, Latino voters and new voters have helped Democrats win seats here. Yet it\u2019s hardly a blue state. A Republican Party here viewed by many as extreme has allowed moderate Democratic candidates like Sinema, Kelly and even Biden to win. The 2022 midterms will be a fascinating test of whether the state shifts back to red or continues its very incremental shift toward the left. But for now, it is cementing itself in the ranks of being a classic battleground state.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Elise Stefanik, who\u2019s poised to replace Rep. Liz Cheney as the No. 3 House Republican, has signaled to some of her colleagues that she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks. That assurance could help assuage concerns on the right over her more moderate voting record, though she\u2019s widely viewed as a virtual lock for the No. 3 job when the vote happens as soon as Wednesday. If Stefanik ultimately abides by her private assurance, which was first reported by Politico, there would be an open position and an all-out scramble for the third-ranking spot, which would be the majority whip position if Republicans regain control of the House in next year\u2019s midterms. The New York congresswoman has been locking up support for the position this week, moving swiftly to clear the field. But concerns remain among some conservatives in the House and around Washington. Outside groups rate her voting record as much less conservative than Cheney\u2019s. And the House Freedom Caucus, for example, has taken issue with Stefanik\u2019s uneven stance on a wide range of issues the group prioritizes, including immigration and LGBTQ rights. She\u2019s expected to address lawmakers in the caucus on Monday, according to a person familiar with the plan. How a vote on Liz Cheney's leadership post could happen But even skeptics of Stefanik\u2019s conservative credentials say she\u2019s preferable to Cheney on the most important factor: her loyalty to former President Donald Trump. While the Wyoming Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney was a loyal supporter of Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress during most of his presidency, her support for his second impeachment is the only vote that really matters for her leadership position. Despite her ability to overwhelmingly survive an attempt in February to remove her as conference chair, Cheney\u2019s impeachment vote and her consistent defense of it have enraged the former President. And her continued arguments that the party should move on from Trump and correct his lies about the 2020 election have weakened her position with members who publicly remain in Trump\u2019s camp. Stefanik\u2019s outspoken loyalty to Trump and his effort to claim the election was illegitimate, on the other hand, appear to be insulating her from anything beyond perfunctory criticism from the conservative activist wing of the party. There\u2019s wide expectation that Stefanik will win a secret ballot election next week, given that she has the support of Trump, House leadership and a wide cross-section of the conference. And so far, no challenger has emerged to take her on. Even moderate Republican Rep. John Katko, who voted to impeach Trump and was an ally of Cheney, told a local newspaper he will back his fellow New Yorker for the job, a clear signal that Cheney\u2019s leadership tenure is coming to an end. \u201cI have every confidence that Elise will be a superb leader for all of our conference, not just some,\u201d Katko told The Auburn Citizen Friday. \u201cElise and I came in together and she knows me as well as she knows conservatives. She knows that I have a different type of district than a lot of conservatives.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "Even as Rep. Elise Stefanik has consolidated her position as the likely replacement for Rep. Liz Cheney as the No. 3 House Republican, her voting record has raised concerns from some conservatives in the House and around Washington. During a Wednesday night conference call, multiple members of the far-right Freedom Caucus voiced deep reservations about Stefanik as the consensus choice for Republican conference chair \u2013 even as they conceded she has the votes to succeed Cheney. A House member on the call told CNN the Freedom Caucus has concerns about Stefanik\u2019s moderate voting record and her uneven stance on a wide range of issues the group prioritizes, including immigration and LGBTQ rights. Given those concerns, Stefanik is expected to address lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus on Monday, according to a person familiar with the plan. Meanwhile conservative outside interest groups are also expressing trepidation about Stefanik\u2019s rise, especially since her record is less conservative than Cheney\u2019s. But even skeptics of Stefanik\u2019s conservative credentials say she\u2019s preferable to Cheney on the most important factor: her loyalty to former President Donald Trump. \u201cLiz Cheney is a true conservative. She has better ratings across the board. Elise was a moderate and a Trump skeptic who realized she had to pivot to Trump \u2013 and she did,\u201d said one prominent conservative activist who was granted anonymity to speak more freely. \u201cElise satisfies the litmus test that she is pro-Trump. And that\u2019s all that counts these days in our coalition. And I think we are a coalition, not a party today, because there are plenty of the Trump folks, the MAGA folks who are not true Republicans.\u201d The reaction from conservatives inside and outside Congress around Washington reflects the speed with which House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has moved to oust Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, from her position in leadership. Despite Trump\u2019s own endorsement of Stefanik, some activist groups are making their displeasure known. The pro-market Club for Growth tweeted on Wednesday that Stefanik is a \u201cliberal\u201d and has just a 35% lifetime score with the group. And social conservatives were turned off by Stefanik\u2019s past support for legislation that would have extended non-discrimination protections to LGBTQ Americans. \u201cNot a fan,\u201d said Terry Schilling, the executive director of the American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group, when asked about Stefanik. But that distaste for Stefanik does not reflect an affinity for Cheney among conservative activists. Fact check: Elise Stefanik tried to get election overturned, promoted election lies \u201cI think we could find someone else for leadership (other) than Stefanik, but I\u2019ll take her over Cheney any day,\u201d said Schilling. Activists say they are wary of how quickly Republicans have lined up behind Stefanik, even if there is no apparent alternative to the New York congresswoman when it comes to replacing Cheney. \u201cThis train is headed down the tracks. The only way to stop it is to blow up the tracks and nobody seems to have the willpower or desire to do that at this point, so we\u2019re going to have to pray this doesn\u2019t turn out to be a mistake,\u201d the head of one prominent conservative advocacy group told CNN. Despite some grumbling among more conservative House members and outside groups about the quick push to anoint Stefanik \u2013 especially given her more moderate voting record \u2013 there\u2019s still wide expectation that she will win a secret ballot election, given that she has the support of Trump, House leadership and a wide cross-section of the conference. And so far, no challenger has emerged to take her on. Few have argued Cheney, a loyal supporter of Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress during most of his presidency, should be booted from leadership over her positions on issues. The Wyoming Republican\u2019s voting record is more rigidly conservative than Stefanik\u2019s. In the scorecards for multiple conservative groups \u2013 the Club For Growth, Heritage Action, and the American Conservative Union \u2013 Cheney receives a higher rating than Stefanik. As the Club noted on Twitter on Wednesday, Stefanik\u2019s rating is the fourth-lowest among current House Republicans. But for Cheney\u2019s support among the House conference, only one vote has really mattered: her support for the second impeachment of Trump. Liz Cheney's fall shows that Trump is here to stay Despite her ability to overwhelmingly survive an attempt in February to remove her as conference chair, Cheney\u2019s impeachment vote and her consistent defense of it has enraged the former President. And by continuing to argue that the party should move on from Trump and correct his lies about the 2020 election, her position has weakened with members who publicly remain in Trump\u2019s camp. Stefanik\u2019s outspoken loyalty to Trump and his effort to claim the 2020 election was illegitimate, on the other hand, appear to be insulating her from anything beyond perfunctory criticism from the conservative activist wing of the party. \u201cShe\u2019s not a hardcore conservative, and I maybe would have liked to have had some input, but there absolutely needs to be a woman in that role,\u201d said the head of the advocacy group. This person described Stefanik\u2019s likely elevation to GOP conference chair as \u201csomething to be cautiously optimistic about.\u201d And the prominent conservative activist told CNN that \u201cthe perception is that Elise is a lot more solid than Liz on Trump.\u201d Stefanik did not return a request for comment from CNN. When asked about these criticisms during a Thursday morning appearance on \u201cWar Room,\u201d a podcast and radio show hosted by former Trump White House aide Steve Bannon, Stefanik pivoted to tout her pro-Trump credentials. \u201cMy vision is to run with support from the President and his coalition of voters,\u201d she said, referring to Trump. For the most dedicated conservatives, Stefanik\u2019s expected turn in leadership is just part of the compromise of politics. \u201cThis is basically asking conservatives to choose between two people that aren\u2019t really our friends. But at the end of the day, Elise Stefanik isn\u2019t going to join the chorus of people saying \u2018Republicans are evil,\u2019 whereas Liz Cheney seems to believe that,\u201d Schilling added.

            "article_content": "The unmistakable message of Liz Cheney\u2019s downfall is that Donald Trump will be a dominant figure in the Republican Party -- and by extension American life \u2013 most likely for years to come. The Wyoming Republican congresswoman is about to lose her No. 3 House leadership post after a lonely defense of the truth that last year\u2019s election was not stolen and that Trump incited a riot in the US Capitol to try to overthrow it. Those facts are unpalatable for most of Cheney\u2019s House Republican colleagues, who have ambitions to rise in a party controlled by the former President despite his two impeachments, botched reelection bid, failure to properly handle the pandemic and insurrectionist exit from power. Cheney nevertheless warned her party in a valedictory op-ed in The Washington Post on Wednesday that the GOP was at a \u201cturning point\u201d at which the party must decide whether to \u201cchoose truth and fidelity to the Constitution\u201d or bow down to Trump. \u201cWe Republicans need to stand for genuinely conservative principles, and steer away from the dangerous and anti-democratic Trump cult of personality,\u201d Cheney wrote. \u201cWe believe in the rule of law, in limited government, in a strong national defense, and in prosperity and opportunity brought by low taxes and fiscally conservative policies.\u201d Her article made an implicit case that the Republican Party may be irrevocably damaging itself in the eyes of the American public by ignoring Trump\u2019s offenses against the basic democratic principles that underpin the country. But the frightening reality for traditional conservatives who support Cheney\u2019s stand against Trump is that she appears to be defending a vision of the GOP that no longer exists. While low taxes and fiscal prudence still appeal to some conservatives, ideological purity has long since receded as the organizing principle of the party in favor of personal tributes to Trump and appeals to his anti-establishment base. Club for Growth, a conservative organization focused on economic issues, came out Thursday against Rep. Elise Stefanik, who Trump and some in GOP leadership have endorsed to replace Cheney, saying saying the New York moderate-turned-MAGA congresswoman is \u201cNOT a good spokesperson\u201d for the conference. \u201cShe is a liberal with a 35% CFGF lifetime rating, 4th worst in the House GOP. House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority,\u201d the group tweeted. For Trump backers, \u201cstrong national defense\u201d is a code word for long, bloody wars in the Middle East started by President George W. Bush and the Wyoming lawmaker\u2019s father, ex-Vice President Dick Cheney. Liz Cheney\u2019s version of the GOP has already been superseded by a populist, autocratic, anti-free-trade and deficit-oblivious vehicle for Trump\u2019s personal gratification, having been reshaped and now dominated by the former President. That means that the likes of Cheney, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois likely face years in the wilderness until political winds shift \u2013 all because they put principle over personal loyalty to the ex-President. Trump\u2019s hold on the GOP \u2013 which is, if anything, even more powerful, at least in the House, than when he was in office \u2013 is one of the most remarkable achievements in modern politics. Trump claimed the White House and kept the country in an exhausting whirl of controversy and chaos through ubiquity \u2013 mostly on social media. But his orchestration of Cheney\u2019s exit, on a day when Facebook\u2019s oversight board prolonged his suspension from the platform, showed that his power in the GOP is so broad that he may not need to tweet or post to work his will. His continued primacy is proof of the unshakable bond with millions of voters who embraced his tirades against political correctness, immigration and cultural warfare, and those voters now see his lies about election cheating as an article of faith. The decision by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to anchor his bid to reclaim the House in midterm elections in 2022 on the former President means Trump will be a dominant, and likely vocal, campaign trail presence. If Republicans fail to trigger the first-term curse of presidents and erase the narrow Democratic House majority, the move will be seen as a blunder. But the portents of history and the fact that success in midterm elections relies on agitated base voters mean that McCarthy, from a purely electoral sense, may be adopting the most logical political strategy open to him by embracing Trump. Barring a wipeout by the GOP \u2013 or a clear sign that the ex-President\u2019s visibility cost the party a chance to win back the Senate \u2013 Trump would then appear to be in prime position to launch a bid for the 2024 Republican nomination or to play a kingmaker role for a favored candidate. His oversized presence has already caused some uncomfortable positioning for other possible 2024 contenders, many of whom are falling over themselves to praise the former President with an eye on his voters. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has started to praise Trump\u2019s presidency after criticizing his friend\u2019s behavior after the election. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is refusing to apologize for raising his fist in tribute to Trump crowds on Capitol Hill before the insurrection. And former US Ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley \u2013 seen by many Republicans as a possible force for post-Trump renewal and a return to a more traditional GOP \u2013 has said she won\u2019t run in 2024 if her old boss does. That means that given luck, good health and presuming no legal problems or financial woes emerge to scupper any comeback hopes, the former President will be at minimum a major player in GOP politics until at least 2024. That dominance is the reason why winning Trump\u2019s approval has become the most important task of ambitious Republicans and why holdouts like Cheney figure to spend years on the sidelines before they get another taste of power. By contrast, Stefanik, Cheney\u2019s likely replacement in House leadership, took the fast track \u2013 morphing into a Trump defender and riding his endorsement, which swayed rank-and-file House Republicans to back her push for a plumb leadership post. Trump\u2019s likely constant and increasing presence in US politics \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t get his social media accounts back \u2013 means interesting calculations for the other top political leaders in town: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Joe Biden. While Trump may be already a favorite for the Republican nomination in 2024, the increasingly radical and authoritarian track down which he is leading his party might make it tough to win a rematch with the President in 2024. Of course, there will be questions over whether Biden would contemplate a reelection race as an 80-something. But as long as Trump is around, Democrats will be able to raise the specter of a return of the lawlessness and abuses of power of his single term in the service of retaining moderate suburban voters. Biden on Wednesday portrayed the GOP as in the grip of a churning, endless battle for its soul as he highlighted a pandemic restaurant rescue plan \u2013 part of his effort to make his own presidency as successful as possible in order to block any possible path to a return to power for Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the Republicans,\u201d the President said, when asked about the effort by Trump loyalists to eject Cheney \u2013 who has been civil toward Biden, though pillorying his economic and social politics \u2013 from the leadership. The President\u2019s Senate sparring partner, McConnell also faces challenges. Trump\u2019s refusal to slip into a quiet retirement might help drive up GOP votes in House races. But in broader electorates in statewide contests, aggressively pro-Trump candidates could make it harder for the party to win tight Senate races. The Kentucky Republican now seems set to chart a parallel course to the ex-President while seeking to halt Biden\u2019s massive and ambitious agenda. \u201cOne hundred percent of my focus is on stopping this new administration,\u201d the minority leader said on Wednesday, mirroring a similar comment he once let slip about trying to make Barack Obama a one-term president. McConnell harshly criticized Trump\u2019s role in the Capitol insurrection but declined to vote to convict him in an impeachment trial after he had left office. McConnell\u2019s positioning fell far short of Cheney\u2019s principled resistance but preserved him a much faster route to return to power even in a party that still contains the former President. Cheney and her fellow Trump refuseniks, meanwhile, now have little option but to adopt the kind of political long game that McConnell has more often made his signature if they are to turn their party around.",

            "article_content": "California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner said Wednesday that she is committed to building former President Donald Trump\u2019s wall at the southern border but that she favors \u201cmodernizing\u201d the nation\u2019s immigration system to help some of the undocumented immigrants in this country gain US citizenship. Jenner, who is challenging Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the Republican-led effort to recall him, did not offer any specifics Wednesday night about what changes are needed in the immigration system during her first television interview as a candidate, with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. But she appeared to be trying to straddle the line of appearing compassionate while also describing herself as \u201cpro-law enforcement\u201d and \u201cpro-border protection.\u201d \u201cWe need to spend some money to have a fair and equitable immigration system,\u201d she said when Hannity asked her if she supported \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d \u201cI am all for the wall. I would secure the wall. We can\u2019t have a state, we can\u2019t have a country without a secure wall.\u201d When Hannity asked whether she would \u201celiminate all of the sanctuary status that currently exists in this state,\u201d she replied, \u201cI would do my absolute best to do that.\u201d At the same time, she added: \u201cWe are a compassionate country, OK? We are a compassionate state. \u2026 Some people, we are going to send back. No question about that. \u2026 But I have met some of the greatest immigrants into our country.\u201d At one point, Jenner mistakenly said, \u201cI am pro-illegal immigration,\u201d and Hannity quickly clarified that she meant \u201cpro-legal immigration.\u201d \u201cLegal immigration, yes,\u201d Jenner replied. \u201cThanks for catching me.\u201d In a state where more than a fifth of likely voters are Latino, Jenner is clearly attempting to position herself as a GOP candidate who could appeal to a broader spectrum of voters by adopting a more moderate approach on issues like immigration than Trump and other leaders within the GOP base. Jenner, who announced her candidacy on Twitter late last month, described herself as a socially progressive, fiscally conservative Republican who would advocate lower taxes, less regulation and a \u201cmore friendly business environment.\u201d Her inclusive framing of her candidacy is an imperative in a state where Democrats now outnumber GOP voters by more than 2 to 1. Last month, state officials announced that recall organizers had gathered enough valid signatures for the effort to qualify for the ballot this year, but there are still several procedural steps \u2013 including allowing voters to withdraw their support for the recall \u2013 before the potential election will be officially announced. No date has been set. \u201cI can get along with anybody, Sean,\u201d Jenner said when Hannity asked her what she meant when she described herself as a \u201ccompassionate disrupter\u201d in a video introducing her candidacy. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t really care if you\u2019re a Republican, a Democrat, a libertarian, vegetarian. You know, it doesn\u2019t make any difference to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want solutions. If the Democrats are able to come up with great solutions, I am behind that 100%. Solutions to bring this state back, and to give the power of this state back to the people and not to the special interests and Gavin Newsom.\u201d Though Jenner initially supported Trump, one complication in her effort to win over his supporters in California is that she publicly rescinded her support for the then-President in 2018 in a Washington Post op-ed where she said his administration\u2019s policies were harmful to transgender people. Jenner, who is running one of the most high-profile campaigns by a transgender person in the nation, now counts some Trump loyalists among her advisers, including Brad Parscale, who ran Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, among others. \u201cWhat I liked about Donald Trump is he was a disrupter. You know? He came in and shook the system up,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that in Washington, DC, but he came in and shook the system up. I think he did some things that I agreed with, some things I didn\u2019t agree with. On trans issues, LGBT issues, I was more hopeful at the beginning. But there were some good things he did. On the other hand \u2013 (President Joe) Biden \u2013 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve agreed with anything.\u201d Though coronavirus case rates have dropped dramatically in California and the state\u2019s health department reported just two deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday \u2013 the lowest daily toll in more than a year \u2013 Jenner was sharply critical Wednesday night of Newsom\u2019s handling of the pandemic. She said she would open up the state without restrictions immediately if she were governor. The former Olympian also described Newsom as a \u201chypocrite\u201d beholden to special interests who had abandoned working people and small businesses during the pandemic with restrictive orders that he said were necessary to reduce surging case numbers and protect the state\u2019s limited intensive care unit capacity. Jenner faulted Newsom for attending the birthday party of a lobbyist at the exclusive French Laundry restaurant last November at a time when he was asking Californians to avoid gatherings with members outside their households. Newsom has apologized profusely for that decision and described his attendance at the gathering as a mistake. But while attempting to portray Newsom as an elitist, Jenner did not downplay her own wealth, noting the interview was taking place in her airplane hangar and offering Hannity a ride in her plane as soon as they finished filming. Jenner charged that Newsom used Covid restrictions as a \u201cpolitical tool\u201d to \u201ccontrol people.\u201d \u201cIt is like there is one set of rules for Sacramento and there\u2019s another set of rules for everybody else. I mean, you\u2019ve seen the video of him at The French Laundry, OK?\u201d Jenner said. \u201cI can\u2019t go down to my restaurant, and all the employees in that restaurant on there are not working. OK? And he is up there dining. \u2026 I\u2019m really fighting the hypocrisy that\u2019s going on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President George W. Bush again criticized what he sees as a Republican Party that is not inclusive enough, arguing that if it stands for \u201cWhite Anglo-Saxon Protestantism, then it\u2019s not going to win anything.\u201d The comments by the 43rd President \u2013 who has recently critiqued the modern GOP with a candor that has been unusual for him in retirement \u2013 speak to a rift in the party that has one side urging a doubling-down on former President Donald Trump\u2019s brand of nativist politics and another that wants to return to the more traditional GOP that Bush once led. Bush made the remark in a podcast interview with The Dispatch last week in response to a question about members of the Republican Party who planned to start a caucus pushing for \u201cAnglo-Saxon political tradition\u201d and Republicans who peddled the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen. Bush, who said he does not believe the election was stolen, told The Dispatch that while he believes Republicans will eventually govern again, \u201cif the Republican Party stands for exclusivity \u2013 you know, it used to be country clubs, now evidently it\u2019s White Anglo-Saxon Protestantism \u2013 then it\u2019s not going to win anything.\u201d It\u2019s far from clear, however, if the former President\u2019s guidance will find an audience among a GOP whose leaders are reluctant to defy former President Donald Trump and his base. In recent days, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney was booed by GOP delegates at the Utah Republican Party\u2019s organizing convention who are still angry about the 2012 presidential nominee\u2019s votes to convict Trump in both his 2020 and 2021 impeachment trials. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House, who also voted to impeach Trump this year, has become once again a target of Trump and his congressional allies after she said that Republicans who objected to the certification of Electoral College results on January 6 should be disqualified from leading the party. Bush has in recent weeks described the Republican Party as \u201cisolationist, protectionist and, to a certain extent, nativist,\u201d and written about the need for a gentler approach to immigration in contrast to much of the hardline rhetoric that dominates the current GOP in the post-Trump era. The former President has been making media appearances to promote his new book, a collection of portraits of American immigrants he painted, titled \u201cOut of Many, One,\u201d which happens to have been released at a time of heated debate over immigration in Washington. Bush, who lives in Texas, has for years highlighted the immigrant community in his home state and has often praised America\u2019s immigrant history while advocating for immigration policies. \u201cI fully understand the populist angst that comes with the immigration debate,\u201d he told The Dispatch on Friday. Bush, who has experienced immigrants for years in Texas and embraces immigration, said he can understand why those without that experience might feel differently. \u201cOne reason I can see it is because I studied history and I, you know, I remember the Know-Nothing Party, fiercely anti-immigrant. I remember the immigration policy of the 20\u2019s: \u2018too many Jews and Italians.\u2019 Therefore we had zero immigrants, except for, of course, on the Texas border, where immigrants were always coming in to help, you know, the cattle raisers and the farmers. But yeah, I fully understand it. And I don\u2019t cast aspersion. But I also know that without those immigrants, the economies of those areas would be, you know, paltry,\u201d Bush told The Dispatch. \u201cThe purpose of responsible policymakers is to say, \u2018Look, we fully understand where you\u2019re coming from,\u2019 \u201d he said, adding that policymakers should also shed light on the \u201cpositive contributions these citizens can make.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a natural phenomenon and it\u2019s not a onetime experience in our country,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having these spasms of anxiety for a long period of time. On the other hand, a confident nation says, \u2018E pluribis unum.\u2019 \u201c CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster, Maeve Reston, Lauren Fox, Alex Rogers and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A building Biden boom may be about to reshape America\u2019s politics. As the economy roars into life after its pandemic shutdown, soaring growth and rising stock markets may seem to undermine the President\u2019s case for trillions of dollars in spending as Republicans and some moderate Democrats balk at the cost. Yet, from Joe Biden\u2019s point of view, the signs of a long-awaited rebound actually make his core goal \u2013 sharing prosperity with working Americans and not just the wealthy \u2013 even more urgent and on point. The President said Wednesday night it\u2019s time for a \u201cblue-collar blueprint to build America,\u201d speaking to Americans who feel \u201cleft-behind, forgotten in an economy that\u2019s so rapidly changing.\u201d It\u2019s a message that resonates with the voters courted by former President Donald Trump, as well as the Black and Brown voters in cities who turned out to elect Biden in states like Georgia. When Republican senators argue that the economy is coming back so fast that it doesn\u2019t need extra help \u2013 or that higher taxes and regulation will create a drag \u2013 Biden can point to the 8.4 million jobs the economy is currently down from pre-pandemic levels.   Voters are paying attention and that\u2019s the reason the White House sees an opening amid the crisis for a transformational moment. During a drive-in rally Thursday in Georgia \u2013 the state that elected the two Democratic senators in runoff races this year that gave that party control of the 50-50 Senate \u2013 Biden told attendees that their votes had made it possible for him to sign coronavirus relief legislation, which he described as \u201cone of the most consequential rescue bills in American history.\u201d \u201cWhat did you do? What would you do with your vote here in Georgia? \u2026 You began to change America and you\u2019re helping us prove that democracy \u2013 democracy can still deliver for the people,\u201d the President said. \u201cBut as much as we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve got a lot more to do,\u201d he said, turning to the infrastructure plan that he is trying to push through Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-generation investment in America. It\u2019s the biggest jobs plan in this country since World War Two.\u201d Biden has presented his American Jobs Plan as a fulfillment of his campaign promises to reward the middle class and union households, and on Thursday he argued that it would also deliver \u201creal equity across the board to everyone: Black, White, Latino, Asian-American \u2013 good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water.\u201d On Wednesday night, in his first address to a joint session of Congress, he outlined the second part of his infrastructure proposal \u2013 a large-scale investment in education, child care and paid family leave. That framing of the President\u2019s ambitious economic plans is not just central to the President\u2019s lifelong philosophy. It is also critical to addressing the most important political challenge he faces \u2013 a need to lure moderate voters, especially in the industrial Midwest, who have been alienated by the Democratic Party\u2019s drift to the left and ultimately aligned with Trump on cultural issues. Biden\u2019s proposal for expansive social programs \u2013 including aid for home health care workers and child care \u2013 target voters in these geographical areas, but also are intended to rebuild the economy from the bottom up. Such reforms also offer an opening to another crucial constituency \u2013 suburban women who were hammered by the recession and could be pivotal in the 2022 midterm elections. Joe Biden warns democracy is still threatened and Trump's looming shadow proves it The medium-term political question is whether the benefits of a fast-expanding economy could sway some GOP and independent voters to Biden\u2019s side who opted in two elections for Trump-style populism. Such Americans bought into Trump\u2019s scorching messages on immigration, guns and now back his claims the last election was stolen and that Democrats want to defund and eradicate police forces. Republicans are already making the calls by some Democratic activists to \u201cdefund the police\u201d their attack against moderate Democratic lawmakers, and that GOP talking point became one of the most effective attack lines against congressional Democrats during the 2020 elections. The size of Biden\u2019s economic proposals has also given Republicans more fodder for their argument that Biden has lived up to the GOP\u2019s claims that he\u2019s a radical pushing \u201csocialist policies\u201d that are out of step with most Americans. It\u2019s a familiar Republican line \u2013 and it worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term when conservative alarm about big spending nurtured the Tea Party movement that helped the GOP win back control of Congress. Yet it is still to be proven whether similar attacks work now, since Trump had no problem exploding deficits and there was less resistance within his base to government action that helps the working class when he proposed it. Looking ahead to this first midterm election cycle of a new presidency \u2013 when the party in power in the White House traditionally loses seats \u2013 Biden\u2019s appeals will test whether the potential rise in economic prosperity fueled by historic government intervention will have as much power to persuade swing voters as the cultural appeals of Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cThere\u2019s a big meta question \u2013 to what extent do economic gains actually filter into political behavior. That is the riddle,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who closely studies the way economic disruptions have affected the American workforce. But he noted that Biden\u2019s plans are \u201chuge programs that are going to make a difference rapidly, so you\u2019re really going to see an attributable benefit from them.\u201d He added that Biden\u2019s Covid relief plan also has large amounts of \u201cvery flexible, easily used state and local aid\u201d that may help many of the communities that are struggling economically, including in the Midwest where Trump and Biden battled for voters. That aid may have not only forestalled layoffs that would have occurred because of the pandemic; it may also help small towns and rural areas create new initiatives like job training programs or educational grants for workers. If the Biden administration is effective in branding those programs as a result of their work, some persuadable voters may take notice. The state and local aid, Muro said, is \u201cundersold as an important part of this \u2013 and it will be some of the fastest (aid) to hit the streets.\u201d Ultimately, improving the lot of working and middle class Americans and creating broader prosperity is fundamental to a mission Biden defined this week to mend frayed US societal cohesion \u2013 and democracy itself to keep up with rising economic superpowers like China, which see the US in inexorable decline. Signs of economic awakening are everywhere. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout\u2019s success, with tens of millions of people already or shortly to be fully vaccinated, has hospitality and travel industries on a hiring spree and consumer spending soaring as long-lost freedoms beckon. New data shows GDP growth at 6.4%, marking the the best first quarter since 1984. Stocks are soaring, confounding Trump\u2019s claims that Democrats would tank the market. Under Biden\u2019s watch, the markets have gone on their richest first 100-days tear since President John F. Kennedy took office. Given the normal laws of politics, such data might offer the President a political boost and validate the promise that got him hired \u2014 to end the worst public health crisis in 100 years and get the country back to work. Presidents often get too much credit and too much blame for short-term booms and busts in the economy, but their policies in the long term can set the foundation for prosperity for millions of people. Joe Biden can't stop thinking about China and the future of American democracy At a deeper level, a fast rebound could change the forces and calculations that will dictate the fate of the most audacious effort by a Democratic President to transform the US economy and social safety net in generations. With Republicans and some moderate Democrats \u2013 including Senate swing vote Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 leery about Biden\u2019s multi-trillion dollar plans, a strong economy could undermine the case for more spending. On the other hand, rising stock markets and a flurry of balance sheets showing bumper profits could strengthen the President\u2019s case that the very richest Americans and corporations can afford to pay higher taxes to fund his plans. Biden argued in his speech Wednesday night that the pandemic had widened inequalities that were further stretched by Trump\u2019s massive corporate and personal tax plan that helped the rich. He has already signed into law a $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan that injected billions of dollars, in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks for many Americans into the economy. His more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan is about far more than roads and bridges. It expands into non-traditional areas like home health care for the elderly, which activists say is critical to improving the economy and lives at a grassroots level. Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion dollar American Families plan targets education and child care, an industry that suffered serious economic blows in the pandemic. Biden has begun doing outreach to Republican senators in the hopes that he can build bipartisan consensus for infrastructure proposals. Before departing Georgia on Thursday, he said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. \u201cI invited her to come with anyone she wants to bring with her to the White House,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cShe seemed very positive about wanting to do something, and I\u2019m interested to hear what they have to say.\u201d Capito tweeted that she had a \u201cconstructive & substantive call\u201d with Biden about infrastructure: \u201cWe both expressed our mutual desire to work together & deliver results for the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cI stand ready to be a partner in advancing bipartisan infrastructure legislation\u2014just as we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d The willingness of Republicans like Capito to engage with the Democratic President suggests that the GOP sees the potential allure of his proposals to voters.",

            "article_content": "Critics of California Gov. Gavin Newsom have met the state\u2019s threshold with enough validated signatures to force a recall election of the Democratic governor this year, a contest that could land on the ballot as early as this summer or as late as December. The recall had long been expected to qualify because it was driven by a well-organized grassroots group that gathered signatures in every county of the state \u2013 and backed by key Republican strategists in California who brought their fundraising heft and direct mail expertise to the effort. After largely ignoring the bid to force him out of his job, Newsom began mounting a formidable offensive to fight the recall earlier this year. But the California Democrat, who is often mentioned as a future contender for the White House, now enters a challenging new phase where he will be attempting to steer his state back to normal life as the pandemic recedes while essentially running a full-time campaign to defend his job. Newsom\u2019s approval ratings are still above 50% and he has put a great deal of effort into accelerating Covid-19 vaccinations to speed up the state\u2019s reopening \u2013 setting a target of June 15 for when he hopes to lift all Covid-19 restrictions. But the recall has been fueled by anger over the restrictions he put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus throughout last year and during an alarming surge in cases during the winter holiday months. California has been one of the slowest states to get children back to school \u2013 in Los Angeles, the second-largest school district in the country, many children did not return to school in person until mid-April, infuriating parents who worried about their own ability to work and the many hours of instruction that their students have lost this year. Everything you need to know about the effort to recall California's governor In a recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, 53% of likely voters said they approved of how Newsom is handling his job. Only 4 in 10 likely voters said they would vote to remove him in a recall, while 56% said they would vote no and 5% are unsure. The California governor has said that he is working as hard as he can to get children back into the classroom, and Californians back to work, while balancing the lingering safety concerns about the virus. He and his team have framed the recall as an effort by Trump supporters and right-wing extremists to wrest control of the government from progressives. \u201cIt is what it is. This is a Republican recall,\u201d Newsom said in an exclusive interview with CNN before the latest signature tally. \u201cAn RNC-backed Republican recall of White supremacists, anti-Semites and people who are opposed to immigration and immigrants is an accurate assessment of who\u2019s behind this recall.\u201d After the announcement, Newsom tweeted an ad on Monday tying recall proponents to extreme Trump supporters and calling it a \u201cpower grab.\u201d \u201cThis Republican recall threatens our values and seeks to undo the important progress we\u2019ve made \u2013 from fighting COVID, to helping struggling families, protecting our environment, and passing commonsense gun violence solutions,\u201d Newsom tweeted. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d Orrin Heatlie, who led the grassroots effort to gather the signatures to recall Newsom, hailed the critical milestone by noting how many people had predicted the effort would fail when it started. \u201cThe People of California have done what the politicians thought would be impossible,\u201d said Heatlie, a retired Yolo County sheriff\u2019s office sergeant and founder of the California Patriot Coalition (who filed the petition with 124 others). \u201cOur work is just beginning.\u201d There are still a number of bureaucratic steps that state officials must take before the recall is officially announced \u2013 and before Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis can set a date for the question to appear before voters on a ballot. Then potential candidates vying to replace Newsom can officially file paperwork to get into the race. For the recall to qualify, Newsom\u2019s opponents were required to gather more than 1,495,709 valid signatures from Californians by March \u2013 the equivalent of 12% of the vote in the last election for governor \u2013 and they ultimately submitted more than 2 million to give themselves a cushion for duplicates. On Monday, the secretary of state\u2019s office put out a new report showing that county officials have now verified at least 1,626,042 signatures as valid \u2013 signifying that recall proponents had crossed the critical threshold. Still, county registrars have until April 29 to continue verifying the signatures and report their final tallies to the secretary of state. After that, any voter who signed the recall petition will have 30 days to reconsider their support and withdraw their signature. State officials will then complete a second verification process to make sure there are still enough signatures to qualify. \u201cThis now triggers the next phase of the recall process, a 30-business-day period in which voters may submit written requests to county Registrars of Voters to remove their names from the recall petition,\u201d California Secretary of State Dr. Shirley N. Weber said in a statement Monday. \u201cA recall election will be held unless a sufficient number of signatures are withdrawn.\u201d Weber was recently appointed secretary of state by Newsom, who had to fill the vacancy left when he sent Alex Padilla to Washington to replace Vice President Kamala Harris as California\u2019s junior senator. Several Republicans have already announced their intentions to challenge Newsom, including businessman John Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and former Olympian and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner. Now that recall proponents have officially crossed the threshold to qualify, the floodgates will open for dozens of additional candidates who want to raise their profiles by running to replace Newsom. The state\u2019s voters will be asked two questions on the recall ballot. First, do they want to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on recalling Newsom, who was elected in 2018 with nearly 62% of the vote. The second question will ask which candidate they would like to replace Newsom, and they will choose from what is likely to be a very long list of names (candidates from different parties will appear on that same list). By law, Newsom is not permitted to add his name to the ballot as an option. When then-California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, was recalled in 2003, more than 125 candidates \u2013 including Davis\u2019 eventual replacement, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 leapt into the race, creating a circus-like political environment for months. California Republicans, who are outnumbered by Democrats by nearly 2 to 1 in the Golden State, welcomed the prospect of a fierce campaign ahead on Monday, predicting that the recall would be supported by voters \u201cacross political parties and a range of diverse constituencies.\u201d California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson accused Newsom of \u201ckeeping children out of school by not standing up to teachers\u2019 unions\u201d and faulted him for dining at the famed restaurant French Laundry at a time when he was urging Californians to stay home and avoid gatherings with families beyond their own households \u2013 an act of hypocrisy for which he has profusely apologized. \u201cVoters signed recall petitions because California is on the wrong track, and we deserve better than the failures of this incompetent governor,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional details Monday.",

            "article_content": "Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory acknowledged reality in 2020: former President Donald Trump lost. He then explained why \u2013 and objected to Trump\u2019s baseless effort in Congress to overturn the election. Now a candidate for Senate, McCrory is facing the same threat as other Republicans in key races: a primary against challengers who vigorously defended Trump\u2019s actions in the runup to the January 6 insurrection and backed Trump\u2019s Big Lie that he actually won reelection. It\u2019s a dynamic that is consistent in races across the country \u2013 whether it\u2019s Trump defender Mo Brooks\u2019 Senate bid in Alabama or Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski\u2019s reelection effort after repudiating the then-President\u2019s role in the deadly Capitol Hill riot. Candidates like Brooks who aligned with Trump\u2019s endeavor to subvert the will of the electorate \u2013 and continue to do so \u2013 are likelier to win over his coveted endorsement that could set them apart from their GOP primary foes. Trump supporters could be incited to future violence by his continued promotion of 2020 election lies, DOJ and judges say And in the high-stakes North Carolina primary, McCrory is trying to reconcile his criticism of Trump from his radio program, telling CNN he backed \u201calmost all\u201d of the former President\u2019s policies, supported his reelection effort and opposed both times Trump was impeached by the House, including on a charge of inciting the Capitol insurrection. Yet since Election Day, McCrory has at times offered unsparing criticism of Trump in candid comments on his radio program, according to a CNN review of his remarks. McCrory dismissed that there was \u201csomething devious\u201d leading to President Joe Biden winning the race, saying that Trump\u2019s name-calling, \u201cdisastrous\u201d first debate performance and personality cost him the election, turning off \u201csoccer moms\u201d in the suburbs. He said the then-President\u2019s legal team \u201cfailed miserably,\u201d saying it was Trump\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d for bringing them on board \u2013 and said his pressure campaign on Georgia officials to find enough votes to reverse Biden\u2019s win raised \u201csome possible legal issues.\u201d At one point, McCrory compared Trump to 2018 Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams for not accepting defeat, saying they were both \u201cdestroying democracy.\u201d \u201cI tell you I lost the election about every day,\u201d said McCrory on November 23, referring to his concession in 2016 after his campaign alleged voter fraud and requested a recount. \u201cStacey Abrams says she won the election, she was robbed of the election. I never say that. Stacey Abrams is getting a free ride by the national media because she\u2019s doing the exact same thing Donald Trump is doing: destroying democracy.\u201d Asked about the comments, McCrory instead stressed his allegiance with Trump, noting that he supported the then-President\u2019s reelection effort \u2013 and was aligned with virtually all of the Trump agenda, except massive deficit spending. He said that the second impeachment shouldn\u2019t have happened because it was the rioters, rather than Trump, who were culpable for the attack in January on the Capitol. McCrory said he\u2019d welcome Trump\u2019s endorsement and would support him again if he were the 2024 GOP presidential nominee. And he said that 95% of his comments in media appearances have been favorable to the former president. \u201cDuring the past four years, on both the radio and on \u2018Meet the Press,\u2019 I was a huge defender \u2013 and continue to be a huge defender \u2013 of Trump policies,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cYou could have pulled out hours upon hours of shows where I\u2019m a very strong defender of his tax cuts, of his immigration policy, of his trade policies.\u201d North Carolina emerges as battleground for post-Trump GOP \u201cI will continue to fight for those policies as North Carolina\u2019s next US senator,\u201d he added. \u201cTrump policies trump everything because they were right.\u201d McCrory is currently viewed as the front-runner in the North Carolina Senate primary against former Rep. Mark Walker and other Republicans. But GOP Rep. Ted Budd is expected to join the race, and Lara Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, has not yet ruled out a campaign. Walker has sensed an opening in McCrory\u2019s criticism of Trump, who won the state both in 2016 and 2020. \u201cOne day he\u2019s all about pro-Trump; the next day he\u2019s taking a personal shot,\u201d Walker told CNN. While Walker did not say that Trump won the race, he said there were \u201cproblems with the election,\u201d and there were over the past four years \u201csome disingenuous behavior that has undermined the sanctity of the election ballot.\u201d And Budd, who voted to throw out the electoral results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, just hours after the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and signed onto a Texas lawsuit seeking to discard millions of votes across key battleground states, would likely hammer the former governor over those comments if he entered the race. Jonathan Felts, Budd\u2019s political adviser, said that there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the former governor and ex-president that the congressman could exploit. \u201cGiven President Trump\u2019s continued popularity in North Carolina, McCrory\u2019s disconnect with Trump and Trump voters will be a significant problem for him in this primary,\u201d Felts said. But McCrory defended Congress\u2019 certification of Trump\u2019s loss because the \u201cconservative standpoint,\u201d he argued, is that states, rather than the federal government, are responsible for their elections. The Trump litmus test isn\u2019t unique to North Carolina. In Alabama, Brooks won the Trump endorsement in large part because he was a leader of the failed effort to overturn the election in Congress, even speaking in inflammatory terms to the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that preceded the riot. Brooks, in an interview last week, continued to defend his remarks at the rally where he said: \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d \u201cThe only thing I asked anyone to do at the United States Capitol was to chant the words U-S-A,\u2019\u201d Brooks insisted, claiming his remarks referred to the 2022 midterms. Nevertheless, his staunch defense of Trump\u2019s election conspiracies has made him a clear favorite in the race, even though the former President\u2019s one-time ambassador to Slovenia, Lynda Blanchard, is running, and other candidates are considering campaigns as well. Controversial congressman could emerge as favorite in Alabama Senate race despite inflammatory remarks In March, Trump threw his support behind a long-time friend, football great and Texas resident Herschel Walker, to run for Senate in Georgia, a few months after Walker tweeted a video backing the former President\u2019s efforts to overturn his election loss. Trump responded then: \u201cHerschel is speaking the truth!\u201d Trump is also getting behind Rep. Jody Hice for Georgia Secretary of State over Republican incumbent Brad Raffensperger, who enraged Trump by certifying Biden\u2019s victory there. Some candidates eager to receive the ex-president\u2019s endorsement are declining to call out Trump on his election claims. In Alaska, Murkowski\u2019s Republican challenger Kelly Tshibaka questioned the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s win in a recent interview with CNN. When asked whether she agreed with Trump that he won, Tshibaka responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t know the outcome of the 2020 election.\u201d In North Carolina, Republicans are bracing for a brutal primary fight \u2013 and are awaiting a decision by Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara, on whether she\u2019ll run for the seat caused by the retirement of GOP Sen. Richard Burr. McCrory though has a number of advantages in the Senate GOP primary. The former one-time governor, who narrowly lost his reelection bid in 2016, is the only candidate to win statewide and is the best-known Republican in the race. He told CNN that besides supporting the \u201cTrump policies\u201d on immigration, taxes, trade and foreign policy, he\u2019d place a \u201cspecial emphasis\u201d on infrastructure, mental health and drug addiction, while bashing Biden and the Democrats for \u201cspending money like drunken sailors.\u201d The former governor\u2019s fight over North Carolina\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which required people at government-run facilities to use the bathrooms that corresponded to the sexes on their birth certificates, could also help him connect with some GOP primary voters, although it caused a major backlash among corporations and LGBT groups. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 In the interview, McCrory emphasized his experience as mayor of Charlotte and governor to make the pitch that he\u2019s an outsider to Washington, DC \u2013 an indirect shot at Walker and Budd. \u201cI want to put a focus on our deficit and spending, and look for more efficiencies which, frankly, the Washington insiders have forgotten about,\u201d said McCrory. The primary race, however, could turn on loyalty to Trump, even though no Republican candidate has aligned with him 100% of the time. Walker himself noted that he didn\u2019t approve of every Trump tweet \u201cor sometimes the personality.\u201d Budd first supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2016 presidential primary before supporting Trump, and occasionally opposed the GOP president, including on increasing the stimulus checks in December to $2,000 per person. But both Walker and Budd supported the Texas lawsuit contesting Biden\u2019s victory, which the Supreme Court threw out, ruling that the Lone Star state didn\u2019t have standing to challenge the results of others. Then, on January 7, Budd said he supported challenging the certification of the election after the pro-Trump attack on the Capitol because he \u201cresolved to not let a violent mob stop me from giving voice to the thousands of North Carolinians who demanded a debate on the irregularities and Constitutional violations in the presidential election.\u201d \u201cGoing through the constitutional process of debate was never about overturning an election, it was about standing up for the integrity of each and every citizen\u2019s vote,\u201d he added. Walker, a pastor, has already obtained the support of some social conservatives, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. While he views himself as a \u201cbridge builder,\u201d he is also clearly aligning himself with the former President. When McCrory jumped in the race, Walker said that he was the \u201cmost conservative and pro-Trump\u201d member of Congress from North Carolina, and noted that while McCrory had won his governor\u2019s race in 2012, he also had lost gubernatorial campaigns in 2008 and 2016. But Walker only raised $209,000 in the first quarter of the year \u2014 after raising close to $370,000 in December \u2014 and has earned the ire of North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Tillis told CNN that McCrory has \u201cgood name ID\u201d and a \u201cgenerally good reputation\u201d from his time in office. He called Budd a \u201cvery confident\u201d friend whose candidacy would make it a \u201ccompetitive race.\u201d But he had no such kind words for Walker. \u201cI have no support for Mark Walker,\u201d Tillis told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s right for the job.\u201d \u201cYou look at his body of work. There\u2019s not a lot to rely on,\u201d he added. Walker responded that McCrory had hired Tillis\u2019 political strategists and that the senator is \u201cstill aggravated\u201d that he and Trump met on a couple occasions to discuss running against him last year. But then, Walker said, he spent time working to reelect Tillis in 2020 to make sure the Republican won. \u201cWe\u2019re no stranger to taking on the establishment, whether it\u2019s Thom Tillis or others,\u201d Walker added. \u201cI\u2019ll match my body of work with Thom Tillis\u2019 body of work any day of the week in the six years that we served [in Congress].\u201d In an interview last week, Burr said that he didn\u2019t expect Lara Trump to run after she signed a contract this year to be a paid on-air contributor to Fox News. He said McCrory is viewed favorably by North Carolina Republicans and was \u201cfairly confident\u201d that the former governor would be a \u201cvery competitive candidate.\u201d He also dismissed Walker\u2019s anemic fundraising quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna get you a Senate race,\u201d Burr said.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The US Census Bureau on Monday announced the winners and losers of the decennial US population count, which you\u2019ve probably already heard about for the obstacles that got in the way of the 2020 edition. (The short version: the Trump administration tried to game it and Covid delayed it.) The results will determine which states gain and lose seats in the House of Representatives \u2013 and, as a result, which states gain or lose Electoral College votes, which are allocated based on the number of congressional representatives each state has. Here\u2019s what we learned about who lives in the US right now and where they are: The US population is growing, but more slowly. As of April 1, 2021, there are 331,449,281 people living in the United States. That\u2019s an increase of 7.4% since 2010, the second slowest growth rate in history, just barely behind the 1940 census after the Great Depression. Read CNN\u2019s full report here. The South is booming. Most of the country continues to grow, but the South is growing fastest \u2013 more than 10% since 2010, followed by the Mountain West, the Northeast and the Midwest. Three states saw negative growth. West Virginia, Illinois and Mississippi all lost population. So did Puerto Rico, which is not a state but has a population of more than 3.2 million Americans. The balance of power will change in Congress in 2022. Seven of the 435 seats in Congress will be reallocated in 2021. Texas gains two seats, while Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Montana and Oregon each gain one. California, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois each lose a seat. The balance of power in the Electoral College will change in 2024. Each state that gains or loses a congressional seat also gains or loses an Electoral College vote. Five of the seven new Electoral College votes will go to states won by former President Donald Trump in 2020. Five of the seven votes are leaving states won by President Joe Biden. However, four of the states gaining seats are likely to be competitive in the next presidential election. Three of the states losing seats are also competitive. Every person counts. The margin between losing a seat and not \u2013 hugely consequential \u2013 is based on complicated math, but can be incredibly slim. The Census bureau suggested a difference of just 89 people meant that New York lost a congressional seat instead of Minnesota. What are the most and least populous states? California, with more than 39 million residents, is still by far the most populous state. With 52 representatives in Congress, it will have 761,091 people per representative, which is close to the average. Wyoming is the least populous state, with just 576,000 residents. The country is getting more crowded. Congress is staying the same. In 1960, the first Census for which there were 50 states, there were about 410,481 people in the US per congressperson. That number will have doubled in the decades to come. See the growth at the Census site. This data is late and likely affected by Covid. The pandemic disrupted the Census just like it disrupted everything else. Most Americans filled out census forms online but the Census workers tasked with going door to door to fill in the gaps had to delay their work because of the pandemic.. This data is part of the fight over citizenship and immigration. The Trump administration tried very hard to include a question about citizenship on the Census form. The concern among many data scientists and Democrats was that the question \u2013 asking people for their citizenship status \u2013 might scare non-citizens from taking part, thus depleting the count. The Supreme Court ultimately killed the citizenship question, but the fight politicized the Census process in a new way. Later, Trump tried to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment data used by the Census bureau, but the President Joe Biden undid that order. There have been political fights over the Census in the past. There was no reapportionment in 1920 because Congress couldn\u2019t agree on how to split up seats without expanding the size of Congress. Nine years later, they passed the Reapportionment Act of 1929, which capped the size of Congress at 435. Why do we do the Census anyway? The Constitution. Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution originally stipulated the number of people per representative \u201cshall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand.\u201d That had to change. And so did the people who were counted as part of the Census. Originally, it read, horribly, that the number of people in the states, \u201cshall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons\u2026\u201d The 14th Amendment forced the government to count everyone as a whole person. What happens next? More data, then redrawing congressional lines. This is only the first data drop from the Census. More detailed data, including demographics, will be released by September 30. It\u2019s that more detailed data that state legislatures or independent commissions will use to re-draw congressional lines within states. This is a highly political task that some states have tried to depoliticize by placing with nonpartisan commissions. Others, however, are nakedly partisan. While the Supreme Court has outlawed the drawing of congressional lines around racial data, they have given the green light to draw lines for political reasons. That means Republicans in Texas, for instance, will cram as many Democrats as possible into as few districts as possible, both at the state and federal level. Democrats will do the same thing in states they control. But Republicans, objectively, have been more successful at gerrymandering. The political drawing of congressional districts is a key reason they retained control of the House in 2012. It\u2019s a large reason they retained control of many state legislatures in 2020. Multiple states have created nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to draw congressional lines and they have been shown to yield more competitive congressional races. The Brennan Center for Justice has a roundup of each state\u2019s system. Other states, like Florida, have legislature-approved districts, but there are curbs on gerrymandering written into state law. Congress could vote to end the practice of gerrymandering. Democrats in the House have endorsed a plan to create independent commissions in every state. But it does not currently have the supermajority needed to cut off debate in the Senate.",

            "article_content": "Democratic state Sen. Troy Carter will win the special election runoff for Louisiana\u2019s vacant US House seat, CNN projects, capturing the state\u2019s only Democrat-held seat in Congress. Carter, a former New Orleans city council member, ran as the more moderate candidate in the runoff and as someone willing to work across the aisle. His win over fellow state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson (no relation) draws Louisiana\u2019s intraparty contest to a close. \u201cThis was a hard fought race, and now it is time to come together,\u201d the congressman-elect wrote in a tweet on Sunday. \u201cThe hard part starts now. We have so much work to do together. We celebrated upon victory. Today, we get back to work!\u201d While the election doesn\u2019t alter the balance of power in the House, it does fill a seat that\u2019s been vacant for months, giving Democrats \u2013 who enjoy a narrow majority \u2013 slightly more breathing room. The race in Louisiana\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, a majority-Black district that stretches from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, also stood as an early test of the direction of the Democratic Party three months into President Joe Biden\u2019s term. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Crucially, Carter earned the early endorsement of the man whose seat he\u2019ll be filling, former Rep. Cedric Richmond, who had resigned his seat in January to join the Biden White House. Carter was also more comfortable embracing the establishment banner, casting himself as an effective legislator and touting his endorsements from Richmond, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, Louisiana teachers\u2019 unions and the Greater New Orleans AFL-CIO. Peterson, a fellow Democrat and state senator, ran on a more progressive platform, campaigning on priorities that included working to cancel student loan debt, divesting from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and decriminalizing sex work. She also said she wanted to work to deschedule marijuana on the federal level and touted her support for the Green New Deal. The policy differences between the two candidates were on full display during a debate last week in which they discussed policing in America, with Peterson calling for \u201ccomprehensive criminal justice reform\u201d that involves a \u201creinvestment in the criminal justice system\u201d and an investment in \u201ccommunity policing.\u201d Carter, meanwhile, said he would \u201csmart fund, not defund\u201d the police, adding: \u201cWe should make sure that we stand with the good police officers while we prosecute the bad ones.\u201d Peterson\u2019s defeat marks an early loss for the progressive wing of the party ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats may get a clearer idea of which direction the party at large will move in the Biden era. Carter will be the only Democrat representing the Bayou State in Congress. The state\u2019s other five representatives and two senators are all Republicans. Besides choosing between two divergent approaches to politics, voters in the district were also deciding how much gender was a factor. Peterson, who had the endorsement of EMILY\u2019s List \u2013 which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights \u2013 would have been the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress. Following Saturday\u2019s election results, Peterson said, \u201cI\u2019m honored by the faith that so many put in me because they believe in the future of this district and what we can accomplish together.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wishing Sen. Carter well as he represents Louisiana in Washington, and I will keep fighting every day for our communities, our people, and the change we need,\u201d she continued in a statement. The race was the latest chapter in a political rivalry that has brewed for decades \u2013 and one that includes facing each other in a previous congressional election. In 2006, both Carter and Peterson ran against then-Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat who at the time was under investigation for corruption and would later be convicted. Peterson finished second in the primary and Carter a distant fifth. In Louisiana, the top-two primary finishers advance to a runoff. Peterson lost to Jefferson in the general election.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The guilty verdicts for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd felt like an important moment, creating momentum to change the way police interact with Black Americans. The specific nature of that progress, however, is very much yet to be determined, particularly on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans are actually working together to find a compromise piece of legislation. Hopes rise for a police reform compromise, but huge political hurdles loom What Matters turned to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean, who covers Congress, to get her front-row assessment of what\u2019s been proposed, what a compromise could look like, what it would actually accomplish and whether any issue can get Democrats and Republicans to vote for the same thing. Her emailed thoughts are below: WHAT MATTERS: Police are governed at the local level, but the killing of Black Americans by police officers is a national crisis. What exactly would the current legislative proposals do to address this problem? DEAN: In short, lawmakers are still trying to figure out exactly what the final legislation would look like. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed the House back in March. That bill bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants and eliminates qualified immunity. It would also set up a national registry of police misconduct to stop officers from moving from place to place. And it would ban racial and religious profiling by law enforcement at the federal, state and local level. But in order to pass in the Senate, there will have to be changes made to this bill. Which gets us to our next question \u2026 WHAT MATTERS: The House passed the George Floyd Act, but it would take 10 Republican senators to overcome a filibuster. Is there any indication 10 Republican senators could support a police reform bill? DEAN: Yes, and here\u2019s why. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the lead Senate Republican taking part in these talks, has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Scott also holds a lot of sway with his fellow Republican members on this issue. One source told me he\u2019s been reaching out to other Republican senators and they have been \u201csupportive.\u201d McConnell told me \u201cof course\u201d he was supportive of Scott\u2019s efforts. So, it\u2019s possible. Related: GOP senator floats compromise on policing legislation WHAT MATTERS: A key issue dividing lawmakers is \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d What is it and is there any room for compromise? DEAN: Qualified immunity is a legal defense used in civil cases that critics say shields officers from accountability and defenders argue protects officers\u2019 ability to make quick decisions in dangerous situations. This issue is a key sticking point. Sen. Scott has proposed a compromise which would allow police departments or employers to be sued but not the individual officer. Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the House bill and is another key player in the discussions with Scott and the Senate, told me yesterday officers and departments should both be held accountable. So they\u2019re still not on the same page there. WHAT MATTERS: Floyd was suffocated to death. Daunte Wright was shot. Would anything in these bills have been able to stop those deaths? If not, what do supporters say federal legislation would accomplish? DEAN: Again we have to wait to see exactly what is in the final legislation. But Scott and Bass, along with Sen. Cory Booker, the lead Senate Democrat in these talks, all agree policing needs to be overhauled in this country. And they all say lives will be saved as a result. The specific elements might not address each of the instances of police violence we\u2019ve seen, but they would certainly change policing in the US. Aside from qualified immunity, the key areas in the House bill include: WHAT MATTERS: Republicans signed on to sentencing reform under pressure from former President Donald Trump. What pressure could be applied on them today? DEAN: A number of Senate Republicans have said they\u2019re open to supporting legislation overhauling policing. There is no question the events of the past year, and even the past few weeks and months, have created a sense of urgency which is not something we see that often in the Senate. It\u2019s also not an election year so people may be willing to truly negotiate. It all comes down to what Scott, Booker and Bass hammer out. What is a palatable compromise to all parties that can get 60 votes? WHAT MATTERS: The story is similar on a number of issues \u2013 climate change, infrastructure, immigration, gun control, voting rights. Does it seem right now like there could be breakthroughs on any of these? DEAN: We wrote a story on this very question because at this point to get almost any of that done, you need 60 votes in the Senate, which demands bipartisan support. And it\u2019s no secret that\u2019s a tall order right now. Democrats can use reconciliation to pass infrastructure without any Republican support and that may be the route they take. But on things like gun control or voting rights, there is going to have to be compromise to get to 60, which means everyone is giving up something to get a deal done. It\u2019s a very steep uphill climb.",

            "article_content": "On Monday night, former President Donald Trump sat down with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity for his first on-camera interview since leaving the White House in January. I use the word \u201cinterview\u201d lightly here because what Hannity did in his capacity as a \u201cjournalist\u201d was something short of asking tough questions of a public figure. It was more like having a few beers with an old friend who you were hoping might help you get a job one day. I went through the transcript \u2013 you\u2019re welcome in advance! \u2013 and pulled out the best(?) lines. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cWell, we\u2019re seeing a lot of people. We\u2019re seeing a lot of good Republicans and a lot of good Americans, in some cases, great Americans. And we are working very hard.\u201d What was the question from Hannity that elicited this response? \u201cYou were working as hard as you did when you were in the White House, except you play a little golf more, that you\u2019re keeping an insane schedule, seven days a week. You really don\u2019t stop.\u201d And away we go! 2. \u201cYou get impeached for doing nothing wrong. Then you get a second impeachment for doing nothing wrong.\u201d The first impeachment was because Trump asked a foreign power to investigate the son of a political rival and hinted that the country owed him that because of all the aid America provided. The second was because Trump egged on a crowd that went on to stage a violent insurrection at the US Capitol that left five people dead. So, yeah, \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d 3. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re going to see something that will start to take place in \u201922 and will culminate in \u201824.\u201d Well, this sure sounds like Trump is running again, no? 4. \u201cBut I had an instance where on a slippery, slippery ramp, piece of steel, very steep and very long, no railings, no nothing, and it was pouring at West Point. And the last thing I want to do is go down because when Gerald Ford went down, it was not good.\u201d So we\u2019re back on the ramp thing now? 5. \u201cWell, Air Force One is a very big plane. And usually, what they try and do is shield the wind. You know, when they park it you can turn it in angles and so you don\u2019t ever have too much. I\u2019ve never seen too much wind.\u201d \u2026\u2026 6. \u201cNobody was tougher on Russia. And frankly, getting along with Vladimir Putin is a good thing. And I got along with him very well.\u201d \u201cTrump sides with Putin over US intelligence\u201d \u2013 July 16, 2018 7. \u201cSo now something\u2019s going on with Taiwan. Something maybe is going on with Ukraine. This never was a big subject when I was president.\u201d Something\u2019s happening here. What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear \u2026 THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 8. \u201cI have a great relationship with a certain man that\u2019s got great power over North Korea.\u201d Who could it be? This game is fun! 9. \u201cThe Russian hoax was very, very bad for the relationship that we would have with Russia.\u201d So, uh, it wasn\u2019t a hoax. Like, at all. 10. \u201cThe wall, getting the wall built and the wall we \u2013 we\u2019re up to almost 500 miles and completing it was very easy.\u201d Know what wasn\u2019t easy? Getting Mexico to pay for it. Which they didn\u2019t. 11. \u201cThe wall is imperative. All of the things that go with the wall, the technology that goes into the wall and with the wall is so imperative.\u201d So, if I am reading this right, the wall \u2013 I think \u2013 is imperative? 12. \u201cOne other thing, they\u2019re sending us not their best people. They are sending us people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers, and really bad \u2013 rapists, really bad people.\u201d Yes, Trump really said this about Mexico. And yes, it is almost exactly what he said in his announcement speech for president in 2015, which went like this: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d This time around, Trump didn\u2019t add the \u201cgood people\u201d part, though. 13. \u201cVery simple, more liberty, more freedom, of belief in the Constitution, lower taxes, less bureaucracy, constitutionalists on the bench. You want secure borders, legal immigration, energy independence. You believe in law and order, safety and security for every American. Simple stuff. School choice.\u201d This word salad is Trump\u2019s answer to what the \u201cTrump agenda\u201d for the future looks like. Very reassuring! 14. \u201cSo many different things that \u2013 look, we got 75 million votes. It\u2019s more than any sitting president in history by far.\u201d OK, this is the actual transition Trump made. He was talking (and talking) about the Trump agenda and then \u2013 whammo! \u2013 right into the whole thing about how many votes he got in 2020. Super normal! 15. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know, Sean, usually in a second term a president gets less votes. I got 12 million more. It\u2019s the biggest that\u2019s ever happened in history, from 63 to 75. Never happened before. And all of these things are good.\u201d I, just, uh, I have no idea what to say here. I will say that I, too, like good things. 16. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if Joe knows what\u2019s going on with it, because I think you have a cabal, you have a group of people that are sitting around a table just saying do this, do this, do this. They\u2019re giving him these things to sign. It\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d OK, so there is a \u201ccabal\u201d of people just giving a clueless President Biden \u201cthings to sign?\u201d That IS hard to believe! 17. \u201cWe were supposed to lose 25 seats. I got involved. I called 56 different districts. And we ended up picking up 16 instead of losing 25.\u201d Uh, it\u2019s not that simple. 18.  \u201cLisa Murkowski is a disaster. I mean, she\u2019s a total disaster.\u201d \u2026 said the former REPUBLICAN President of the United States. 19. \u201cAnd I was making calls getting congressmen elected.\u201d Tell me more about these magical calls \u2026 20. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cQuarterly Gap in Party Affiliation Largest Since 2012\u201d \u2013 Gallup, April 7, 2021 21. \u201cBut I\u2019m at 128 and two when I endorse people, 128 and two.\u201d But who\u2019s counting?! 22. \u201cYou know, I cut taxes more than any president\u2019s ever cut taxes.\u201d For the BILLIONTH time: He did not. 23. \u201cWe did a great job. We got very little credit for the great job we\u2019ve done.\u201d Donald Trump on his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yes, really. 24. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a little breaking news. Pfizer is in with the FDA. And what the FDA did with Johnson & Johnson is so stupid.\u201d [\u201cBREAKING NEWS\u201d banner] \u201cPfizer is in with the FDA.\u201d And, no, I have no idea what he is talking about either. 25. \u201cI said, they want me to do a commercial, some commercial. And they do this pause.\u201d Trump seems to be suggesting here that \u201cthey\u201d (the Biden administration? the FDA?) wanted him to film a commercial telling people to make sure to get the Covid-19 vaccine, but he said no because the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused? Or something? 26. \u201cYou know, I can be liked by everybody. But I won\u2019t be doing a good job.\u201d Important note: Trump is no longer president. 27. \u201cI think it\u2019s very suspect is what they did with Johnson & Johnson, because the only people that are happy about that are Pfizer and Moderna. The only people that are happy about that because what they did is a terrible, terrible thing.\u201d Trump is suggesting \u2013 with zero evidence \u2013 that Pfizer and Moderna are somehow responsible for the pause in the J&J vaccine. Man, this conspiracy goes deeper than I even thought! 28. \u201cI tell you that at least eight senators would have lost their race. I could name them but I don\u2019t want to embarrass them but that includes Mitch, who is heading south.\u201d The idea that Mitch McConnell would have lost without Trump\u2019s support is, candidly, laughable. 29. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very popular in Kentucky. I love Kentucky. And they love me.\u201d \u201cI love lamp.\u201d \u2013 Brick Tamland 30. \u201cLook, almost everybody I endorse wins.\u201d Paging DJ Khaled \u2026 31. \u201cBut you know what, I love doing it because I help people. And I\u2019ve helped them more than any president with the cutting of taxes, with the regulations, with right to try.\u201d Trump on what he loved about the White House. You owe him, America! Bigly. 32. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve added something called Space Force. It\u2019s going to be so powerful, so important.\u201d Mars Awaits! 33. \u201cI got tremendous numbers. Nobody has ever gotten the numbers I got. No sitting president has come even close. There\u2019s more popularity now than there was the day before the election because they see how bad things are at the border.\u201d This is Trump\u2019s answer to whether he is running again in 2024. I like this as his slogan for that race: \u201cI got tremendous numbers. Nobody has ever gotten the numbers I got.\u201d It could work! 34. \u201cI got along great with President Putin. I liked him. He liked me.

            "article_content": "What started as a polite discussion about small business soon turned into a heated confrontation between unusual opponents \u2013 Republican members of the House and their party\u2019s old friends at the US Chamber of Commerce. Republican lawmakers were blunt with the Chamber\u2019s lobbyist, Tom Sullivan, calling him on the carpet about the organization\u2019s decision to endorse so many Democrats in the 2020 election, including 23 House freshmen in competitive districts. Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican from New York, was particularly upset the Chamber backed a Democrat against her. Recalling the encounter to CNN last week, Tenney said she asked Sullivan, \u201cWhy did you endorse someone who is against all the policies, who\u2019s, like, voted for everything in New York that really was not really good for business, but was good for the trial bar, and it exposed many of us to liability?\u201d Sullivan handled it graciously, Tenney said, and didn\u2019t seem surprised by the round of complaints. \u201cHe said \u2018I kind of knew I was gonna get this,\u2019\u201d she said of the February meeting of Republican members of the House Small Business Committee. For the Chamber, the dustup was another sobering reminder that their longtime ally, the Republican Party, is growing more populist by the year \u2013 and many of its members now view the business groups with suspicion. For years there was cooperation between the party and the Chamber, blocking the Democratic policy agenda and electing Republicans during the Obama years. (The US Chamber is a lobbying organization funded by its members, from large corporations like 3M and Microsoft to small businesses. It is distinct from state and local chambers, some of which are members of the national Chamber). But the fruitful partnership has been upended by shifts in both the political platform of the GOP and the more progressive social priorities for corporate America. As some Republicans embrace populism and economic paternalism typified by former President Donald Trump, groups like the Chamber are finding their member companies are less eager to follow the GOP\u2019s trajectory. Biden: It's 'reassuring' to see companies speaking up about restrictive voting laws For that, many Republicans privately argue that the one-time powerful lobby has lost its focus and can no longer be trusted as a pillar of the GOP coalition. The Chamber, meanwhile, insists its purpose \u2013 advocacy for its members and for free enterprise \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed, even if the Republican Party has. \u201cThe Chamber\u2019s north star is and always has been to create American jobs, stimulate economic growth, and help businesses work on solving the nation\u2019s most important challenges,\u201d said a spokesman in a statement provided for this story. \u201cThe Chamber is committed to supporting pro-free enterprise, pro-business, pro-governing members of Congress from any party.\u201d The fallout has been felt between the GOP leaders of Congress \u2013 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2013 who have scoffed at their courtship of Democrats and questioned the organization\u2019s focus on issues in which they once aligned. The gulf has only intensified over the weeks-long fight over voting rights in the United States, with GOP leaders lambasting major corporations for boycotting Georgia amid the Republican push to restrict and tighten voting access in the state. Top Republicans believe the business lobby in Washington could have helped make the case that leaving Georgia was the wrong decision. And when it comes to electoral politics, GOP leaders see a sharp drop off from just six years ago when the Chamber was a dominant force in key races to last year when they endorsed vulnerable House Democrats and were a minor player in pivotal Senate races. \u201cWhatever they\u2019re doing \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing it in a visible way in terms of the playing field when it comes to political campaigns,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who faces reelection next year and serves as minority whip. \u201cI know there was a time when they were really active. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case anymore.\u201d \u201cThe Chamber of Commerce filed for divorce years ago, and the GOP has finally accepted it,\u201d said Terry Schilling, the executive director of the American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group. And privately, the assessment is even more harsh. \u201cThe National Chamber of Commerce effectively endorsed Nancy Pelosi for speaker in 2020,\u201d a senior House GOP aide said. The Chamber has hardly abandoned the GOP. Just a few months ago, the organization released a TV ad with the Georgia Chamber of Commerce praising Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler as the two were fighting to win runoff elections and maintain GOP control of the Senate. But the general sense of alienation reflects the widening gulf between the business community and other parts of the Republican Party\u2019s coalition. In addition to the reaction in corporate America to Georgia\u2019s new election law, which saw executives from hundreds of major companies sign a letter denouncing the legislation and several threaten to move business out of the state, there\u2019s been skepticism about big tech firms, criticism of the business community\u2019s support for more expansive immigration laws \u2013 and a sense that major corporations have \u201cgone woke\u201d on political issues that have become articles of faith among Republicans. We're about to see how far CEOs will really go to protect voting rights Republican lawmakers have taken notice and staked out positions contrary to the broader business community\u2019s goals. This year, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mitt Romney of Utah proposed raising the minimum wage, along with mandating that employers enroll in E-Verify to ensure that their workers are legally working. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marco Rubio of Florida and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee introduced a bill to remove the antitrust exemption for Major League Baseball. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has attacked Democratic candidates who\u2019ve accepted corporate PAC money. And last month, Rubio endorsed a push by Amazon workers in Alabama to unionize, citing the online retailer\u2019s supposed \u201cwar against working-class values.\u201d \u201c(T)he days of conservatives being taken for granted by the business community are over,\u201d Rubio wrote in a March op-ed for USA Today. There are signs that the Chamber may be seeking to get back on the same page as the GOP. The group last week came out to oppose the Democrats\u2019 sweeping bill to overhaul election laws. And as Democrats push to boost the corporate tax rate to help pay for a massive infrastructure package, the business community is bound to push back. Yet the Chamber\u2019s own efforts to expand its influence and reflect the broader political views of its member companies on issues like immigration have further alienated the group from Republican lawmakers. The beginnings of the break-up had already begun near the end of former Chamber CEO Tom Donohue\u2019s tenure and have accelerated with the tapping of Suzanne Clark, the first woman to head the business lobby, as his replacement. Republicans say Donohue\u2019s criticisms of Trump\u2019s immigration and trade policies and the Chamber\u2019s cozying up with some Democrats were damaging. The Chamber\u2019s endorsements for those freshman Democrats last year \u2013 eight of which lost narrow races \u2013 sparked more outrage among Republicans. Many GOP House and Senate campaigns are no longer courting the Chamber\u2019s endorsement, a move that began before the 2020 election, after McCarthy said he did not want the group\u2019s support \u201cbecause they have sold out.\u201d Some Washington Republicans say other personnel changes at the Chamber around the time of Clark\u2019s elevation to CEO are cause for concern \u2014 and reflect the lack of relationships that exist now between the business lobby and top GOP lawmakers. Caroline Harris, the Chamber\u2019s top tax lobbyist who was a major force behind the Republican-backed tax overhaul in 2017, left the organization after 14 years, according to an email obtained by CNN. This comes months after the Chamber\u2019s longtime political director, Republican strategist Scott Reed, departed after his contract was terminated. In a statement at the time of his departure, the Chamber claimed Reed had \u201crepeatedly breached confidentiality, distorted facts for his own benefit, withheld information from Chamber leadership and leaked internal information to the press,\u201d prompting his dismissal. Reed declined to comment for this story. The flashpoint between the Republican Party and the business community over voting rights is only the latest example of a growing rift since the heyday of the Barack Obama era, when the US Chamber helped sink progressive legislation to boost unions and tackle climate change, pushed back against the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and aided the party\u2019s takeover of the Senate in 2014. The Chamber has seen its clout on Capitol Hill tested even under Republican administrations, including in the second term of George W. Bush, when the President failed to quell his rightward flank in failing to pass a major bill granting legal status and a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants. But the election of Trump shook the symbiotic relationship. While the Chamber vigorously supported the Republicans\u2019 top legislative priority \u2013 the 2017 tax overhaul bill that lowered the corporate tax rate \u2013 the lobby group saw its influence wane and ultimately decided to reach back out to Democrats. In July 2018, the Chamber released a report bashing the Trump administration during its trade war with China \u201cfor threatening to undermine the economic progress it worked so hard to achieve.\u201d In July 2020, it sued the administration over its \u201cjob-killing immigration restrictions\u201d and expressed its support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in light of the Republican attacks to dismantle it. The Business Roundtable, a rival association made up of chief executive officers, has also been in line with some Democratic priorities in recent years. In 2019, the group reversed its decades-long view that corporations exist principally to serve shareholders, announcing that companies have \u201ca fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,\u201d including customers, employees and their communities. Over the next two years, it urged politicians to pass gun control and police reform legislation. The rupture between the GOP and the business community came in September, after the Chamber endorsed 23 freshman Democrats in some of the tightest House districts and indicated it would try to repair bridges to Senate Democrats. \u201cPlainly, they were hedging their bets,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of Senate GOP leadership, said of the chamber\u2019s endorsements of Democrats. \u201cBut you know I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to like a 28% tax rate and have all their members who make over $400,000 a year paying a lot more taxes. I guess, it just seems like it\u2019s not very well thought through.\u201d And some Republican strategists say the party no longer needs its traditional allies in the business community. Back in 2014, Reed and the US Chamber were deeply involved in promoting Republicans who could win Senate seats after some tea party Senate candidates lost in 2012. The Chamber\u2019s outside group spent more than $35 million \u2014 the seventh highest-spender out of the 263 outside groups tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. But the Chamber then decided to take a step back from elections, even as it remained the biggest business lobbying group. In 2020, it spent about $5.7 million \u2014 the 67th of 657 outside spenders. A GOP strategist told CNN that the latest fundraising numbers show that Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t need to rely on businesses\u201d to bankroll their campaigns. Infrastructure negotiations: 4 things to watch on Capitol Hill In the first quarter, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it raised a record-breaking $33.7 million, even as many major corporations said they would pause donations to the 139 House Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. McCarthy, one of those members, raised an astonishing $27.1 million \u2014 and less than 2% came from corporate PACs, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal, however, found that PACs for companies gave $1.3 million in the first quarter to the 147 Republican objectors, down about 80% from the $6.7 million donated to those members of Congress in the first quarter 2019. In the Biden era, the Chamber, Business Roundtable and major corporations have made moves further distancing themselves from Republicans out of power in Washington. The Chamber of Commerce has supported aspects of President Joe Biden\u2019s first two legislative priorities \u2014 the $1.9 trillion plan to Covid relief bill and the multi-trillion dollar infrastructure plan, although it strongly opposes how it plans to pay for the latter by increasing the corporate tax rate. It backed Neera Tanden for Office of Management and Budget director, the former head of the liberal Center of American Progress who had sharply criticized Senate Republicans. And it has expressed an openness to raising the minimum wage, although not to $15 an hour. Meanwhile, the Business Roundtable has supported Biden\u2019s decision to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, moves to preserve the DACA program and address climate change.

            "article_content": "Conservative Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is scrapping the planned launch of her \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus after receiving blowback from leaders in her own party, despite confirming through a spokesperson on Friday that the caucus would launch. Nick Dyer, Greene\u2019s spokesperson, told CNN in an email on Saturday afternoon the Georgia Republican is not \u201claunching anything.\u201d \u201cThe Congresswoman wants to make clear that she is not launching anything. This was an early planning proposal and nothing was agreed to or approved,\u201d he said in an email to CNN, referring to a flier promoting the caucus, obtained by Punchbowl News, that used inflammatory rhetoric. He added that \u201cshe didn\u2019t approve that language and has no plans to launch anything.\u201d This is a reversal from Friday, when her office said she would launch the caucus \u201cvery soon.\u201d Marjorie Taylor Greene launching 'America First' caucus pushing for 'Anglo-Saxon political tradition' \u201cBe on the look out for the release of the America First Caucus platform when it\u2019s announced to the public very soon,\u201d Dyer said in a statement to CNN Friday. Greene in a series of tweets Saturday afternoon also claimed that the staff-level draft proposal of her \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus is \u201cfrom an outside group that I hadn\u2019t read.\u201d She also accused the media of creating \u201cfalse narratives\u201d and focusing on race to \u201cdivide the American people with hate through identity politics.\u201d Greene suggested in her tweets she plans to move forward with advocating for former President Donald Trump\u2019s America First agenda. The flier promoting the new caucus calls for a \u201ccommon respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions\u201d and pushes a series of conspiracy theories about election integrity. The flier also outlined a nativist argument warning that \u201cmass immigration\u201d poses a threat to \u201cthe long-term existential future of America as a unique country with a unique culture and a unique identity.\u201d Congressional caucuses are voluntary groups usually made up of lawmakers seeking to advance certain policy agendas. While the groups operate outside of the formal congressional legislative structure, many have found success influencing debate and amplifying their shared policy prescriptions. On Friday, amid news reports of the caucus, Dyer complained about the initial draft of the flier being leaked but confirmed to CNN in a statement that plans were in the works to form the group, which he said would be \u201cannounced to the public very soon.\u201d The reversal from her office comes a day after top House Republican Kevin McCarthy indirectly referenced the congresswoman\u2019s new caucus, tweeting, \u201cThe Republican Party is the party of Lincoln & the party of more opportunity for all Americans\u2014not nativist dog whistles.\u201d And GOP conference chair Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, responded to the reporting about the new caucus from Greene in a tweet. \u201cRepublicans believe in equal opportunity, freedom, and justice for all. We teach our children the values of tolerance, decency and moral courage,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRacism, nativism, and anti-Semitism are evil. History teaches we all have an obligation to confront & reject such malicious hate.\u201d Embattled GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is under federal investigation over allegations involving sex trafficking and prostitution, tweeted Friday, \u201cI\u2019m proud to join @mtgreenee in the #AmericaFirst Caucus. We will end wars, stop illegal immigration & promote trade that is fair to American workers. This is just a hit piece from the America Last crowd in Big Media, Big Tech & Big Government.\u201d Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican, denied his involvement in plans to launch an \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus and wrote in a statement Saturday he will \u201ccontinue to work on America First issues in the House Freedom Caucus.\u201d Punchbowl News had reported Gosar had been involved with the caucus. He claimed on Saturday that he first heard of the flier when he read the report by Punchbowl. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois said that he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d following initial reports of the new caucus, and on Friday said that anyone who joins the caucus should have their committee assignments stripped and be expelled from Republican conference participation. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t prevent someone from calling themselves Republican, we can loudly say they don\u2019t belong to us,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.

            "article_content": "Conservative Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is launching a new \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus, her office confirmed Friday, bringing together a group of far-right lawmakers known for their controversial rhetoric. Punchbowl News obtained a flier promoting the new caucus, which calls for a \u201ccommon respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions\u201d and pushes a series of conspiracy theories about election integrity. The flier also outlined a nativist argument warning that \u201cmass immigration\u201d poses a threat to \u201cthe long-term existential future of America as a unique country with a unique culture and a unique identity.\u201d A spokesperson for Greene, Nick Dyer, complained about the initial draft of the flier being leaked but confirmed to CNN in a statement that plans were in the works to form the group, which will be \u201cannounced to the public very soon.\u201d Dyer on Saturday, however, told CNN in an email that Greene is not \u201claunching anything.\u201d The congresswoman is scrapping the planned launch of her \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus after receiving blow back from leaders in her own party. Embattled GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is under federal investigation over allegations involving sex trafficking and prostitution, tweeted Friday, \u201cI\u2019m proud to join @mtgreenee in the #AmericaFirst Caucus. We will end wars, stop illegal immigration & promote trade that is fair to American workers. This is just a hit piece from the America Last crowd in Big Media, Big Tech & Big Government.\u201d Congressional caucuses are voluntary groups usually made up of lawmakers seeking to advance certain policy agendas. While the groups operate outside of the formal congressional legislative structure, many have found success influencing debate and amplifying their shared policy prescriptions. CNN has reached out to Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas and Rep. Barry Moore of Alabama, whom Punchbowl News reported to be involved in the caucus. A spokesperson for Moore told CNN in a statement, \u201cCongressman Moore wholeheartedly supports President Trump\u2019s America First agenda and policies that prioritize hardworking Americans. He will not agree to join any caucus until he\u2019s had an opportunity to research their platform, which he has not had the chance to do so with the America First Caucus and therefore has not joined.\u201d The lawmakers are known to be on the extreme far-right fringes of the GOP, and their rhetoric is often designed to grab headlines. The rhetoric surrounding protecting the American identity and \u201cuniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions\u201d ties into a toxic argument with a racist legacy that immigrants are \u201creplacing\u201d Americans who were born in the United States. Tucker Carlson sneers at critics as he doubles down on 'replacement theory' remarks Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania evoked a similar argument during a subcommittee hearing earlier this week set to examine why those from Central American countries comprise a disproportionate number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. \u201cFor many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is what appears to them is we\u2019re replacing national-born American \u2014 native-born Americans to permanently transform the political landscape of this very nation,\u201d Perry said. Similar comments were also recently made by Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson, underscoring how certain Republican lawmakers and right-wing media personalities are echoing and thus potentially legitimizing arguments that have been made by White nationalists and nativists for years. The House voted in February to remove Greene, a freshman from Georgia, from her committee assignments after reports of her comments surfaced showing her encouragement of political violence, suggesting that the Parkland, Florida, school shooting was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation and conspiratorial claim that a space laser controlled by Jewish financiers started a California wildfire in 2018. She has tried to make a name for herself being an outsider and a rabble rouser and routinely uses parliamentary procedures to slow down House floor business, much to the dismay of her colleagues. 'An existential threat': The Republicans calling for their party to reject QAnon conspiracy theories But the tactics have helped her win support on the far right, and just this week her campaign announced she had raised $3.2 million in the first three months in office - an astonishing amount for a freshman member. Following news of the new caucus Wednesday, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted, \u201cJust when I was hoping to take a long weekend away from crazy I see this.\u201d \u201cCompletely disgusted,\u201d he said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, tweeted Friday afternoon, \u201cThe Republican Party is the party of Lincoln & the party of more opportunity for all Americans\u2014not nativist dog whistles.\u201d GOP conference chair Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, responded to the reporting about the new caucus from Greene in a tweet. \u201cRepublicans believe in equal opportunity, freedom, and justice for all. We teach our children the values of tolerance, decency and moral courage,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRacism, nativism, and anti-Semitism are evil. History teaches we all have an obligation to confront & reject such malicious hate.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comments from Dyer on Saturday.",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry used a House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on Wednesday to spread an ugly, racist theory that \u201cnative-born\u201d (read: White) Americans are being purposely replaced by immigrants as a way to alter the culture of the country. \u201cFor many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is what appears to them is we\u2019re replacing national-born American \u2014 native-born Americans to permanently transform the landscape of this very nation,\u201d said Perry in reference to the number of people trying to enter the country at the United States\u2019 southern border. It\u2019s not difficult to figure out where Perry picked up such a noxious notion. Here\u2019s Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson on April 8 making the exact same argument: \u201cI know that the left and all the gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term \u2018replacement,\u2019 if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters, from the third world. But, they become hysterical because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening, actually. Let\u2019s just say it: That\u2019s true. Every time they import a new voter, I become disenfranchised as a current voter.\u201d Nor is Carlson the first person to promote the theory, which is alternatively known as \u201cWhite replacement theory\u201d or  simply \u201creplacement theory.\u201d It\u2019s long been an underlying theory of the White supremacist movement; you\u2019ll remember the White supremacists chanted \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d as they paraded through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That same year, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King tweeted this: \u201cWe can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies.\u201d As The New York Times\u2019 Nellie Bowles detailed in 2019, Carlson himself has previously dabbled in this space. Wrote Bowles: \u201cIn January, (Carlson) opened his show with a segment he said was \u2018the biggest issue facing this country going forward,\u2019 bigger than wars and G.D.P.: the collapse of families. The major cause of that collapse, he said, was that some women now out-earn some men. \u201c(Mr. Carlson\u2019s discussion of the topic attracted fierce criticism, something he addressed on his show the next night. \u2018This is why important science is no longer being conducted,\u2019 he said of the response. \u2018It\u2019s why art isn\u2019t being made and comedy is dying.\u2019) At its core, \u201creplacement theory\u201d is guided by the belief that lower birth rates among Whites (as compared to non-Whites) is allowing some amorphous groups \u2013 some adherents to this view blame Jewish people, while others put the onus on liberal politicians \u2013 to bring in thousands of immigrants more attuned to their preferred world view and, in so doing, change American culture right from under White people\u2019s noses. This was, once, the stuff of Internet fever swamps \u2013 never even considered the sort of thing that a sitting Republican member of Congress might entertain, much less say out loud in a committee hearing. But Donald Trump\u2019s presidency changed all that \u2013 from his attempted both-siderism in Charlottesville to his message to the far-right Proud Boys group to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d (It\u2019s not a coincidence that hate crimes rose to their highest level in more than a decade in the latter half of the Trump presidency.) Carlson, seeing ratings gold in playing to the anxieties of the older, whiter populace that makes up the core of Fox News\u2019 view base latched on the grievance-heavy view that Whites (and the allegedly \u201cAmerican\u201d values they represented) were being purposely marginalized by politicians who wanted to overhaul what it means to be an American. This is all very ugly stuff. But it\u2019s unfortunately an extension of Trumpism \u2013 and even tied to the ongoing belief among many of the former President\u2019s (predominantly White) supporters that the election was stolen from him by liberals and socialists bent on destroying America. (It will surprise you not at all that Perry was one of the nearly 150 House Republicans who voted to object to the Electoral College results in Arizona and Pennsylvania earlier this year.) It\u2019s these views \u2013 and the willingness by the likes of Carlson and Perry to indulge them that led to January 6 when the US Capitol was overrun by a violent crowd heavy with far right and White supremacist leaders all seeking to create chaos and cause damage. That such a moment happened in the world\u2019s greatest democracy is shameful. That Perry \u2013 more than three months on from that day \u2013 saw fit to forward a racist theory of immigration in a House committee hearing is appalling.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)

BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, find that specified harmful foreign activities of the Government of the Russian Federation \u2014 in particular, efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; to engage in and facilitate malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; to foster and use transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; to pursue extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and to violate well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states \u2014 constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. Accordingly, I hereby order: Section 1.

(b)  any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, a government whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to chapter V of title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations or another Executive Order, and to be: (i)    a citizen or national of the Russian Federation; (ii)   an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction within the Russian Federation (including foreign branches); or (iii)  a person ordinarily resident in the Russian Federation. (c)  any person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged in or attempted to engage in, cutting or disrupting gas or energy supplies to Europe, the Caucasus, or Asia, and to be: (i)   an individual who is a citizen or national of the Russian Federation; or (ii)  an entity organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction within the Russian Federation (including foreign branches). (d)  The prohibitions in subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order. Sec. 2.  The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include: (a)  the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and (b)  the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 3.  (a)  The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that the person\u2019s entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person\u2019s entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives. (b)  The Secretary of State shall implement this authority as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish. (c)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish. (d)  Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions). Sec. 4.  (a)  Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b)  Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 5.  I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Sec. 6.  For the purposes of this order: (a)  the term \u201centity\u201d means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; (b)  the term \u201cGovernment of the Russian Federation\u201d means the Government of the Russian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and any person owned, controlled, or directed by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation; (c)  the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of the United States; (d)  the term \u201cperson\u201d means an individual or entity; and (e)  the term \u201cUnited States person\u201d means any United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 7.  For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 8.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.  The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury.  All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order. Sec. 9.  Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof. Sec. 10.  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)). Sec. 11.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

            "article_content": "Major items on President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic agenda hang in the balance this month, hinging on Republicans\u2019 willingness to cut deals and whether Democrats agree to pare back their ambitions at the risk of causing a backlash on the left. April is turning out to be a crucial month to fulfill Biden\u2019s campaign pledge to work on a bipartisan basis in Washington, with groups of senators holding both informal and formal talks on a range of issues \u2013 infrastructure, gun violence, a crackdown on China, police reform, the minimum wage and immigration policy. But finding a delicate compromise \u2013 that could muster 60 votes in the Senate and win backing in the narrowly divided House \u2013 remains a far more complicated question, with distrust between the two parties running high and lawmakers often dug in on their ideological positions. And Republicans are still smarting from the White House\u2019s handling of Covid relief talks, arguing Biden jammed through a partisan $1.9 trillion proposal and used short-lived discussions with Republicans to create an appearance that he and Democrats actively sought bipartisan support. Why Biden is making more progress on economic than social issues \u201cIf somebody tells you in their inaugural speech they\u2019re for bipartisanship, and they go out and do everything but, it doesn\u2019t engender trust,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who says he\u2019s been invited to a White House meeting on infrastructure next week. All of which means this: Biden could see much of his agenda falter if bipartisan talks collapse, forcing Democrats to try to go it alone under budget rules that allow them to pass legislation in the Senate with just 51 votes rather than the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Yet going that route would significantly limit the scope of their agenda, since big-ticket items on immigration and gun violence are unlikely to meet the strict requirements under Senate budget rules to advance bills on a simple majority basis, though an infrastructure package could pass the test. Plus Democrats lack enough support within their own caucus to eliminate the filibuster\u2019s 60-vote threshold altogether, putting even more pressure to find a bipartisan way forward in the next several weeks or risk seeing chunks of the Biden agenda falter in the narrowly divided Congress. 4 signs of where infrastructure stands on Capitol Hill \u201cThis month is our opportunity to show that we can actually legislate in a bipartisan way,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat who occupies Biden\u2019s old US Senate seat in Delaware. Yet liberals are eager to see results and say that if bipartisan talks peter out, Democrats must achieve their goals by whatever means necessary \u2013 including potentially using the budget process up to six times in this Congress \u2013 with or without GOP support. \u201cWhether it\u2019s one piece of legislation or six pieces of legislation, is a less concern to me as to whether it goes done,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. \u201cWhat matters is it gets done and we can address the crises facing working families.\u201d On some major issues, such as voting rights, there are no serious bipartisan talks occurring. It\u2019s a sign that a sweeping Democratic proposal to increase voting access and overhaul the election process is almost certain to be blocked by Republicans as soon as next month. At a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told his caucus that he would give time for bipartisan talks to play out \u2013 but that Democrats would go a different route if negotiations stall, attendees said. \u201cSchumer also cautioned that Senate Dems do not have the luxury of time,\u201d a person in the room said. Behind the scenes, bipartisan talks are beginning to pick up pace on some key issues. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, two Connecticut Democrats, have been quietly working the phones to court Republicans to see if there\u2019s any support on gun violence legislation that could garner 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats hope this month will yield progress before trying to bring a bill to the floor next month, though they\u2019ll need the backing of 10 Republicans to do that. Between the two Democrats, they\u2019ve spoken to roughly half the 50-member Senate GOP Conference. They readily acknowledge that they will have to pare back the House-passed bill that would mandate background checks on firearm sales on commercial and private transactions, given the stiff opposition from GOP senators and skepticism from moderate Democrats to requiring checks on private transfers. Yet, it\u2019s still a tall order to cut a deal even on a narrow measure \u2013 such as forcing all gun purchasers through the internet and at gun shows to undergo background checks, similar to a long-stalled proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a Republican. 'This is the year to get it done': Democrats move on expanding background checks Still, senators are discussing ways to bolster the background check system, while seeking to find consensus on proposals to empower states and local authorities to remove firearms from those deemed mentally ill \u2013 known as red-flag laws. And while both Murphy and Blumenthal say they\u2019re more optimistic than before that a deal could be reached in the weeks ahead, they plainly recognize the challenges ahead. Blumenthal said talks are going \u201cbetter than I would have expected, much more productively than any other time.\u201d But he added: \u201cRealistically, it\u2019s still very much an uphill effort, in part because Republicans are so spooked right now by Donald Trump and his base and the complete irrationality, almost paranoia, of that base when it comes to guns, the slippery slope becomes a cliff. If they take one step, it\u2019s like the world ends.\u201d Murphy said he\u2019s spent recent weeks \u201ccajoling\u201d his Republican colleagues to support anti-gun violence legislation, and says he\u2019s ready to compromise on \u201csomething that\u2019s less than what the House passed.\u201d But what that bipartisan plan looks like remains unclear. Indiana Sen. Mike Braun, a Republican who spoke with Murphy, said the focus should be on \u201ckeeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.\u201d Colorado's controversial 'red flag' gun bill becomes law. Some sheriffs would rather go to jail than enforce it But Braun said focusing on expanding background checks first means \u201cyou\u2019re starting in the wrong place\u201d and called on senators to instead \u201cfirst focus on why some laws aren\u2019t working.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said: \u201cThese people would pass background checks, which is why I proposed the red flag grants to incentivize more states,\u201d a reference to grants to state and local governments that implement laws that allow the temporary removal of guns from people deemed at high risk of harming themselves or others. And the distrust looms large. Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota was skeptical when asked if there\u2019d be an appetite for a bipartisan deal on background checks. \u201cMost of the proposals the Dems come up with have something to do with making it harder for law-abiding citizens to get access to firearms,\u201d Thune told CNN. Amid the attention around the Derek Chauvin trial on charges of murdering George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, the White House has shifted its focus to getting legislation through Congress, abandoning a Biden campaign pledge to create a commission on the issue. After the House passed a bill in March named after Floyd, without a single Republican supporter, there are now active conversations about a bipartisan Senate version of a police reform bill. Those involved in the bipartisan discussions include Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat and lead author of the House bill, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, whose version of police reform was blocked by a Democratic filibuster last summer. Clyburn says 'we've got to have police officers' after Tlaib calls for 'no more policing' Scott told CNN this week that he and Bass had just spoken, adding he believed progress was being made since they first started their conversations in recent weeks. Bass told CNN in March the group was working through \u201csome of the thorny issues\u201d in their discussions over a potential Senate bill. One of the thorniest issues is how to deal with the issue of qualified immunity, which protects police officers from civil litigation. Democrats have pushed to gut the protections, a proposal that Republicans have resisted. But Scott indicated that the sticking point could be resolved. Asked if he sees a potential compromise on qualified immunity, Scott told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic still.\u201d In order to overcome the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, there needs to be a bipartisan consensus in the 50-50 Senate since most bills are unlikely to meet the strict rules of budget reconciliation, a process that allows legislation to pass on a simple majority basis and that was employed to enact the sweeping Covid relief law with no Republican support. The Senate\u2019s parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, gave Democrats a boost last week when she ruled that it\u2019s possible to use that process multiple times per fiscal year, meaning it could be employed six times in the current Congress \u2013 an unprecedented move. Schumer says he has not made a decision to go that route yet, as the White House has sought to engage Republicans on a potential bipartisan way forward on its $2 trillion-plus infrastructure-and-tax package. Yet in order for an infrastructure bill to pass the House by July 4, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wants, Democratic leaders must make a decision soon about which route they want to pursue: A narrow bill that could win over Republicans, or a more sweeping measure that they could pass through the reconciliation process. On Wednesday, Schumer refused to say when he\u2019d make that decision. But he made clear he wouldn\u2019t let talks drag out. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat the mistake of 2009 and \u201910 where for a year-and-a-half they negotiated and then nothing came of it,\u201d Schumer said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d referring to the first two years under then-President Barack Obama when Democrats controlled all of Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Progressive caucus chair says Senate must eliminate the filibuster or override parliamentarian But going the reconciliation route has its limits. For instance, MacDonough ruled this year that increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour is outside the bounds of the budget reconciliation process, dealing a blow to progressive Democrats. The ruling prompted bipartisan talks over the issue, with GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona putting together a middle-ground proposal to pitch to a group of 20 senators from both parties who are trying to craft compromises for the Senate to consider. And Manchin and some other moderate Democrats have resisted calls to use the reconciliation process on an infrastructure package, even though the prospects for a bipartisan deal seem slim \u2013 as Republicans reject Biden\u2019s call to hike corporate taxes to help pay for the plan and seek a proposal with a much lower price tag. Manchin said bipartisan deals will happen, \u201cbut it might not happen at the scope some people want it to happen. You can\u2019t do every social agenda and every pent-up issue that you might have.\u201d But asked what he\u2019d do if the bipartisan talks fall apart, Manchin demurred. \u201cYou just work a little harder until you massage it and make it happen,\u201d Manchin told CNN.

            "article_content": "Prominent Republicans rededicated themselves to Donald Trump\u2019s creed of grievance, lies and demagoguery this weekend as President Joe Biden bolstered his counter bet on the use of expansive federal power to ease America\u2019s crises. The dueling approaches reflect a nation torn not only by ideological divides and disputes over the role of government but one that often lacks a common version of the truth as the 45th president stokes the discord and resentments still boiling after his single, turbulent term. Trump tightened his grip on the GOP as potential future candidates and lawmakers flocked to party and donor meetings in Florida capped by the ex-President\u2019s profane rant that laid out the culture war blueprint he insists will return the party to power. By contrast, Biden\u2019s administration has quickened the pace of vaccinations, setting another 24-hour record for reported doses administered. His team cranked up the sales job on the next stage of his effort to beat a longer-term malaise \u2013 a $2 trillion infrastructure package meant to ease the pain of working Americans who have consistently lost out in an economy that has favored the wealthy. Pandemic may give rise to a progressive new era if White House economic team has its way His push for action reflects the audacious gamble he\u2019s made on the belief that the country is open to a President willing to fix the nation\u2019s problems with sweeping federal spending. The strategy is not only designed to drag the country out of the pandemic. It could offer him a chance to make his case to some of the blue-collar voters that were attracted to Trump\u2019s populist economic message in 2016. It\u2019s almost as if Democrats and Republicans are fighting parallel battles right now on a separate set of issues \u2013 with the GOP especially appealing only to its own base voters. Republicans have ceded the fight against the pandemic and economic inequality in favor of hardline rhetoric on immigration, race and transgender rights plus a flurry of voter suppression laws built on Trump\u2019s election falsehoods and a policy of obstruction of Biden\u2019s agenda in Washington. Not a single Republican in Congress, for instance, voted for Biden\u2019s pandemic relief plan and the prospects for GOP buy-in for his massive infrastructure package seem just as remote. How Americans perceive the struggle over the coming months will be crucial to Biden\u2019s chances of moving ahead with even more ambitious plans \u2013 on issues like climate change and election reform. But if the 2022 midterm elections go well for the Republican Party \u2013 despite its current state of civil war \u2013 Trump\u2019s influence will only be enhanced heading into the 2024 presidential race. As he seeks to maintain early momentum, the President will meet with Republicans at the White House on Monday as part of a bipartisan group that will discuss whether common solutions are possible on the infrastructure plan at the center of pitched battle on Capitol Hill. But the huge dollar cost of the plan, and Biden\u2019s definition of infrastructure as broader than fixing roads, bridges and highways into areas like boosting home health care for the elderly and the disabled, means GOP support is unlikely. Some Washington Republicans also doubt the President\u2019s sincerity in negotiating and believe he is simply paying lip service to a campaign vow to work across the aisle, while others who believe Biden are more skeptical of the staff and Democratic leaders around him. But the biggest uncertainty facing the bill may be whether Biden can get 50 Senate Democrats on board. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg unveiled a swift timeline for action on the bill on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday and challenged the GOP to join the President in steps that would boost the well-being of the party\u2019s own less wealthy supporters. \u201cThe President wants to see major action in Congress and real progress by Memorial Day,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, defending the scope of Biden\u2019s ambitions for a package that stretches traditional definitions.   \u201cInfrastructure is the foundation that allows us to go about our lives. To me, it makes no sense to say, \u2018I would have been for broadband, but I\u2019m against it because it\u2019s not a bridge. I would have been for eldercare, but I\u2019m against it because it\u2019s not a highway.\u2019 These are things the American people need.\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that old definitions of infrastructure were outdated. \u201cHistorically it\u2019s been: What makes the economy move? What is it that we all need to ensure that we, as citizens, are productive?\u201d Granholm said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to use past definitions of infrastructure, when we are moving into the future.\u201d Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, however, didn\u2019t hold out much hope for progress, saying he would go to the White House to talk to Biden if his plane arrived in time. \u201cWe are willing to negotiate with him on an infrastructure package, and this trillion-dollar number is way too high for me,\u201d Wicker said, also on \u201cThis Week.\u201d He accused Biden of not taking Republican offers seriously on his previous Covid relief plan. \u201cAmericans voted for a pragmatic moderate that they thought Joe Biden was. Where is that centrist candidate they thought they were voting for back in November of last year?\u201d It\u2019s true that the Covid relief plan, Biden\u2019s infrastructure package and an expected future package, which could reach $1 trillion on issues including education, represent some of the most audacious bids to reshape the economy in modern history. While Biden appears to believe that in a time of crisis he has a window to act, Wicker\u2019s comment did hint at possible consequences should his approach backfire. Voters in midterm elections often take the opportunity to rein in a first-term President if they are seen to be overreaching. So the President\u2019s willingness to aim so high is a significant risk. While Washington Republicans seek to interrupt Biden\u2019s fast start in office, the man he replaced did more this weekend to set the terms of the Republican Party\u2019s midterm election campaign, exploiting the hold he retains on the party\u2019s grassroots. Speaking at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Trump vowed to help the GOP win back control of Congress next year and to help them recapture the White House. The question, however, is whether an extreme message that helped the Republican Party lose the House and the Senate and the White House is likely to recapture the suburban and more moderate voters that deserted the party when he was in power. Still, a strategy designed to inflame base turnout could conceivably give the GOP an edge in some tightly contested state races \u2013 especially if its state voter suppression tactics succeed in limiting Democratic votes. In his Saturday speech \u2013 which was dripping with falsehoods about his own presidency, the pandemic, Biden\u2019s program and a boiling desire for revenge and cultural war arguments \u2013 Trump demonstrated how he has his party in a vise. Republican state lawmakers push new criminal penalties for election activities He waded through debunked claims that the election was stolen from him, a person in the room said. In addition to insulting Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump lashed out at Dr. Anthony Fauci, who, unlike the ex-President, took seriously a crisis that erupted on his watch and that has killed more than half a million Americans and counting. According to Trump\u2019s prepared remarks for the event, which was closed to the press, he attacked Biden for choosing his \u201cradical, open borders\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris for the task of stopping the flow of child migrants from Central America. He singled out transgender athletes competing in women\u2019s sports. And after Biden signed an exceedingly modest executive order on limiting the production of homemade firearms, Trump warned in his prepared remarks, \u201cHe is coming for your guns, he is coming for your money, and he is coming for your freedom.\u201d The ex-President also claimed that Biden was leading corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines in a \u201cslanderous effort to cancel and punish the entire state of Georgia.\u201d In reality, Trump sought to overturn Biden\u2019s win in the Peach State and state lawmakers have reacted to his lies about fraud by passing a tough new law that discriminates against minority voters. Trump\u2019s months of false claims about the election have had a profound effect in convincing Republican voters that the last election was stolen, meaning the entry point into the midterms and 2024 presidential race for candidates that want to woo his voters is acceptance of his big lie. Proof of this can be found in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll that showed that 55% of Republicans falsely believe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential election was the result of illegal voting or rigging. And 60% of Republicans incorrectly agree that the election was stolen from Trump. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, the kind of old-school, pro-business Republican that Trump has driven out of the party, warned Sunday that the ex- President\u2019s behavior was \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cnot helpful\u201d on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Trump last week blasted Hutchinson for vetoing an anti-transgender state law that would outlaw gender-affirming \u201cprocedures\u201d for transgender youths. The ex-President is confident that his former White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who is running for governor in Arkansas with his blessing, will be yet another of his acolytes to extend his power and influence. That is a lesson that has already been learned by a crop of Republicans who may run in 2024 if Trump doesn\u2019t. Top Florida office holders \u2013 Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 all made sure they were on hand this weekend. As did South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. Inside the Republican Party, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no path to advancement without Trump\u2019s endorsement. But it\u2019s also possible that by recommitting to his divisive message, Republicans are playing into Biden\u2019s hands.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Here\u2019s evidence of the extreme dysfunction of the US federal government in three semi-related stories from the last day. This might sound like a good thing. The President did something because Congress is unable to do much of anything. CNN\u2019s report by Kevin Liptak explained the very limited scope of the actions and how little they actually accomplish: The executive actions \u2013 which Biden repeatedly argued did nothing to impinge on the Second Amendment right to bear arms \u2013 include efforts to restrict weapons known as \u201cghost guns\u201d that can be built using parts and instructions purchased online. The moves are limited in scope and fall short of the steps Biden has vowed to pressure Congress to take. Still, they fulfilled his pledge last month to take \u201ccommon-sense\u201d steps on his own, and one move \u2013 more heavily regulating arm braces used to make firing a pistol more accurate \u2013directly relates to the March shooting in Boulder, Colorado, where such a device was used. But the larger issue is that Biden\u2019s action is a symptom of Washington\u2019s larger paralysis. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t a majority in the House or Senate to pass legislation that\u2019s supported by members of both parties. The problem is that under current Senate rules, majority support is meaningless, because the minority party \u2013 right now, Republicans \u2013 can insist on a 60-vote supermajority to pass anything at all. This could be the death knell for Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan, along with any hope of action on immigration or climate crisis. What it means is that Democrats can\u2019t get the 50 votes they need to approve changing Senate rules so that a bare majority can pass laws \u2013 so the need to reach a supermajority is here to stay, at least until the next election. Related: Joe Manchin just crushed liberals\u2019 dream for Biden\u2019s first term Republicans are united behind the filibuster and several Democrats, most notably Manchin \u2013 a centrist from increasingly red West Virginia \u2013 are nervous about shaking things up. \u201cThere is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster,\u201d Manchin wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday night. He described the stand as sticking up for small and rural states and said that only through compromise between Republicans and Democrats would the Washington paralysis end. That may be true, but it\u2019s equally evident that as long as there is a filibuster to exploit, lawmakers will use it to stand in the way of gun legislation, climate legislation, voting rights legislation and immigration legislation. Manchin calls for Republicans and Democrats working together and ignores the recent evidence that they are rewarded for doing battle, not finding common ground. What proves Manchin wrong is that in the time since Democrats and Republicans ended the filibuster for federal, judicial and Supreme Court nominations, the world has not ended and Presidents have gotten most, but not all, the nominees they\u2019ve desired. The filibuster isn\u2019t a law, it\u2019s a custom handed down from a time before senators were selected by voters. The third, and maybe the most important thing, that\u2019s happened in the past few days is that Kentucky \u2013 not a blue state, but a state with a Democratic governor and a Republican legislature \u2013 enacted bipartisan voting rights reforms. This is, in and of itself, not dysfunctional. But the fact that it\u2019s a surprise only further underscores how polarized and paralyzed the rest of American politics is right now. The reality of a Democratic governor working with Republicans to expand voting rights bucks the larger trend of GOP-controlled swing states making it harder for people to vote. Kentucky opening access to the vote does not put it on par with other states. In Georgia, where Republicans have moved to restrict access, it\u2019s still arguably easier to vote than in Kentucky, where the new law opens access to just three days of early voting. It also, perhaps, underlines the need for more national standards. It\u2019s easier to vote in some places than others, which means different Americans have different access to the polls. Still, the idea of anything bipartisan happening in Washington at the moment seems so fantastic in part because small minorities in the Senate have the power to block any legislation they wish. I wrote here about the political controversy around verifying a vaccine in exchange for access to something \u2013 planes and cruise ships, or concerts, say. There was a fair amount of reader comment on that edition. Mark Hall, a senior fellow at Brookings, reached with his research to argue that while the idea of \u201cvaccine passports\u201d is divisive, it\u2019s not divisive in the normal partisan way. He and David Studdert, a Stanford researcher, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that while there is not public support for a government passport system, industries and businesses should not be prohibited from verifying vaccines. This is where the government can play a role, they argued, by setting up a system to document vaccine verification while not itself mandating a vaccine. \u201cAlthough not in the driver\u2019s seat, government will have to help steer. Private actors need standards and bounds, including clear directives barring uses of vaccine certification that constitute unlawful discrimination,\u201d they write. \u2018Passport\u2019 may be a divisive term. There was a similar vein in the conservative pollster Frank Luntz, who along with Brian Castrucci on CNBC that the problem with passports is one of messaging. Just call it a vaccine verification, they argued. \u201cThe concept of a vaccine passport pushes nearly every partisan political button for Republicans who already don\u2019t trust their political leaders and fear government overreach.\u201d After conducting a focus group, they argued, \u201cIf you want everyone vaccinated and life to go back to normal, it starts with using the right language.  A vaccine \u201cverification\u201d is preferred to a passport by every population subgroup \u2014 all of them.\u201d Related: Here\u2019s what to know about going to restaurants after vaccination It\u2019s not just vaccines that could lead to verification. Ethan Veneklasen wrote in on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative, an open source effort backed by companies to create a verification system. \u201cWhile I recognize that most journalists are using the term \u201cvaccination passport\u201d in a generic sense \u2013 as a sort of shorthand \u2013 it is factually inaccurate, inflammatory, and distorts a critically important public debate. It plays into the hands of extremists \u2013 on both ends of the political spectrum \u2013 who are using the term intentionally to bolster the assertion that any type of digital health pass system would, by definition, represent an affront to civil liberties and/or health equity,\u201d he said. He pointed out that most of the verification systems being proposed would also allow for a negative Covid test or recovery from Covid in addition to vaccination. That\u2019s certainly true of the system being implemented in New York. Cruise ships, which want to require vaccination to board, might be the exception.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has left the White House, but the Republican Party just can\u2019t quit his stunt politics. As President Joe Biden sells a popular Covid-19 rescue plan, highlights a quickening national vaccine effort, positions himself to benefit from an economic growth spurt after the pandemic and tackles economic inequity in American society, the GOP seems to be acting out the temperament of the last President. At times, the party seems trapped in a perpetual primary race, shaping positions that seem best suited as fodder for the culture warriors at Fox News. The party has spent the first months of the Biden administration rewriting electoral laws to suppress minority votes, denying the truth of Trump\u2019s Capitol insurrection, raging against vaccine passports and trashing science with state openings that threaten to cause unnecessary pandemic deaths. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell unleashed a fearsome attack on \u201cwoke\u201d corporations that reacted to a discriminatory voting law in Georgia. McConnell, at least in his rhetoric, sounded a lot like the former President. \u201cBusinesses must not use economic blackmail to spread disinformation and push bad ideas that citizens reject at the ballot box,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. In fact, what Georgia voters rejected at the ballot box \u2013 causing the GOP to change the laws \u2013 was a second term for Trump and two Republican senators. McConnell\u2019s threat of consequences for big business also rang with Trumpian bluster since no one thinks the GOP \u2013 or the Kentuckian, who has built a career defending corporate cash in politics \u2013 is suddenly turning into an Occupy Wall Street activist. Yet it was a free hit for a minority leader more known for playing the long game, with the veteran senator well aware that it will draw headlines in conservative media and might help ease his estrangement with Trump\u2019s base voters. The most eye-catching current story about the Republican Party is not the way it is mobilizing to thwart Biden\u2019s increasingly radical presidency. It is the multiple scandals ripping around Trump proteg\u00e9 Rep. Matt Gaetz, the latest being a New York Times report Tuesday night that alleged the Florida Republican sought a preemptive pardon for himself and congressional allies at the end of the ex-President\u2019s time in office. Gaetz is refusing to show contrition in a defiant and unapologetic stand reminiscent of his mentor. While few Republicans are rushing to defend him, it has been an unwelcome distraction for the GOP as they try to reposition the party for the elections of 2022. Another one of the most visible Republicans this year has been first-term pro-Trump Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who is known for conspiracy theories and spreading false narratives about Trump\u2019s election loss. The party\u2019s strategy does reflect the views of much of its activist base voters \u2013 among whom Trump remains deeply popular in an audience that is fully bought into the ex-President\u2019s lies about the last election being stolen. But it is far from clear the Trump-style uproar is proving to be an effective counter to Biden, as he rushes to put a lasting liberal imprint on social policy that echoes Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. By making a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago soon after Trump left the White House, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sent a signal that he believed keeping the Make America Great Again fans on his side was a passport to power in the 2022 congressional elections. King: This tells you everything you need to know about the GOP But it remains an open question if that is a winning message among the suburban voters who deserted the GOP amid distaste at Trump\u2019s antics. Populism drove Trump to power. But now that he\u2019s not in the White House, ad hoc appeals to his base are doing little to build a coherent rhetorical and philosophical alternative to Biden\u2019s big government power. The party lacks the kind of conservative doctrine and clear program that swept Newt Gingrich to the speaker\u2019s gavel in the 1994 midterm election or even the clear message that helped George W. Bush win the White House in 2000. It\u2019s not as if there aren\u2019t good targets for Republicans. Biden was initially caught flatfooted amid a surge of child migrants to the border when he changed the former President\u2019s tough immigration policies. The issue is one where the President has significant vulnerabilities, according to polls. But the Gaetz firestorm, coverage of GOP voter suppression and the heartrending testimony in the trial into George Floyd\u2019s death have thwarted Republican efforts to keep Biden on the spot on immigration. Biden\u2019s new cause, a $2 trillion infrastructure bill that represents his latest attempt to reorient the economy towards working class and middle class Americans, also ought to offer pickings for the Republicans. The party is taking a familiar tack in branding the huge bill as little more than a massive tax hike to fuel far left liberal programs. Yet there must be questions over whether that approach fits the current mood of the country during a pandemic in which sweeping government action to solve problems has been enjoying something of a revival. Just as the GOP left Biden a clear field to claim credit for any economic recovery by opposing the Covid relief bill, there is a chance its obstruction on infrastructure could turn out to be a liability. There is no sign for example that Republicans have an alternative plan to help out the many elderly and disabled Americans who need home health care \u2013 who the President is targeting under his expanded definition of \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d It may also be a risk to oppose a hike in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% after big business got a windfall during the Trump years. Republican culture warriors are not just operating in Washington. Governors across the country \u2013 including several who might hope to woo Trump\u2019s flock in possible 2024 White House runs \u2013 are also headline hunting, attempting to use the roiling battle over voter suppression to their advantage. Rejecting criticism of Georgia\u2019s restrictive voting rights law, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp essentially ripped a page from Trump\u2019s playbook when dealing with the fallout of Major League Baseball pulling this summer\u2019s All-Star Game from Atlanta. In a shape-shifting exercise, he blamed Democrats for the backlash to the law passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, charging that their \u201clies\u201d about the legislation had cost \u201chard working Georgians\u201d a paycheck by causing baseball to shift the game to Denver. Hitting a buzzword sure to have resonance for the GOP nationally, Kemp argued that the move was the product of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d a favorite catch phrase of the former President, who used it as a defense whenever his attempts to stoke the culture wars came under fire. Attempting to deflect criticism for their role in legislation that will disproportionately make it harder for Black Americans to vote, Kemp and other Republicans have suggested that the community is now paying an economic price as a result of corporate activism on voting rights. The Georgia governor said the nation should interpret MLB\u2019s move to mean that \u201ccancel culture and partisan activists are coming for your business. They\u2019re coming for your game or event in your hometown, and they\u2019re coming to cancel everything from sports to how you make a living, and they will stop at nothing to silence all of us.\u201d Republican National Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel echoed those talking points in an interview on Fox News in which she said that the \u201clittle person\u201d in Georgia will ultimately be harmed by MLB\u2019s actions. \u201cAtlanta, a majority-black city, those hotdog vendors, those hotels, these businesses that have been decimated by the pandemic,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThey are hurting the little guy based on a lie told by the President, by President Joe Biden.\u201d The President did err in suggesting that the Peach State had cut voting hours on Election Day. But the bulk of the evidence suggests the law makes it harder for Black Georgians to vote. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another Trump acolyte, tied MLB\u2019s action to what she viewed as pandering to political correctness when football and basketball stars came out in support of the Black Lives Matter protests last year that followed the death of George Floyd while under arrest by a Minneapolis police officer. \u201cLike the @nfl & @nba before it, @mlb is the latest pro sports league being used & bullied by the most radical liberal groups in this country,\u201d Noem said in a recent tweet, adding the hashtag #GetWokeGoBroke. After calling this past weekend for Republicans to boycott the corporations that are speaking up on voting rights, Trump weighed in with similar mockery of \u201cwoke\u201d corporations during an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday: \u201cThey\u2019re woke and woke is not good for our country. Woke is not good,\u201d Trump said when asked for his opinion on MLB\u2019s decision. Apparently alluding to several restrictive voting bills that are moving through the Texas Legislature \u2013 which have led companies like American Airlines and Dell to register their opposition before the bills become law \u2013 Trump also warned that corporations might pay a steeper price for speaking up in the Lone Star State. \u201cLet them try boycotting Texas. Texas will teach them a lesson, that I can tell you. Let them try it,\u201d Trump told Newsmax. \u201cLook, it\u2019s crazy what\u2019s going on, it shouldn\u2019t be happening, frankly these companies should stay out of it, because all they do is aggravate people and people are not happy with it.\u201d \u201cIf Republican conservatives ever got their act together,\u201d the former President added, they would boycott the corporations criticizing the legislation and \u201cthese companies that are so above it all, you would find that they would come back into the fold very quickly. But right now, the liberals, the radical left, the Democrats, they play a much tougher game.\u201d His comments were a reminder that the former President doesn\u2019t just loom over the Republican Party \u2014 he has changed the way it conducts politics, a lasting legacy and a set of tactics that the GOP does not seem willing to abandon anytime soon.",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was blunt in his reaction to Major League Baseball\u2019s decision to move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta this summer following the passage of a series of new election measures by Georgia elected officials. \u201cCorporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order,\u201d warned McConnell, adding: \u201cBusinesses must not use economic blackmail to spread disinformation and push bad ideas that citizens reject at the ballot box.\u201d Whoa! A prominent Republican blasting corporate America \u2013 long the fundraising lifeblood of the GOP? Holy moly! But, upon further review, there\u2019s actually an explanation for all of this. And, yes, it has everything to do with politics. Start here: There\u2019s no question that the populist revolutionary vision of the Republican Party pushed by former President Donald Trump has put the Grand Old Party more at odds with its long-standing business allies than at any point in modern political memory. The US Chamber of Commerce was openly leery of Trump\u2019s nativist immigration policies. And lots and lots of companies were sufficiently spooked by the insurrection at the US capitol on January 6 that they promised to avoid donating to any Republican politician who voted to object to the Electoral College vote. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The controversy over the new Georgia law, which opponents say will make it harder for voters in the state to cast ballots, was the latest domino to fall in the seeming breakup of big business and the GOP. MLB\u2019s decision to pull the All-Star Game out of Atlanta \u2013 coupled with scolding statements by the likes of Delta and Coca-Cola (after some initial hemming and hawing) \u2013 led to praise from Democrats and scorn from the Trump wing of the party. \u201cBoycott all of the woke companies that don\u2019t want Voter I.D. and Free and Fair Elections,\u201d said the former President in a statement Tuesday morning. (And, no, I have no idea why \u201cFree\u201d and \u201cFair Elections\u201d are capitalized in that statement. Literally none.) So, that is all true. But don\u2019t be fooled into believing that corporate America and the Republican Party are going to be breaking up in any meaningful way for any significant amount of time. Here\u2019s why: Corporations know that Republicans, generally speaking, will look to protect their long-term interests (and by that I mean, uh, money) far better than the Democratic Party. And Republican politicians \u2013 very much including McConnell \u2013 know that they need the financial contributions of corporations to fund their campaigns, particularly as they seek to retake the House and Senate majorities they lost during the Trump era. Just one example, courtesy of the Center for Responsive Politics: The 147 Republicans who objected to the Electoral College results raised $68 million from business PACs in just the 2020 election alone. Let\u2019s not forget that McConnell has been the face of opposition to campaign finance reform for, well, as long as there have been efforts to reduce the role of money in politics. McConnell gushed with praised for the Supreme Court landmark Citizens United ruling in 2010, which allowed corporations to make independent expenditures in political campaigns: \u201cFor too long, some in this country have been deprived of full participation in the political process \u2026 the Constitution protects their right to express themselves about political candidates and issues up until Election Day,\u201d he said in part. And when the Supreme Court considered revisiting the Citizens United ruling in 2012, McConnell wrote a brief to the court arguing against such a move. Corporate America is well aware of McConnell\u2019s past record in pushing for them to spend their dollars on campaigns. (Just as McConnell is well aware of how many corporate dollars have been spent in support of Republican candidates since 2010.) And here\u2019s something else corporate America knows: President Joe Biden has proposed raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% to finance his $2 trillion infrastructure plan. Guess who opposes that plan vehemently? None other than Mitch McConnell and his Republican colleagues! \u201cI\u2019m going to fight them every step of the way, because I think this is the wrong prescription for America,\u201d McConnell said of the infrastructure bill. (Guess who dropped the corporate tax rate from 35% to its current 21%? Yes, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and congressional Republicans \u2013 as part of the 2018 tax cut package!) So, given all of that, here\u2019s what McConnell is up to. He knows that corporate America is entirely bottom-line focused \u2013 as in, what way can it keep as much of its money as possible. And that corporations believe \u2013 and have ample reason from the past to believe \u2013 that the Republican Party is the party most likely to make that happen. Which means that attacking corporations \u2013 and throwing a bone to the Trump populists with a nod to supposed \u201ccancel culture\u201d \u2013 amounts to a freebie for McConnell. He knows corporations aren\u2019t going to walk away from the GOP because he\u2019s issuing vague threats to them over the reaction to the Georgia election law. And if they do blanch at his critique, McConnell can just have his office crunch a few numbers on the difference in their bottom line between a 21% corporate tax rate and a 28% one to remind them. That\u2019s McConnell\u2019s ultimate Trump \u2013 ahem \u2013 card on corporations. And they know it.",

            "article_content": "If baseball is a metaphor for American life, Opening Day brought a tantalizing springtime hint of better days ahead, despite reflecting a nation divided by the polarized politics of a pandemic and Georgia\u2019s battle over Republican voter suppression. Annual first rites of a new season played out in front of well-below-capacity and socially distanced crowds, while ongoing contact tracing postponed a game in Washington were a reminder of the still potent peril of Covid-19 as the country faces another infection surge. But the fact that there were fans in the seats at all to watch teams play ball underscored how much of the country is tentatively itching for a return to some semblance of normality after a grim winter of sickness and death and as millions of vaccines go into American arms at an increasing pace. And while the vast salaries and ripped athleticism of modern players have no precedent, the rituals and geometric truths of a fabled game that has borne fans through the national crises of earlier eras brought comfort and continuity in tough times. The annual return of the boys of summer carries a sense of renewal and possibility. A similar feeling is being conjured by stunning and welcome news of the success of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. New trial data shows the shot to be highly effective at least six months after the second dose and experts say it probably lasts much longer and offers protection against most viral variants that worry epidemiologists. The results emerged as vaccine distribution quickly ramps up across the country, with more than 150 million doses of vaccine administered in the US and eligibility for inoculations fast expanding to almost all age groups in many states. The Pfizer news also offered President Joe Biden a powerful weapon in his drive to convince a sizable minority of skeptical Americans to get vaccinated to enable the country to reach the herd immunity that is necessary to eradicate the virus. It\u2019s going to take widespread vaccination to drive the virus down sufficiently to allow a return to packed baseball stadiums later in the summer \u2014 and then to see fans return en masse to indoor arenas later this year. Play ball! Why politicians love baseball's Opening Day On the issue of crowds, Biden registered clear disapproval with a plan by the Texas Rangers to have a full house at Globe Life Field for their home opener on April 5. \u201cThat\u2019s a decision they made. I think it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey should listen to Dr. (Anthony) Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it\u2019s not responsible,\u201d Biden said in an interview with ESPN in lieu of throwing out the opening pitch before the Washington Nationals season opener. The Rangers plan to fully open their ballpark for their first game and then to play before a slightly reduced capacity with social distancing sections in subsequent games. Texas is one of the states that has defied the President\u2019s call for patience in easing Covid-19 restrictions in order to allow time for more people to be vaccinated. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott canceled a mask mandate and has declared the state fully opened.   The President also weighed into another controversy that encroached on the festivities of the first baseball games of the season \u2014 a new voting law passed by Republicans in Georgia that discriminates against Black voters and is based on ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the last election was marred by fraud. Biden backed calls by civil rights campaigners for baseball\u2019s All-Star Game, which is due to be held this year in Atlanta, to be moved to a different state. Tony Clark, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, has said, according to the Boston Globe, that it would be open to a discussion on moving All-Star celebrations. \u201cI think today\u2019s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,\u201d Biden told ESPN. \u201cPeople look to them. They\u2019re leaders.\u201d The current President\u2019s attitude contrasted starkly with the way that Trump slammed protests in which pro athletes, inspired by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, took a knee to protest police brutality. Trump also openly feuded with sportsmen and women who spoke out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in the racial reckoning that followed the death of George Floyd last year. At the same time as baseball was opening its season Thursday, the trial of the police officer charged with murdering Floyd entered its fourth day of testimony in Minneapolis. The commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, said on ESPN that the sport had \u201calways been opposed to any law that unfairly restricts access to voting rights.\u201d But he also appeared to indicate that at this stage, moving the All-Star Game, scheduled for July 13, would be impractical. \u201cWe plan these games years in advance and this game is only three months away. It\u2019s one thing to say this game should be moved, it\u2019s another thing to figure out how to move it on that short time frame.\u201d Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, meanwhile, lashed out at the campaign to shift the venue, accusing Biden of trying to distract attention from a flood of child migrants at the southern border, which Republicans say is the result of his more humane immigration policies. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s focused on trying to get Major League Baseball to pull the game out of Georgia, which is ridiculous,\u201d Kemp told Fox News. The power of organized political pressure should not be underestimated, however. Several iconic corporations based in Atlanta, including Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, recognized the rising heat from activists this week and forcibly condemned the new voting law. The Georgia voting law may also be in the background at the Masters next week, the first men\u2019s golf major of the year at the Augusta National Golf Club. Racial issues were already to the fore of this year\u2019s tournament since Lee Elder, the first Black player to tee off at the Masters, in 1975, will be making his debut as honorary starter alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. The crack of the bat rang more loudly than usual Thursday around sparsely populated ballparks among socially distanced and masked fans. Most stadiums were much less than half full, with 20% to 30% capacity. The Nationals\u2019 game against the New York Mets was postponed owing to Covid protocols anyway. At least three players have tested positive for Covid-19 and another is considered a \u201clikely\u201d positive, Nationals manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo confirmed during a video conference Thursday. How Major League Baseball is tracking Covid-19 variants The loss of the game was a reminder of the complications of putting on a full baseball season and all the travel that it involves during a pandemic. Last year, there was a heavily truncated seasons in the major leagues. At Yankee Stadium in New York, which has been doubling as a Covid-19 vaccine site, fans had to show they were fully vaccinated or post a negative Covid test before passing through the turnstiles. The visiting Toronto Blue Jays, who pulled out a 3-2 win in extra innings, will not be heading back to their home Rogers Centre ballpark any time soon. The US-Canada border is closed and the Jays\u2019 home province of Ontario shut down for at least a month on Thursday amid a Covid-19 surge. The team will be playing home games for now at its spring training base in Florida. The team hopes to return to Toronto at some point but is also planning for a possible return to its minor league affiliate in Buffalo, just across the Niagara River from Canada, according to a report on the Major League Baseball website. Not all of the Opening Day challenges were caused by a pandemic and politics, however. In one sign of early season normality, the Boston Red Sox were rained out and will have to wait another day to welcome fans back to Fenway Park for the first time in 18 months.",

            "article_content": "Texas and 13 other Republican-led states have filed a long shot bid with the Supreme Court asking the justices to allow the states to defend a controversial Trump-era rule that makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use certain public benefits, such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. The so-called \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule is currently blocked while the Biden administration completes a review process and decides what the new regulation will be. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court agreed to dismiss a pending challenge to the rule at the request of the Biden administration because the government changed its position in the case after the election. Now Texas wants to intervene and defend the rule, even though the underlying cases have been dismissed. How the border problem caught the Biden team off guard, and how they've scrambled to fix it \u201cThe States\u2019 interests in this matter were adequately represented by the United States during the previous administration,\u201d Paxton told the justices. \u201cBut on March 9, and without notice to the States or other interested parties, the Biden Administration agreed to voluntarily dismiss its appeal in every pending challenge to the Rule.\u201d The 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals has previously denied Paxton\u2019s request. The Trump rule was issued in 2019 and had been in effect in most states nationwide until earlier this year. The \u201cpublic charge\u201d provision dates back at least to the Immigration Act of 1882. Federal lawmakers at the time wanted to make sure that immigrants would be able to take care of themselves and not end up being a public burden. Under current regulations put in place in 1996, the term is defined as someone who is \u201cprimarily dependent\u201d on government assistance, meaning it supplies more than half their income. But it only counted cash benefits, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Supplemental Security Income from Social Security. The Trump administration\u2019s rule widened the definition of who is expected to be dependent on the government by including more benefit programs.",

            "article_content": "The US-Mexico border crisis is one of the first noncoronavirus-related issues to break through the news cycle during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Republicans are playing up the surge of people trying to cross the border, while Democrats are hoping that Biden can figure out a way to deal with it. The issue is one of the first that puts Biden and his administration between a rock and a hard place. It\u2019s not clear looking at the data how to politically deal with the issue. For one thing, a flow of illegal immigration across the border divides the Democratic base. Plenty of Democrats would like to essentially decriminalize crossing the border illegally. This was the stance that Vice President Kamala Harris took during her bid for the presidency in the 2020 election cycle. NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist polling in late 2019 showed that 51% of Democrats thought such a position was a good idea. This was especially true of the progressive base, among whom 61% thought it was a good idea. Biden was one of the Democrats during the primary season not to endorse decriminalizing border crossings. He had to have known that few people outside the Democratic base wanted to do so. Only 42% of moderate Democrats did, and a mere 28% of registered voters overall believed decriminalizing border crossings is a good idea. A very large 65% believed decriminalizing border crossing was a bad idea. So if voters don\u2019t want a decriminalized border, what do they want? It\u2019s not clear. A wall along the US-Mexico border, for instance, was pushed by former President Donald Trump. It proved to be unpopular with the public and certainly with the Democratic base. Democrats have responded in another way: pushing immigration legislation of another sort that unites them. Specifically, House Democrats passed a bill that seeks to find a path to citizenship for many immigrants who are here illegally. Polling shows that most Americans are in favor of a path to citizenship for most people who are in the country illegally, but its chances in the Senate don\u2019t look great at the current moment because of GOP opposition. Of course, there\u2019s a major difference in the minds of the voters for immigrants who are newly coming over the border illegally and those who have been in the country for a substantial period of time. The Democratic legislation doesn\u2019t really solve the current issues at the border. Republicans, recognizing that fact, have opposed such bills. They\u2019re hoping to keep the issue of immigration in the news longer because a lot of the attention is on the current border situation. Moreover, Republicans understand their base tends to be far more fired up about immigration than the Democrats are. Last year, Trump\u2019s voters were 15 points more likely to say that immigration was very important to their vote than Biden\u2019s voters in Pew Research Center polling. The last time Republicans were trying to take back the House in a midterm election (2010), voters who selected immigration as one of their top issues were more than twice as likely to say they were voting Republican. Perhaps the biggest issue Democrats face at this particular point is that they lack Trump in the White House. Trump was someone Democrats and the public at-large could unify against on immigration. The vast majority of both disapproved of his job performance on immigration and his signature border wall. It was easy to point out children being crowded into migrant facilities and place the blame on Trump. Now, however, Democrats are the ones in control. Biden so far hasn\u2019t paid a price in his overall approval ratings, but it\u2019s not difficult to see how it could happen. Immigration has been one of Biden\u2019s weakest points. Biden rated poorest on immigration in a CNN/SSRS poll from earlier this month. Among all adults, his approval clocked in at a mere 43% compared to a disapproval rating of 49%. A Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly had his approval rating on immigration at 41%. With registered voters, CNN\u2019s poll put Biden at a 41% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating. Biden\u2019s overall approval ratings are no doubt being propped up by voters largely approving of how he has handled the coronavirus pandemic. What remains to be seen is what happens when the pandemic is less of a concern to voters. Other issues such as immigration will become more important as the midterms approach and more and more Americans get vaccinated \u2013 and that may bode poorly for Biden and the Democratic Party.",

More than two months into his presidency, at his first news conference since becoming president, Biden blamed Trump for a slew of issues, including a broken immigration system and the US\u2019 current diplomatic woes. Biden\u2019s frequent invocation of Trump was noticeable perhaps because his press conference was the first time he spoke at length on a variety of issues his White House is working on, and his relative low-profile compared to Trump. The press corps also wanted to talk about Trump. Biden was also asked about the possibility of running against Trump in 2024, Trump\u2019s plan to pull the US out of Afghanistan and Georgia\u2019s law placing new limits on voting \u2013 a direct result of Trump\u2019s false claims about election fraud. Fact-checking Biden's first news conference as president The President\u2019s frequent mentions of Trump should come as no surprise. Biden built up a presidential campaign pegged on reversing the Trump administration\u2019s policies and countering what he saw as Trump\u2019s political divisiveness. His 2020 campaign revolved around the idea that the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d was at stake in the election, and that he would seek to heal a country fractured by Trump\u2019s presidency. No policy area is perhaps as central to Trump\u2019s image than his anti-immigration actions. Biden largely blamed Trump for the current situation on the southern border, where an influx of unaccompanied minors are traveling into the US, despite some indications that unauthorized migrants are coming into the US because of the perception that the new administration will be more lenient. \u201cIt happens every single, solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBy the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy? And he was doing good things at the border? That\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming.\u201d The President also blasted the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of foreign aid funding to deal with the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration and blamed his predecessor for having \u201cshut down the number of beds available\u201d by not funding the Department of Health and Human Services \u201cto get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities.\u201d Despite a recent spike in migrants that is putting the US on track to see the most individuals on the southern border in 20 years, Biden says he\u2019s making no apologies for the way he\u2019s handling the situation. Trump lies about Capitol riot by claiming his supporters were 'hugging and kissing' cops \u201cFirst of all, all the (Trump) policies that were underway were not helping at all, did not slow up the amount of immigration, and as many people coming. And rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers? I make no apology for that,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity,\u201d he added. Trump kicked off his presidential campaign in 2015 by claiming that \u201cwhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. \u2026 They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d He repeatedly used terms such as \u201ckiller,\u201d \u201cpredator,\u201d \u201canimal\u201d and \u201cinvasion\u201d when referencing immigration issues in front of audiences. And his administration was responsible for devising some of the most stringent and publicly divisive immigration policies America had adopted, including the so-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant families, including those with children. Biden\u2019s blame game with Trump is in line with what other US presidents have done after taking office. President Barack Obama blamed the George W. Bush administration for the financial crisis. And Going back to President Ronald Reagan, nearly every US president has blamed their predecessor for inheriting a poor economy. That extends to Trump, too. During his first news conference since taking office, Trump referred to the messes he inherited from President Barack Obama four times. 'It's a matter of timing': Biden lays out expansive theory of his own presidency \u201cTo be honest, I inherited a mess. A mess. At home and abroad \u2013 a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what\u2019s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places. Low pay, low wages,\u201d Trump said in 2017. \u201cMass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea, we\u2019ll take care of it, folks. We\u2019re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know. I inherited a mess.\u201d Trump went on to express his frustrations about the messes he inherited up until his final weeks in office, but touted his legacy on immigration as a \u201csuccess story.\u201d \u201cThis is a real success story,\u201d Trump told US Customs and Border Patrol agents during a speech in front of a section of the US-Mexico border wall in mid-January. \u201cWhen I took office, we inherited a broken, dysfunctional, and open border. Everybody was pouring in at will. Working alongside the heroes in this great outdoor space, looking at our wall, we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in US history. It is at a level that it\u2019s never been before.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The push by liberal Democrats to enact President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping agenda is running into problems beyond just Sen. Joe Manchin: A handful of Democrats are not falling in line and could limit the scope of the party\u2019s ambitions on an array of critical issues. Some Senate Democrats like Sen. Jon Tester of Montana are not yet sold on the House-passed bills to expand background checks on gun sales. Eight Democrats are resisting calls to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. And it\u2019s more than just Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema who are opposed to changing Senate rules so a filibuster can be defeated by 51 votes, rather than 60: The two New Hampshire Democratic senators are resisting those calls as well, in addition to several others who are not yet persuaded that such a change is necessary. \u201cNo,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, told CNN when asked if she would support eliminating the 60-vote threshold. \u201cI think we should look at ways to reform the filibuster, but I don\u2019t think getting rid of it is the best approach.\u201d New Hampshire\u2019s junior Democratic senator, Maggie Hassan, who faces a tough reelection bid next year, also has \u201cconcerns about eliminating the filibuster,\u201d a spokesperson said, though backs some reforms. What that means: Democratic ambitions to pass landmark legislation like an expansion of voting access and a major immigration bill will either fall by the wayside \u2013 or will have to be pared back substantially to win the support of at least 10 GOP senators. And any compromise would have to pass muster in the House, where progressives remain a dominant force. Manchin, a conservative West Virginia Democrat, told CNN repeatedly in an interview that \u201cno,\u201d he will not cave to pressure to gut the 60-vote threshold, even if Republicans block a voting rights bill. Democrats had hoped that a likely GOP filibuster on their party\u2019s bill to expand voting access and overhaul the elections would be enough to convince Manchin and others to do away with the filibuster\u2019s 60-vote threshold \u2013 given the onslaught of Republican-led efforts on the state level to impose new restrictions. But Manchin made clear that a Republican blockade of a voting bill won\u2019t change his mind. \u201cNo, it will not, no, no,\u201d said Manchin, who also wants changes to his party\u2019s election bill, S.1., before considering supporting it. \u201cThey are reading that totally wrong.\u201d Manchin added he won\u2019t give up trying to cut deals with Republicans, even as many of his colleagues see little chance that the GOP will try to advance Biden\u2019s goals and see now as the best opportunity to pass Democrats\u2019 agenda with the prospects of a Republican takeover in the 2022 midterms very real. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing I will say to all my colleagues: When\u2019s the last time you had dinner with one of them? \u2026 So don\u2019t start telling me about, \u2018Oh, you give up\u2019 \u2026 If I give up on that, I give up on humanity,\u201d Manchin said. Fact check: Breaking down 10 claims about the Democrats' elections bill After passing a major $1.9 trillion relief bill on the support of just Democrats, the next major test will whether Democrats can do the same on a $3 trillion infrastructure and tax-and-spending package that the White House wants to move in the months ahead. Democratic leaders are looking at splitting up the bill into several parts in the House. And if Republicans filibuster those plans in the Senate, they are considering tying it all together in one budget package that cannot be filibustered under the rules of the chamber, a process similar that led to the enactment of the Covid plan. Keeping Democratic unity through that process, however, remains another question. And the White House will need all 50 Democrats on board to pass such a proposal, assuming Republicans vote in opposition. Yet even if the filibuster were gutted, the Biden administration\u2019s challenges wouldn\u2019t end there. Democratic divisions \u2013 at times \u2013 would be even more apparent without Democrats\u2019 ability to blame Republicans for standing in their way. With a 50-50 Senate, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s Senate majority would still be razor thin and every piece of legislation would require complete unity on the part of the Democratic caucus. And Manchin isn\u2019t the only one who could be a liability. On the issue of guns, there are still challenges to get every Democrat to back the House-passed bill to expand background checks on both commercial sales as well as private transfers, including to family members. The bill that Manchin tried to advance in 2013, along with GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, would only apply to commercial sales and require background checks when firearms are purchased over the Internet and at gun shows. The broader House bill has caused some concerns among some more moderate Senate Democrats, beyond just Manchin, who opposes the two Democratic bills. \u201cI mean, look, I\u2019m from Montana. I\u2019ve got more than I need and fewer than I want, but background checks are important,\u201d Tester said. \u201cI do believe that. But you can go too far on that ship pretty fast too.\u201d Senate GOP continues to resist push for expanded background checks in aftermath of recent mass shootings Tester added: \u201cI am for background checks. There is a caveat for handing down within the family and not requiring a background check.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d have to see,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan said when asked if he\u2019d back the House-passed bills. \u201cI have always supported comprehensive background checks. We have to make sure it is comprehensive\u2026 I will have to look at the details of it.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, a longtime proponent of stricter gun laws, is mapping out his party\u2019s strategy along with Schumer and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a fellow Connecticut Democrat. He says that the divide with Republicans \u2013 who are battling any restrictions on guns, even in the wake of more mass shootings \u2013 is far greater than among Democrats. But Murphy acknowledges more work needs to be done to unify his caucus behind the House Democrats\u2019 approach. \u201cJoe and I have a great personal and working relationship, but he is not the only one that is going to have changes to HR 8 that they want to entertain,\u201d Murphy said, referring to Manchin. Now, Senate Democrats are having discussions about modifying the House-passed bill in order to win over holdouts in their own caucus and potentially some Republicans too, according to sources familiar with the matter. Schumer is still planning to bring up the two House bills as soon as next month to expand background checks. But since those measures have fewer than 50 votes, some Democrats are exploring whether a third option could win over at least Manchin, Tester and potentially woo some Republicans in the process. Democrats are eager to have their caucus united behind one approach, one of the sources said, even though they almost certainly won\u2019t have the 60 votes needed to break a GOP-led filibuster. Yet the Democratic divisions expand beyond just guns. Despite overwhelming support in the House for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, there were eight Senate Democrats who voted against moving ahead on the provision in February. Republicans and Democrats have found one thing they can all rally around: Curbing China's influence And during a closed-door meeting with their leadership Tuesday, Democratic senators didn\u2019t come to a consensus about how to move forward. Some senators have pushed for raising the minimum wage to just $11 an hour, others have voiced concerns with requiring a $15 minimum wage for tipped workers. Some have argued that a regional minimum wage would make more sense, an idea rejected by progressives. Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who voted against the minimum wage increase in February, said he\u2019s not opposed to some changes to the minimum wage, but that he believes the economy has to recover first. \u201cThere were eight of us who weren\u2019t comfortable,\u201d Carper said. \u201cRight now we are in the worst economic recession since the Great Depression and we may want to wait just a little later into the year. I want us to be careful we don\u2019t have unintended consequences.\u201d Right now, the filibuster \u2013 while it slows down the progressive agenda\u2013 shields Democratic leaders from having to immediately contend with a caucus that isn\u2019t always in lockstep. Without moderates like Manchin, the party would have a hard time keeping a seat in a state that Biden lost overwhelmingly last year. And with those members, the job of pushing through a liberal agenda gets harder. \u201cWe\u2019re a big tent party,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be in the majority if Sen. Manchin weren\u2019t in the caucus.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sarah Fortinsky and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden opened his first presidential news conference Thursday with a new promise to get 200 million Covid vaccine shots in American arms by the end of April \u2013 and then spent the rest of the hour defending his administration\u2019s immigration policy and teasing openness to ending the Senate filibuster. The questions mostly focused on the immigration crisis at the border, but ran the gamut from Biden\u2019s plans for dealing China, running again in 2024 and protecting voting rights. What\u2019s below is the speed read version of the hourlong event, with key excerpts from each of his answers along with what they meant. Subtext: Will you back ending the filibuster? First, Biden answered that he\u2019s going to continue to focus on Covid and the economy. BIDEN: The fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage or the millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent. But he thinks Republicans have a choice to make. BIDEN: Here\u2019s the deal. I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2013 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division, but I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come. And the bottom line is, Biden thinks he can get a lot done without Republicans, and pointed to his Covid relief bill as evidence. BIDEN: All I know, I\u2019ve been hired to solve problems, to solve problems, not create division. Biden said former President Donald Trump tried to dismantle the US immigration and border system and disputed that there\u2019s a larger influx of migrants now that he\u2019s President. BIDEN: What we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild, rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today. And I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year. He said most of the kids at the border are teenagers, not young kids, that most people apprehended are sent back to their home country and that his administration is working to place them with family members in the US much more quickly. He also said he\u2019s working with Mexico to take back more of the families who are detained at the border. After rattling off statistics about the rise in filibusters in recent years, Biden said he supports a return to the so-called \u201ctalking filibuster.\u201d BIDEN: It used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster and get a quorum and vote. He added that he\u2019ll go further if he has to. BIDEN: We\u2019re ready to get a lot done. If we have to, if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what I\u2019m talking about. Biden was in the Senate for a very long time, but now he\u2019s President \u2013 and he made clear that fixing the Senate is not his problem. BIDEN: Our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate. But in the meantime, we\u2019ve got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster. ABC\u2019s Cecilia Vega told Biden she met a 9-year-old at the border whose mother sent him specifically because Biden would be more humane. BIDEN: Look, the idea that I\u2019m going to say, which I would never do, if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border we\u2019re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side \u2026 no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m not going to do it. In Vega\u2019s follow-up, she noted that kids are sleeping on floors and aren\u2019t seeing the sun. So, she asked: Is that acceptable? BIDEN: Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving 1,000 of those kids out quickly. That\u2019s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working from the moment this started happening to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely, not just children, but particularly children, to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening. That is totally unacceptable. Biden has been navigating how to meet a May 1 deadline to withdraw all US troops from the country that was agreed between former President Donald Trump and the Taliban. BIDEN: The answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, hard to get those troops out. \u2026 But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. Follow-up: Will there be US troops in Afghanistan next year? BIDEN: I can\u2019t picture that being the case. The Biden administration has not allowed journalists to independently visit facilities housing kids, but several lawmakers have visited them. Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar earlier this week provided CNN with photos revealing the conditions for dozens of children and adults in an overflow facility in Donna, Texas. Biden said his administration needed more time. BIDEN: I will commit to transparency, and as soon as I\u2019m in a position to be able to implement what we\u2019re doing right now. One of the reasons I haven\u2019t gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don\u2019t want to become the issue. I don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So, this is being set up and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving. Follow-up: Did you unwind Trump border policies too quickly? BIDEN: Rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in the muddy circumstance with not enough to eat, I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that. On Wednesday, North Korea launched two ballistic missiles. South Korea\u2019s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that two short-range missiles had been fired from the Hamju area of South Hamgyong province toward the sea, off North Korea\u2019s east coast, at 7:06 a.m. and 7:25 a.m. Thursday local time. BIDEN: We\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners and there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly, but I\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy. But it has to be conditioned upon the end result of de-nuclearization. Follow-up: What do you mean by diplomacy? Biden didn\u2019t answer directly, but he did agree that North Korea is his top foreign policy item to watch. One reason the filibuster matters is because Democrats want to pass voting rights legislation in Congress \u2013 in part to counter Republican moves in the states to add restrictions. As the press conference was getting underway, Georgia\u2019s Republican-controlled state legislature was moving ahead with a bill that would set new rules on voting in a state that was pivotal to Biden\u2019s victory \u2013 as well as to sealing Democratic control of the US Senate. Conservative groups nationally have unified behind the effort, drawing comparisons to Jim Crow from Black activists \u2013 a precedent that Biden also brought up. BIDEN: What I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick. Deciding in some states that you can not bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at 5 o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?\u2026 I\u2019m convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. Follow-up: What can you do besides pass legislation out of Congress? BIDEN: The answer is, yes, but I\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. Trump had already set up a re-election committee at this point in his first term, the questioner noted. BIDEN: My predecessor needed to. My predecessor. Oh, god, I miss him. No, and the answer is yes, my plan is to run for re-election. Follow-up: What\u2019s the relationship like with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell? BIDEN: I would like Republican \u2013 elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I\u2019m doing. Again, Biden was a creature of the Senate for most of his Washington life, and he has been hesitant about calling for total evisceration of its rules \u2013 even as he agreed that it is a relic of America\u2019s racist past. (For more on that, head here.) The question: Why not get rid of it? BIDEN: (Long pause) Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let\u2019s deal with the abuse first. Follow-up: So are you running for re-election? BIDEN: I said that is my expectation\u2026 Look, I don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. I\u2019ve never been able to travel. I\u2019m a great respecter of fate. I\u2019ve never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain. Follow-up to the follow-up: Do you think you\u2019ll be running against Trump? BIDEN: I don\u2019t even think about \u2013 I have no idea. \u2026 Look, this is \u2013 the way I view things, I become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working, decent American people really having it stuck to them\u2026 I\u2019ve not been able to unite the Congress but I\u2019ve been uniting the country. Based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to \u2026 To me it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people. Just hard-working people. Biden did not directly answer the question from Bloomberg\u2019s Justin Sink, which was about whether he\u2019d lift the tariffs Trump put in place. But he did go in-depth about his conversations with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, pledged to keep the US competitive with China and voiced his commitment to standing up for freedom and his faith in democracy. BIDEN: I predict to you, your children or grandchildren, are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded, autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake. Not just with China. Look around the world. We\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence \u2026 This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don\u2019t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It\u2019s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. We got to prove democracy works. It took most of the hour to get to a question connected to the supermarket shooting in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this week, and what Biden plans to do on guns \u2013 which may not be much. BIDEN: It\u2019s a matter of timing. As you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing. Order it. Deciding priorities. What needs to be done. Then Biden pivoted to what his priorities are \u2013 including infrastructure. BIDEN: The next major initiative is, and I\u2019ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail, is to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure of this country, so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs, really good-paying jobs. He then described at length how he wants to improve airports, ports, schools, energy efficiency, water availability and more. (Also, he misstated when his trip to Pittsburgh will be \u2013 it\u2019s next week.) Reporters who have traveled to the border were hard on Biden, who said he has not gone because he doesn\u2019t want to create a distraction \u2013 but insisted his administration is going to fix things. BIDEN: They\u2019re already getting better but they\u2019re going to get real, a whole hell of a lot better real quick and we\u2019re going to hear some people leaving, okay? We can get this done. Follow-up: Vice President Kamala Harris is now in charge of diplomatic efforts to stop people from traveling north. But those efforts won\u2019t work overnight. BIDEN: It\u2019s not like somebody sitting on a hand-hewn table in Guatemala or somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe saying, \u2018I got a great idea, let\u2019s sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, have him take our kids across the border into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language, won\u2019t that be fun? Let\u2019s go.\u2019 That\u2019s not how it happens. People don\u2019t want to leave. He repeated that most of the people arriving at the border are not small children. BIDEN: I realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching, and it is, to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old, but you went down there and you saw the vast majority of these children, 70%, are 16 years old, 17 years old and mostly males. Doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent, but the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these god-awful facilities that are really little babies, crying all night, there\u2019s some, that\u2019s true. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got got to act. Last follow-up: Has he talked to Republicans about immigration reform? BIDEN: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They\u2019ve sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a \u2013 but I\u2019m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem. Or make the situation better. And with that, he left.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden is holding his first formal news conference on Thursday and will likely face scrutiny over his administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing number of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the border and gun control, among many other pressing issues. The news conference comes more than two months into Biden\u2019s presidency, which is behind many of his predecessors. Fifteen of Biden\u2019s predecessors held a solo news conference within 33 days of taking office, according to a CNN analysis of the past 100 years. But Biden regularly answers questions from reporters at events at the White House or on its South Lawn. Biden is set to formally take questions after signing his first major legislative achievement, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, into law. The legislation has funds allocated to help schools reopen safely, for the national vaccination effort and direct economic relief for Americans.   The briefing also comes as the nation reels from mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia that together killed 18 people in less than a week. Biden has pushed the Senate to pass a pair of House-approved gun control laws expanding background checks and an assault weapon ban. The measures don\u2019t currently have enough support to pass \u2013 and the White House hasn\u2019t ruled out taking executive action. Here\u2019s what to watch during Biden\u2019s first formal news conference of his presidency: Biden administration not confident Johnson & Johnson will meet 20 million goal by end of month More than 544,700 Americans had died from Covid-19 as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 130,400,000 Covid-19 doses have been administered in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The US has a seven-day average of administering about 2.5 million doses per day. A month ago, the seven-day average was about 1.5 million, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. The administration surpassed its goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots well within Biden\u2019s goal of doing so in his 100 days in office. Biden is expected to announce his new vaccination goal on Thursday. If Americans continue to get vaccinated and follow health and safety guidelines, Biden said there is a \u201cgood chance\u201d that family and friends will be able to celebrate the Fourth of July together in small groups.\u00a0The President directed states to make all adults eligible to get Covid-19 vaccines by May 1. When and how schools can reopen safely is a national hot-button issue, and many students have been out of classrooms for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden has set a goal of reopening a majority of schools within his first 100 days in office. How the current US-Mexico border crisis compares with the peak of the Trump era in 2019 The Biden administration is scrambling to find adequate housing for the rising number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border. Biden has said that he will travel to the border at some point, and senior administration officials and lawmakers have already made the trip down to see facilities housing the migrants. A group of White House officials and members of Congress toured a Texas facility on Wednesday holding unaccompanied migrant children and for the first time under the Biden administration a news camera was allowed inside. There are more than 16,000 unaccompanied children in US custody, including around 4,800 in US Customs and Border Protection custody and 11,300 in Department of Health and Human Services custody. As of Sunday, more than 800 unaccompanied migrant children had been in Border Patrol custody for more than 10 days, according to documents reviewed by CNN. Federal law requires unaccompanied children to be turned over within 72 hours to HHS, which oversees a shelter network designed to house minors, but amid constraints related to the pandemic, children are staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit. Biden's heartfelt plea for gun control adds to daunting policy wish list Biden has called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and has urged the Senate to pass two gun safety bills that have already cleared the House of Representatives. But the chances the Senate passes any gun legislation remain highly unlikely given it would require significant Republican support. The White House is weighing whether to issue a number of gun safety measures through executive action. But Vice President Kamala Harris noted Wednesday morning: \u201cIf we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation.\u201d The mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, this week killed 10 people. Less than a week prior, the shootings in Atlanta left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Biden says he supports bringing back the Senate's talking filibuster rule Some Democrats in Congress want to change Senate rules so they can use their slim majority to pass things unlikely to garner Republican support, such as a voting rights bill or the massive infrastructure package that Biden is expected to introduce. Right now they need to garner 60 votes to overcome Republican objection \u2013 or, filibuster \u2013 a tally that requires several Republicans to join Democrats. Biden\u2019s legislative agenda will be greatly affected by whether the filibuster stays or goes. The President has said he supports changing\u00a0the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule\u00a0by bringing back the talking filibuster, requiring a senator who wants to block legislation to hold the floor without taking a break. The Covid-19 relief package was able to pass through Congress because of a special budget process called reconciliation, which Democrats used to advance the legislation in the chamber with only a simple majority and no Republican support. But those rules can\u2019t apply to things such as gun control or voting rights because they aren\u2019t budget related. White House aides prep $3 trillion jobs package for Biden White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to Biden as soon as this week, CNN has reported. The proposal, the White House\u2019s next major legislative agenda item, would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the jobs agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his presidential campaign. The proposal, which Biden\u2019s top advisers have been deliberating over for weeks, would be segmented into two separate parts \u2013 one focused on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second on what\u2019s being termed the \u201ccare economy\u201d with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues. The package will explode spending and is also expected to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, as well as increase the corporate tax rate. North Korea fires two ballistic missiles, senior US official says Biden will take the stage as a series of perennial foreign policy challenges arise, including North Korea testing missiles and a looming decision on when and how to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. Both are fraught with history and complicated factors to weigh \u2013 particularly in Afghanistan where the US has been mired in war for two decades. Pulling out, however, could cause further damage and decline in a country so much American blood has spilled to democracy build. The President is also sure to get questions about his team\u2019s harsh words with China and his own verbal jousting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Talks with China in Alaska got off to a rocky start and hot tempers, over issues such as trade and cybersecurity. Russia, meanwhile, has been accused of election interference in both the 2016 and 2020 election by top US national security experts. Biden will surely get asked about how he plans to navigate both adversaries while reestablishing the United States as a world leader on human rights.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s first two months in power went remarkably smoothly considering he took office amid a once-in-a-century pandemic, a consequent economic crisis and his predecessor\u2019s refusal to recognize his victory. But in his first formal news conference Thursday, he\u2019ll face scrutiny on gun control and immigration, two sudden tests of leadership for which his administration has lacked immediate answers. Biden is expected to highlight blasting through his 100 million doses in 100 days timeline and the passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue bill, which, along with other social legislation in the planning stages, suggests that he is in the process of shaping the most progressive and ambitious Democratic presidency in decades. The doubling of the pace of vaccinations in the last two months represents tangible progress on the one issue on which Biden\u2019s first year will likely be mostly judged \u2013 the quest to revive a semblance of normal life. 30 questions for Biden's first press conference \u201cNow is not the time to let down our guard. If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America. \u2026 We\u2019re going to beat this pandemic,\u201d Biden said in Ohio on Tuesday, striking the balance between caution and hope that has marked his management of the pandemic, which polls show wins the approval of a majority of Americans. That is no doubt the message the White House hopes Americans will take away from the news conference Thursday afternoon. But the 78-year-old commander-in-chief can expect a grilling on a fast-expanding front of tough issues coming at his administration on all sides, which shows how quickly unforeseen events can challenge a president. A surge in border crossings by migrant children appeared to catch a White House focused on the pandemic off guard and offered Republicans an opening as they seek to slow his momentum \u2013 and build their 2022 attack lines against Biden\u2019s narrow Democratic congressional majority. Biden is also under pressure to explain how he can make good on his calls for sweeping gun control reforms after two mass shootings in a week and while opposing a rewrite of Senate filibuster rules, which appears the only way for Democrats to get new laws on the books amid staunch GOP opposition. The President must also appeal to all Americans to embrace the government\u2019s vaccination program as polls show many conservative voters reluctant to roll up their sleeves \u2013 a trend that could threaten achievement of the herd immunity needed to end the pandemic. And after escalating rhetorical conflicts with nuclear-armed rivals Russia and China, Biden has a chance Thursday to explain the principles behind his foreign policy at a moment when rivals sense US weakness and are seeking advantage. And with its customary sense of timing, North Korea is testing the new commander-in-chief with missile launches that are ratcheting up tensions in a showdown that no president in the last 70 years has managed to solve. The President has maintained approval ratings above 50% in his early months in office because he arrived with a mandate to tackle the pandemic head on and executed his agenda with a steady approach that was the antithesis of the erratic, combative presidency of Donald Trump. Though he was unable to win bipartisan congressional support for his American Rescue Plan, Biden had the backing of the American people to get it passed \u2013 and could argue he was acting with bipartisan support nationally if not in Washington. Three-ring binders and 14-point font: How Biden preps for a news conference The White House has maintained a disciplined regime of televised events and strict messaging that recalled the successful approach of an election campaign that saw Biden make most appearances online because of the pandemic, save for well-executed scripted events like the Democratic National Convention and his participation in two presidential debates. But a rush of events in recent days has challenged that strategy, increasing calls among journalists for Biden to answer questions in a traditional setting. The President is holding his first formal White House news conference later in his term than his 15 most recent predecessors, who faced the music within 33 days of taking office, according to a CNN analysis of the last 100 years. Unlike the coronavirus crisis that has killed more than half-a-million Americans, the issues that are now at the top of the nightly newscasts have defied bipartisan consensus for decades \u2013 and will provide a severe test of the President\u2019s calls for national unity and cooperation between Democrats and Republicans. In the nearly two weeks since Biden signed the rescue bill \u2013 at a time he had hoped to be taking a victory lap and explaining the elements of the legislation to voters \u2013 he has confronted mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado, that took the lives of 18 people, entrenched racism directed at Asian Americans, and the humanitarian crisis at the border where the number of people apprehended could now be on pace to exceed the levels that the Trump administration faced in 2019. The White House\u2019s refusal to call the influx of children across the border a crisis \u2013 after changing, on humanitarian grounds, the Trump-era rules under which kids were sent back to Mexico \u2013 left the administration open to criticism that it had not thought through early immigration changes. Two years ago, Democrats excoriated Trump administration officials for its handling of the crisis at the border. Now the problem is squarely within Biden\u2019s domain and government resources are once again strained to the brink as more than 600 unaccompanied children cross the Mexico border each day. As images emerge of children crowded together in plexiglass holding areas, sitting and sleeping on mats on the floor wrapped in Mylar blankets, it is the Biden administration that is facing charges of hypocrisy, inhumanity and a lack of transparency as children languish in Border Patrol facilities, akin to jail-like conditions, that the press hasn\u2019t had access to. Facing constraints related to the coronavirus pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services hasn\u2019t been able to accommodate the growing number of arrivals. On Wednesday, the administration notified Congress of its intent to use a third convention center in San Antonio, Texas, to shelter the arriving children, and the Pentagon approved a request from HHS to temporarily house unaccompanied migrant children at two Texas military bases. The same day, a dozen retired Border Patrol chiefs who served in administrations from both parties called out congressional leadership for their inaction, noting that the US immigration system is outdated and not equipped to handle migrant families and children. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any action. Our experience has taught us that now is the time to act. We need Congress to get on board. We need a recognition of the fact that there\u2019s a crisis on the Southwest border,\u201d Roy Villareal, who served as chief patrol agent in the Tucson sector from 2018 to 2020, told CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez. With pressure mounting on Congress to direct more resources to the issue \u2013 and on Biden to find a solution \u2013 the administration took a minimal step toward transparency into border conditions by allowing a network pool camera to accompany members of Congress and White House officials to a Wednesday visit to a Texas facility holding unaccompanied migrant children. It\u2019s a facility intended for the care of children and an example of the types of shelters the administration has been scrambling to find more of \u2013 unlike the Border Patrol facilities, which are supposed to be an interim step in the process. When questioned about the fact that the Biden administration has not allowed news cameras inside Customs and Border Protection facilities where children have been detained for longer than the three days allowed under law, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the White House was looking for ways to increase access to journalists. \u201cThis is just the first step in a process of providing greater access to the media,\u201d Psaki said during a news briefing. \u201cWe all agree that the Border Patrol facilities are not places where children should be. They are, children should be moving more quickly through those facilities. That is what our policy central focus is right now,\u201d Psaki said. The lack of broad press access so far has called into question the administration\u2019s commitment to transparency, especially after the Trump administration\u2019s assaults on the press and Biden\u2019s repeated pledges to tell the American people the whole truth, no matter how bad a situation gets. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked by Biden Wednesday with overseeing the outreach to Central American countries to try to halt the flow of migrants to the US southern border, faced a preview of some of the difficult questions that Biden will encounter Thursday during an interview with CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem. I\u2019m not going to pretend that it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Harris said in remarks that appeared to be somewhat of a do-over of the administration\u2019s initial downplaying of the situation. \u201cAre we looking at overcrowding at the border, in particular these kids? Yes. Should these kids be in the custody of HHS, the Health and Human Services, instead of the Border Patrol? Yes. Should we be processing these cases faster? Yes.\u201d \u201cThis is, however, not going to be solved overnight,\u201d the vice president said. The appointment of Harris is one of the most high profile efforts that Biden could make to stress the seriousness with which his administration is now taking the border crisis \u2013 and offers a chance for the vice president to burnish her own political and foreign policy skills as she contemplates a possible run for the top job in future. \u201cI asked her, the VP today, because she\u2019s the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday. But beyond Harris\u2019 new oversight role, Biden will face many more questions about how his administration can actually stop that movement across the southern border and create long-term solutions in partnership with Congress. As with so many of the intractable problems he is now facing, there aren\u2019t likely to be easy answers at his news conference Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Footage from the January 6 riot at the US Capitol shows a close ally of Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene inside the building. CNN previously reported that Anthony Aguero, a conservative live-streamer, activist and associate of Greene, said on video following the riot that he had been among those who entered the building. At the time of that February report, Aguero declined to answer if he had been inside when pressed by CNN. He claimed videos later posted to social media accounts from both inside the Capitol and outside were not his, but screen recorded from others. The publicly posted videos of the riot reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile are now the first \u200bvisual confirmation\u200b that Aguero went inside the building. Aguero previously confirmed to CNN that he was at the Capitol on January 6 and said he was an \u201cindependent journalist\u201d there reporting the events. Aguero, however, appears to have never uploaded any footage he took inside the Capitol to Facebook or Instagram. And in videos previously reported on by CNN, he can be heard chanting \u201cheave ho\u201d as rioters were attempting to break in on the West Side of the Capitol. In a comment, Aguero wrote \u201cMAGA\u201d under the video. Later, Aguero can be heard chanting \u201cour house\u201d among the Capitol mob on the East Side of the building. In a video immediately filmed following the riot, Aguero said \u201ca message was sent.\u201d He later described those who broke in as \u201cpatriots,\u201d and commented \u201c#PatriotsSaveAmerica2021! Not Antifa/BLM!!!\u201d in a since-removed comment made immediately following the ransacking of the Capitol by rioters. The FBI said last month that it had received nearly 200,000 digital tips from the public related to the Capitol riot, mainly from people who documented it. The FBI previously declined to comment on whether it was investigating Aguero in an email to CNN. Aguero declined to comment and Greene\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment. Greene, the freshman congresswoman with a history of promoting dangerous and fringe conspiracies and comments, encouraged the big lie that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump by voting to object to the election\u2019s certification. She fanned the flames ahead of the Capitol insurrection by telling her supporters \u200bon Twitter to \u200b\u201dFIGHT. FOR. TRUMP.\u201d On Friday, Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez introduced a resolution to expel Greene from Congress, suggesting that she \u201cadvocated violence against our peers, the Speaker and our government.\u201d In a statement last week to CNN, Greene commented on the resolution, saying \u201cHouse Democrats have declared war on House Republican Women,\u201d adding that \u201cDemocrats are trying overturn the will of the People who voted for both myself and Congresswoman Miller-Meeks.\u201d Footage shows Aguero inside the Capitol, just inside and just outside the Rotunda near what are known as the Columbus Doors. The historic bronze doors on the East Front of the Capitol, facing the Supreme Court, were first installed in 1863 and sustained damage from rioters who broke into the building through them. In one video, posted on Instagram, Aguero is briefly seen inside the Rotunda among rioters as they are held back by police. In another video, Aguero appears to be exiting the Rotunda, though it is unclear where he goes because he disappears into the crowd. It is not clear how long Aguero was in the Capitol, or where he entered. \u200bSome protesters broke in through the Columbus Doors during the riot. Later, other footage shows Aguero \u200bstanding outside the building, near the doors. The exact timing of those videos is unclear, though one publicly posted video lists the time Aguero was exiting the Rotunda as just after 3 p.m ET. The first rioters entered the building around 2:15pm on the West Side of the building and a video posted by Aguero shows him\u200bcheering on what appears to be the initial break in on the West Side of the Capitol facing the National Mall. Footage shows the Columbus Doors were first forced open around what is time stamped as 2:30 p.m. A video posted by Aguero on Facebook on January 6 shows him\u200b standing outside the East Front of the Capitol chanting \u201cour house,\u201d among the rioters. In a since-deleted livestream from another conservative live-streamer, Aguero is seen standing near the steps on what appears to be the eastern side of the Capitol after the Capitol was breached. In videos posted following the Capitol riot, Aguero repeatedly boasted about entering the building and attacked those who claimed it was the work of \u201cAntifa.\u201d \u201cA message was sent,\u201d Aguero said in the video streamed live on January 6 while walking away from the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue following the riot. \u201cThese politicians are not going to continue to get away with the abuse as they\u2019ve been doing. We will continue to press on these individuals.\u201d \u201cThe National Guard has just been called in,\u201d he continued. \u201cA woman was shot in the face earlier. There was blood all over the floor. I recorded it for y\u2019all. I could not go live during the whole event because the signal was either jammed purposely or there was just too many, too many people out there. Guys, I was able to make it inside the chambers and I have footage that I\u2019m going to provide for you guys as we made our way in there.\u201d Greene and Aguero have worked closely together over the years on causes such as immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border wall and have attended pro-Trump rallies together. In many since-deleted videos saved by CNN\u2019s KFile, Greene repeatedly calls Aguero \u201camazing\u201d and a \u201cfriend.\u201d On social media, Aguero has called Greene \u201cone of my closest friends.\u201d Prior to January\u2019s riot at the Capitol, Greene was photographed with Aguero in Washington at the \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d post-election rally, also known as the Million MAGA March, on November 14, 2020, where Greene spoke. Following Greene\u2019s speech, Aguero accompanied Greene off the stage in a video of the rally. A November tweet of the pair at the rally was liked by Greene. CNN\u2019s Richard J. Chang contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has set the price of admission for Republicans in the midterm elections, and probably the next presidential race: an embrace of the big lie that he was cheated out of office by a historic voter fraud operation. The former President\u2019s effort to turn 2022 polls into a personal revenge mission and to replenish his personality cult got a big boost Monday when a comrade-in-arms, Rep. Mo Brooks, launched an Alabama US Senate run. Brooks is the latest Republican to seek to leverage his efforts to thwart a democratic election as a springboard for higher office. He led a push in the House to block the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory after telling Trump supporters at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that turned into the Capitol insurrection on January 6: \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Even Brooks admitted Monday that his campaign launch rally in Huntsville, Alabama, would not be quite so hyper. But he built the foundation for his run on proven falsehoods just the same. \u201cIn 2020, America suffered the worst voter fraud and election theft in history,\u201d Brooks said, claiming no other candidate for the US Senate had stood as strongly as he had alongside Trump. Channeling his hero, he slammed \u201cweak-kneed RINOs,\u201d the \u201cfake news media\u201d and \u201cradical socialists.\u201d Multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the ex-President\u2019s claims of election cheating. Even Trump\u2019s own Justice Department said that there was no widespread electoral fraud last year. In a new court filing, lawyer Sidney Powell, who is facing a defamation suit from electoral infrastructure firm Dominion Voting Systems, said reasonable people would not accept her claims of voter fraud made on behalf of the ex-President as fact. Brooks, who figures to have a strong chance of winning the GOP nomination and the Alabama seat, given Trump\u2019s fervent support there, launched his effort alongside Stephen Miller, the hardline former White House official who authored many of the ex-President\u2019s tough immigration policies. \u201cNobody over the last four years has had President\u2019s Trump\u2019s back more than Mo Brooks,\u201d Miller told the crowd. \u201cBut now, I need you to have his back.\u201d Brooks, who is running for the seat long held by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, a classic old-school conservative, was not the only member of Trump\u2019s army targeting the Senate on Monday. Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, who also fanned false claims about election fraud, and who had resigned amid allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, announced a bid for the seat of retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. Greitens opened his campaign on Fox News and said he was running to \u201cdefend President Trump\u2019s America First policies.\u201d The new recruits for Trump\u2019s efforts to demonstrate his continuing hold on the GOP showed their stripes as the ex-President made a parallel bid to dismantle the democratic safeguards that confirmed his loss in Georgia last November. Trump on Monday endorsed GOP Rep. Jody Hice for Georgia secretary of state \u2013 after attacking the incumbent, Brad Raffensperger, who had stood firm against Trump\u2019s pressure on local officials to rig vote counts. Hice has falsely claimed that there were multiple examples of fraud in Georgia, the key state that handed Democrats control of a 50-50 Senate in runoff elections in January. Other outspoken pro-Trump Republican candidates are considering or have launched Senate campaigns in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania where more GOP incumbents are retiring. Proteges of the ex-President are lining up challenges against some of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting an unprecedented and deadly insurrection designed to destroy basic US democratic principles. The former President signaled to potential GOP candidates the price of his endorsement when he reemerged at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month, where he warned that Republicans needed to back an end to mail-in voting and called out GOP lawmakers who had voted to impeach him by name. The former President\u2019s shadow in 2022 will ensure that yet another election will be dominated by his pernicious claims that voting in America is corrupt  \u2013 with all the consequent damage to US democracy that brings. Controversial congressman could emerge as favorite in Alabama Senate race despite inflammatory remarks Trump\u2019s unending campaign of lies coincides with an effort across multiple states by local Republicans to suppress votes and reverse voting methods that resulted in a record turnout and his clear defeat in November. The rededication of the party to Trump\u2019s populist nationalist creed \u2013 characterized by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s visit to Mar-a-Lago earlier this year \u2013 helps explain the drive to make it more difficult for Democrats and minority voters to get to the polls. The GOP could have rejected Trumpism and tried to broaden its appeal to win over more voters. But it doubled down on the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d themes that lost the House, the Senate and a reelection race in Trump\u2019s single term \u2013 so may need to attempt to muffle the voice of the majority of the nation that rejected the ex-President. While the strategy may make sense in a base turnout election, it does pose questions for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who strongly repudiated Trump\u2019s behavior on January 6. The influence of the ex-President threatens to deliver a slate of radical candidates that in some scenarios could make it tougher for Republicans to win swing states \u2013 in elections that history suggests should be tough for first-term Biden. The announcement by Greitens had been feared by the GOP establishment amid worries he could put a safe Republican seat at risk in 2022. The former governor\u2019s run is stirring some dark memories among conservatives of Todd Akin\u2019s 2012 loss to Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Still, McConnell, as always with a shrewd eye on power, hedged by voting to acquit Trump in the Senate impeachment trial that took place after the former commander in chief had left office. And with typical transactional pragmatism he has signaled that he will seek candidates who can win \u2013 from whichever wing of the party they hail \u2013 for the midterm elections. McConnell quietly courts Senate primary candidates 'who can win' regardless of Trump ties Trump\u2019s attempt to project his considerable enduring power in the Republican Party through the opening exchanges of primary races could help him build a case for a fresh presidential election campaign himself in 2024. Or it may enable him to perform a kingmaker role with wannabe GOP White House candidates jostling to serve as heir to his faithful base voters. Potential candidates thought to have White House ambitions, such as  Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, are loud advocates for Trump. Others, such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have built bridges with the ex-President\u2019s voters. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is enjoying attention as a potential successor to Trump in holding the \u201cAmerica First\u201d banner after throwing open his state before the end of the pandemic. The former President\u2019s aggressive strategy will also test whether his aura is enduring \u2013 or if his time out of the spotlight will begin to erode his influence. At the same time, it will show whether there is any lane left in the GOP for Republican candidates who rejected his false 2020 reality. Brooks and Greitens are not the only Trump lite candidates to borrow the ex-President\u2019s aura to bless a new Senate primary campaign. In Ohio, where another establishment Republican, Sen. Rob Portman, is also retiring, former state Treasurer Josh Mandel launched his Senate campaign last month by also amplifying the big lie. \u201cI think over time we\u2019re going to see studies come out that evidence widespread fraud,\u201d Mandel told WKYC television. \u201cBut I think when we look back on this election, we\u2019ll see in large part that it was stolen from President Trump.\u201d Trump is already inspiring like-minded challengers in House races. His camp has vowed to unseat the third-ranking Republican House leader, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, in a primary race after she repelled a challenge to her leadership role by Trump supporters after voting for his impeachment. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, unlike a majority of his House GOP colleagues, sharply criticized Trump\u2019s assault on American democracy in January. He has already drawn a primary challenger for his pains. Catalina Lauf, a former Trump administration official, opened her campaign by slamming Kinzinger\u2019s impeachment vote and echoing the ex-President\u2019s assaults on \u201csocialist\u201d Democrats, \u201celection integrity\u201d and cancel culture. Signing off her announcement video, she uttered a statement that was far closer to the truth than much of what is said by the ex-President\u2019s foot soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s our party now, it\u2019s our movement and it\u2019s America First,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "As the number of unaccompanied children in Border Patrol custody ballooned this month, President Joe Biden\u2019s team raced to find more places to house them, leaving thousands of children stuck in jail-like facilities for longer than the 72 hours allowed under the law. But the process of scouring government sites for adequate shelters was taking too long for Biden, who is now staring down a problem threatening to spiral out of control. \u201cHe was disappointed that we hadn\u2019t gotten answers from other agencies faster or that (the facilities) wouldn\u2019t be ready for children faster,\u201d said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment of the response. \u201cHe made it pretty clear that there were times when he didn\u2019t think we were moving fast enough.\u201d From its earliest weeks in office, the Biden administration has been playing catch up, scrambling to stem a growing immigration crisis on the US southern border, where there are now more than 14,000 unaccompanied children in US custody, officials said Thursday. Republicans have assailed Biden\u2019s handling of the situation, blaming his early actions to overturn some of the Trump administration\u2019s draconian border enforcement policies for inducing what is shaping up to be a historic surge of migrants to the border. \u201cThese are all self-inflicted wounds,\u201d a Homeland Security official said. Interviews with more than a dozen administration officials, people involved in the presidential transition, lawmakers and congressional aides provide an inside look at how the gravity of the situation along the border began to sink in for the administration as it took power two months ago \u2013 and how it\u2019s struggled to address the problem ever since. Biden administration officials say they expected the number of migrants arriving at the US border would swell once they took office, given their drastically different approach to immigration compared to former President Donald Trump\u2019s, but they did not anticipate a surge this big, which Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warns will likely reach a two-decade peak. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who traveled to the border with Mayorkas Friday, described the conditions in border facilities, where there are now more than 5,000 minors in custody.   \u201cJust left the border processing facility. 100s of kids packed into big open rooms. In a corner, I fought back tears as a 13 yr old girl sobbbed uncontrollably explaining thru a translator how terrified she was, having been separated from her grandmother and without her parents,\u201d he tweeted Friday. \u201cThe Biden Administration is trying their best to uphold the rule of law with humanity. They have a ton of work ahead to clean up the mess Trump left them, but their intentions are true,\u201d Murphy added. In dealing with the political fallout, Biden officials and congressional Democrats have attempted to deflect blame. A less-than-cooperative transition from the Trump administration, pent up demand stemming from Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies, and worsening conditions in Central America have all contributed to the surge, they say. But the White House\u2019s emergency actions in recent weeks \u2013 scrambling to find more beds for kids in federal custody and calling in the Federal Emergency Management Agency to jump start emergency intake sites \u2013 are all signs of an administration that\u2019s been caught off guard by the sheer number of migrants arriving at the border. There were warning signs this would happen. Last summer, the number of migrant encounters at the US-Mexico border began to rise, after having dropped when the pandemic gripped the western hemisphere. Behind the scenes, federal border officials began to warn about a projected increase in the coming months. \u201cWhen Covid hit, we saw a precipitous drop in the numbers. But we knew from the beginning that at some point those numbers would creep up,\u201d former acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan told CNN, citing the worsening conditions in Latin America as a result of the pandemic and hurricane devastation. Morgan said the Biden transition team was \u201cspecifically warned again and again and again,\u201d adding that officials had worked on modeling to project the jump in encounters if Trump policies were pulled back. Biden officials argue that the Trump team inhibited their ability to get a true grasp of the situation by not fully cooperating during the transition in the months after the election. That, according to one Biden official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, prevented the incoming administration from getting \u201cunder the hood in the time frame that other administrations would have been able to.\u201d This official also bristled at the notion they weren\u2019t fully prepared. \u201cWere we prepared? Yes,\u201d the official said. \u201cEveryone wants to be like \u2018crisis, crisis, crisis, crisis\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s like, you know what, actually, things are going really well. Yes, we brought in FEMA, but you know what? That was the responsible thing to do.\u201d Not only was the transition truncated, but Biden officials argue they inherited an overall immigration and asylum system that had been deconstructed by Trump. \u201cAs we were coming into the administration, we knew we were inheriting an absolute mess from the previous administration \u2013 that there were aspects of our legal immigration system that had been gutted and a department that lacked the personnel to administer our laws,\u201d said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the director of the White House\u2019s office of intergovernmental affairs. \u201cWhen we came into office, like, it was a disaster. I mean, really. The staffing wasn\u2019t in place, the structures weren\u2019t in place,\u201d said another administration official. Critics say the White House hasn\u2019t helped itself. During his first week in office, Biden signed a slew of executive actions aimed at undoing Trump\u2019s immigration policies and released comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Most notable among the changes has been the decision to no longer expel unaccompanied minors who show up at the border, resulting in more children coming into US custody. Those policy changes, some argue, sent a signal to migrants that it was the time to come to the United States, despite administration officials warning them it wasn\u2019t. \u201cThe gulf between what the Trump administration did in enforced cruelty and where the Biden administration wanted to be was so great that I don\u2019t really think there was a clearer example that needed to be made in how the government and the administration was going to change,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cThe previous administration had so radically changed what we did on migration that, I think, the President felt very strongly that we had to act really quickly and really decisively to demonstrate that it wasn\u2019t going to be the same,\u201d the official added. Mark Greenberg, a former Health and Human Services official who was involved in the Biden transition, noted the difficulties in projecting the scope of the influx. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to estimate how big the numbers would be, but it was always clear there would be a need for more capacity if the government was going to stop expelling children,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of Covid, they had greatly reduced bed capacity. That capacity has not been enough for the increased number of children. It was foreseeable months ago that there was going to be a problem if bed capacity wasn\u2019t going to be increased,\u201d Greenberg added. The Trump policies barring people from coming to the US also contributed to more people waiting in Mexico to come to the United States, argued John Sandweg, a former senior Homeland Security official under the Obama administration. The Trump administration had pushed non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico until their court dates in the United States, leaving tens of thousands languishing in Mexico, and invoked a public health law during the coronavirus pandemic that allowed border officials to turn away migrants, including adults, families and unaccompanied children, encountered at the border. Biden moved to undo those, though he\u2019s still leaning on the public health law to turn most adult migrants away. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a little over a year of (Migrant Protection Protocols), two years, and then Title 42 and that created a real anomaly in the sense that we had hundreds of thousands of people staged in Mexico ready to come, Central Americans,\u201d Sandweg told CNN, citing another policy, known as the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program, which required migrants to wait in Mexico until their US court dates. \u201cI think that\u2019s playing a big role and artificially increasing the numbers.\u201d A source with knowledge of discussions during the transition said officials were aware the border would pose a challenge from the start. \u201cWe knew the Trump administration was turning away children. We knew there were camps in Matamoros (Mexico) because of \u2018remain in Mexico.\u2019 We knew that this was going to be a challenge immediately,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe transition was not in a position to open facilities because we weren\u2019t the government. What we concentrated on was developing the policy that the new administration would be able to follow immediately,\u201d the source added. Republicans have turned to immigration as their primary line of attack against Biden. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy led a Republican delegation to El Paso, Texas, this month and Sen. Ted Cruz is planning to head up a Senate GOP trip. \u201cThe sad part about all this, it didn\u2019t have to happen. This crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration. There\u2019s no other way to claim it than a Biden border crisis,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference. Democrats have responded by charging that the outgoing Trump administration is responsible for creating the conditions that led to the border problems, by refusing to give the Biden administration a proper transition and with policies that led to migrants waiting in dangerous conditions in camps near the border. \u201cThere\u2019s a rush because people are so desperate,\u201d said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat. \u201cIt was one of those things where you\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. What the Trump administration was doing was in many ways cruel forcing these people to wait in very dangerous situations on the other side of the border.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just screaming about this to change the subject,\u201d one administration official said of Republican criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s used to distract and divide the American public and distract from the issue at hand. President Biden \u2013 60% approval, huge approval \u2013 what do they do? They go to the border.\u201d Democrats have expressed anger toward the Biden administration over the failure to move children out of border facilities quickly enough, calling the situation unacceptable. One House Democrat involved in immigration issues said it\u2019s been a \u201cmessy process\u201d as the Biden administration has ramped up capacity to address the surge in unaccompanied minors. There\u2019s been particular frustration over the lack of shelter space to house the additional children, including the fact that the HHS facilities were being used at less-than-full capacity because of Covid restrictions. \u201cI\u2019m not defending having a child in a Border Patrol station for more than three days \u2013 that\u2019s not what the law requires and it\u2019s not appropriate,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat. \u201cJamming kids in a Border Patrol station, that\u2019s not Covid protocol \u2013 so you might as well get them out of there into some of the facilities.\u201d But Democrats charge that Republicans are trying to exploit the situation for political gain, scaring voters and ignoring the fact that the migration increases are cyclical and happened in the Trump administration, too. \u201cMcCarthy goes down there \u2013 I never heard him once express concern about a 12-year-old girl being sent back on their own to some camp in Mexico,\u201d Lofgren said. On Thursday, the House passed two immigration bills \u2013 one to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d and another to provide legal status for farm workers \u2013 though they are expected to hit a wall in the Senate. The bills are a sign of the tough slog ahead for Congress to address immigration reform and the problems at the border. \u201cThe reason why I find it so irritating to debate whether we should say there\u2019s a crisis on the border or not is because saying that takes our focus off the broader picture,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from a Texas border district. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address the root causes now, and if we don\u2019t change the system now, we will continue having this conversation every single year. And nothing will change. And things will get worse.\u201d Geneva Sands contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The organizers of the effort to recall California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom turned in their final batches of signature petitions to the registrars of the Golden State\u2019s 58 counties on Wednesday. Now they wait as county and state officials determine whether they have collected the 1,495,709 valid signatures they need to qualify the recall election for the ballot \u2013 a tally that is 12% of the votes cast in the last election for governor. Recall leaders said Wednesday night that they have well exceeded that target, turning in more than 2.1 million signature petitions to county officials. But it\u2019s now up to those officials, who have until April 29 to finish verifying the signatures and then report their results to the California secretary of state. Here are some common questions about how the next few weeks could play out: Q: How likely is it that the recall will qualify for the ballot? A: At this point it looks pretty likely. Newsom\u2019s sudden blitz of media interviews \u2013 and his vow to fight the recall \u2013 underscore that his team is taking the recall threat very seriously. The recall proponents have organized in all of California\u2019s counties, and they collected more than 2 million signatures, so they would have a cushion if some signatures were duplicates or were deemed invalid for other reasons. And so far, the signature validity rate is very high \u2013 yet another reason it\u2019s likely to qualify. The latest report from the secretary of state in early February showed that of the signatures checked by county officials so far, 83.7% were valid. The recall organizers also hired a third-party firm to verify signatures before they were submitted, eliminating many duplicates on the front end. Q: If it qualifies, how soon would the recall land on the ballot? A: No one has a good answer to that yet, because there are a lot of procedural steps that must be completed before the lieutenant governor would officially call the recall election. But sources on both sides of the recall expect it to land on the ballot sometime between August and December. First though, there\u2019s an arcane series of next steps. After county election officials finish verifying signatures by the end of April, the secretary of state has until May to report back to the counties about whether the recall has qualified. After that, any voter who signed a recall petition has 30 business days to reconsider and withdraw their signature. Then county officials conduct a second verification process to determine whether there are still enough signatures. If the recall proceeds, the California Department of Finance and the secretary of state come up with a cost estimate that is sent to the chair of the state\u2019s Joint Legislative Budget Committee, Newsom, Lt. Gov Eleni Kounalakis and Secretary of State Shirley Weber. The budget committee has 30 business days to review the estimate. After final signoff from Weber, Kounalakis would be required to set a date for a recall election that is no earlier than 60 days from that point and no later than 80 days. Q: What would voters see on the ballot if qualifies? A: The state\u2019s voters will be asked two questions. First, do they want to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on recalling Newsom. And two, who should replace him \u2013 a question that is likely to be followed by a very long list of names, just as it did in 2003, when Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, replaced former California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat. Q: Can Newsom enter his own name in the running for question No. 2 as a backup plan? A: No. He\u2019s banned from doing so under state election law. Q: Newsom was elected in 2018 with nearly 62% of the vote in one of the most liberal states in the country. How did he end up in this predicament? A: This is actually the sixth time that Newsom\u2019s opponents have tried to recall him, which demonstrates the polarized climate in America, even in a blue state like California. Early on, recall proponents were most focused on their ideological differences with the governor. The recall petition, which was written before the pandemic began, argues that Newsom failed to adequately address the state\u2019s high taxes, immigration, widespread homelessness, lack of affordable housing and wildfires, among other complaints. But the signature gathering collided last summer with anger about the pandemic, attracting a broader group of Californians who were angry about Newsom\u2019s restrictive approach to curbing the virus. Q: Did Newsom take a more restrictive approach to managing the pandemic than other governors? Why has so much anger been directed at him? A: Definitely. He instituted the country\u2019s first statewide stay-at-home order last March and then another set of regional stay-at-home orders in early December last year \u2013 based on intensive care unit capacity in different regions of the state. Earlier, he angered some residents in Orange County by temporarily shutting down beaches that got too crowded. Newsom was also repeatedly sued by advocates for religious freedom because of his early restrictions on church services, and he lost some of those cases at the Supreme Court. The recall has also drawn a broader base of support, in part, because so many business owners believed Newsom\u2019s restrictions were economically crippling and sometimes arbitrary. West Coast school districts have also been slow to open, despite Newsom\u2019s efforts to accelerate reopenings. Newsom became the most visible target for all of that anger. Q: Why was his visit to French Laundry in Napa Valley such a big deal? A: There\u2019s nothing voters hate more than hypocrisy from their leaders. And to his opponents, Newsom looked both hypocritical and elitist when he attended the 50th birthday dinner of a longtime friend, who is a lobbyist, at the Michelin-starred French Laundry last November. At the time, he was urging residents to stay home and avoid social gatherings with people outside their household. To a lot of Californians who were already frustrated with the restrictions, it appeared that Newsom was playing by a different set of rules when he visited the restaurant. He has apologized repeatedly, including during a recent interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper who bluntly asked him: \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d Newsom said, \u201cI haven\u2019t made a mistake like that before or since.\u201d Q: Who\u2019s behind the recall effort? A: The lead proponent of the recall is a retired county sheriff\u2019s office sergeant named Orrin Heatlie, who was joined by 124 others in submitting the petition. His grassroots group, California Patriot Coalition \u2013 Recall Governor Newsom, focused heavily on signature gathering and worked closely with another group called Rescue California\u2026Recall Gavin Newsom, which raised a considerable amount of money for the effort. The second group included California GOP heavy-hitters including longtime consultant Anne Dunsmore and former chairman of the California Republican Party Tom Del Beccaro. Both the California State Republican Party and the Republican National Committee made major donations to help the effort. Other top funders include Orange County entrepreneur John Kruger, real estate developer Geoff Palmer and venture capitalist Douglas Leone. Q: What are the key metrics to watch to determine whether the recall will succeed or fail? A: It\u2019s important to remember that Democrats now outnumber Republicans by nearly two-to-one, giving Newsom a built in advantage at the ballot box \u2013 if he can get Democrats to turn out and defend him. After the holidays, when anger about the pandemic in California was at a boiling point, about 52% of likely California voters approved of Newsom\u2019s job performance in a poll from Public Policy Institute of California (a dip from 64% last May). But in order for a recall to proceed, 50% of California voters must vote for it. In that poll released in February, only 43% of likely voters disapproved of Newsom and that number may improve as more people get vaccinated and the virus recedes. By comparison, some 7 in 10 voters disapproved of Davis shortly before he was recalled with 55% of the vote. Q: If the recall qualifies, who should we expect to run to replace Newsom? A: There are likely to be more than 100 names on that list \u2013 if not hundreds of names \u2013 because the requirements for getting on the ballot are not expected to be very difficult to meet. The most prominent Republicans in the mix are Newsom\u2019s former opponent, John H. Cox, whom Newsom defeated by about 24 points in 2018, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. Richard Grenell, the former acting director of national intelligence to former President Donald Trump, also teased a potential run during a recent appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, which could excite Trump voters in California. (Both Cox and Faulconer plan to challenge Newsom when he\u2019s up for reelection in 2022). Given the inexpensive filing fee and the expected low bar for entry, the list could become a pretty wild cast of characters. Q: What is Newsom doing to stop the recall? A: For starters, after largely shrugging it off and focusing on his duties as governor, he\u2019s now pivoted to a more engaged posture \u2013 doing a series of press interviews to trying to define his opponents. Democrats launched a new effort \u2013 Stop the Republican Recall \u2013 the day before signatures were due earlier this week, and Newsom has referred to the recall proponents as \u201canti-mask and anti-vax extremists\u201d and \u201cpro-Trump forces who want to overturn the last election and have opposed much of what we have done to fight the pandemic.\u201d President Joe Biden opposes the recall, along with many California Democrats in Washington. As Newsom focuses on getting Californians vaccinated in the coming months, expect to see many prominent Golden State Democrats forcefully defending his record as governor as they work to redefine his image. Newsom\u2019s current strategy was encapsulated by his March 15 tweet: \u201cI won\u2019t be distracted by this partisan, Republican recall \u2013 but I will fight it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks delivered fiery remarks before the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, telling then-President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters in stark terms, \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Just four hours later, the pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol to try to stop the congressional certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s win. Many of his fellow Republicans were alarmed when they came to learn of the remarks from the six-term congressman, who could now be a leading contender for an open Senate seat. In private, some House Republicans advocated booting Brooks from his committee assignments, aghast at such inflammatory rhetoric to a crowd that later ransacked the Capitol, terrorized police officers, vandalized the halls of democracy and left death and destruction in its wake, lawmakers told CNN. \u201cWhat shocked me at the time was the number of my own colleagues that had never heard the remarks. And I played it for them,\u201d Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack, a member of the House GOP group that was weighing stripping Brooks of his committee assignments, recalled on Friday. \u201cThere were jaws dropping.\u201d Asked if he thinks that Brooks incited the rioters, Womack told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that. He offended me, I can tell you that.\u201d Ultimately, House Republicans opted not to punish Brooks, who led the quixotic campaign in Congress to try to overturn the votes in some states that Biden won, endearing him to Trump and his closest supporters in the process. Now the conservative Alabama congressman, with his divisive style of politics and staunch pro-Trump credentials, could very well become a United States senator. On Monday, Brooks is expected to announce that he\u2019ll run for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, making his kickoff announcement at a shooting range in Huntsville, Alabama, with long-time Trump adviser Stephen Miller, the controversial anti-immigration crusader, by his side. In interviews with an array of Republicans in the state, one thing is clear: the 66-year-old Brooks could easily emerge as the front-runner for the GOP nomination in a state that Trump won by 26 points last fall. And if he gets the coveted Trump endorsement, the icing could be on the cake, potentially paving the way to a primary victory and ensuring the seat stays red, according to multiple senior Republicans. \u201cI think the person that\u2019s going to win this primary is going to be somebody that is in that Trump-MAGA lane,\u201d said former Alabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, who ran for Senate in 2020. \u201cAnd so right now, just looking at the field, the two candidates that are the most likely to get in that lane \u2013 and be successful \u2013 are Mo Brooks and Lynda Blanchard.\u201d Indeed, Brooks\u2019 top competition for Shelby\u2019s seat may come from Blanchard, the former ambassador to Slovenia, who is less well-known in the state but boasts the ability to self-fund her campaign. She and her husband John donated more than $1.9 million to Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020; Lynda was rewarded with the ambassadorship to then-First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s home country. The Blanchards, the co-founders of a real estate investment management company and the anti-poverty 100X Development Foundation, have pledged $5 million of their own money to the Senate campaign. Blanchard held a fundraiser last week at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida; the former President showed up and took a picture with her. Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg under Trump who attended Blanchard\u2019s recent fundraiser, said she could appeal to both Republicans who support Trump and those in the business community wary of him. The former President was \u201cvery complimentary\u201d of Blanchard, Evans said, and \u201cnot shy at all about showing his appreciation for the good work she\u2019s done,\u201d while being \u201ccareful not to step over the line of \u2026 getting into the race one way or the other.\u201d Other potential Senate Republican candidates include Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill and Business Council of Alabama CEO Katie Boyd Britt, who served as Shelby\u2019s former chief of staff. Merrill, who told CNN that he would likely make his decision in April and is seriously considering running for Senate, called Brooks a \u201cvery formidable\u201d candidate with an \u201centhusiastic following.\u201d But he said that the congressman is a \u201cpolarizing figure.\u201d Yet Merrill also made clear whose side he\u2019s on, declining to say if Trump was responsible for the attack on the Capitol, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did bluntly last month. \u201cI don\u2019t remember President Trump advocating riotous behavior or advocating that there be an overthrow of the government,\u201d Merrill said, defending the former President. There\u2019s a reason why Republicans in the state are aligning with Trump. \u201cWhoever gets the Trump endorsement will likely win,\u201d said one veteran Republican official in Alabama, who asked for anonymity to talk candidly. Brooks told CNN that he had spoken to Trump by phone before his Monday announcement but declined to divulge details. When asked if Trump would back his Senate run, Brooks said, \u201cI think that\u2019s for him to announce at the appropriate time.\u201d Whether Trump gets involved remains an open question and one that Senate GOP leaders are eager to avoid. A Trump adviser told CNN that there\u2019s been \u201cno decision yet\u201d on whether the former President will endorse in the race. \u201cBrooks has been a strong ally of the President\u2019s,\u201d the adviser added. While whoever wins the primary would still be a favorite to win in the red state, top Republicans are warily assessing Brooks\u2019 candidacy as GOP leaders are keenly aware that divisive intra-party fights across the country are among the chief impediments to taking back the Senate, currently under Democratic control with a 50-50 split. Last week, Sen. Rick Scott, the Florida Republican who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, made a trek to Mar-a-Lago and pitched Trump to back whichever Senate candidates emerge from contested primaries \u2013 and not engage in the primaries themselves. \u201cWell I told him, you know, so I don\u2019t get involved in primaries, and I said, \u2018I think it\u2019s in his best interest to have winning candidates and so it\u2019d be helpful if he did after the primary,\u2019\u201d Scott told CNN. Asked if Trump agreed with his suggestion, Scott added: \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond.\u201d The primary also is of keen interest to McConnell, who has been in a cold war with Trump ever since blaming the former President for inciting the riot, even though he voted to acquit him during his impeachment trial last month. McConnell is quietly moving to recruit candidates whom he believes can win in November 2022 \u2013 regardless of their alignment with Trump \u2014 and is willing to employ his well-financed super PAC to target Republicans in primaries he believes stand in his way to retaking the majority. Whether the McConnell-Trump split will play out in Alabama remains to be seen, but it\u2019s a possibility. \u201cOnly if necessary,\u201d McConnell said when asked if his affiliated super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, will spend in primary fights. But others in the state privately caution that Trump\u2019s backing only goes so far, and look to Shelby, the long-time appropriator, to signal which Republican candidate could continue bringing home the bacon as he\u2019s done for years in funneling billions to his state. Asked if he would endorse a candidate, Shelby said, \u201cNot now. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Some Republicans note that Trump\u2019s 2017 endorsements of Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill then-Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019 seat, and Judge Roy Moore, who defeated Strange in a primary, were unsuccessful \u2013 and Democrat Doug Jones took the seat in a remarkable upset. But they recognize that while Trump might not be a kingmaker, he can destroy a Republican campaign if he publicly opposes the candidate. In 2020, Trump\u2019s attacks on Sessions, stemming from their fallout over Sessions\u2019 handling of the special counsel probe as attorney general, ended his political career. Sessions was once beloved in the state; In 2014, he faced no opponent. Six years later, former Auburn football Tommy Tuberville easily defeated Sessions in the primary and Jones in the general election. Tuberville said he would not endorse a candidate in the primary, and he downplayed Brooks\u2019 role on January 6. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see his speech,\u201d Tuberville said of Brooks. \u201cI knew he was there.\u201d Told about the fiery rhetoric, Tuberville added, \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s what political speeches are. I mean they\u2019re all fiery.\u201d While Brooks blasted Trump in favor of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas during the 2016 presidential campaign, he quickly became a diehard supporter after Trump\u2019s victory. He ran for Senate in 2017 after Trump picked Sessions for attorney general and came in third in the GOP primary with the support of conservative personalities Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. In 2020, Brooks became one of the first members of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of the election of Biden. The night before the January 6 rally, he tweeted that Trump had personally asked him to speak \u201cabout the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.\u201d After the insurrection, Brooks called for \u201cthe Capitol attack perpetrators\u201d to be \u201cprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d But he also falsely suggested that the left-wing Antifa activists \u201corchestrated\u201d the attack. Two Democrats introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally. In a recent interview, Brooks offered no regrets for his January 6 remarks. \u201cI did my duty for my country,\u201d Brooks, who won his House seat in the 2010 tea party wave, told CNN defiantly. He then pointed to his full remarks, asking: \u201cDid you see this sentence right before? You guys have done a great disservice to our country by distorting the truth.\u201d Yet in the sentence before Brooks\u2019 comments where he pushed for supporters to start \u201ckicking ass,\u201d the Republican said: \u201cRegardless of today\u2019s outcome, the 2022 and 2024 elections are right around the corner, and America does not need and cannot stand, cannot tolerate any more weakling, cowering, wimpy Republican congressman and senators who covet the power and prestige the swamp has to offer while groveling at the feet and the knees of the special interest masters.\u201d After his now-infamous remarks, Brooks then ratcheted the temperature up even more, asking supporters of the then-President: \u201cNow our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes, and sometimes their lives, to give us their descendants, an America that is the greatest nation in world history. So I have a question for you \u2013 are you willing to do the same?\u201d The business community abhorred the effort to overturn the 2020 election, and was shocked when the pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol to stop the certification of the vote. Corporations suspended their donations to the 147 Republicans who objected. The simmering discontent could leave an opening for a business-friendly candidate. Tripp Skipper, a GOP political consultant who helped launched Tuberville\u2019s successful 2020 Senate campaign, said that the pro-business wing of the party led by McConnell would treat Brooks \u201cprobably a little bit better\u201d than Moore, who lost to Jones after several women accused Moore of sexual misconduct while they were underage. \u201cHis candidacy is not going to resonate in the business community by and large,\u201d said Skipper of Brooks. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge push from the McConnell wing of the party to say anybody but Mo. They\u2019re going to treat him probably a little bit better than they treated Roy Moore, but not much.\u201d But Skipper and other political operatives argued that Brooks is still the frontrunner because of his connection to Trump supporters. The only Alabama members of Congress who actually voted to certify the election were the man Brooks seeks to replace \u2013 Shelby \u2013 and Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell. Sewell told CNN this week that she is considering a run for the seat in the Republican state. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about figuring out, can I expand the base?\u201d Sewell said. \u201cI\u2019m in the bluest of districts in the state of Alabama, and so it would require expanding that base but also getting our message out.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sarah Fortinsky contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In an interview that aired Thursday with the Texas Tribune\u2019s Evan Smith, one thing about George W. Bush was: He is fundamentally at odds with the current version of the Republican Party on virtually every front. On the US Capitol riot of January 6, which many Republican elected officials have sought to downplay in its aftermath, Bush said this: \u201cThe violent assault on the Capitol \u2013 and disruption of a constitutionally mandated meeting of Congress \u2013 was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.\u201d On whether the 2020 election was stolen, as former President Donald Trump (and many of his allies in Congress) continue to insist, Bush had a one-word answer: \u201cNo.\u201d On Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP, Bush was dismissive: \u201cHistory and the United States has shown these populist movements begin to fritter over time, and so I\u2019m optimistic about democracy.\u201d On immigration, Bush rejected the approach adopted by Trump to weaponize the issue during his 2016 campaign (\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d) and during his time in the White House. \u201cThere needs to be an overhaul, which means that we need to get politics out of the system and get sober-minded people focusing on a) what\u2019s best for our economy and b) what\u2019s best for our country,\u201d he said. And on President Joe Biden, who Trump and Republicans have insisted is in the early stages of a socialist takeover of government, Bush was praiseworthy: \u201cHe\u2019s off to a good start, it looks like.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The contrast \u2013 on nearly every issue of import to the country \u2013 is stunning. And speaks to how radically the Republican Party and what it stands for has been transformed by Trump\u2019s rise and continued death grip on the GOP. What\u2019s remarkable is that Bush wasn\u2019t the head of the Republican Party all that long ago! We\u2019re not talking about someone who led the GOP in the 1970s or 1980s. Bush was president in the 2000s \u2013 and was the last Republican elected president before Trump won in 2016. Less than a decade separate Bush\u2019s presidency from Trump\u2019s. And yet, Bush\u2019s version of what it means to be a Republican is unrecognizable from where the GOP stands today. Remember that Bush ran as a self-proclaimed \u201ccompassionate conservative.\u201d He repeatedly pushed for comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship for those in the United States illegally. And perhaps most importantly, he was relentlessly focused on decency and civility in politics and life. As Bush put it in a 2018 conversation at the George W. Bush Institute: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that respect and civility are a political philosophy so much as they are an understanding of the importance of decency in society, whether in the political arena or how you treat your neighbor. There\u2019s no question we need respect and civility.\u201d Contrast that with Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that his political opponents were, among other things, \u201cevil.\u201d One example (of many): Acquitted by the Senate over impeachment charges related to his handling of the US relationship with Ukraine, Trump used the forum of the National Prayer Breakfast to blast the \u201cdishonest and corrupt people\u201d who had pushed for his impeachment. He also questioned whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California) actually prayed for him; \u201cNor do I like people who say, \u2018I pray for you,\u2019 when they know that\u2019s not so,\u201d said Trump. Trump, in fact, expressly positioned himself \u2013 and his followers \u2013 as a rejection of the establishment politics that he said the Bushes represented. \u201cWe need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term,\u201d Trump tweeted way back in 2013. During the 2016 campaign he would regularly mock Jeb Bush, the younger brother of George W. Bush and the perceived front-runner for the GOP nomination at the start of the race, as out of touch with the current views of the Republican base. And the Bushes responded in kind. The late Barbara Bush, the mother of George W. Bush and Jeb Bush, said this in 2016 of Trump: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give many answers to how he would solve problems. He sort of makes faces and says insulting things.\u201d Neither George W. Bush nor his wife, Laura, voted for Trump in 2016; they both chose \u201cnone of the above\u201d option, according to a spokesman. Bush didn\u2019t make public who he voted for in 2020 but in the days immediately after the election, as Trump was continuing to contest the results, Bush very publicly congratulated Biden for his victory. \u201cThough we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThe President-elect reiterated that while he ran as a Democrat, he will govern for all Americans. I offered him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and Obama: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can.\u201d Bush\u2019s comments that were released on Thursday about the state of the country come in the wake of a series of retirement announcements by Republican senators who closely identified with his preferred interpretation of what it means to be a Republican. The decisions by Sens. Roy Blunt (Missouri), Rob Portman (Ohio), Pat Toomey (Pennsylvania), Richard Burr (North Carolina) and even Richard Shelby (Alabama) suggest that the rise of Trumpism \u2013 and the resultant decline in Bushism \u2013 has made the GOP a place they no longer feel entirely comfortable in. Polling suggests that view of those senators \u2013 and the 43rd president \u2013 are in the minority within the party. Trump remains the most popular figure among Republican base voters and the vast majority of party elected officials have avoided any direct criticism out of fear of drawing his ire. Bush, who is constitutionally barred from serving as president again, is less constrained.",

            "article_content": "Visiting the warehouse of a flooring company here Tuesday to begin selling his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief law, President Joe Biden seemed ready to sign something else. \u201cAnything else we can be doing?\u201d he asked the business owners, who seemed grateful to chat up the visiting president. If the primary goal of Biden\u2019s \u201cHelp is Here\u201d tour, which kicked off this week, is to claim credit for the massive and mostly popular Covid-19 relief package, his tacit objective is to convince Americans there is more the government can do to make their lives better. The road show, which spans the country from coast to coast, will bring the first lady, vice president, second gentleman and Cabinet members to mostly battleground states that were key to Biden\u2019s election victory in November. Making political hay out of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package \u2013 which no Republicans voted for but which remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans \u2013 is top of mind for the President, who believes similar efforts were absent more than a decade ago after another stimulus measure passed. But Biden and his top aides say the tour\u2019s more important purpose is to muster support for the idea that government can solve big problems \u2013 capital the President will need as he moves to the next big-ticket items on his agenda, which this time will likely come with tax hikes. \u201cI think you should be aware, more help is on the way, for real,\u201d Biden told the owners, Kristin and James Smith. Standing inside the flooring company outside Philadelphia, Biden sought to frame his efforts as necessary to keeping businesses like this one afloat. The company, Smith Flooring, received business loans during Biden\u2019s term but also under then-President Donald Trump. The White House said the company would benefit from new programs in the relief bill that help companies navigate the Byzantine application process, as well as from an employee-retention tax credit.   The President took swipes at similar programs administered under his predecessor, saying it was too difficult for businesses like the one he was visiting \u2013 which has 22 employees during peak season and operates from a small facility set back from the road in a commercial district \u2013 to receive funds. \u201cYou got very big businesses getting the lion\u2019s share of that money. So when we wrote this rescue plan, we insisted that we have an inspector general to make sure the money goes exactly where it\u2019s supposed to go,\u201d he said. In highlighting the assistance his administration is offering, Biden was implicitly making the broader case that big government, when functioning properly, is a good thing. He said a day earlier that his goal was to improve the view of the government among Americans. \u201cWe have to prove to the American people that their government can deliver for them,\u201d Biden said Monday as he explained how the White House planned to roll out the massive new law. \u201cThat\u2019s our job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d Biden said last month he did not believe the stimulus passed in 2009 under President Barack Obama was properly sold to the American people; he claimed he told Obama as much but was rebuffed. The circumstances now are different from more than a decade ago. Obama entered office at the very start of the economic meltdown while Biden entered office nearly a year into the pandemic; while it was difficult to see a way out of the crisis in March 2009, there is now light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel thanks to a massive vaccination effort. After years of avoiding outward embrace for big government policies, Biden is banking on parallel health and economic crises \u2013 aggravated by government mismanagement under the previous administration \u2013 to make Americans more welcoming of his bid to expand the social safety net. Speaking at a school for baristas in Las Vegas on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris said the goal of the administration travel efforts was to ensure Americans knew what they were getting under the law. \u201cWe want to avoid a situation where people are unaware of what they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not selling it; it literally is letting people know their rights. Think of it more as a public education campaign.\u201d Harris will continue her efforts in Denver on Tuesday at a vaccination clinic and a small empanada business.\u00a0First lady Jill Biden spoke with students at a school in New Jersey on Monday and will visit New Hampshire later in the week. Many of the states that administration officials are visiting this week are critical electoral battlegrounds and the law\u2019s popularity among the American people is helping Biden and his surrogates promote the plan to Americans eager for relief. A smooth rollout of the new law will be essential for maintaining its majority support among Americans. There were positive signs on that front this weekend as direct stimulus payments began hitting Americans\u2019 bank accounts. But officials say there are still potential hiccups ahead, including administering the expanded child tax credit through the IRS and getting billions of dollars to state and local governments efficiently and without waste. Biden on Monday named Gene Sperling, a top economic official in previous Democratic administrations, to oversee the implementation efforts. White House officials acknowledge the law\u2019s implementation will go a long way in convincing Americans\u2019 that further spending \u2013\u00a0and potential tax increases\u00a0\u2013 are needed to pull the country from crisis. What that next step will be remains an open question. White House advisers have discussed with Biden their options on next legislative moves but haven\u2019t yet come to a conclusion, according to officials. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her members last week to begin working with Republicans on\u00a0infrastructure proposals, a good indication that is in Biden\u2019s sights. Yet a growing humanitarian problem at the southern border has also lent urgency to immigration reform, another of Biden\u2019s top priorities.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are ramping up their attacks on Democrats over the ongoing crisis at the Southern border, including a new ad campaign accusing President Joe Biden of opening the border instead of focusing on opening schools and businesses. A 30-second digital ad from the American Action Network, an affiliate of the pro-Republican Congressional Leadership Fund, launched Tuesday and is running in 16 Democratically-held House districts across the country. The spot encourages viewers to \u201ctell Congress\u201d to \u201cenforce the law and stop the Biden border crisis.\u201d It\u2019s among the earliest Republican efforts to concentrate on the issue of the border and Biden\u2019s handling of it.   This new ad campaign amounts to a five-figure digital ad purchase, which is in line with AAN\u2019s other recent campaigns attacking Democrats on school reopenings, Covid relief and their election-integrity legislation H.R. 1. It\u2019s also part of a concerted effort by Republicans to target the administration\u2019s immigration policies and comes with an eye toward next year\u2019s midterm elections. Nearly every district the ad will run in was identified by the House Republican campaign arm as a target seat for 2022. On Monday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy led a delegation of 12 other House Republicans to a Border Patrol processing center in El Paso. In remarks he made following a tour of the facility, McCarthy also referred to the surge as a \u201cBiden border crisis.\u201d \u201cThis crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration. There\u2019s no other way to claim it than a Biden border crisis,\u201d said McCarthy. Monday\u2019s trek to El Paso comes days after several House Republicans held a press conference on Capitol Hill calling on Democrats to give more attention to the issue. \u201cOur constituents are on the frontlines bearing the brunt of the lawlessness and self-inflicted crisis at the border created by the Biden administration,\u201d said Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas. The sudden spike in children seeking to cross the southern border \u2013 more than 4,000 are currently being held at Border Patrol facilities \u2013 is due to several factors, including the devastation from two major hurricanes last year, as well as the toll the pandemic has taken on Central American countries. But there is also a perceived relaxation of border enforcement that has taken place under the Biden administration, which has reversed the Trump-era policy of turning away unaccompanied minors who show up at the border. The political pressure on Biden is mounting in Washington, including from some fellow Democrats who have been critical of the President\u2019s handling of the matter. While these Democrats are supportive of allowing children to stay, they wonder why the administration did not prepare for the consequences of the policy change before enacting it. The House will vote on two immigration bills this week, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas plans to testify on the Hill Wednesday. The Biden administration has begun to respond to this pressure. Over the weekend, Mayorkas tapped the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help process the waiting children. The administration also decided to terminate a Trump-era agreement that officials said discouraged sponsors, like parents or relatives, from coming forward to collect their children. But Republicans sense a political opportunity and have zeroed in on the situation at the border as perhaps their most promising argument against the Biden administration. In Biden\u2019s first several weeks in office, the GOP has struggled to find a potent line of attack on policy,  retreating to the more comfortable ground of the culture war while generally refraining from mounting a concerted critique of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which enjoys broad-based support among voters yet did not receive a single Republican vote in Congress. Democrats have dismissed the new focus on immigration from a GOP that was slamming the \u201ccancelation\u201d of the late children\u2019s author Dr. Seuss. \u201cWell I guess their Dr. Seuss approach didn\u2019t work for them,\u201d said House speaker Nancy Pelosi last week. \u201cSo now they have to change the subject.\u201d But a debate over immigration, a signature issue of the Donald Trump administration, puts Republicans back on a familiar footing, say some in the party. \u201cWithout question, this was the main issue that drove working-class voter support for Donald Trump,\u201d said David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist. \u201cIf these voters think Biden has thrown the doors open and that\u2019s why they\u2019re showing up in bigger numbers, Democrats will pay a heavy price.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The competing realities of red and blue America now seem to exist on different planes. Democrats, in total control of the federal government, are spending big with tax dollars to convince Americans that government still works and pushing vaccines to get the country back up and fully running. Republicans, in control of more state governments, are working overtime to change election rules and make it more difficult for Americans, who handed Democrats the keys of state, to do the same thing in the future. Convincing people government is not an enemy. The sloganeer in chief for the Democratic view is President Joe Biden, who promised Monday that within 10 days there will be 100 million Covid shots in American arms and 100 million stimulus checks. \u201cWe have to prove to the American people that their government can deliver for them and do it without waste or fraud,\u201d he said, adding a sort of to-do list: He added: \u201cThat\u2019s our job. That\u2019s our responsibility.\u201d That\u2019s an activist federal government in the mold of FDR. Just wait until Democrats start pushing their infrastructure proposals to evolve the US economy away from oil. Nearly half of Republicans aren\u2019t pursuing a vaccine. Just focus on vaccines \u2013 one issue where a partisan lack of trust can have snowballing consequences. Public health experts say they are necessary to get American life back to normal. But there is a distinct partisan break on who is willing to get them. The vast majority of Democrats \u2013 92% \u2013 have either gotten the vaccine or will try to get it, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released March 11. Only half of Republicans said they\u2019ve gotten the vaccine or are trying to. If you don\u2019t like polls, listen to Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has talked about hesitancy among White Republicans. That\u2019s why Dr. Anthony Fauci specifically called out former President Donald Trump and said it could make the difference for him to more vocally call on Republicans to get the shot. (Trump did once, during his speech to conservative activists at CPAC.) But he did not take part in a public service campaign with the other former presidents.   \u201cIt seems like an intrinsic contradiction, the fact that you have a program that was started during his presidency, and he\u2019s not out telling people to get vaccinated,\u201d Fauci said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI wish he would. He has such incredible influence over people in the Republican Party \u2013 it would really be a game-changer if he did.\u201d Making rhetoric match reality. There\u2019s no doubt that Biden has changed the message and substance of US government since taking office on January 20, but on some issues the changes are not complete. On the southern border, migrant kids continue to flow toward the US, perhaps drawn by his more humanitarian change in tone. That the government under Biden is now housing them at overflow sites is something his administration will have to address. On Monday, they announced undocumented teenagers would be housed for a time at the Convention Center in Dallas. Blaming Biden at the border. Immigration seems destined to replace nonexistent election fraud as Republicans\u2019 top issue. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy held a press conference at the border and blamed Biden for the influx of arrivals. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference near the border. \u201cThis crisis is created by the presidential policies of this new administration.\u201d Different views of integrity. Biden\u2019s trying to restore a sense of integrity to the social functions of government. Republicans are also talking about integrity of the system, but as an excuse to change rules they no longer like. Making it more difficult to vote. Arguing they are adding integrity to the voting system, despite no evidence of fraud, their top priority at the state level is to curb access to early voting and put barriers between people and the ballot box. \u201cJim Crow in a suit and tie.\u201d Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who turned a 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election loss into a mission to bring more Black Georgians to the polls, talked about new voting bills on CNN over the weekend. In Georgia they would end automatic voter registration and limit voting by mail and Sunday voting, all steps that experts say disproportionately target Black voters who tend to vote for Democrats. \u201cI do absolutely agree that it\u2019s racist. It is a redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie,\u201d Abrams told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d referring to historic state and local laws that institutionalized racism and segregation in the 19th and 20th centuries. Versions of these proposals have been replicated in Arizona, Texas, Iowa and scores of other states. The effect could be fewer Black votes, but supporters say they\u2019re just trying to save money and add integrity. \u201cEven those of us who never claimed that the election was stolen recognize that the electorate has lost confidence in the legitimacy of the system. We must work to restore that,\u201d Georgia Senate President Butch Miller said in an email statement to CNN when bills there were passed by his chamber. Seeing Biden make promises about stimulus checks in American pockets, kids in American schools and vaccines in American arms, brought to mind the old promise to put \u201ca chicken for every pot,\u201d which had been stuck, apocryphally, in my mind as something that came from FDR. I was completely wrong! According to American Heritage, it was from supporters of his predecessor, President Herbert Hoover, who took out an ad in 1928 in a New York newspaper, referencing the promise through Republican policies of \u201ca chicken for every pot\u201d and \u201ca car in every backyard, to boot.\u201d In between that 1928 ad and the 1932 election, the Great Depression hit and every American pot most certainly did not have a chicken in it. Democrats in 1932 claimed Hoover had promised \u201ca chicken in every pot\u201d even though he had not. The actual phrase \u201ca chicken in every pot\u201d is much older, although I could not find something I was comfortable linking to on the beginnings of the phrase.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden can report in his first prime-time address Thursday that a vaccination drive now reaching 2 million people daily has brought America far closer to exiting the pandemic than when he took office 50 days ago. With new infections and deaths way down from their peaks of a horrific winter, Biden can afford to conjure hope that better days may be imminent and will speak to the nation from a position of political strength. He is also armed with a newly passed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package \u2013 his first major legacy achievement \u2013 which represents an ambitious attempt to rebuild the US economy to favor the less well off. \u201cThis bill represents a historic, historic victory for the American people,\u201d Biden said Wednesday, touting his rescue plan that finally cleared Congress on Wednesday and pivoting to an address that he said would inform the country what \u201ccomes next\u201d in the effort to prevail over the coronavirus. A clear majority of Americans \u2013 60% \u2013 approves of the new President\u2019s handling of the pandemic in a new CNN poll. He has reintroduced the nation to calm, functional leadership and a scientific approach to the public health crisis, and has ended the stream of vitriol that poured from the Oval Office for four years. Yet in a national crisis this deep and in a country so polarized less than two months since ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s insurrection, nothing is remotely normal. While Biden honored campaign promises to take the virus seriously, to secure funds to get kids back to school and to help Americans pummeled by the economic crisis, his White House is weighed down by stark challenges.   A White House official said Biden\u2019s Thursday night speech, expected to last about 20 minutes, would focus on the lives lost and changed in the pandemic and the work Biden\u2019s administration has done to rapidly increase the vaccination effort. The President will also explain what must still be done to defeat the virus, the official said. The virus is far from purged. Covid-19 variants may trigger a new spring surge in infections before vaccination campaigns can tamp them down. Republican governors racing to open their states with cases still at a high plateau could also cause a new wave of unnecessary deaths. It will be a massive task to ensure a swift, smooth disbursement of American Rescue Plan largesse and to get money quickly into vaccination drives, for example, in ways that speed the pandemic endgame. Any corruption or bureaucratic glitches will only fuel Republican claims the plan is a massive liberal handout. A fast-building southern border crisis threatens to turn into the first big non-Covid-19-related emergency of this presidency, with Biden yet to get a handle on a surge of undocumented child migrants across the border. The issue is perilous for him because it is one area where a reeling Republican Party may gain traction on one of its key issues. Biden garnered one of his lowest ratings in the CNN poll \u2013 only 43% approval \u2013 on immigration. The White House hopes to repair Biden\u2019s reputation for bipartisan compromise \u2013 battered by unanimous GOP opposition to the Covid-19 rescue plan \u2013 with an infrastructure package. But when the President ventures into more controversial legislative areas, such as a vast voting rights bill that has already passed the House and a climate bill, his popularity will come under pressure. He will have to consider a nuclear option of seeking to abolish or at least amend Senate filibuster rules that allow Republicans to easily kill legislation. Controversial foreign policy gambits like an attempt to coax Iran back into a nuclear deal will also expose Biden to attacks at home. Negotiator-in-chief Biden notches his first win but a bipartisan governing loss Biden\u2019s success \u2013 along with Democratic leaders \u2013 in piloting a massive piece of legislation through Congress despite the tightest of majorities in the first weeks of his presidency is a historic achievement that ranks alongside the fastest of starts by modern presidents. The new law delivers on his promise to send $1,400 stimulus payments to millions of Americans. If Biden succeeds in making a flurry of child tax credits, health insurance subsidies and nutrition assistance measures permanent, he will deserve a place in the pantheon behind reforming Democratic presidents such as Lyndon Johnson and Franklin Roosevelt, who used vast federal power to lift Americans out of poverty. In a White House memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, officials vowed to sell the American people on the benefits of the legislation and to get cash rolling immediately. \u201cThe implementation of the Rescue Plan is going to be an all-hands-on-deck effort across the administration,\u201d White House deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in the memo. What was true at the start of the Biden administration remains true now: The President will be judged on his capacity to bring the country out of the pandemic. If he succeeds in leading America back to normality this year, his place in history will be secure whatever else happens in his term. The blanket Republican opposition to the Covid-19 bill may also look like a bad bet. Since taking office, Biden has led the nation in mourning for 525,000 lost citizens and has managed a steady rise in vaccinations, which now average 2 million a day. He is on course to blast past his target of 100 million vaccines in arms in his first 100 days. While his team has been unwilling to credit the previous administration\u2019s work in helping to develop the vaccine, it has put in place tangible improvements in what was a threadbare rollout effort. The overhaul of the US counter-pandemic strategy after Trump\u2019s denial and mismanagement and Biden\u2019s success in passing the Covid-19 rescue plan leave an impression that the new President is effectively wielding the tools of his office, after a lifetime Washington apprenticeship. The agreement he brokered for Merck to manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine developed by its rival Johnson & Johnson, for example, appeared to be a far more effective use of the wartime powers in the Defense Production Act than was managed by the Trump administration. And Biden\u2019s intervention helped coax moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on board the rescue act \u2013 an unabashed liberal bill. Biden\u2019s impact is also being felt in the way he has restored traditional expectations of presidential behavior and has projected human decency from the White House \u2013 for instance, when he visited an old friend, former GOP Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, after his recent cancer diagnosis. No longer does the president of the United States spend his time attacking American democracy, waging personal feuds on Twitter or cratering painstakingly brokered political compromises in Congress. As in the campaign, when his pandemic-enforced spell at his Delaware home made him an elusive political target, Biden\u2019s rationed public appearances have made it tough for Republicans and the conservative media to line him up. Washington journalists are complaining that the new President has yet to hold a formal news conference. But the strategy appears to be working. Perhaps because he is an old, White man, Biden is not the kind of lightning rod for right-wing radicals that former President Barack Obama was early on. Pro-Trump pundits have spent much of the last few weeks trying to whip up a storm over culture war issues like the supposed \u201ccancellation\u201d of children\u2019s author Dr. Seuss. The White House has refused to take the bait. Biden's border strategy faces crucial test amid dramatic surge of migrant children Early victories do not guarantee successful or ultimately popular presidencies. The job is so vast, and the challenges \u2013 from domestic security threats to a sudden foreign policy crisis \u2013 can be grave and unexpected. The pandemic, which destroyed the economy Trump had hoped to ride to reelection, is proof of that. If Biden fails to get the immigration crisis under control, the success of passing the rescue plan may be quickly forgotten. White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused even to call the situation a \u201ccrisis\u201d on Wednesday. The President is also under extreme pressure on the issue of getting kids back to in-person classes now that he has secured billions of dollars for fixes, including improved ventilation in school buildings, for instance. While education is largely a state and local responsibility, the hardest problems reach the President \u2013 who gets the blame if he can\u2019t fix them. One of the most revealing aspects of the effort to pass the rescue plan was how powerful liberal figures such as Vermont\u2019s Sen. Bernie Sanders embraced the bill as a monumental liberal reform. But progressives were disappointed that a hike in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour was removed in the Senate, and the tensions between rival wings of the party are sure to resurface. One crucial issue overshadowed by the race to vaccinate Americans and put them back to work is the unresolved threat to American democracy. Republican state legislators across the nation are rushing to suppress the potential vote of the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election with new laws that often directly discriminate against minority and Democratic voters. The For the People Act now awaiting attention in the Senate is meant to address such behavior and could be a defining moment for the US political system. Given such tests, Biden\u2019s objectively strong start to his presidency is only revealing the height of the political mountain up ahead.",

            "article_content": "The economic relief bill moving rapidly through Congress is broadly popular, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. The popularity of the bill comes as President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating tilts positive around 50 days after he took the oath of office. In the new poll, 61% support the $1.9 trillion economic relief bill proposed by Biden and expected to pass in the House Wednesday, and several key provisions of the bill are even more popular. A broad majority of Americans (85%) say they support policies in the bill that would provide larger tax credits for families and make them easier for low-income households to claim, including majorities across party lines (95% of Democrats and 73% of Republicans support it). Around three-quarters favor provisions to provide funding to facilitate a return to the classroom for K-12 students (77%), and sending stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 per person to most families and individuals (76%). Both of those policies also have majority support across party lines (55% of Republicans support each, among Democrats, support tops 90% for each one).   A smaller majority, 59%, say they back providing $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. That policy sparks the sharpest partisan divide among the four tested, with 88% of Democrats in favor vs. just 28% of Republicans. One measure not in the bill \u2013 raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour \u2013 also has majority support. Overall, 55% favor such an increase in the minimum wage, including 85% of Democrats, 52% of independents and 20% of Republicans. Roughly two-thirds of Americans say that if the bill becomes law, it will help the economy at least some (66%), and 55% say it would help people like them. Those with lower annual incomes are more likely to say the bill will do a lot to help them than are those with higher incomes (46% of those earning less than $25,000 per year say it will help people like them a lot, compared with just 6% among those earning $100,000 or more per year), as are women (28% of women say it will help them a lot vs. 19% of men), and people of color (37% among people of color vs. 16% among Whites). The broad popularity of the bill comes as just over half of Americans say they approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency (51%), while 41% disapprove. Biden\u2019s ratings are higher for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic: 60% approve and 34% disapprove. And most, 54%, say the new President\u2019s policies will move the country in the right direction. Still, even with high hopes for economic improvement from the relief bill, there are indications in this poll that Biden has yet to win over the public on his handling of the economy generally. His approval rating for handling it stands at 49% approve to 44% disapprove, and just 30% say they have a lot of confidence in Biden to deal with the economy. Even as the bill is poised to become a major legislative accomplishment for the Biden administration, the President receives somewhat mixed reviews for his handling of some issues, including environmental policy (50% approve, 41% disapprove), helping the middle class (50% approve, 43% disapprove), racial injustice (47% approve, 43% disapprove), foreign affairs (44% approve and 46% disapprove) and immigration (43% approve and 49% disapprove). Biden\u2019s overall approval rating about two months into his presidency is higher than that of his predecessor, Donald Trump, who held a 45% approval rating in a CNN Poll in March 2017. But Biden\u2019s 51% lags behind other modern presidents, including the three most recent prior to Trump (Barack Obama, 64% in March 2009, George W. Bush, 58% in March 2001 and Bill Clinton, 53% in March 1993). Both Biden and Trump appear to lag behind because of far sharper partisan polarization than their predecessors faced at this stage of their presidencies. Nearly all Democrats approve of how Biden is handling the job thus far (92%) while almost all Republicans disapprove (88%). That\u2019s about the same as partisan views of Trump in March 2017 (88% of Republicans approved and 89% of Democrats disapproved). In March 2009, disapproval of Obama among Republicans was more than 20 points lower than Biden\u2019s (65% disapproved), Bush\u2019s disapproval among Democrats stood at just 49% in March 2001, and Clinton\u2019s disapproval rating among Republicans in March of 1993 was 59%. Americans also seem to have more confidence in Biden than they did in Trump on measures of political leadership. Overall, 38% say they have a lot of confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to provide real leadership for the country (31% said so about Trump in April of 2017) and 34% have a lot of confidence in Biden to appoint the best people to office (Trump stood at 27% on that in April 2017). About a third (32%) say they have a lot of confidence in Biden to work effectively with Congress. The share of Americans who say things in the country today are going well has rebounded after dropping sharply in January. Overall, 39% say things are going well now, up from 22% in January and about the same as in October 2020 just before the presidential election. There has been a sharp partisan reversal on this question, however, as often happens when the presidency changes hands. Just 9% of Democrats said things were going well in January, that has risen to 59% in the new poll. On the Republican side, the percentage who say things are going well has dropped from 37% in January to 19% now. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS March 3 through 8 among a random national sample of 1,009 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. The methodology and weighting for the poll incorporates some changes to CNN\u2019s polling practices made starting with the January 2021 survey. Interviews conducted on cell phones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in recent CNN surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden plans to use the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill expected to pass Congress on Wednesday as a platform for a generational transformation of the economy to benefit the least well-off Americans and alleviate poverty. The passage of a bill of this scale and ambition two months into any new president\u2019s term would represent a power-affirming win. The political payoff for Biden of his first legacy achievement may be even greater. He had to navigate the measure through thin congressional majorities and a Democratic caucus riven by ideological divides \u2013 and amid the worst domestic crisis since World War II. But according to a CNN poll released Tuesday, the relief bill is broadly popular, and Biden\u2019s approval rating tilts positive around 50 days after he took the oath of office. Biden ran for election pledging to send stimulus payments to millions of Americans and to secure money to fund the return of kids to school, while speeding up the pace of vaccinations. When he gives his first prime-time address to Americans on Thursday, he can make a case that he kept his word as he battles to end a pandemic that has killed more than 525,000 Americans. \u201cLeadership matters. Vaccinations are up, infections are down, $1,400 survival checks are on the way, and that is only the beginning,\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said on Tuesday. With its tax credits for children and low-income workers, an extension of health insurance subsidies and nutrition and rental assistance, the American Rescue Plan is intended to do far more than simply stimulate the economy. Liberal champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is hailing it as a major victory for the progressive movement and the biggest targeted relief for working Americans in many years. While many of the provisions in the bill are short term, CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported Tuesday that the President intends to launch an effort to make them permanent. Early successes are crucial for presidents, since they must harness their power when it is at its apex early in their terms. Political muscle is built for later legislative fights by enacting priorities and uniting party factions behind a common cause. Presidents who struggle to get early priorities passed are not necessarily doomed. But they risk creating an impression of disarray that can hurt them in their first midterm elections, as was the case with President Bill Clinton\u2019s collapsed effort to overhaul American health care. Biden plans media and travel blitz to sell relief plan -- and make the benefits permanent Biden\u2019s big opening bill passed the Senate last weekend only after a cliffhanger negotiation to secure the crucial vote of moderate Democrat Joe Manchin. The President intervened personally to get the West Virginian over the line, using the experience as a onetime Senate bull that he told voters would help ease Washington\u2019s divides. In many ways, his stewardship of the measure \u2013 mostly in the background, but stepping in when necessary \u2013 marks a return to traditional presidential cajoling after the vehement tweets of his predecessor, who frequently changed his position on legislation and left his own lawmakers politically exposed. While Manchin did extract concessions on the timeline for extended unemployment benefits, he was able eventually to vote for what is essentially a liberal bill despite coming from a state that ex-President Donald Trump won twice with massive majorities. And progressives who were dismayed by the removal of a hike in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour elected to bank their gains, staying behind the effort and vowing to fight another day. But Biden was unable to keep another of his campaign vows: securing Republican support for major initiatives. The President judged the $600 billion cost of an alternative package offered by 10 GOP senators as insufficient for the scale of the crisis. In votes so far in the House and the Senate, the bill has not attracted a single Republican supporter as Biden\u2019s opponents stake out early positions for the midterm elections on the basis of a pro-Trump base of activists who are keen to deny the new President an early victory. The rescue bill is unusually popular for such a huge and politically consequential measure. Various polls show that more than 60% of the public supports it, which means some Republican and independent voters are on board. Yet if a bill this expensive is not a success, Biden will be exposed, given the lack of Republican support. Key GOP lawmakers are branding his No. 1 priority as a massive, untargeted liberal giveaway. Some economists, meanwhile, fear that it could trigger an inflationary spike in an economy that already appears to be in recovery and could overheat if there is a swift exit from the pandemic. Republican House conference Chair Liz Cheney on Tuesday warned that there would be an inevitable consequence from the scale of the bill \u2013 even though the GOP was quite happy to throw around money when Trump was president. \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy when you look at that package. We know that the result of that package is going to be middle-class tax increases,\u201d the Wyoming Republican said. How much will your stimulus check be? Some pundits have already described the bill as the most fundamental boost to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society measures. While Biden\u2019s ambitions appear in the same ballpark as those of LBJ and New Dealer President Franklin Roosevelt, the Rescue Act may not deserve such comparisons. Many of its key provisions \u2013 including health insurance subsidies, an extra child tax credit and food stamps \u2013 expire in months or at the most two years. But progressive activists see the bill as a down payment on federal benefits that politicians will find politically hard to remove, at least under Democratic majorities. The bill is sure to be a fulcrum of the Democratic midterm election campaign next year. After his address on Thursday, Biden is eventually expected to hold his first presidential news conference, speak to a joint session of Congress and hop aboard Air Force One in the kind of countrywide blitz that has been put on hold so far because of the pandemic. Biden has said that President Barack Obama was too modest in touting the success of the $800 billion Recovery Act in 2009 \u2013 and he seems keen to avoid the same mistake. In that case, however, the recovery was always going to be sluggish after the Great Recession. By the time of the midterm elections in 2010, many Americans were still hurting and it would have seemed crass to mount a victory lap. But if the current pace of vaccinations is maintained and the end game of the pandemic is not derailed by a wave of sickness and death caused by Covid-19 variants, Biden can expect a much faster and more robust economic rebound. Biden forges ahead with his pro-union agenda on several fronts The bill is almost the inverse of Trump\u2019s sole major legislative triumph outside of a conservative refashioning of the judiciary: a massive tax cut that cost $1.5 trillion and was targeted mostly at corporations and more well-off Americans. The comparison shows the massive ideological divide between the two parties, even as some pro-Trump Republicans seize on culture war issues to portray their party as the true voice of America\u2019s working class. GOP lawmakers, however, also have little incentive to break with the party line despite the popularity of Biden\u2019s bill, since in an era of gerrymandered seats and hardened partisan divides the greatest threat to their jobs comes from primary challenges. While the White House is gearing up to spin what it regards as a massive success, the process of passing the American Rescue Plan also included warning signs for Biden as he eyes the rest of his ambitious agenda, which includes immigration revisions, climate change legislation, infrastructure spending and gun control. His initial $1.9 trillion request, not far off half the entire US annual federal budget, is playing into Republican claims that his administration will be rooted in out-of-control socialism. The attack takes substantial liberties with the term but did appear to resonate in sectors of the electorate in last November\u2019s elections, when Republicans in the House narrowed the Democratic majority. The painstaking task of getting moderate Democratic senators like Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema in line with their colleagues suggests there could be difficult discussions ahead if Democrats seek to hobble the fossil fuel industry. And eight Democratic senators voted against a bid by Sanders to insert the minimum wage rise into the Senate bill. The Vermont independent\u2019s gambit was in many ways a symbolic one but it did underscore one of the fault lines in the Democratic Party on Capitol Hill. The partisan nature of the votes on Biden\u2019s recovery package also has some Democrats pondering whether to seek to abolish filibuster rules that mean most major legislation needs a 60-vote majority to pass. The $1.9 trillion behemoth was advanced using a process known as reconciliation, which applies only to budget issues and can be used only sparingly. The White House says Biden, a Senate traditionalist, hopes to avoid such a move \u2013 which would probably be a step too far for Manchin and Sinema. But it seems equally certain that Democratic priorities like voting rights will die in a 50-50 Senate.",

            "article_content": "The Republican Party\u2019s inability to ignite a grassroots backlash against the $1.9 trillion Democratic Covid relief bill moving toward final passage underscores the GOP\u2019s transformation into a coalition energized primarily by cultural and racial grievance \u2013 and the opportunity that opens for President Joe Biden to advance his economic priorities. Although every House and Senate Republican voted against the rescue plan, it has not generated anything like the uprisings against new government spending and programs that engulfed Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama during each man\u2019s first year in office. Indeed, throughout the legislative fight, congressional Republicans and conservative media outlets like Fox News appeared more interested in focusing attention on peripheral cultural issues, like whether Dr. Seuss had become a victim of liberal \u201ccancel culture.\u201d That stress on cultural complaints reflects the shifting source of motivation inside the GOP coalition, with fewer voters responding to the warnings against \u201cbig government\u201d once central to the party\u2019s appeal and more viscerally responding to alarms that Democrats intend to transform \u201cour country,\u201d as former President Donald Trump often calls it, into something culturally unrecognizable. \u201cConcerns about cultural influence, political power and status are really overwhelming other ideological concerns on the right,\u201d says Daniel Cox, a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who recently published an exhaustive national survey of attitudes among GOP voters. \u201cTraditional conservative principles, whether it\u2019s commitment to a strong national defense or support for limited government, do not animate Republican voters.\u201d In \u201909 there was so much anger in the air, the big fat cats being bailed out \u2026 and people were looking for blood and who do we hold accountable. And that\u2019s not as easy to do when you\u2019ve got a global pandemic. Rep. Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat While that shift wasn\u2019t sufficient to attract any Republican votes in Congress for the plan, the absence of grassroots conservative resistance helped Biden unify virtually all moderate Democrats in both legislative chambers, after only some relatively minor policy adjustments. In these votes, congressional Democrats have held together far more cohesively than they did on the principal economic proposals that Clinton and Obama passed during their first months. Rahm Emanuel lived through both of those earlier fights as a top White House side to Clinton and Obama\u2019s chief of staff. Compared with the gyrations required to pass those economic plans, he told me, the changes that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and other moderates demanded this time were \u201ca nip and tuck. It\u2019s not even plastic surgery.\u201d The modest changes, he says, shows that compared with those earlier periods, the Democratic congressional caucus today is \u201cmuch more ideologically cohesive.\u201d Some Democratic strategists warn that the cumulative price tag of the Biden agenda might still trigger a backlash, particularly if interest rates and/or inflation rise, as some economists warn. But for now it\u2019s clear that Democratic moderates are displaying less fear of being tagged with the \u201cbig government\u201d label from the right than their counterparts did during the early months of the Clinton and Obama presidencies. That could help Biden consolidate his party for another expensive proposal he\u2019s likely to unveil soon: a broader, infrastructure-centered, economic recovery plan whose price tag will also likely reach the trillion-dollar level. \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that on economic issues, the voters \u2026 want them to pass stuff and take action, and there\u2019s not a lot of opposition out there,\u201d says Democratic pollster Nick Gourevitch. \u201cSo Biden\u2019s got running room.\u201d As in the famous Sherlock Holmes story, the most revealing dynamic in the legislative debate over the Covid plan may have been \u201cthe dog that didn\u2019t bark\u201d: in this case, the absence of a grassroots conservative uprising against the plan, even though its price tag vastly exceeded the Clinton and Obama proposals that ignited more resistance. Polls have consistently found significant majorities of Americans support the Covid relief plan, with Gourevitch\u2019s firm releasing one survey last week that showed it winning support from more than two-thirds of adults, including a plurality of Republicans. Democratic Rep. Ron Kind, who represents a rural-flavored western Wisconsin district that Trump carried by almost 5 percentage points last November, told me he felt no hesitation about backing the Covid bill. Calls coming into his office, Kind told me, have been \u201c10 to one positive. \u2026 The reaction has been amazing: overwhelming support.\u201d Likewise, Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, who also holds a seat in a blue-collar district Trump won by more than 4 points, says that among his colleagues in swing districts, \u201cTeeth-gnashing, hand-wringing, pearl-clutching: All of those were absent in this.\u201d Changed circumstances partly explain the GOP\u2019s inability to stir serious resistance to the plan. Obama\u2019s economic recovery package was buffeted by the broader public anger over financial institutions\u2019 role in triggering the 2008 housing crisis and severe recession. This time, despite Trump\u2019s frequent efforts to blame the virus on China, Americans seem much more inclined to view the outbreak as a kind of natural disaster that demands a collective response. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that in the modern Republican Party, spending control for its own sake is a minority taste, not a majority taste, and that partly explains why there hasn\u2019t been this massive uprising at a $1.9 trillion bill. Henry Olsen, Ethics and Public Policy Center \u201cIn \u201909 there was so much anger in the air, the big fat cats being bailed out \u2026 and people were looking for blood and who do we hold accountable,\u201d Kind says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not as easy to do when you\u2019ve got a global pandemic.\u201d Different, too, is the breadth of the pain the virus has inflicted. Clinton\u2019s economic plan followed a relatively mild recession; and while Obama\u2019s responded to a much more serious downturn, the housing crisis still spared most homeowners while crushing others. The small-government \u201ctea party\u201d movement that helped power the huge GOP gains in the 2010 election began with a television rant by CNBC reporter Rick Santelli, who asked, \u201cHow many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills?\u201d By contrast, the coronavirus outbreak has touched virtually all Americans: Even those who haven\u2019t faced illness in their families, or disruption to their incomes, have seen the routines of daily life disintegrate. In his northeastern Pennsylvania district, Cartwright says, \u201cyou would struggle to find somebody who wasn\u2019t affected by this pandemic negatively in some way.\u201d That includes local Republican officials in cities and towns, Kind notes, who are eager for the bill\u2019s assistance \u2013 despite congressional Republican attempts to tag its aid for local governments as a bailout to poorly run Democratic cities and states. \u201cThe [congressional] Republicans are overplaying their hand by trying to make this more partisan than it is back home,\u201d he says. One Republican police chief in his district, Kind says, even told him that by opposing the local aid, Republicans \u201care the ones who are really defunding law enforcement and our first responders.\u201d Yet just as important as the changed circumstances may be the evolving priorities of the GOP voter base. \u201cDonald Trump may have shifted the GOP coalition to a more economically populist position or revealed that there\u2019s just less appetite for spending discipline on the right than there was before,\u201d Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told me in an email. If anything, questions about whether to increase or shrink government are now more likely to divide than unite Republican voters, notes Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center. Though Republican partisans still generally recoil at higher taxes and oppose programs they view as transfer payments for the poor, a recent poll of Trump voters that Olsen supervised, for instance, found substantial support among them for spending on Social Security and Medicare (entitlements that benefit the predominantly White senior population). \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that in the modern Republican Party, spending control for its own sake is a minority taste, not a majority taste, and that partly explains why there hasn\u2019t been this massive uprising at a $1.9 trillion bill,\u201d Olsen says. As concerns about big government recede, anxiety about America\u2019s changing identity in an era of growing racial and religious diversity has emerged as the core unifying principle of the GOP coalition. A February poll from Echelon Insights, Anderson\u2019s firm, offers one measure of that shift. Asked their top priorities, Republican voters identified illegal immigration, lack of support for the police, liberal bias in media and general moral decline among their top five concerns; high taxes was the sole economic issue that cracked the list. Olsen\u2019s national survey of Trump voters, conducted in January, found them crackling with the sense that they are culturally and demographically besieged. In that poll, roughly 9 in 10 Trump voters agreed with a series of stark propositions: that America is losing faith in the ideas that make the country great, that Christianity is under attack in the US and that discrimination against Whites \u201cwill increase a lot\u201d in years ahead. Overwhelming majorities rejected the idea that Whites have any intrinsic advantage in American society or that Hispanic and Asian immigrants face discrimination. In the recent national American Enterprise Institute survey supervised by Cox, three-fourths of Republicans asserted that discrimination against Whites was as big a problem as bias against minorities. As conservative White Protestants moved from operating at the periphery of Republican politics to becoming the most critical part of the GOP base, their manifest cultural concerns, which have always incredibly important to these voters, have overshadowed the GOP\u2019s traditional economic agenda. Daniel Cox, American Enterprise Institute Olsen argues that racial resentment is overstated as a unifying principle for Trump supporters, instead portraying the common thread as a more general \u201csense that the American way of life is under attack.\u201d Cox, along with many other political scientists and opinion analysts, disagrees: They argue the claim that Whites face discrimination has been the best predictor of not only support for Trump but also of the belief that the \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d is under such threat that anti-democratic means, including violence, are justified to protect it. Either way, whether these cultural anxieties are motivated primarily by racial resentment or not, what\u2019s clear is they are burning brighter for GOP voters now than hostility to \u201cbig government.\u201d \u201cAs conservative White Protestants moved from operating at the periphery of Republican politics to becoming the most critical part of the GOP base, their manifest cultural concerns, which have always incredibly important to these voters, have overshadowed the GOP\u2019s traditional economic agenda,\u201d says Cox. House Republicans effectively acknowledged that shift by devoting so much attention to the controversy over Dr. Seuss \u2013 the National Republican Congressional Committee offered copies of his books to donors \u2013 while Democrats were passing a spending bill that towered over anything they had approved under Clinton or Obama. Other Republicans, meanwhile, tried to portray Biden\u2019s use of the word \u201cNeanderthal\u201d to criticize GOP governor rollbacks of Covid restrictions as a slur on Republican voters, like Hillary Clinton\u2019s description of some Trump backers as \u201cdeplorables.\u201d While congressional Republicans called the Covid plan \u201csocialist\u201d or charged it was stuffed with Democratic pet projects, they hardly pressed that case with as much enthusiasm as these cultural attacks: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they are even really trying\u201d to discredit the package, says Gourevitch, in a verdict privately echoed by some Republicans. That half-hearted resistance seems likely to encourage Democrats to go big on the next stage of Biden\u2019s economic agenda: the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d long-term growth proposal that will include a substantial infrastructure investment. Though the White House has not decided when to introduce the proposal, it will almost certainly include infrastructure spending in the range of about $300 billion annually, for a cumulative price tag over 10 years in the trillions. Yet both inside the White House and Congress, Democrats are showing little hesitation about proposing that much new spending immediately after a package this big. Both Kind and Cartwright, holding districts that stretch deep into Trump country, say they would enthusiastically support a big infrastructure plan. \u201cI\u2019d be very comfortable with it,\u201d Cartwright says. \u201cI have been serving in the US House since January 2013 and the whole time I have been saying out loud we need a big, big infrastructure package. It\u2019s not just that the folks around here who build things for a living will benefit, it\u2019s that the entire American economy will benefit.\u201d Steve Ricchetti, the White House counselor to Biden, told me the administration expects broad support for the infrastructure package when the President eventually unveils it. I believe there\u2019s a prospect for securing bipartisan support in Congress for this, but I am certain there will be bipartisan support throughout the country for this: governors, mayors, local officials whose economies are dependent on infrastructure investment, digital, energy, transportation, water. Steve Ricchetti, White House counselor to Biden \u201cI believe there will be wide, deep bipartisan support for infrastructure because the need is so great,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe there\u2019s a prospect for securing bipartisan support in Congress for this, but I am certain there will be bipartisan support throughout the country for this: governors, mayors, local officials whose economies are dependent on infrastructure investment, digital, energy, transportation, water. The business community will be enormously supportive of this; it\u2019s an engine for the recovery.\u201d The open question for Biden, as he finalizes his next proposals, is whether there\u2019s a cumulative weight of proposed spending that awakens the slumbering conservative recoil against \u201cbig government.\u201d Both Clinton and Obama saw the grassroots backlashes against their agendas intensify when they followed their initial economic plans with other expensive proposals, particularly their efforts to overhaul the health care system. Each of those dynamics culminated in crushing losses for them in the first midterm after their election. US infrastructure gets slightly better grade on engineers' report card: C- Compared with the Clinton or Obama experience, Democrats unquestionably feel they have more runway to advance new programs today, largely because the GOP coalition no longer seems as energized by opposition to spending. But if the political limits on new spending seem relaxed, that doesn\u2019t ensure they have been eliminated. It\u2019s possible Americans will accept trillions in spending beyond the Covid plan, but it\u2019s also possible Biden and fellow Democrats might trigger a circuit breaker in public opinion if they go too far \u2013 particularly if inflation and interest rates rise from all the economic stimulus as even some Democratic economists have warned. Demands from moderates such as Manchin to find offsetting tax revenues for some or all of the infrastructure plan could also stir more conservative opposition. The problem is that both the cost of the federal response and the underlying disruption to society from the pandemic are so unprecedented that no one can confidently predict how much more spending Biden can add to his tab without provoking the backlash he has conspicuously avoided so far. Even Emanuel, who rarely expresses doubt, acknowledges, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I can give you an educated guess on that.\u201d The safest bet is that so long as the GOP remains fixated on cultural and racial grievance, Democrats will feel confident pushing forward the most aggressive expansion of government\u2019s role in the economy since President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society during the 1960s.

            "article_content": "Liberal Democrats are sensing new momentum behind their years-long drive to overhaul the Senate\u2019s hallowed filibuster \u2013 but they still face a thorny path to weaken the powerful tactic long used to derail bills that lack support from the minority party. To change the filibuster rules, Democrats will need total unity among their 50 members behind a single plan, but there are still ample disagreements over some major issues: Namely whether to keep the 60-vote requirement needed to break a filibuster. Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who for the first time on Sunday opened the door to weakening the filibuster, still favors keeping the 60-vote requirement, people familiar with his thinking told CNN, even as a growing number of his colleagues are calling to change the rules so that a simple majority of 51 senators can vote to advance legislation. The debate has profound implications not just for the traditions of the body but for the direction of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda and for Presidents to come given that the Senate \u2013 unlike the House \u2013 has long been where the minority can thwart the will of the majority. But critics say that the filibuster has been increasingly abused by the minority over the last generation and is in dire need of reform. Manchin, who has long vowed to protect the filibuster, sounded open to one significant shift in the rules: Forcing members to go to the floor and argue if they want to attempt to talk a bill to death, much akin to the popular scenes from the classic film \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington.\u201d Manchin\u2019s comments have now prompted renewed talk among Senate Democrats to at least change the rules to force senators to go to the floor and mount a \u201ctalking filibuster,\u201d a move they hope would at least discourage the tactic since now a simple threat of a filibuster is enough to force a time-consuming set of procedural steps before being forced to clear a 60-vote threshold. \u201cI think a common refrain that you\u2019ve heard from so many members is: \u2018If there\u2019s going to be a filibuster it needs to actually be a filibuster that those who want to obstruct actually should make their case before the American people,\u2019\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat and leading advocate to gut the filibuster, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cThey should have to spend the time and energy to show up and hold the floor.\u201d Merkley, who wants to gut the filibuster altogether so that a simple majority of 51 senators is enough to advance legislation, has spent years lobbying his colleagues to adopt changes to the tactic. Now, he says, there\u2019s been an \u201cenormous change\u201d within his caucus in favor of rewriting the filibuster rules. Under one of Merkley\u2019s proposals, if at least 41 senators vote to block ending debate on a bill or nominee, they would enter a period of extended debate where one or more senators could prevent a final vote for as long as they could physically keep debating the issue on the floor. But as soon as they didn\u2019t have someone on the floor, the presiding officer would declare the extended debate time to be over and the majority leader could move to a final vote where a simple majority vote would be needed for passage of either a nominee or a bill. Yet changing the rules to 51 votes envisioned under the proposal is something that Manchin is highly unlikely to support. Discussions within the Senate Democratic Caucus are expected to pick up steam in the coming days to see if they can unify behind a single plan, senators and aides said Monday. In order to change the rules, Democrats need to employ a rarely use tactic called \u201cthe nuclear option\u201d \u2013 a process where a majority party can change the rules without the consent of the minority. 'This is the year to get it done': Democrats move on expanding background checks In 2013, with Barack Obama as President, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid infuriated Republicans when he invoked the so-called nuclear option to allow presidential nominees, other than Supreme Court picks, to be advanced by a simple majority of 51 senators. Later in 2017, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invoked the nuclear option to allow Supreme Court nominees to be advanced by a simple majority, a move that led to the eventual confirmation of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s picks of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the high court. And now, with Democrats seeking to push forward an ambitious agenda that has scant GOP backing, calls are growing from the left about taking that route again to gut the filibuster in order to allow legislation to deal with gun control, immigration, climate change as well as voting and LGBTQ rights. \u201cIf we continue to see obstruction from our Republican colleagues as we saw through this Covid relief package, I think the patience is going to wear thin, even on moderate Democrats,\u201d said California Sen. Alex Padilla, a freshman appointed to fill the seat vacated by Vice President Kamala Harris. Democrats were only able to advance Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief package since they employed a budget process known as \u201creconciliation\u201d that cannot be filibustered in the Senate, meaning a simple majority is all that\u2019s needed to pass the bill under that particular procedure. It passed on Saturday by a 50-49 vote. But they won\u2019t be able to use the reconciliation process on other policy measures that fall outside of the parameters of the budget rules in the Senate, including the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage that was ruled as outside the bounds of the procedure. Biden, whose legislative agenda has so far garnered no support from Republican lawmakers, continues to resist changes to Senate rules that would diminish the power of the filibuster and its 60-vote requirement. It\u2019s a stance borne from his 36 years in the Senate, a staunch respect of its traditions and practices and an awareness that Democrats won\u2019t always be in the majority, people close to Biden say. And while it\u2019s not an unmovable view \u2014 the White House said Monday it was simply his \u201cpreference\u201d to not change the rules \u2014 it\u2019s one that puts him at odds with members of his own party. At immediate issue is a voting rights bill Senate Republicans largely oppose. HR 1, which passed the Democrat-led House last week, would expand voting access and improve accountability and transparency in Washington, its sponsors say. The bill lacks 60 votes in the Senate. House passes sweeping election bill that would counter GOP efforts to restrict voter access \u201cVoting to me ought to be filibuster-free just like we arranged for the budget to go forward under reconciliation, civil rights laws, and voting rights laws ought to be subject to reconciliation efforts as well,\u201d Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who is close to Biden, said on CNN on Sunday. Yet pressed on whether Biden could support that kind of exemption to the filibuster rules, the White House would not budge. \u201cThat\u2019s not his preference,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. \u201cHe believes with an issue as important as voting rights, there should be a path forward to work with Democrats and Republicans to get it done, so nothing\u2019s changed on his policy on the filibuster.\u201d Democrats say there is still an opportunity to change the views of Biden and other skeptics in their party. \u201cI feel like things change on a dime here,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told CNN on Monday. \u201cAnd when we have several defeats of things that President Biden has promised, and that we must deliver like HR 1 voting rights, I think that that will move him. And we\u2019re keeping up the pressure.\u201d Yet advocates for changing the filibuster still have a Manchin-sized roadblock ahead of them. And they\u2019ll have to convince others who have been skeptical of changes \u2013 including Sens. Angus King of Maine and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2013 to go along as well. Democrats pushing the rules changes say they\u2019re party shouldn\u2019t be worried about the long-term ramifications. Merkley said Monday \u201cI do not worry\u201d that a rules change could backfire if Democrats find themselves back in the minority in the next two or four years. \u201cDemocrats in minority would have the same ability to delay things if we\u2019re willing to take to the floor and make our case before the public that the Republicans would have under the talking filibuster,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cIf your position is right, if your cause is just, well then you\u2019re going to do fine in the following election at having taken your stand.\u201d CNN\u2019s Olanma Mang contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump plotted his Conservative Political Action Conference appearance last week, and a broader, more-robust plan to return to politics as an omnipresent disruptor, one person was conspicuously absent from the confab. Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was notably not on the list of advisers assisting the former President. Kushner, who previously served as chief adviser-cum-micromanager with far-reaching responsibilities and had virtual carte blanche, has tapped out, say several people who worked closely with Kushner at the White House or are familiar with his thinking and told CNN on background in order to maintain relationships. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s just checked out of politics,\u201d says one person, echoing the mindset of Kushner\u2019s wife, Ivanka Trump, who is so over the political bubble she has told friends and colleagues of late to not utter anything to do with Washington. Given Trump\u2019s election loss and current out-of-power position, Kushner\u2019s absence from the aftermath follows a pattern critics have previously pointed out: being present for the wins and MIA from the losses. A person with close ties to Kushner told CNN that Trump\u2019s son-in-law is enjoying \u201csome much needed time with his family,\u201d and his retreat is unrelated to the ebb and flow of the former President\u2019s popularity. During the administration, Kushner was more than happy to speak on behalf of the moments that turned out well for the White House \u2013 but also conveniently skip the parts embroiled in turmoil. As far back as 2017, when Trump\u2019s health care plan floundered and failed, Kushner and his family were on the slopes of Aspen, Colorado. In 2018, they were vacationing in Florida amid the government shutdown, even though the White House insisted Kushner was actively leading negotiations. And in 2019, when Trump was under fire for multiple issues, from background checks to comments about Jews and Democrats, the couple was having downtime in Wyoming, something even Trump noted with a tweet of a photo of them on vacation: \u201cTwo incredible people. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re not working (few work harder)!\u201d A Trump spokeswoman did not provide an on the record response to CNN\u2019s request for comment. It\u2019s not clear, however, who is instigating this \u2013 at least for now \u2013 breakup. Some who have been in contact with Kushner place it at the feet of being done with his father-in-law\u2019s antics. Sources closer to Trump say he\u2019s angry with his son-in-law over the election loss. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner move out of DC and lease luxury condo in Miami That Kushner has now developed anathema to his father-in-law\u2019s political appetite is questionable in its timing, an indicator that Kushner again is putting space between his image and Trump\u2019s, in the wake of the delusional flow of falsehoods after Election Day and the deadly Trump-incited insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. Yet several people told CNN that Kushner is truly \u2013 this time \u2013 effectively done with Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Kushner and Ivanka Trump got out of their posh Washington rental home soon after January 20, the last moving trucks rolling towards their new high-rise, beachside Miami rental departing within 24 hours of President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. Another person familiar with Kushner\u2019s new chapter, says he wants closure and a fresh start, one that doesn\u2019t include advising his father-in-law on a daily basis. Yet two other people who spoke with CNN indicated the schism was instigated by Trump, who has been telling those in his inner circle he is angry with Kushner. Late last week, when Trump convened what he believes is his strongest political brain trust for a meeting to discuss his political future he did not include Kushner. The group looked at the 2022 midterms and, more and more likely, say people who have spoken to Trump of late, a presidential run in 2024. Ensconced in Trump\u2019s private quarters at Mar-a-Lago, his club/post-White House headquarters/home in Palm Beach, the advisers consisted in part of former campaign manager Bill Stepien, adviser Jason Miller, former White House social media director Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and another former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who Kushner fired at Trump\u2019s request last summer and replaced with Stepien. On the table was a push to create a super PAC to raise money, as well as a broader discussion of who would do what as Trump determined where and when and to whom to dole his outsized influence within a fractured Republican Party. For Kushner not to be present at a strategic roundtable struck many who know his deep involvement in every aspect of Trump\u2019s political messaging as odd. \u201cThat\u2019s about as 180 a turn as he could ever make,\u201d said a third person, who worked inside the Trump White House with Kushner. \u201cThis was a guy who for four years did everything on behalf of President Trump. He lived that job.\u201d Another former White House colleague expressed surprise at Kushner\u2019s decision to walk away, adding there was nothing in the administration\u2019s portfolio that Kushner didn\u2019t \u201cmeddle\u201d in, according to this person. From domestic policy, foreign policy, staffing, speechwriting, national security, criminal justice reform, budget, Covid-19, Kushner had a hand in it all. \u201cHe was an \u2018expert\u2019 in everything,\u201d said the former colleague, who noted Kushner\u2019s flitting from one topic to the next was often the bane of some senior West Wing staff\u2019s existence. Jared and Ivanka are poised to return to a Manhattan social scene that no longer welcomes them But Kushner\u2019s \u2013 and similarly Ivanka Trump\u2019s \u2013 ability to maneuver in and out of topics, day-in and day-out, was due in part to being family. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Trump could fire his son-in-law, or give him a nickname and attack him on Twitter,\u201d said the person who worked inside the Trump White House. As such, Kushner was able to be a chief strategist and an influential voice for the then-President. Not so much now. Two of the people who spoke to CNN say Kushner\u2019s relationship with Trump, son-in-law or no, has been fractured since Trump\u2019s reelection loss. Trump, they say, has at times in the last several weeks expressed to those close to him that he faults Kushner for losing. A person who speaks with Kushner frequently strongly denied any contention between the two men, noting Kushner and Trump met for lunch Wednesday in Florida at Trump\u2019s Doral property. Kushner, however, would be a plausible surrogate, seeing it was he who orchestrated much of the administration\u2019s response to, essentially, most things, from the economy to immigration reform and ultimately coronavirus \u2013 and who can forget Kushner\u2019s pledge last April during an interview that the United States would be \u201creally rocking again\u201d by July? \u201cWe know the boss isn\u2019t going to blame himself\u201d (for losing the election), said one source speaking to the nature of their relationship, highlighting Trump\u2019s habitual avoidance of personal responsibility. However, if it is Trump who is keeping Kushner at arm\u2019s length, or vice versa, one thing is clear to those who have talked to Kushner in recent weeks: \u201cHe wants a break,\u201d said a person familiar with his thinking. But the source predicted that after a cooling-off period, and if and when Trump decides to launch a 2024 campaign, Kushner would likely come back into the fold as an adviser. For now, however, Kushner is more than willing to see Trump Jr. or even Parscale assume the role of Trump whisperer and loyal first lieutenant, though Kushner\u2019s close associate said he keeps tabs on Stepien, Parscale and Miller, and speaks with them frequently. Several of the people who spoke to CNN noted Kushner\u2019s peripheral interests still include an ongoing focus on the Middle East, brokering peace deals and helping ensure they take hold. He would also like to be part of advancing criminal justice reform, such as reviving parole in the federal prison system, something that was eliminated in 1984 and Kushner feels deserves reexamination. \u201cHe is trying to be someone you would go to on the Republican side to put a deal together,\u201d said the person familiar with Kushner\u2019s potential career path. Yet for the foreseeable future, don\u2019t expect to spot Kushner among the former presidential advisers eagerly volunteering for a second tour. \u201cThe drama of politics wore him down. Eventually, Trump wears everyone down,\u201d the person said.",

            "article_content": "Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation to create a monument on Capitol Hill in honor of the late Supreme Court Justice and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The House bill, introduced on Monday by the Democratic Women\u2019s Caucus \u2013 including Reps. Lois Frankel of Florida, Jackie Speier of California, Veronica Escobar of Texas and Brenda Lawrence of Michigan \u2013 and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, proposes placing a monument either in the Capitol or on the grounds honoring Ginsburg, who died in September at age 87 after 27 years on the high court. The bill does not specify details about the proposed monument, including what it would look like and how much it would cost to build. CNN has reached out to multiple lawmakers\u2019 offices for comment. \u201cThe Notorious RBG was tiny in stature, but a giant in the fight for women\u2019s equality,\u201d Speier told CNN in a statement. \u201cHad it not been for her tireless and fearless dedication, we women in Congress would have had a much different experience in pursuing our dreams to serve our country and shape and inform policy impacting women everywhere. We must immortalize this feminist icon with a statue in the Capitol that honors her legacy and educates future generations of her profound contributions.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has introduced a companion bill in the Senate that has since gained 15 Democratic co-sponsors. \u201cJustice Ginsburg\u2019s dedication to our country\u2019s values and ideals is an example for every American,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement. \u201cShe was an icon and a trailblazer who dedicated her life to opening doors for women at a time when so many insisted on keeping them shut.\u201d A monument of Ginsburg in the Capitol would be one of few that depict female icons. Ginsburg was appointed as an associate justice in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton. In recent years, she became the most senior member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, casting progressive votes on social issues including abortion, same-sex marriage, voting rights, immigration, health care and affirmative action. Ginsburg\u2019s death \u2013 which came less than seven weeks before a hotly contested presidential election \u2013 prompted a fierce partisan battle over the court\u2019s future. Days after her death, then-President Donald Trump nominated conservative federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed a week ahead of the November 3 election in a process that Democrats had argued was a rushed and cynical power grab that threatened to undermine Ginsburg\u2019s legacy.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration could reunite migrant families separated at the US-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump in the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday. Mayorkas, who\u2019s leading the family reunification task force established by President Joe Biden, said the administration hopes to reunite separated families in the US or in their country of origin. \u201cWe hope to be in a position to give them the election. And if in fact they seek to reunite here in the United States, we will explore lawful pathways for them to remain in the United States and address the family needs,\u201d he said at the White House press briefing. The Biden administration is relying on a Trump-era policy to turn away migrants at border \u201cThe prior administration dismantled our nation\u2019s immigration system in its entirety,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cIt takes time to rebuild an entire system and to process individuals at the border in a safe and just way.\u201d The administration is working closely with counsel for separated families, along with other partners, to chart a path forward. \u201cWe are doing it along with the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras \u2026 We are doing it with non-governmental organizations. And we intend to and will shortly harness the capabilities, resources and desire of the private sector,\u201d Mayorkas added. Lawyers are still trying to locate the parents of nearly 500 children who had been split from their families at the US-Mexico border by the Trump administration, according to attorneys \u2013 down from a month ago, when attorneys were looking for the parents of 611 children. Mayorkas reiterated the administration\u2019s message that migrants should not come to the US now, telling reporters Monday, the department is working to rebuild its asylum and humanitarian programs. \u201cThey need to wait. It takes time to rebuild the system from scratch. If they come, if families come, if single adults come to the border, we are obligated to, in the service of public health, including the health of the very people who are thinking of coming, to impose to travel restrictions under the CDC\u2019s [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] Title 42 authorities and return them to Mexico and we have done that,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe need individuals to wait.\u201d Lawyers make progress in locating parents of children split from families at the border, latest court filing says Last year, as the pandemic gripped the country, the Trump administration invoked a public health law allowing border officials to turn away migrants apprehended at the border, including children, resulting in a low number of unaccompanied children being admitted to the US. The Biden administration is no longer returning unaccompanied minors under the health law. However, families and single adults are subject to the policy. Mayorkas said the goal is to rebuild a system \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to enable potential migrants to access humanitarian relief from their countries of origin. \u201cWe are not saying don\u2019t come, we are saying don\u2019t come now because we will be able to deliver a safe and orderly process to them as quickly as possible,\u201d he added when asked how long it will take to rebuild the department and processes. When pressed by CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny on how specifically the administration is conveying that message to families that want to travel to the US, Mayorkas said, \u201cWe are flooding the space with that critical message.\u201d He said the department is working with non-governmental agencies and others to communicate to migrants, along with Northern Triangle country governments of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to know those whom we have successfully deterred,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut our understanding is that it does work to a degree.\u201d Asked about plans to do Covid-19 testing for migrants, Mayorkas said the extraordinary weather in Texas created an \u201cunexpected stress on our system.\u201d As a matter of process, individuals and families are brought into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody and are tested in ICE custody, he said. But he did not address testing in US Border Patrol custody or testing for unaccompanied migrant children that don\u2019t go into Health and Human Services custody, not ICE. Asked whether there\u2019s a border crisis, Mayorkas said no, calling it instead a \u201cchallenge.\u201d \u201cWe are challenged at the border. The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are meeting that challenge. It is a stressful challenge. That\u2019s why quite frankly we\u2019re working as hard as we are, not only in addressing the urgency of the challenge but also in building the capacity to manage it,\u201d he said. He cast blame on the Trump administration for dismantling the nation\u2019s immigration system, repeatedly underscoring that the system was \u201cgutted.\u201d He cited to plan to bring migrants in the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program back to the US as one part of the strategy to rebuild the immigration system. The department has expanded returns for people forced to wait in Mexico to three US ports of entry, with one that can manage 100 individuals a day, he said.",

            "article_content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Monday to advance President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for attorney general, setting up his confirmation before the full Senate. The vote was 15 to 7 with all Democratic senators and four Republicans in favor of the nominee. Garland, the former chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, has been praised by members of both parties for his intellect and integrity. He pledged in his nomination hearing last month to \u201cfend off any effort by anyone\u201d to politically influence the Justice Department\u2019s investigations, and that his first priority would be to fully prosecute the \u201cheinous\u201d crimes committed in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of extraordinary qualifications,\u201d said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman, on Monday. \u201cHis life has been dedicated to public service and advancing values that are vital to the Justice Department\u2019s functioning, integrity, independence, fidelity to the rule of law, and a commitment to equal justice for all.\u201d Garland will face politically charged questions at the Justice Department, including how to handle a federal probe into Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and whether the DOJ should wade into former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in the riot at the Capitol. Garland also said in his hearing that he didn\u2019t have \u201cany reason to think\u201d that special counsel John Durham \u201cshould not remain in place\u201d to complete his investigation of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe. Garland also said he had not spoken to the President about his son\u2019s case. Federal investigators in Delaware have been examining multiple financial issues, including whether Hunter Biden violated tax and money laundering laws in business dealings in foreign countries. \u201cThe President made abundantly clear in every public statement before and after my nomination that decisions about investigations and prosecutions will be left to the Justice Department,\u201d said Garland. \u201cThat was the reason that I was willing to take on this job.\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, supported Garland, calling him an \u201chonorable man\u201d with a \u201cbig job\u201d ahead of him to uphold the integrity of the department. \u201cIt\u2019ll be up to him to keep the Justice Department from turning into the social justice department,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cI take him at his word that this is not what he wants.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was one of seven Republicans to oppose Garland\u2019s nomination. He argued that Garland wasn\u2019t forthcoming in responding to questions on gun, immigration and other policies, and wouldn\u2019t agree to an in-person meeting. Cruz said that the panel\u2019s vote would set a precedent where an attorney general nominee could \u201cessentially refuse to answer all questions\u201d and the Senate majority would still confirm him or her. \u201cThat\u2019s a precedent I predict will come back to haunt this committee,\u201d said Cruz. Durbin said that Garland responded to all of Cruz\u2019s 127 written questions, and offered to meet with Cruz over Zoom due to the health concerns of the pandemic. In March 2016, then-President Barack Obama nominated Garland to serve as a justice on the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans blocked his nomination, claiming that the public should vote for the next president to decide the lifelong appointment. Yet in September 2020, then-President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and on October 26, about a week before Election Day, she was confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Before becoming a judge, Garland served under President Bill Clinton\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick and led the Justice Department investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Garland said at his hearing that the current threat from White supremacists is a \u201cmore dangerous period than we faced at that time.\u201d He also gave a brief, yet emotional, anecdote in response to a question about his family history in confronting hate and discrimination. Garland fought back tears as he explained why leading the Justice Department was important to him. \u201cI come from a family where my grandparents fled anti-Semitism and persecution,\u201d said Garland. \u201cThe country took us in and protected us. I feel an obligation to the country to pay back.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has no remorse about the deadly violence he incited with his lies about a stolen election in his uprising against the US Congress. This much was clear when the ex-President put the Republican Party on notice on Sunday that he intends to use his hold on its grassroots to try to suppress the vote heading into the presidential election in 2024, in which he hinted he might run. In his first public remarks since leaving the White House, he also dangerously lashed out at Supreme Court justices for failing to intervene to throw him the election he clearly lost to President Joe Biden. \u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves for what they\u2019ve done to our country \u2026 the Supreme Court didn\u2019t have the guts or the courage to do anything about it,\u201d Trump fumed in an authoritarian speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in Orlando, Florida, referring to false fraud claims thrown out by multiple judges. Fact check: Trump delivers lie-filled CPAC speech Last seen leaving Washington in disgrace, the ex-President\u2019s self-regarding wander through old political fights emphasized his obsession with revenge at a time when the attention of the majority of the nation not in his camp is concentrating on more immediate concerns. The distribution of a third Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 manufactured by Johnson & Johnson \u2013 is stirring new hope that a version of normality could be restored by the summer. Depending on how it progresses in the Senate, the House passage of Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan early Saturday could also accelerate the end of a pandemic that the ex-President ignored completely in his final weeks in office. The embittered former commander in chief, however, was locked in his false but damaging alternative reality, to which millions of his followers subscribe, that he was the victim of a massive election fraud effort. The last time Trump publicly used the kind of language that he spewed on Sunday was when Congress was certifying Biden\u2019s election win and his mob invaded the US Capitol, calling for the execution of then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to break the law to keep Trump in power. His latest comments suggest that the fight to safeguard US democratic institutions and free elections did not end when he left the White House but will be a key struggle in the run-up to the next presidential election. As local and state Republicans seek to narrow access to the polls, Trump, who tried to force officials in Georgia to steal the election for him, called on the GOP to outlaw mail-in and early voting to ensure \u201chonest elections\u201d and made racially motivated insinuations about irregularities in Detroit and Philadelphia. He demanded citizen tests for ballot access, said voting should only take place on Election Day and called for independent judges to be barred from adjudicating election disputes. 6 takeaways from the Trump-dominated CPAC \u201cThe Republicans have to do something about it. They better do something about it,\u201d he said The ex-President\u2019s warning could be so damaging because he is effectively making his support for GOP candidates in the 2022 midterms contingent on them backing his false claims of a corrupt election in 2020. And in the shorter term, he is seeding even more suspicion about his exit from the White House with conservative voters, while providing more potential motivation for extremist groups who support him. In such a way, Trump\u2019s corrupting influence could harm faith in the fairness of US elections, the bedrock of US democracy for months or years into the future. In a further inflammatory move, Trump also called out by name Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach him in the House and convict him in the Senate for his assault on the Constitution, including Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah. His singling of them out demonstrates his intention to exact revenge in upcoming primaries and could leave them vulnerable to harassment as they travel around the country. Trump\u2019s speech, apparently intended to further radicalize followers who have already shown they are willing to embrace violence, was carried live on Fox News and other conservative outlets in an unfiltered stream of falsehoods. Trump got his biggest cheer when he refreshed the lie that he won in November, then embarked on multiple flagrantly false claims of fraud. His fury put down a marker that any Republican who wants his endorsement and to prosper with the party\u2019s base must now support his dangerous lies about the last election being stolen. \u201cI may even decide to beat them for a third time,\u201d said the one-term former President who never won the popular vote and failed to crack 50% in presidential approval polls while in office. Several times, Trump implied to his delighted crowd that he could end up back in the Oval Office. \u201cWith your help, we will take back the House. We will win the Senate. And then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I wonder who that will be.\u201d Trump\u2019s unhinged conduct and attacks on his successor so soon after leaving office represented a historical aberration. Yet such is the blowtorch that Trump trained at the traditions of the presidency that they came as no surprise. In fact, a show of restraint would have been more notable from an ex-President who often put personal grievances above the national interest. To begin with, Trump\u2019s big comeback speech was a low-energy elegy for his own presidency and an extended whine about Biden\u2019s early policies. His delivery lacked the enthusiasm and sparks of humor that made his speeches compelling political theater early in his 2016 campaign. But the pilgrimage of senior Republican politicians who made the trip to Florida, including potential 2024 candidate like Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, demonstrated Trump\u2019s unbroken hold on the Republican grassroots. Trump\u2019s inflammatory language and new push to dismantle the infrastructure of elections is likely to mean more frustration for Republican leaders in Washington who are trying to build opposition to the current President\u2019s Covid rescue package in the Senate but who will now be assailed by questions about Trump\u2019s new insurrectionary rhetoric against the Supreme Court. 2024 Republican prospects seek their own breakout moments at Trump-dominated CPAC The ex-President\u2019s comments came with the Capitol and the Supreme Court building still behind a massive steel fence, amid lingering fears of attacks by extremists fueled by Trump\u2019s seditious rhetoric. There was no doubt about the former President\u2019s desire to remain the dominant figure in the Republican Party. The question is whether performances such as Sunday\u2019s will retain resonance months down the road or whether Trump\u2019s inevitable time out of the spotlight will dampen his aura even among his devoted fans. Washington Republican leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appear to be hoping for the latter scenario. One of the senators who voted to convict Trump in his Senate trial, Louisiana\u2019s Bill Cassidy, suggested on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that the ex-President\u2019s grip on the party would eventually fade. \u201cIf we idolize one person, we will lose. And that\u2019s kind of clear from the last election,\u201d Cassidy told Dana Bash. Trump accused Biden of having the worst beginning to a new presidency in history, even though the Democrat\u2019s approval ratings are at levels his predecessor never reached. He demanded that kids must go back to school now, playing into the frustration of parents, but ignoring his own negligence in fighting the pandemic that meant that in-person learning has been on hold for a year in many parts of the nation. Trump offered a policy prescription of \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade, draconian border enforcement, expanded oil and gas exploration, opposition to gun control and a crusade against what conservative cable hosts call cancel culture. \u201cIn just one short month we have gone from America first to America last,\u201d Trump claimed. But his angry comments on immigration, while mirroring his early rhetoric in the 2016 campaign, represented a reprise of the nativist rhetoric that alienated many suburban voters and may have helped lose him the presidency, and Republicans the House and Senate. Trump\u2019s appearance often lacked the freshness of turns from his proteges \u2013 like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem \u2013 until he reached the inflammatory rhetoric of his attack on the Supreme Court and claims of a stolen election. The CPAC presidential straw poll is hardly a scientific barometer of GOP opinion. But Trump\u2019s win with only 55% of the vote seemed low at a three-day event staged as an endless homage to the ex-President.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump repeated his election lies on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, Sunday, looking to reclaim his role as the Republican Party\u2019s kingmaker in the 2022 midterm elections and positioning himself for a 2024 presidential run. \u201cIt is far from being over,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be victorious and America will be stronger and greater than ever before.\u201d Repeating his false claims that he won the November election, which President Joe Biden won resoundingly with 306 to Trump\u2019s 232 electoral votes, Trump teased a White House run in four years: \u201cI may even decide to beat them for a third time,\u201d the one-term former President said in his first public remarks since leaving the White House. Goya Foods CEO falsely says election was illegitimate, Trump is 'the real, the legitimate, and the still actual president' During a lengthy speech in which he baselessly claimed that the US has a \u201cvery sick and corrupt electoral process\u201d and accused the Supreme Court of failing to \u201chave the courage\u201d to overturn the election on his behalf, he called for a new round of voting restrictions, claiming, falsely, that mail-in ballots and early voting were responsible for Biden\u2019s win. After boasting that it has \u201cbeen stated\u201d that his endorsement \u201cis the most powerful asset in politics,\u201d Trump closed out his speech by asking supporters to contribute to his political action committees as he hinted about his future plans. \u201cWith your help, we will take back the House, we will win the Senate, and then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I wonder who that will be. I wonder who that will be. Who? Who? Who will that be? I wonder.\u201d Trump has remained unbowed and unapologetic since the January 6 insurrection, his political capital among Republicans scarcely diminished even after he was impeached for a second time by the US House, with 10 Republican votes, and then acquitted by the US Senate, with seven GOP senators joining Democrats in the vote to convict him. On stage Sunday, he named all the Republican lawmakers who voted against him \u2013 calling them \u201cgrandstanders\u201d \u2013 and saving special ire for Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, who he referred to as a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d He targeted Biden throughout much of his speech, attacking his immigration policies, accusing him of taking credit for the Trump administration\u2019s work on vaccines and demanding that he \u201cget the schools open.\u201d 6 takeaways from the Trump-dominated CPAC Without any evidence, he claimed that Biden\u2019s policy changes are triggering a new crisis at the Southern border and creating a youth migrant crisis. He touted his own efforts as president to expand the border wall and said Biden was reversing his administration\u2019s accomplishments. To allay concerns among Republicans about the splintering within the GOP, Trump dismissed any discussion that he was contemplating starting a new political party: \u201cWe have the Republican Party,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cIt\u2019s going to unite and be stronger than ever before,\u201d Trump said at the gathering, which has served as an audition for other potential Republican presidential hopefuls. Trump won the unscientific straw poll of CPAC attendees when they were asked who they favored as 2024 GOP presidential candidates. But the results suggest that there is interest in other potential candidates. Two polls were conducted, one that included Trump\u2019s name and one that did not. In the straw poll that included Trump, 55% of attendees said they preferred the former President as their nominee for 2024, another 21% favored Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, while South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was third with 4%. In a second poll that excluded Trump, DeSantis was far ahead of the other contenders at the event that took place in his home state. In that poll, 43% of CPAC attendees supported DeSantis, a close ally of Trump. Noem was second with 11%, followed by Donald Trump Jr. at 8%, then former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 7% each. The overwhelming majority of CPAC attendees who participated in the gathering\u2019s informal surveys said they approved of the job that Trump did as president. But only 68% said they wanted him to run again in 2024; 15% said they don\u2019t want the former President to vie for the GOP nomination and 17% said they were unsure \u2013 indicating the opening for a fresh face within the party. While charting his next political act over the past month from his post-presidential retreat at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Trump has refused to take any responsibility for his role in inciting his supporters to violence during the January 6 storming of the Capitol during the certification of the November election results \u2013 an event that has exacerbated divisions within the GOP about Trump and his role in the party moving forward. Fact checking CPAC: speakers make false claims about the election, the Capitol attack, immigration, Covid, and The Muppets GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy \u2013 who voted to convict Trump earlier this month \u2013 said Sunday that he believes if the Republican Party focuses on Trump to win back seats in 2022 and the presidency in 2024, \u201cWe will lose.\u201d \u201cIf we idolize one person, we will lose,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of clear from the last election.\u201d Although he has prominent critics in the party, most GOP leaders have stood by Trump as state and local party officials have moved to censure Republican lawmakers who favored his impeachment. The former President has been holding court in Florida not only with one-time aides like his former campaign manager Brad Parscale, but also visitors like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has pledged to work with Trump to regain the majority in 2022, and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. Foreshadowing Trump\u2019s influence on the 2022 races, McCarthy lavished praise on Trump during a Saturday panel at CPAC, crediting him with Republicans\u2019 better-than-expected showing in the 2020 House races: \u201cWe got closer than anybody thought we could get\u2026 No one said we\u2019d win seats,\u201d McCarthy said of GOP efforts to win the majority last November. \u201cBut this is the little secret. You know why we won that? President Trump worked on all these races.\u201d Indiana GOP Rep. Jim Banks, the chairman of an influential group of House conservatives, took a shot at Republicans who have been disloyal to Trump during the same panel, warning that efforts to curtail his influence could harm the party in 2022 as they try to regain the majority in the US House and the Senate. 2024 Republican prospects seek their own breakout moments at Trump-dominated CPAC \u201cThere\u2019s very few Republicans \u2014 the least popular in our party are the ones who want to erase Donald Trump and Donald Trump\u2019s supporters from our party,\u201d said Banks, who represents a solidly red district in northeast Indiana. \u201cLet me tell you if that happens, we won\u2019t win back to majority in 2022. We definitely won\u2019t win back the White House in 2024 if we erase Donald Trump.\u201d That certainty about Trump\u2019s reign in the Republican Party has emboldened the former President as he seeks to put his imprint on the upcoming elections. After raising millions of dollars off his false claims of election fraud, Trump is weighing the creation of a new super PAC that could raise unlimited amounts of money with very few restrictions, CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Jim Acosta reported Saturday. In filings with the Federal Election Commission Saturday, Trump also expanded his potential reach by converting both his presidential campaign committee, Donald J. Trump for President, and his leadership PAC, Save America, into two political action committees that can support other candidates for office. In the discussions with aides about the 2022 midterms and future election cycles, Trump has been weighing how to exact revenge on the House members and Senators who cast impeachment votes against him \u2014 and the new committees could serve as his vehicle for doing that. He made one of his first steps in that direction Friday when he threw his support behind Max Miller, who is challenging one of the House members who voted to impeach Trump \u2013 Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez. Explaining his reasons for running Friday, Miller charged that Gonzalez \u201cbetrayed\u201d his Northeast Ohio constituents when he voted to impeach the former President. The deference to the former President after the events of January 6 that stunned the world has underscored Trump\u2019s firm command of the party\u2019s base even as much of America recoiled from his election lies and his dangerous maneuvering to overthrow the democratic process. Though polls showed a dip in Trump\u2019s support after the Capitol insurrection, his approval ratings among Republicans have since rebounded. Three-quarters of Republicans said they wanted to see Trump play a prominent role in the GOP going forward, according to Quinnipiac University Poll released earlier this month, even though 68% of Americans said the former President did not do enough to stop the insurrection. Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC also gave him another shot at revisionist history about his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic not long after the nation marked 500,000 deaths from coronavirus. Speakers at the political conference largely panned President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief package, which narrowly passed the House early Saturday morning with all Republicans and two Democrats opposing the bill. Trump, who oversaw the rapid development of coronavirus vaccines through the task force known as Operation Warp Speed, said his administration deserves much of the credit for the current pace of vaccinations in America and repeatedly referred to Covid-19 using a racist term. \u201cNever let them forget this was us. We did this,\u201d Trump said of the vaccine development. Though Biden has set a goal of getting most K-12 students back to in-person instruction by the end of his first 100 days, Trump accused Biden and Democrats of capitulating to teachers\u2019 unions, which have cited concerns about children returning to school when their members have not been vaccinated. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason whatsoever why the vast majority of young Americans should not be back in school immediately,\u201d said Trump, hammering an issue that the GOP hopes to use against Democrats in the 2022 midterms. And although the Biden administration has said that teachers should be prioritized for vaccinations and dedicated at least $130 billion to reopening schools in the President\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package that passed the House early Saturday morning, Trump said school funding was \u201ca very small part\u201d of the legislation. Biden offered a diametrically different message about fighting the virus on Saturday morning as he pressed for the passage of his relief package in the Senate: \u201cWe have no time to waste. If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus.\u201d \u201cWe can finally get our economy moving again, and the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long,\u201d Biden said in remarks at the White House. \u201cWe need to relieve that suffering.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "Democratic lawmakers are wrestling with how to move forward with a series of immigration bills that would legalize undocumented immigrants, with some pushing for sweeping immigration revisions out of the gate and others urging caution. Lawmakers are hoping to resurface immigration bills on the House floor before April 1, a period in which they can introduce legislation in the new session that\u2019s already passed in the chamber without going through committee again. Those bills would grant legal status to thousands of undocumented farmworkers and address immigrants who came to the US illegally as children, as well as two other programs, Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure, that offer temporary relief. Then too there\u2019s President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration legislation, known as the US Citizenship Act, which tackles the whole US immigration system and seeks to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants already in the US. Biden said during a CNN town hall this month that he wants a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants residing in the US but signaled willingness to pass other immigration measures in the interim. Democrats involved in the efforts are in talks with leadership about how to proceed with the immigration agenda in the House but decisions haven\u2019t been made yet, according to multiple members and aides. Leaders in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus are still holding education seminars with various groups within the Democratic caucus, according to one member. White House announces sweeping immigration bill \u201cThere are two camps. One is that we should have three separate votes and one that says we should bundle them all together,\u201d said one Democratic member who asked to speak on the condition of background to freely discuss the internal caucus conversations. \u201cIt\u2019s also unclear if they want to try to do this in a purely partisan way or do they want to try to build bipartisan support for it?\u201d The question of order and timing is in part a calculation about what can actually become law. While Democrats largely support legalizing millions of immigrants who are already in the country illegally, as Biden\u2019s proposal would do, there is a risk in passing a sweeping bill in the House only to watch it go nowhere in the Senate. Moderate Democrats, some of whom won election in districts that Donald Trump carried in 2016 and 2020, fear that voting on a comprehensive immigration bill without a clear path in the Senate could open them up to unnecessary attacks. It\u2019s one thing, they argue, to vote on legislation that will become law, but it\u2019s another thing to vote just for the sake of messaging and then suffer political attacks later. This is the struggle, whether we continue to just pass stuff that just initially is a statement of our values, knowing we then have to back down in order to actually legislate, and there is some tension within the caucus. Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat Lawmakers involved in previous attempts at immigration overhauls also concede that moving Biden\u2019s immigration measure forward is no easy feat, and instead focus on a piecemeal approach. \u201cIf we look at reality, I think we know that it\u2019s easier to get bipartisan support on the DREAM Act and agriculture plan,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, citing two measures that previously passed the House and would provide relief to farmworkers and undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. \u201cI think we have a much better shot at those two, even though I support full comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up with good intentions; I want to end up with some sort of progress.\u201d One option could be to vote on the farmworker and Dreamer bills separately and keep working to see if changes could be made to the comprehensive bill to garner some Republican support down the line. \u201cIn the abstract, my preference has been for a big comprehensive bill that has a lot in it and not piecemeal. It\u2019s easier to do some hard things when you do it that way,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan. \u201cThis is the struggle, whether we continue to just pass stuff that just initially is a statement of our values, knowing we then have to back down in order to actually legislate, and there is some tension within the caucus,\u201d Kildee added. Others argue that Democrats should take advantage of the opportunity sooner rather than later. We want to make sure we\u2019re not forgoing the possibility of a truly comprehensive bill for these other bills. If we do these smaller pieces, does that mean we\u2019re not going to get to the whole thing? \u2026 Let\u2019s just push hard on all the different places. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat This \u201cis our moment to finally fix an immigration system that has been broken for decades. We can keep families together, stimulate our economy, and properly manage our border at the same time. The U.S. Citizenship Act will do just that. We must use this momentum to pass robust reform,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, who\u2019s leading the Biden bill on the House side, in a statement. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, echoed that. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re not forgoing the possibility of a truly comprehensive bill for these other bills. If we do these smaller pieces, does that mean we\u2019re not going to get to the whole thing?\u201d Jayapal told CNN. \u201cLet\u2019s just push hard on all the different places.\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, confirmed on a call with reporters this week that putting a bill on the House floor by March 8 is \u201cbeing discussed,\u201d but he didn\u2019t offer a timeline. \u201cThis is a hiccup where we have to figure out what\u2019s going on the floor, but ultimately it\u2019s going to be up to the Senate,\u201d said a source familiar with the discussions. The Senate would need 10 Republican lawmakers to cross the aisle and vote for a comprehensive immigration bill, something that doesn\u2019t seem plausible in the wake of Trump\u2019s recalibration of the party\u2019s positions on immigration. During the Trump administration, many Republicans on Capitol Hill moved farther to the right to restrict even legal forms of immigration. The former President\u2019s border wall \u2013 a lightning rod for Democrats \u2013 became synonymous with gaining control of the southern border for the Republican base, and even senators who worked on the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul, like Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have made it clear they would prefer a piecemeal approach this time. Democrats have the advantage of controlling all three branches of government. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, could bring immigration legislation to the floor even if it didn\u2019t have the votes to pass, but the timeline for something like that is still far off, given other measures, like Biden\u2019s infrastructure package, that the Senate is working through. The blind spot in the immigration debate Immigrant advocates have stressed the need for a legislative revamp after years of constant policy changes and executive actions that have put millions of lives in limbo. They find themselves in the unusual spot of supporting Biden\u2019s bill, and the vision it lays out, while recognizing there may be more success in passing smaller measures for the time being. \u201cOur movement is so hungry for a breakthrough this year that we are focused on what\u2019s going to get us from today to the finish line with a breakthrough victory,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant advocacy organization. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to vote on it, but what we\u2019re trying to do is get momentum that leads to a victory,\u201d Sharry said, referring to Biden\u2019s immigration bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not really either/or. It\u2019s now and later.\u201d Jorge Loweree, policy director at the American Immigration Council, noted how previous attempts at an overhaul hang over the latest effort to pass sweeping legislation. \u201cWhat\u2019s playing out behind the scenes is an assessment in real time of what\u2019s possible in this particular Congress, in this moment. And it\u2019s in response to the way we\u2019ve pursued immigration reform previously, which is to cobble everything into one bill, rally everyone behind it and only to see it fall apart,\u201d Loweree said. In a letter to the White House on Friday obtained by CNN, a group of immigrant advocates urged the President to push Democratic lawmakers to \u201cpursue every possible avenue to deliver for immigrant communities without delay,\u201d starting with measures addressing immigrant youth, Temporary Protected Status holders, essential workers and farmworkers. \u201cWith passage in the House of these bills, we expect the White House to go all in on a strategy urging the Senate to pass permanent solutions for immigrant youth, TPS holders and farmworkers. These are clear, attainable and immediate steps Democrats can take to set President Biden\u2019s bill, and the larger objective of citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, in motion,\u201d reads the letter. A member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who requested anonymity to speak freely told CNN that debate within the party on these kinds of issues is expected. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any major bill that comes to the Congress where there isn\u2019t some internal debate about what exactly it should look like. It\u2019s the same thing with this bill,\u201d the member said. Still, the message from groups advocating for immigrants in the US is clear: \u201cJust move in March,\u201d Sharry said.",

            "article_content": "For obvious reasons, President Joe Biden made the coronavirus pandemic his first legislative priority. Polling shows wide public support for his $1.9 trillion relief plan. But that didn\u2019t translate to Republican support for the measure. When the House passed the bill last week, not a single GOP lawmaker voted yes. That offered a bookend to developments in state capitals across the nation, where Republicans seek to restrict access to the ballot. After Biden defeated Donald Trump in a presidential election free of large-scale voter fraud, Republican legislators have proposed curbing voting methods used last November in the name of stopping large-scale fraud. In both cases, Republicans defied broad signals from the political marketplace. Instead, they heeded the defiant partisan impulse that Trump sounded before leaving office: \u201cIf you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d Those words explain why Trump\u2019s pugnacity continues to grip the GOP despite his electoral defeat, second impeachment and mounting legal woes. They reflect the existential dread motivating the conservative White Christians who form the party\u2019s core constituency and fear 21st century America is drifting away from them. \u201cIt really is about not giving an inch anymore \u2013 this sense of absolute resistance,\u201d says Robert P. Jones, director of the Washington-based Public Religion Research Institute and author of \u201cThe End of White Christian America.\u201d The imperative for resistance over cooperation, even when futile, fueled Trump\u2019s denial of his defeat and the deadly US Capitol insurrection by his supporters that was replete with Christian iconography. In a different context, it produced the reflex among conservative politicians and commentators to blame Democratic energy policies for the recent power-grid crisis in Republican-controlled Texas \u2013 as stalwart conservative Sen. Ted Cruz, his constituents suffering, headed to a Mexican beach. \u201cFor the Republican Party, the sensationalization, nationalization, and demonization of the political system matter far more than any form of governing,\u201d Amanda Carpenter, a former Cruz aide who is now a CNN contributor, wrote in The Bulwark. \u201cPolitical performance is the point. Both the means and the end. The purpose and the power.\u201d For almost all of American history, White Christians have represented a large majority of the US population and controlled the levers of government power. But that majority had shrunk to just 54% by 2008 when Barack Obama won election as the first African American president and personified the nation\u2019s changing demography. Trump has personified resistance to that change with his turn-back-the-clock call to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d Faith in his singular mission proved so strong that at last summer\u2019s nominating convention Republicans didn\u2019t even offer a governing platform. Resistance hasn\u2019t worked. Trump lost his reelection bid, Democrats captured Congress, and the proportion of White Christians in the population has now shrunk to 44%, PRRI research shows. But White Christians still hold unchallenged dominance within the GOP. They represent two-thirds of rank-and-file Republicans, Jones said. And they represent more than 90% of Republican senators, House members and governors. Is the GOP's extremist wing now too big to fail? The most conservative among them \u2013 those describing themselves as evangelical or born-again \u2013 wield the greatest influence. Last November, that group \u2013 comprising 28% of the overall electorate according to exit polls \u2013 gave Trump three-fourths of their votes. And their grievances against prevailing national sentiment on issues from gay rights to immigration to racial justice to election integrity echo through GOP stances in Washington and state capitals now. Just three House Republicans joined Democrats last week in voting for the Equality Act, which would bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. \u201cAn attack on God\u2019s creation,\u201d declared Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the first-term Georgian who has become the symbol of House Republican combativeness. Just 11 House Republicans voted to discipline Greene over her public embrace of extremism. A January survey by the conservative American Enterprise Institute showed White evangelical Republicans likelier than the rest of the party to believe in the conspiratorial QAnon fantasy, that a \u201cDeep State\u201d within the government targeted Trump, and the falsehood that Antifa rather than Trump supporters staged the January 6 insurrection. Local party organizations around the country have assailed the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over that insurrection. Rep. Adam Kinzinger\u2019s own relatives labeled him a \u201cdisappointment to God.\u201d Instead of condemning the idea of physical resistance, White evangelical Republicans embrace it, the AEI survey showed. Fully 60% agreed that \u201cthe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d White evangelical Republicans who accept Trump\u2019s election lies also propel the national GOP push to restrict voting procedures. Three-fourths believe Biden did not legitimately win the election, the AEI survey showed; among other Republicans, a 56% majority accept Biden\u2019s victory as legitimate. Even on the pandemic that has claimed more than 500,000 American lives, ravaged the economy and upended normal life, Republican lawmakers reflect the emphatic skepticism of White evangelicals. In an AEI survey last fall, 68% of White evangelical Republicans said the media had exaggerated the number of deaths from the pandemic. In a separate PRRI poll, 68% expressed resignation over the toll of coronavirus, calling it \u201cinevitable\u201d rather than the result of failure to control the outbreak. Biden last week battled GOP resistance to his Covid relief bill and his nomination of Indian-American Neera Tanden as budget director. Soon he will turn to his plans \u2013 already denounced by top Republicans - to provide legal status and eventually citizenship to undocumented immigrants. Meantime, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell fends off questions about intra-party divisions by underscoring a higher priority: what Republicans agree they\u2019re against. \u201cI think what you need to focus on,\u201d McConnell told reporters last week, \u201cis how unified we are today in opposition to what the Biden administration is trying to do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A slew of ambitious Republicans eyeing bids for the party\u2019s 2024 nomination used the two days ahead of former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0appearance at this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference to begin staking their own claims as the eventual leaders of the movement built\u00a0around the former President. Though it will take years for the 2024 race to fully take shape, this year\u2019s CPAC in Orlando, Florida, offered a window into a GOP primary dominated by a new Republican\u00a0Party built around the grievances that animated Trump\u2019s campaigns and his presidency. Speakers embraced Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election being rigged. Organizers built this year\u2019s event in Trump\u2019s adopted home state around the\u00a0theme of liberal \u201ccancel culture\u201d in the wake of Trump being banned from social media platforms. The crowd booed reminders to wear masks, much\u00a0like Trump eschewed his own health experts\u2019 recommendations. Fact checking CPAC: speakers make false claims about the election, the Capitol attack, immigration, Covid, and The Muppets \u201cLet me tell you right now, Donald J. Trump ain\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Friday. And CPAC attendees seemed to agree. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he can say that can make me change my mind about him,\u201d Bob Paxton of Ocala, Florida, told CNN. Red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and pro-Trump paraphernalia have been ubiquitous, and every CPAC attendee who spoke to CNN said they would support Trump if he decides to run in three years. The unofficial, organized efforts to generate buzz for GOP presidential candidates that were a hallmark of CPACs during the Obama years were nowhere to be found this year. The weekend in Orlando demonstrated that Trump is poised to be at the center of Republicans\u2019 2024 nominating contest, whether he decides to run\u00a0again as the clear favorite or instead chooses to play a kingmaker role, setting the terms of the race and determining which candidates are persona\u00a0non grata in a GOP built in his image. The clearest illustration of a conservative base that remains fiercely loyal to Trump came from Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who had objected to certifying Electoral College votes from key swing states, effectively attempting to disenfranchise those states\u2019 voters and overturn the\u00a0results of the 2020 election. He bragged about his efforts at CPAC, claiming he was standing up for \u201celection integrity.\u201d In Washington, Hawley has faced backlash over his efforts on January 6, the day a pro-Trump mob emboldened by the former President\u2019s speech stormed the Capitol. But in Orlando, he was treated as a hero. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m staying right here. I\u2019m gonna stand up for you,\u201d Hawley said, to the loudest cheers of the day Friday. He also pointed to the backlash he\u2019s faced, which included a publisher canceling plans to publish a forthcoming book that has since been\u00a0picked up by another publisher, as an example of liberal cancel culture. \u201cI thought it was an important stand to take, and for that the left has come after\u00a0me. They tried to silence me. They canceled a book,\u201d he said. At this year\u2019s CPAC, Republicans who have broken with Trump \u2013 such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse \u2013 and those on\u00a0ambiguous terms with the former President \u2013 including former Vice President Mike Pence, who rejected Trump\u2019s pressure to try to overturn the election\u00a0results, and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, who has offered tempered criticism \u2013 were not on hand. Also largely ignored: President Joe Biden, who was mentioned roughly as often as toy-maker Hasbro\u2019s decision to drop the \u201cMr.\u201d in front of the name\u00a0of its famous \u201cPotato Head,\u201d favoring the gender-neutral name. None of the major speakers attempted to make a detailed case against Biden\u2019s $1.9\u00a0trillion plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic and stimulate the economy that passed the House early Saturday morning. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced just as much criticism over his handling of the pandemic as Biden faced. \u201cFlorida is like an amazing woman. Adventurous, beautiful, mostly sunny, sometimes a little crazy, and always here to encourage and support\u00a0success,\u201d Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said. \u201cBy contrast, New York is like a bad ex-husband \u2013 mean, won\u2019t let you go out to dinner; you\u2019re less safe,\u00a0financially spiraling downward, and they may kill your grandparents.\u201d The breakout star of CPAC\u2019s first days might have been South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who was among the only speakers to articulate a vision of\u00a0conservatism that \u2013 while consistent with Trump \u2013 sought to more broadly define the party\u2019s principles. \u201cWe must more closely articulate to the American people that we are the only ones who respect them as human beings,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThat we are the\u00a0only ones who believe the American people have God-given rights. We are not here to tell you how to live your life, how to treat you like a child or\u00a0criminal because you go to church or you defend yourself.\u201d Noem decried what she said is an \u201corganized, coordinated campaign to remove and eliminate all references to our nation\u2019s founding and many other\u00a0parts of our history\u201d \u2013 seizing on Trump\u2019s complaints about progressives who have attempted to remove some honors given to slave-owning founding\u00a0fathers and Confederate leaders from the public square. \u201cOur founders had their flaws, certainly. But to use those flaws to condemn their ideals and the greatest Constitution the world has ever seen is both\u00a0unjust and it\u2019s self-defeating,\u201d the Republican governor and former congresswoman said. Noem also touted her state\u2019s lax policies to combat the coronavirus pandemic and took aim at Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s leading infectious\u00a0disease expert, whom she claimed overshot the number of hospitalized people South Dakota would face at the height of the pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you agree with me, but Dr. Fauci is wrong a lot,\u201d Noem said to loud cheers. And a story about her late father\u2019s pickup truck \u2013 and the life lessons she discovered he had left behind in the truck\u2019s cab \u2013 brought tears to the eyes of several attendees. \u201cI was getting teary-eyed,\u201d Kensy Pelo, an attendee from outside Portland, Oregon, told CNN. The first speaker to attack Biden at length was Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump. Jr., well after most 2024 prospects had\u00a0spoken Friday. And while Trump Jr. used his speech to criticize Biden, he also took aim at Trump\u2019s rivals within the Republican Party. He hammered\u00a0Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican who voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 insurrection, in personal terms with a\u00a0reference to Cheney\u2019s father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, shooting a friend in the face in a 2006 hunting accident. \u201cLiz Cheney and her politics are only slightly less popular than her father at a quail hunt,\u201d Trump Jr. said. To the extent policy was discussed, it often focused on Trump\u2019s priorities: Combatting the rise and reach of \u201cbig tech,\u201d enacting hard-line immigration\u00a0policies and talking tough on China. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton vocalized conservatives\u2019 hard line on immigration, baselessly trying to stir up fear about Democrats giving voting rights to undocumented immigrants \u201cin time for what they hope will be Kamala Harris\u2019 reelection campaign.\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose popularity among Republicans has soared amid his rejection of strict measures to combat the pandemic, bragged\u00a0that Florida had not made changes to how it held the 2020 election to make it easier for people concerned about their health to vote. 'They restricted our freedoms': CPAC speakers push back against Covid restrictions \u201cI rejected pressure to make hasty and ill-conceived changes to our election administration like mass mailing of unsolicited ballots. And the result? On\u00a0election night, by midnight, the state of Florida had counted, tabulated and put out 11 million votes,\u201d DeSantis said. Speakers mocked mask-wearing, even as attendees were reminded that the hotel hosting CPAC required them. Cruz said he had two masks in his\u00a0pocket, but lambasted the notion that wearing masks has become a cultural matter pushed by Democrats. \u201cHow much virtue do you want to signal? This is just dumb,\u201d he said. Republicans also reveled in the criticism they\u2019ve faced since January 6 \u2013 connecting with a palpable sense of grievance within the audience that Trump himself has often played to. \u201cIn the last few months we\u2019ve been called clowns, and deplorables, and ignorant rednecks, we\u2019ve been called the evil resistance. The New York Times\u00a0thinks I\u2019m the worst secretary of state of all time,\u201d said Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s secretary of state, referencing commentary from the newspaper\u2019s\u00a0opinion section. In his speech, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections and has been a staunch Trump\u00a0ally, made clear that he\u2019s not willing to wade into primary fights between those in the party who have criticized the former President and his allies. \u201cI\u2019m not going to mediate anything. Instead, I\u2019m going to fight for our conservative values,\u201d he said. Scott, like Hawley, also hammered tech companies, characterizing Twitter\u2019s decision to ban Trump as ominous for all conservatives \u2013 even though\u00a0Trump was banned for tweets that glorified and incited violence, not for expressing political views. \u201cIf they can silence a former President,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat makes you think you\u2019re not next?\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Conservative Political Action Conference began Friday and continued Saturday with a series of false claims about the 2020 election and many other subjects. The CPAC schedule made clear in advance that the conference \u2013 taking place in Orlando instead of its usual home just outside Washington, DC \u2013 would feature election-related lying. Over three days, the CPAC agenda includes seven separate panels or speeches under the title of \u201cprotecting elections\u201d \u2013 plus appearances by other prominent figures, including former President Donald Trump himself, who have falsely insisted that the election was stolen. Friday featured false claims about the election, the Capitol attack, and even The Muppets, while on Saturday, there were several incorrect claims on immigration, energy and voting laws \u2013 some of which echoed claims President Donald Trump had repeated throughout his administration. Here is a fact check of some of the statements CPAC speakers made on Friday and Saturday: Early in the Friday proceedings, CPAC played a video segment that strongly suggested there was mass fraud or widespread malfeasance in the 2020 election. The segment was titled \u201cYOUR VOTES CANCELED.\u201d Among other things, it suggested there was something nefarious about the fact that Joe Biden gained ground late on election night in vote-counting in swing states \u2013 showing one commentator saying this was \u201cstatistically impossible,\u201d another saying it was \u201cvery strange,\u201d and another, the late radio host Rush Limbaugh, saying the \u201cvote fairy\u201d had visited overnight. How a post-election crisis was manufactured in Pennsylvania Facts First: This is nonsense, as CNN and many others have repeatedly explained since November. Biden gained ground in the vote count in some states as legitimate votes were legitimately counted. Biden simply did far better than Trump with people who voted using mail-in ballots, which some states counted later than they counted in-person ballots. (In Pennsylvania, for example, this happened in part because Republican state legislators refused to allow the processing of mail-in votes to begin before Election Day as Democrats proposed.) Biden also did far better than Trump in most big cities, which had more ballots to count than smaller communities. Biden did not gain ground late at night in every competitive state. In Florida, where counties were allowed to start counting mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, Biden jumped out to what ended up being a mirage of a big lead, but Trump overtook him after in-person votes were counted. In Arizona, Trump gained ground as the counting proceeded past Election Day, though he still ended up losing. TW Shannon, a former Republican state legislator in Oklahoma, said that mobs occur \u201cwhen people have a sense of hopelessness.\u201d After claiming that Democratic mayors had failed to offer hope to the people who ended up burning cities in the summer of 2020, Shannon then said, \u201cThe reason that people stormed the Capitol was because they felt hopeless because of a rigged election.\u201d Facts First: The election was not rigged. Joe Biden was the legitimate winner. There is no evidence of widespread fraud or malfeasance. Shannon would have been correct if he had said that many of the people who stormed the Capitol believed the election had been rigged. But that\u2019s not what he said. Conservative commentator Deroy Murdock said: \u201cDemocrats, not Republicans, installed ballot drop boxes on sidewalks, where nobody oversaw them. How many fraudulent ballots got deposited in these boxes unchecked and then got counted? Who knows.\u201d Facts First: Murdock\u2019s suggestion that ballot drop boxes were insecure is false; there is no sign that these drop boxes were used fraudulently in the 2020 election. The boxes were secured in various ways: affixed to the ground, designed with anti-tampering measures, and, in many cases, subjected to 24-hour video surveillance. Also, some states and counties run by Republicans made use of ballot drop boxes. In addition, states and counties employed various security measures to ensure the legitimacy of the ballots that were deposited in the boxes. Even if drop boxes are hypothetically tampered with, ballots themselves still have to pass the usual checks once they arrive at an elections office. Talking about the attack on the Capitol, conservative radio host Wayne Dupree said there were \u201ca lot of people there \u2013 Antifa was there, BLM was there, MAGA people were there, everybody was there. And if Joe Biden wants to talk unity, there was unity there on that day, because America is sick and tired of being pushed down.\u201d Facts First: Dupree was wrong to suggest the attack on the Capitol was conducted by a united hodgepodge of political activists from left-wing and right-wing movements. In reality, the insurrection was overwhelmingly perpetrated by supporters of Donald Trump. We know this from videos taken on the day of the attack, social media postings by participants in the attack, and court documents filed by the FBI afterward. The FBI has said that there is no indication that Antifa members disguised themselves as Trump supporters that day. We can\u2019t speak definitively about the political positions of every single person who was involved in the mob, and the ideology of some alleged participants can be hard to pinpoint. (One of them, who has a unique political history, had previously used the hashtags #antifa and #blm on social media, though he has denied actually being part of the Antifa movement.) But it is abundantly clear that the vast majority were Trump supporters. Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford criticized California for its coronavirus restrictions. \u201cThe people of California are recalling their governor because they\u2019ve had enough of these stringent closures. They\u2019ve had enough of the encroachment upon their rights, and enough of the government telling them that they can enjoy a five-star meal at \u2018French Laundry\u2019 with their governor but they can\u2019t go to church,\u201d Lee said. Lankford later echoed Lee\u2019s insinuation of California\u2019s hypocrisy, stating that California is a place \u201cwhere you can go to swanky restaurants but not to church.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. Currently, California residents can go to places of worship which choose to open, though indoor capacity is limited. The state did initially ban indoor church services in counties considered at widespread risk of coronavirus transmission but after the US Supreme Court ruled partially in favor of the churches on February 5, California had to revise its guidelines. According to the latest guidance, places of worship must limit indoor attendance to 25% of capacity. The state\u2019s Covid-19 website also notes that church capacity can be expanded to 50% of building capacity based on the tier of coronavirus threat the state is experiencing. Singing and chanting is allowed if performers wear masks and maintain distance. Lee and Lankford\u2019s argument for hypocrisy references California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s attendance at an event with a dozen people at Michelin-starred restaurant The French Laundry, for which he was widely criticized. According to photos obtained by Fox 11 in Los Angeles, Newsom and the other guests were sitting on the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio but none of them were wearing a mask despite being in close proximity. Newsom apologized for his behavior and the decision to dine out at the restaurant when he announced new coronavirus restrictions later that month, moving all counties to the strictest tier.  Newsom\u2019s behavior at The French Laundry would have violated the guidance for face coverings included in the new restrictions. Under the new guidelines, diners may only remove their masks if they are \u201cactively eating or drinking\u201d and are at least six feet away from anyone not in their household. Robby Starbuck, who is running for Congress in Tennessee, castigated Biden for comments he claimed Biden made during a CNN town hall earlier this month. \u201cThey did something that I \u2013 I never thought CNN would do, but they asked him about the Uyghurs in China who are being raped, tortured, and children are being kidnapped, forced to praise China as their mother and to praise communism as their savior. They asked Joe Biden about it, and he said it amounted to a mere cultural difference,\u201d Starbuck said. Starbuck added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that more disgusting words have ever left the lips of an American president.\u201d Facts First: Starbuck misleadingly described what Biden said. Biden did refer to cultural differences during this section of the town hall, but he did not dismiss China\u2019s persecution of the Uyghurs as a \u201cmere cultural difference.\u201d In fact, he said moments prior to his remark about cultural differences that it is important for a US president to speak out against China\u2019s treatment of the Uyghurs and other human rights abuses. Here\u2019s what actually happened. When Anderson Cooper asked, \u201cWhat about the Uyghurs? What about the human rights abuses in China?\u201d Biden responded, \u201cWe must speak up for human rights. It\u2019s who we are.\u201d Biden said he pointed out to Chinese President Xi Jinping on their February phone call that \u201cno American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn\u2019t reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I\u2019m not going to speak out against what he\u2019s doing in Hong Kong, what he\u2019s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China \u2026\u201d Biden soon continued, \u201cAnd by the \u2013 he said he \u2013 he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they \u2013 their leaders \u2013 are expected to follow.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments were a bit muddled. In context, though, he seemed to be saying that Xi understands that, given the different cultural norms for each country\u2019s leader, there is a cultural norm for an American president to speak out on human rights issues. And given that Biden had just said that \u201cwe must speak up for human rights\u201d and speak out against \u201cwhat he\u2019s doing with the Uyghurs,\u201d Starbuck\u2019s account of Biden\u2019s response to Cooper left out essential information. Misleading descriptions of Biden\u2019s remark have circulated widely among conservatives on social media. Mocking the left, Donald Trump Jr. said, \u201cThis month alone, they\u2019ve banned The Muppets. And then if there\u2019s things you thought were sort of above cancellation, you would be wrong. There is nothing the radical left won\u2019t cancel.\u201d Facts First: Trump Jr. was wrong; The Muppets have not been banned. In fact, the Disney+ streaming service just this month started to offer \u201cThe Muppet Show,\u201d which originally aired from 1976 to 1981. Trump Jr. might have been referring to the fact that Disney+ added a content disclaimer at the beginning of 18 episodes and is not airing two other episodes \u2013 but neither of these moves can be fairly described as a ban on The Muppets. The content warning says that the episodes include \u201cnegative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures,\u201d and \u201cthese stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported. The notice goes on to say: \u201cRather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversations to create a more inclusive future together.\u201d The Times reported that \u201ceach episode bears the 12-second disclaimer for a different reason, from (Johnny) Cash\u2019s appearance singing in front of a Confederate flag to negative depictions of Native Americans, Middle Easterners and people from other cultures.\u201d The Times reported that two episodes from the final season of the show were left off Disney+ altogether, while Entertainment Weekly noted that assorted other songs and sketches were omitted. It is not clear that any of these omissions were related to culturally sensitive content; Entertainment Weekly noted that one of the two episodes starred someone who was later convicted of possessing child pornography, while other omissions might have been related to challenges securing music rights. During a panel on protecting elections, Republican attorney Jesse Binnall, who tried to overturn the election results in Nevada on behalf of the Trump campaign, claimed, \u201cThe rest of the world almost exclusively does voting in person because of the opportunities for fraud in mail-in voting.\u201d Facts First: Binnall is wrong about the voting habits of other countries. Approximately 1/4 of countries use mail-in voting, according to the Pew Research Center. A survey of experts by the Electoral Integrity Project, run by researchers at Harvard University and Sydney University, found that of the 166 countries for which data was available, 40 used postal ballots even before the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Electoral Integrity Project analysis, postal ballots were most widely used in North America and Europe. Around 1/3 of European countries have some form of mail-in voting, based on an October 2020 report issued by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental organization aimed at advancing democracy worldwide. CNN has also repeatedly fact-checked previous false claims about mail-in voting and fraud. In the United States, evidence of mail ballot fraud is exceedingly rare. While there are some vulnerabilities, states have systems and processes in place to prevent forgery, theft and voter fraud. On Saturday, in arguing that border walls work, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton repeated the claim \u2013 previously touted by Trump \u2013 that the crime rate in El Paso shrank because of a border wall. \u201cWe have a border wall, partly along where El Paso is,\u201d Paxton claimed, \u201cbefore that occurred, El Paso was one of the highest crime cities in America. When they put that up it actually made them one of the more safe cities. So we know they work.\u201d Facts First: The violent crime rate in El Paso began to fall years before the border wall in the area was built. CNN looked into this claim when Trump made it in his 2019 State of the Union address. Here\u2019s what we found: According to an analysis of FBI crimes data and city law enforcement data analyzed by the El Paso Times, violent crime in El Paso peaked in 1993. Border fence construction didn\u2019t begin until 2008, and was completed in 2009. Violent crime in El Paso fell 34% between 1993 and 2006. And according to the El Paso Times, from 2006 to 2011, violent crime in El Paso actually increased by 17 percent. Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar said that 99 percent of undocumented immigrants don\u2019t attend court proceedings after they are released from US custody. \u201c(T)hey\u2019re releasing 50 undocumented aliens into the streets and hoping they\u2019ll come back for their court appearances,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cbut over 99% of them do not do that.\u201d This, again, is something Trump has claimed before, more recently in the presidential debate with Joe Biden in October. CNN fact checked the claim then as well. Facts First: This is false. Most immigrants do attend their scheduled hearings in immigration court. According to the latest statistics from the Justice Department, 25% of immigration cases were decided in absentia in fiscal year 2018 \u2014 meaning immigrants showed up for 75% of the cases decided that year. California Rep. Devin Nunes told CPAC attendees on Saturday that his home state registers people to vote at the DMV even if they don\u2019t want to be registered. \u201cWhen you go into the Department of Motor Vehicles, you\u2019re gonna register to vote. Even if you don\u2019t want to register to vote, they register you to vote,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cAnd the first little game they played is if you walked in and said \u2018no I don\u2019t want to be registered to vote,\u2019 then they\u2019d say \u2018okay\u2019 and they\u2019d not only register you to vote, but they\u2019d made you a permanent absentee so then the ballot was being mailed directly to your home.\u201d Facts First: This is false. California citizens are automatically registered to vote when filling out certain forms at the DMV, but are allowed to opt out if they so choose. According to the California Secretary of State\u2019s website, \u201celigible applicants completing a driver license, identification (ID) card or change of address transaction online, by mail or in person at the DMV will be automatically registered to vote by the California Secretary of State, unless they choose to opt out of automatic voter registration.\u201d According to Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, \u201cthose claims are false\u201d and represent \u201creally an anti-voter attitude to make things as hard as possible for people to vote.\u201d During a panel on energy policy, moderator Tudor Dixon said that wind and solar are not reliable sources of energy, citing the Texas energy crisis earlier this month. \u201cAnd wind and solar, as great as they may be, they are not reliable,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cYou need that constant reliable source of coal and natural gas that has to be there. But that\u2019s not there if you have wind and solar, which is what we saw in Texas.\u201d Facts First: This is incorrect. While all sources of power failed to some extent in Texas, the bulk of outages were due to fossil fuel sources going offline, in large part due to the lack of winterization in the state\u2019s energy infrastructure. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the state\u2019s power grid, most of the power outages were due to losses in coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. Though frozen wind turbines were a contributing factor, wind shutdowns accounted for less than 13% of the outages in Texas, Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations for ERCOT, told Bloomberg. Wind accounted for 18% of the electricity generated in Texas in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Wind turbines can be equipped with different devices that heat and de-ice parts of the turbine along with other measures like water-resistant coatings to help keep them operational in severe cold. Some wind turbines can function in -22 degrees Fahrenheit. Texas was warned that cold weather snaps could significantly affect the state\u2019s energy infrastructure and recommendations were made by the federal government to install preventative measures to protect Texas\u2019s energy infrastructure from future extreme winter storms.

Mark Walker \u2013 who is a candidate to fill the state\u2019s US Senate seat after Sen. Richard Burr retires in 2023 \u2013 said that Democrats have recently started supporting criminal justice reform. \u201cThe left, they\u2019re finally getting on board with criminal justice reform,\u201d Walker said. Again, Trump has made similar claims, touting the First Step Act bill he signed into law while claiming that President Barack Obama never attempted such reform. Facts First: Walker\u2019s assertion is incorrect. President Barack Obama tried to get criminal justice reform passed during his second term in office, but a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate during the 2016 presidential election, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided not to bring it up for a vote. The Obama administration took reform steps that did not require Republican approval, such as banning the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons, working with state and local governments to reduce pre-trial incarceration and the incarceration of people with mental illnesses, and instructing federal prosecutors to try to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders. Trump signed a large criminal justice reform bill \u2013 the First Step Act \u2013 in December 2018. The bill was a bipartisan effort, passing in the Senate 87-12 and the House 358-36. Regardless of this success, it is incorrect to suggest that Democrats are only now warming up to the ideas of criminal justice reform. CNN\u2019s Samara Lipman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On the cusp of passing President Joe Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief bill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could move the legislation without a single Democratic defection. It\u2019s a sign of Democrats\u2019 willingness to back the President on his first big legislative push and a reflection of Pelosi\u2019s firm hold on the caucus that may prove her most challenging yet. In her fourth term as speaker, Pelosi is managing the slimmest majority in her tenure, a challenge even for a seasoned leader who shepherded her caucus through four tumultuous years of former President Donald Trump. Once at odds with a President who called her \u201ca third rate politician,\u201d repeated conspiracy theories about a deadly pandemic and was impeached \u2013 not once, but twice \u2013 by the House of Representatives, Pelosi\u2019s job then was to draw out the differences between Democrats and Republicans. Now, her work consists of ensuring her caucus stays united for a Democratic President. \u201cThe speaker is the captain of the ship in uncharted waters right now. This is a very, very difficult position to be in,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jason Crow told CNN. \u201cShe\u2019s done a very nice job navigating things.\u201d Behind the scenes, some rank-and-file members say Pelosi has led the Congress in the opening weeks with an \u201ciron fist\u201d \u2013 a symptom of the fact she has little room for error in her own caucus with just a five-vote margin and is leading in an unprecedented moment as the House grapples with an attack on the Capitol that roiled her chamber on January 6. \u201cShe is going to run this train as quickly as she can run it,\u201d one Democratic member told CNN on the condition of background to freely discuss their leadership\u2019s moves. \u201cUntil she runs into a problem, she is going to get away with it.\u201d To that point, Pelosi held firm Thursday night that the minimum wage provision would be in the version of the bill the House takes up on Friday even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the proposal would not be in the Senate\u2019s version of the Covid relief bill. But even as Democrats privately express concerns about specific provisions in the coronavirus relief bill or the speed at which it has moved through the House of Representatives with just Democratic support, most contend they will ultimately vote for it. Where the stimulus bill stands in Congress, and what comes next \u201cThe speaker knows at the end of the day that those votes will be there with what Biden puts forward, and so that\u2019s the sense she has,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to be fair and thoughtful about giving everyone participation, but knowing ultimately that a Democrat is very unlikely to vote against the first major initiative of the President of the United States.\u201d Khanna, who is a member of the Progressive Caucus and former chairman to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, praised Pelosi for taking input from the Progressive Caucus when building the Covid relief package and listening when he and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat and chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, made an argument to Pelosi and her staff about including the $15 minimum wage. \u201cAs a progressive, I feel my voice is being heard, our caucus\u2019 voice is being heard,\u201d Khanna told CNN. \u201cShe\u2019s been open to persuasion.\u201d Still, the legislation has drawn criticism \u2013 for both the speed of the process by which it has been assembled and what is included in it. Another Democratic lawmaker questioned the scope of the massive Covid relief package and whether it addressed the urgency of relief needed. \u201cI have sort of real questions on kind of what we\u2019re trying to achieve just in like the first three or six months,\u201d that Democratic lawmaker told CNN. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not here to just pass a bunch of messaging bills that are going to die in the Senate because we can\u2019t get 60 votes. So that\u2019s what I expect of any leadership of any organization and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to push with my own leadership.\u201d Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon, lamented the speed and lack of GOP support during a markup on the relief bill. \u201cWe\u2019re in this very non-unified, partisan process that\u2019s going to take time to get through the House and the Senate. You know, it\u2019s the exact opposite of what I heard the President articulate at the inauguration,\u201d Schrader said. Criticizing the other pieces of funding Democrats are seeking to get through in this massive package, Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York told CNN Friday that it is \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill includes $1.5 million to fund a New York-Canada bridge and $100 million of funding to the Bay Area Rapid Transit railway in California. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable,\u201d Espaillat said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom.\u201d But he did say the package as it stands will get the country \u201cback on the right track.\u201d Pelosi Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill pushed back on the notion that the bill has been passed too quickly. \u201cI think the reason why members feel very unified around this bill is because this process has been going on literally since last March. And we\u2019ve spent so much time on it,\u201d Hammill told CNN. \u201cWe did not just write this bill behind closed doors and release it. Nine committees put it together, plus three more that had smaller pieces and didn\u2019t hold markups.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s leadership in the last several weeks has been far more than just legislator, speaker or vote counter on a relief bill, however. Members have largely praised how Pelosi has navigated the caucus in the immediate aftermath of the violent insurrection that many experienced first-hand and are still reeling from. They supported her decision to move quickly to impeach Trump. They are grateful she made counseling available to members and sponsored a briefing on security for members\u2019 spouses. \u201cShe has said many times she is like a lioness that if you mess with her cubs, you\u2019re dead. And, you know, she feels that it\u2019s her responsibility to make things right, especially for institutional staff,\u201d Hammill told CNN, who also shared that some Capitol custodial staff refer to the speaker as \u201cmama.\u201d Why House Republicans going through magnetometers has zero to do with the Constitution Crow, the Colorado Democrat, characterized the speaker\u2019s decision to insert the metal detectors outside the House floor as \u201cdecisive\u201d and as a way to make those concerned about looming security threats feel like the Capitol was a safe place again. Pelosi also slapped hefty fines on members who blew past the metal detectors, outraging Republicans and even attracting some ire in her own party with one Democrat telling CNN they viewed Pelosi\u2019s decision as \u201cperformative.\u201d Still, Democrats say they are proud of how their speaker supported the caucus after the attack. \u201cShe\u2019s been inspiring in how she\u2019s handled January 6th,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI have never seen the speaker with more emotion. I think she was visibly shaken up by what happened that day, visibly fearful for her staff, profoundly emotional about what that attack meant for our democracy and our country. I mean, here\u2019s someone who has spent almost 40 years in the institutions of Congress. She believes there is a sacredness to the Capitol.\u201d Not only must the speaker navigate keeping her own caucus together, she must also figure out how to forge bipartisanship at a time when investigations into the security and intelligence failures that led to January 6 have just barely scratched the surface. Members have accused their colleagues of giving reconnaissance tours in the days leading up to the riot, and the speaker herself has expressed concern that the \u201cthe enemy is within the House of Representatives,\u201d as she said in January. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, it seems like we\u2019re always the ones talking about bipartisanship, you know as a Democratic caucus and it\u2019s a very important thing but, you know, I\u2019d like to see some bipartisanship from my GOP colleagues,\u201d Crow told CNN. \u201cHow about they be bipartisan and stop trying to bring firearms onto the House floor, so that their colleagues can feel comfortable and safe,\u201d Crow said, referring to Rep. Andy Harris setting off a metal detector outside the House floor last month for trying to carry a concealed gun on his side. Members who work closely with Pelosi attest the speaker is strategic and understanding about the political dynamics of her members\u2019 districts. But the months ahead will reveal deeper schisms among Democrats as they debate immigration and infrastructure than were previously seen when it was the party united against Trump. The speaker is managing a caucus that at one end includes outspoken progressives like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar of Minnesota fighting for the Green New Deal. At the other end of the political spectrum is a collection of moderate members who defeated Republicans by single digits and for whom slogans like \u201cdefund the police\u201d could cost their seats. The Biden administration is relying on a Trump-era policy to turn away migrants at border \u201cWhen we laugh together, we cry together, we\u2019re inspired together, we find our common ground more easily,\u201d Pelosi told reporters the day after Biden was inaugurated, making a clear call for unity and marking the start of a new chapter. In the months after the November election, in which House Democrats lost more seats than anticipated, the caucus held a collection of grievance-airing conference calls. The chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced she wouldn\u2019t run for reelection and moderates pleaded with their colleagues to focus more on what could pass and less on messaging bills. Pelosi held on comfortably to her gavel with just a handful of defections. Still, members say they want to make sure leadership stays engaged with the moderate wing of her party. \u201cBecause some of the Covid precautions are going to continue and because we are relatively far away from a place we can gather and debate in person and discuss policies and priorities that we now have to be adaptive, and we need leadership to more fully bring in the voices and opinions of the rest of the caucus,\u201d one Democratic member said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated how much money was allocated in the Covid relief package for a New York-Canada bridge. It is $1.5 million.",

            "article_content": "A close ally of Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene took part in the January 6 mob at the Capitol and said he was among those who eventually made their way into the building. Greene, a freshman congresswoman with a history of promoting dangerous and violent conspiracies and comments, encouraged the big lie that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump by voting to object to the election certification and fanned the flames of the insurrection by telling her supporters to \u201cfight for Trump.\u201d In tweets after the Capitol insurrection, Greene falsely suggested that those who had broken into the Capitol were not Republicans and instead falsely implied so-called \u201cAntifa\u201d dressed as Trump supporters were to blame. In fact, Anthony Aguero, a conservative livestreamer, activist and associate of Greene, said on video following the January 6 assault on the Capitol that he had been among those who entered and attacked those who falsely claimed it was done by \u201cAntifa.\u201d \u201cWe were all there. It was not Antifa and it was not BLM. It was Trump supporters that did that yesterday. I\u2019m the first to admit it, being one myself,\u201d said Aguero in a video posted on January 7. \u201cI walked amongst all those people,\u201d he added, later defending entering the Capitol. Greene and Aguero have worked closely together over the years on causes such as immigration and the border wall and have attended pro-Trump rallies together. In many since-deleted videos saved by CNN\u2019s KFile, Greene repeatedly calls Aguero \u201camazing\u201d and a \u201cfriend.\u201d On social media, Aguero has called Greene \u201cone of my closest friends.\u201d \u201cA message was sent,\u201d Aguero said in the video streamed live on January 6 while walking away from the Capitol on Pennsylvania Avenue following the riot. \u201cThese politicians are not going to continue to get away with the abuse as they\u2019ve been doing. We will continue to press on these individuals.\u201d \u201cThe National Guard has just been called in,\u201d he continued. \u201cA woman was shot in the face earlier. There was blood all over the floor. I recorded it for y\u2019all. I could not go live during the whole event because the signal was either jammed purposely or there was just too many, too many people out there. Guys, I was able to make it inside the chambers and I have footage that I\u2019m going to provide for you guys as we made our way in there.\u201d Congress held its first hearing on the Capitol riots on Tuesday, in which law enforcement officials testified the attacks were likely coordinated. In a video posted by Aguero on January 6 on Instagram, he can be heard cheering on, from a distance, those trying to enter the Capitol, chanting \u201cheave ho\u201d as a mob of rioters push against Capitol Police. In a comment, Aguero wrote \u201cMAGA\u201d under the video. In another video, posted from the steps of the Capitol, he can be heard chanting \u201cour house.\u201d He later described those who broke in as \u201cpatriots,\u201d and commented \u201c#PatriotsSaveAmerica2021! Not Antifa/BLM!!!\u201d immediately following the ransacking of the Capitol by rioters. Aguero posted one video on January 10 of someone entering the Capitol, though it is unclear if Aguero himself took the footage. When reached for comment, Aguero told CNN that the \u201cvideos uploaded compiled [sic] are not mine. They\u2019re screen recorded from other posts that I saw.\u201d Aguero did not respond to further questions asking to specify which videos were screen recorded. He appears on camera in two videos and can be heard speaking in others. Before publication, it appears Aguero deleted the video from January 6 in which he appears on camera and says he \u201cwas able to make it inside the chambers.\u201d He did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions on this. Aguero confirmed to CNN he was at the Capitol on January 6 and said he was an \u201cindependent journalist\u201d there reporting the events. He also reiterated his support for Greene. \u201cI fully support Marjorie Taylor Greene. We need more great people like her. God bless her and her family,\u201d said Aguero. Greene responded to CNN\u2019s reporting during an appearance on Newsmax Thursday night in which she acknowledged that she\u2019s known Aguero for years through their activism work but said she hasn\u2019t spoken to him \u201cmuch lately at all.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was in the Capitol. I knew nothing about it until CNN started reporting it. I guess I saw it earlier today and that\u2019s the first I heard of it. I haven\u2019t talked to Anthony much lately at all. I\u2019ve been busy being a member of Congress,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t see or talk with Aguero much because he lives in Texas. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken with him. I hope he wasn\u2019t involved. No one should have broken in the Capitol on January 6th. They committed a crime by doing so, and I was a victim of that crime. I was in the chamber. I was being attacked as well,\u201d said Greene. The FBI said last month that it had received nearly 200,000 digital tips from the public related to the Capitol riot, mainly from people who documented it. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating Aguero. \u201cWe have no comment, keeping with our standard practice of neither confirming nor denying the existence of an investigation,\u201d said the FBI\u2019s national press office in an email. In the video he posted on January 7, Aguero claimed he had been among those who entered the Capitol and attacked those who falsely claimed it was done by \u201cAntifa.\u201d \u201cPeople that were saying, \u2018We need to stand up for our rights,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cWe need to stand up for our country. So patriots stand up for their country and they come out here to physically try to take back their house. The House of the people.\u201d \u201cNow you have people on the right acting like they\u2019re holier than thou, holier than holy,\u201d he continued. \u201d \u2018Oh, I\u2019m appalled. I don\u2019t condone this.\u2019 What the hell do you expect conservatives to do? Do you want us to continue to sit there? Complacent, continue to take the higher route and keep getting f**ked in the a**. I\u2019m sorry for using that language, but I\u2019m sick and tired of the hypocrisy.\u201d Later in the video, Aguero praised Greene for her actions contesting the election. \u201cI stand with people like Marjorie Taylor Greene proudly,\u201d he added. \u201cThat woman has more courage than most of the men that were in that building. No, not most. That woman has more courage than every single man that was in that Capitol yesterday.\u201d Aguero and Greene have worked closely together over the years, particularly before her run for Congress. The pair spoke at a small pro-border wall rally in Washington in February 2019, visited lawmakers\u2019 offices together, made a trip along the border together and sat together in the special backstage section of a Trump rally in February 2019. Aguero frequently spoke of working with and supporting Greene throughout 2019. The El Paso-based videographer, who sometimes goes by the moniker \u201cConservative Anthony\u201d online, frequently documents the activities of right-wing activists and militias, including the Guardian Patriots, the border militia group formerly known as the United Constitutional Patriots, and the Proud Boys. Aguero also has a history of criminal violence, according to online court records. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor family violence assault causing serious bodily injury. In 2015, he was convicted of felony vehicular assault while intoxicated and sentenced to two years in Texas state prison. When Greene was temporarily banned from her personal Facebook page in May 2019, she used Aguero\u2019s page to livestream. He has spent much of January and February expressing support for Greene on social media. She was recently photographed with Aguero in Washington at the \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d rally, also known as the Million MAGA March, on November 14, 2020, where Greene spoke. Following Greene\u2019s speech, Aguero can be seen accompanying her off the stage in a video of the rally. A November tweet of the pair at the rally was liked by Greene. Aguero was also with Greene in February 2019 when she delivered a petition to impeach House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for treason and suggested the speaker could be executed or imprisoned. Aguero frequently posted on social media ahead of the January 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riot. In archived posts from the conservative social media website Parler, Aguero shared posts from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. This story has been updated with Greene\u2019s response to CNN\u2019s reporting in an interview Thursday.",

            "article_content": "The change in immigration policy that could most affect the US\u2019 long-term economic growth is at risk of falling out of the debate as the congressional maneuvering over the volatile issue intensifies. With Republicans, under the shadow of former President Donald Trump, still mostly opposing all forms of immigration, and many Democrats narrowing their focus toward legalizing as many undocumented immigrants as possible, revisions to the nation\u2019s system of legal immigration may lack a plausible pathway to congressional passage, many participants in the legislative discussions say. Yet immigration experts and economists across the ideological spectrum agree that increasing the future flow of legal immigrants will be essential to driving economic growth and maintaining a sustainable balance between the number of working-age people paying taxes and retired Americans drawing benefits through Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements for the elderly. That pressure is especially acute because the latest census data suggest the nation\u2019s population may have grown more slowly from 2010 to 2020 than over any other 10-year span in American history \u2013 an ominous dynamic that\u2019s received little attention from either party. \u201cWithout immigration it becomes increasingly impossible to sustain entitlements, much less a functioning health care system, or a local tax base in rural and suburban cities and communities across the country,\u201d says Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum, a centrist immigration advocacy group. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum, echoes his warning. Given the slowdown in the growth of the working-age population, he says, \u201cin the absence of immigration the US becomes Japan: We become smaller in size, older, less economically potent and less capable of projecting our values on our global stage.\u201d After Trump sought to slash legal immigration through legislative and administrative action, the legislative proposals introduced last week by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats would boost the number of new arrivals to a much greater extent than initial reactions to the bills recognized, according to a new analysis shared exclusively with CNN by Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a public policy group that studies immigration. Legal immigration is really the orphan child in all of this. David Bier, immigration policy analyst, Cato Institute \u201cThe bill would end up significantly increasing the legal immigration level and that should have a significant benefit demographically,\u201d Anderson told me. But those proposals could quickly fall out of the immigration debate if Democrats conclude that they have no chance of winning enough Republican support to pass a comprehensive bill \u2013 and instead narrow their efforts to legalizing big chunks of the undocumented population, such as young undocumented people brought to the US by their parents, through the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process, which requires only a majority vote in the Senate. \u201cLegal immigration is really the orphan child in all of this,\u201d says David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. That\u2019s likely to change only if enough Senate Republicans are willing to support comprehensive legislation that addresses both the undocumented and legal immigration. And that remains a long shot, as the GOP\u2019s electoral coalition in the Trump era has grown even more dependent on the voters most uneasy about immigration in particular and the nation\u2019s growing racial and religious diversity in general. All of this year\u2019s legislative calculations about immigration, as I wrote recently, are shaped by the failures of 2006 and 2013. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried to pass comprehensive immigration bills that balanced legalization for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants \u2013 a Democratic priority \u2013 with tougher border enforcement \u2013 the top Republican goal \u2013 and changes in the legal immigration system \u2013 mostly a concern of the business community and a source of ambivalence, if not hostility, from organized labor. Both in 2006 and 2013, the Senate passed omnibus bills with bipartisan majorities (though with support from notably fewer Republicans the second time.) But each time the legislation died when the Republicans who controlled the House majority at the time refused to consider the bills. That legacy of failure largely explains why there\u2019s little enthusiasm among Democrats today for the extended bipartisan negotiations that characterized the 2006 and 2013 efforts. Immigrant advocacy groups aren\u2019t resisting efforts by Biden and Senate Democrats to seek possible areas of consensus with Republicans, but almost universally they consider them doomed to fail. At most, some advocates think it\u2019s possible that 10 Senate Republicans \u2013 the number needed to break a GOP filibuster if every Democrat holds together \u2013 might support a pathway to citizenship for the young undocumented people brought to the US by their parents or conceivably even longtime agriculture workers. But very few believe that 10 GOP senators will support legal status for any significant remainder of the undocumented, whatever concessions Democrats offer on other issues, like tougher border security. That\u2019s a key difference from the earlier negotiations, when Democrats operated on the assumption that if they provided sufficient reassurances on security, enough Republicans would embrace legalization. \u201cWe are working hard to get 10 Senate Republicans just to see if it\u2019s viable,\u201d said one leading immigration overhaul advocate, who asked to remain anonymous while discussing internal strategy. But, the advocate added, given \u201cthat Trump continues to drive the calculus about their next election,\u201d there\u2019s little expectation that 10 Republicans votes are ultimately available. As a result, the principal energy among immigrant advocates is toward convincing congressional Democrats to legalize as many of the undocumented as they can through the reconciliation process, which requires only a majority vote in the Senate. Their focus isn\u2019t the reconciliation bill now moving on Biden\u2019s Covid relief package, but rather another reconciliation bill that they expect him to unveil in a few weeks, encompassing his broader economic agenda. The advocates hope to include in that bill legalization for the young undocumented, farmworkers, immigrants who are in the US on so-called Temporary Protected Status (from countries experiencing natural disasters or political instability) and, beyond that, up to millions of additional undocumented people working in occupations that have been deemed \u201cessential\u201d during the pandemic. Together, those categories, which overlap somewhat, might cover as many as 7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented workers. \u201cThe feeling is it ends up in reconciliation. That\u2019s what we are driving toward,\u201d the advocate added. Legalizing the undocumented, who in many cases are longtime residents or have US citizen children, has always been the top priority and moral center of the immigration debate for Democrats. But because the undocumented, by definition, are already living in the US and the vast majority are already participating in the workforce, they would not address the population squeeze that\u2019s tightening on American society. The slowdown in population growth is one of the most significant changes in the political landscape since Congress last seriously tried to overhaul the immigration laws. In a recent paper, William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program, noted that from 2019 to 2020 the nation\u2019s population grew more slowly than in any year since 1900. That was obviously influenced by the pandemic, but more troublingly, Frey reported that with deaths rising, births declining and immigration contracting during the Trump years, the nation\u2019s population growth rate from 2010 through 2020 \u201ccould be the lowest in any decade since the first census was conducted in 1790.\u201d The details of this slowdown are even more discouraging. While the working-age population is stagnating, the senior population is exploding. Even under current levels of immigration, the Census Bureau projects that the senior population will grow by nearly 40% from now through 2035, almost exactly 10 times as fast as the working-age population. \u201cSooner or later people are going to look at this chart and say, \u2018We are going to need more people in our labor force. We are going to need more customers,\u2019 \u201d Frey told me. In a recent paper, Noorani and co-author Danilo Zak calculated that these trends will produce a precipitous decline in what\u2019s called the \u201cdependency ratio,\u201d the number of working-age adults \u2013 defined as those aged 18-64 \u2013 available to support each senior. Today there are about 3.5 working-age adults for each senior; by 2060, that number will plummet to 2.7, the lowest in modern times. Such a decline will increase pressure either for cuts in federal retirement programs, difficult tax increases on the working-age population to fund those programs or some combination of both. Despite this looming demographic squeeze, Trump and congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to slash the levels of legal immigration. In 2018 four-fifths of House Republicans and nearly three-fourths of Senate Republicans voted to cut legal immigration by more than 40%. While that bill failed, Trump instituted a dizzying array of administrative actions to reduce legal immigration. And while those changes lowered the level of legal immigration only relatively modestly from its high point in 2016 (when it reached about 1.2 million), Anderson says Trump\u2019s policies would likely have imposed much more severe reductions through a second term, perhaps cutting immigration levels to around only 600,000 annually. Trump\u2019s persistent attempts to restrict legal immigration belied his frequent insistence that he wanted people to come to the US but only if they followed the law. His effort reflected the cultural hostility to immigration of all sorts that now characterizes most of the GOP electorate. In a recent national survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, almost three-fifths of Republicans agreed with the openly xenophobic statement that \u201cimmigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background\u201d; among Republicans who relied heavily on Fox News for information, agreement soared to two-thirds. We need to be talking about the future of immigration with the bottom-line self-interest of Americans who want to retire in mind. Ali Noorani, president, National Immigration Forum In another recent survey of Trump voters by the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, almost two-thirds said they wanted to reduce the number of immigrants admitted to the US and nearly as many said they wanted to deport all of the undocumented \u2013 while most Americans in polls consistently say they would provide the undocumented a path to citizenship. Those attitudes expose the great irony of the immigration debate. The nation\u2019s growing diversity is centered among the young: Frey says the 2020 census will find that for the first time, a majority of the nation\u2019s under-18 population is non-White. But because the US largely cut off immigration from 1924 to 1965, most older Americans are White. I\u2019ve described this demographic contrast as a collision between \u201cthe brown and the gray,\u201d and one of its many implications is that through the 21st century, a growing and preponderantly White senior population will depend on an increasingly non-White working-age population to pay the taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare. The older Whites in Trump\u2019s coalition enthusiastically backing Republican politicians who promise to cut immigration are voting to endanger the entitlements on which they rely by slashing the number of working-age taxpayers available to support them. In a paper published earlier this month, Noorani and Zak argued for reorienting legal immigration policy around that dynamic. They argue the US should set legal immigration levels with the goal of maintaining the dependency ratio at about its current level of 3.5 working-age adults for each retiree. As the senior population grows over the coming decades, that would require roughly a 37% increase in legal immigration \u2013 about 370,000 more people a year than the roughly 1 million to 1.2 million annually the US has been admitting. \u201cWe need to be talking about the future of immigration with the bottom-line self-interest of Americans who want to retire in mind,\u201d Noorani says. Neither the White House nor congressional Democrats have yet produced an estimate of how many more people their plans would admit, and each seems reluctant to do so. But in the detailed analysis shared with CNN, Anderson calculates that if fully implemented, the Democratic proposal would essentially meet Noorani\u2019s target. Anderson projects that the bill would increase the flow of legal immigrants to about 1.5 million annually. At points over the coming decade, he says, the increase would be even greater, because the bill also would clear out the huge backlogs that now have nearly 3.8 million eligible immigrants waiting for family reunification visas. Under the legislation, he calculates, America\u2019s working-age population would grow by nearly one-fourth more each year than it would under current policy. The bill does not fundamentally restructure the legal immigration system, which now admits migrants primarily through two principal streams: family reunification and employment. But it adjusts the rules in seemingly technical ways across multiple entry points in that system, systematically widening the spigot. For instance, the legislation seems to make only a minor change in the employment-based system, increasing the number of visas from the current 140,000 annually to 170,000. But in fact, Anderson notes, the bill could more than double the number of employment-based entrants (a top priority for business groups). The reason: While the spouses and minor children of employment-based immigrants are now counted against that 140,000 annual cap, they would be exempted from the new (higher) limit. That would allow all of the slots to be used for employment-based applicants \u2013 and would have a further multiplying effect by creating eligibility for the immediate family members of that larger group. Other key changes include allowing all foreign students who earn Ph.D.s in the US to receive green cards, a pilot program allowing cities or counties facing population loss to sponsor immigrants who will relocate there and slightly increasing the number of visas available to countries whose small immigration flows make them eligible for the \u201cdiversity lottery\u201d (while again multiplying the impact by exempting spouses and minor children from the count). It is hard to have this discussion now that we\u2019ve had a terrible economic tragedy, a terrible public health tragedy. But when you do immigration reform it should be what do you want to the rules of the road to be for the next 20 years. You don\u2019t want to do this every year. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president, American Action Forum Another big change: providing visas to any eligible immigrant who has been waiting 10 years or more because of annual caps and country limits that restrict entry for certain family members, such as adult children or siblings, of US citizens. (Typically, Democrats have supported clearing such backlogs before legalizing the undocumented to preempt the criticism that legalization penalizes immigrants who have been legally waiting in line.) While employment- and family-based immigration have been pitted against each other in the previous legislative debates, Noorani says that\u2019s a false choice: Whichever door migrants come through, he notes, the vast majority will eventually join the workforce, which is exactly what the US needs in the coming years. \u201cYou can make a case that anybody who is working age is a net contributor to the system,\u201d he says. The question is whether any of this has a path toward becoming law. One obstacle is the partisan conundrum noted above: Legal immigration revisions are likely to make the cut only if there\u2019s a comprehensive bill, rather than a package that\u2019s stripped down to try to squeeze it into reconciliation. But there will be a comprehensive package only if 10 Senate Republicans are willing to vote for one, and given Trump\u2019s continuing influence that seems dubious \u2013 despite strong business community support for such a deal. Timing is a problem too. With millions of Americans still unemployed as a result of the pandemic, this isn\u2019t the ideal time to talk about the need to add more people to the workforce. Yet experts say America must shape these policies with an eye not on the next few months but on the next few decades. \u201cIt is hard to have this discussion now that we\u2019ve had a terrible economic tragedy, a terrible public health tragedy,\u201d says Holtz-Eakin. \u201cBut when you do immigration reform it should be what do you want to the rules of the road to be for the next 20 years. You don\u2019t want to do this every year.\u201d Yet even amid the pandemic, awareness of the population squeeze \u2013 and its implications for the economy \u2013 may be growing. Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer of the US Chamber of Commerce, says, \u201cWe are beginning to hear it in the states and almost on a local basis.\u201d While concerns about population loss have been greatest in rural areas, increasingly \u201cyou hear people talking about it in Rust Belt cities,\u201d he notes. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do immigration reform it\u2019s critical that we think through what provisions work best for supporting the economy, and increasing legal immigration is one of the best things you can do to support future economic growth.\u201d If we\u2019re going to do immigration reform it\u2019s critical that we think through what provisions work best for supporting the economy, and increasing legal immigration is one of the best things you can do to support future economic growth. Neil Bradley, executive vice president, US Chamber of Commerce The most optimistic scenario is that even if legal immigration loses out in this year\u2019s legislative maneuvering, success in legalizing some portion of the undocumented population through the special reconciliation process will generate momentum for more action later. Jorge Loweree, policy director at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group, notes that every attempt to deal with any aspect of the immigration system has ultimately foundered on the emotional issue of addressing the undocumented. If that\u2019s removed from the equation, he says, \u201cthere is the prospect \u2026 it opens the door to potentially a bipartisan consensus on moving something on legal immigration down the road, with a new coalition. \u2026 We can\u2019t quite get to that point, because we are stuck on this threshold question of legalization for the undocumented.\u201d The immigration debate has rarely rewarded optimism in the past few decades. But there\u2019s mounting demographic evidence the US will pay a heavy economic price in the next few decades if it can\u2019t break the immigration stalemate to alleviate its population squeeze. \u201cWithout legal immigration, the United States is not going to see sustained population growth and we\u2019ll see declining economic growth as a consequence,\u201d says Cato\u2019s Bier. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump took a drubbing at the Supreme Court on Monday, as the justices in a flurry of orders dealt critical blows to his efforts to shield his tax records from a New York prosecutor and his oft-repeated false claims that there was widespread voter fraud during the last election. It\u2019s as if the justices, in one day, sought to wipe their hands of lingering issues that had been heralded by the former President in a cascade of tweets, legal filings and statements during the last months of his administration. The focus on Monday was not Trump administration policies, but instead disputes deeply personal to Trump himself: election 2020, his tax records and even allegations made by adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump lost badly in the election and tax returns cases, and the Supreme Court made clear it wanted nothing to do with the case brought by the adult-film actress. What the Supreme Court ruling means for Manhattan DA's Trump criminal investigation The court\u2019s action comes now that the election has brought the Trump era \u2013 which was punctuated from the start by attacks on the judiciary as well as legal disputes that ricocheted throughout the courts \u2013 to a close. The past several years featured the then-president feuding with Chief Justice John Roberts at one point and repeatedly calling on the court to step in to void election results. After he lost the election, his tweets, just before he was banned from Twitter, reached a crescendo. Trump said, for instance, that the court had to show \u201cgreat Courage & Wisdom\u201d to \u201csave the USA.\u201d At another point, after a loss in a dispute related to Texas, he said the court \u201creally let us down.\u201d  \u201cNo wisdom, no courage\u201d he tweeted. To be sure, Trump\u2019s tweets likely played little role in the court\u2019s deliberations. But still, the justices witnessed Trump supporters storming the Capitol, across the street from their own headquarters. And although the Supreme Court was never breached, the building is now surrounded by high fences erected after the riot. The justices are still scheduled to hear challenges to actual Trump policies on issues such as immigration and abortion, but on Monday they refused to give credence to his claims of voter fraud, and they opened the door to legal complications down the road now that a New York prosecutor can continue his investigation. For the most part, the justices \u2013 including the three Trump appointed to the high court \u2013 kept their votes and voices silent, although conservatives Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito would have allowed a challenge brought by Pennsylvania Republicans in a case related to the last election. Justice Clarence Thomas reveals some sympathy for Trump's baseless fraud claims But without comment, the court denied six other appeals concerning the election, one brought by Trump\u2019s own lawyers. As for Trump, he released a statement. \u201cI will fight on, just as I have, for the last five years (even before I was successfully elected) despite all of the election crimes that were committed against me,\u201d he said. Referring to the investigation into his tax records, he added, \u201cThe Supreme Court never should have let this fishing expedition happen, but they did.\u201d The order that will allow the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns was a mere 16 words long, and there was no explanation for the action or even a public breakdown of the vote count. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers had asked the justices to step in and block the release of the tax returns to the prosecutor while they prepared a formal appeal to the Supreme Court. In court papers, Trump\u2019s lawyer William Consovoy called the subpoena for the documents \u201csprawling,\u201d \u201cexpansive\u201d and \u201cunlimited,\u201d arguing that it amounted to an \u201cunlawful fishing expedition.\u201d He asked the justices to step in and freeze the subpoena while the case continued. Recall that last term the justices did reject Trump\u2019s broad claims of immunity in a 7-2 vote but sent the case back to the lower courts to allow Trump to make other arguments. The lower courts ruled against Trump again, catapulting the case back to the high court. The justices sat on the emergency petition for months, dealing Trump a win in the short term. Because of that delay, the subpoena did not go out during the last days of the election campaign or his presidency. But with no noted dissents, the subpoena can go forward thanks to Monday\u2019s order. Cyrus Vance, the New York prosecutor, issued a simple statement. \u201cThe work continues,\u201d he said. It was the move he needed to continue and even escalate his inquiry. Trump\u2019s lawyers can still formally ask the justices to take up their appeal. But the justices have dealt with the heart of the case by allowing the tax returns to go out, even if they are shielded by grand jury secrecy rules. When Consovoy asked the justices to freeze the subpoena, he told them that once the documents are surrendered, \u201cconfidentiality will be lost for all time.\u201d \u201cThe court cannot unring that bell,\u201d he told the court. The justices did sit on the petition for weeks, suggesting one or two may have been preparing to explain their votes or issue dissents from the majority\u2019s order. But if that were the case, something happened to change someone\u2019s mind. The cert petition is due in early March. Perhaps there will be more explanation when the court deals with that. On Monday the justices also denied an appeal from Republicans in Pennsylvania challenging a state Supreme Court decision that allowed mail-in ballots received up to three days after Election Day to be counted in light of the pandemic. The ballots \u2013 roughly 10,000 \u2013 were not enough to swing the election results but lawyers urged the justices to take up the case, arguing the state court had exceeded its authority by allowing the late-arriving ballots and that underlying issues in the case would matter in future elections. Yes, Donald Trump is in very *real* legal jeopardy Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas \u2013 in his own fiery dissent \u2013 did not agree with the court\u2019s order and said so. But Trump\u2019s two other appointees, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, remained publicly silent. It would have taken four justices to grant the case, and it appears neither voted in favor of the Republicans. Without comment, the justices also rejected other election-related challenges from battleground states, including one brought by Trump\u2019s own lawyer. In that case, also challenging decisions by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Trump lawyer John Eastman told the justices in court papers that \u201ccollectively, these three decisions resulted in counting approximately 2.6 million mail ballots in violation of the law as enacted by the Pennsylvania Legislature,\u201d he said. After the election, Trump spoke vehemently about election fraud even without success in the courts. On Monday, the Supreme Court\u2019s message was clear: We are staying out of the 2020 election. Trump did win a victory of sorts on Monday when the justices rejected a defamation claim by Stormy Daniels, leaving in place lower court opinions that went against the former adult-film actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. But again, it was the Supreme Court that put up a stop sign, refusing to review the lower court decision that went against Clifford. In another order without comment, the court indicated it wasn\u2019t interested in reviewing another part of Trump\u2019s life.",

            "article_content": "Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory dissected the state of the GOP on his radio show Thursday for over an hour without mentioning the name of its standard-bearer, former President Donald Trump. Ever since the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Republicans have struggled with whether to embrace or denounce the former President. Perhaps nowhere is that intra-party debate more acute than in North Carolina, where next year\u2019s open Senate race could decide the balance of power in an evenly divided chamber. Despite Republicans losing the White House and Congress, Trump narrowly carried the Tar Heel State last fall. And in the days since Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, Republican Sen. Richard Burr \u2013 who is not running for reelection next year \u2013 has become a pariah among some state party leaders for his vote to convict the former President for inciting the riot. Burr has been censured by the state party, and banned from at least one county GOP headquarters. Every Republican considering a 2022 run for the retiring senator\u2019s seat opposed his decision. While the backlash won\u2019t affect Burr\u2019s political future, it previews a broader fight over Trump\u2019s place in his party. When asked about Trump\u2019s role, McCrory \u2013 who himself is considering a Senate bid \u2013 walked a fine line. He said he would not \u201cplay the game of Republicans fighting each other,\u201d arguing that conservative values would guide Republicans in rebuilding the party\u2019s path back to power. But he also emphasized he was \u201ca strong supporter\u201d of the former President, said he disagreed with Burr\u2019s vote and redirected a question about the riot away from Trump and toward violent \u201cextremists\u201d on both sides, although there\u2019s no evidence that left-wing groups were involved in the planning of or participated in the insurrection. \u201cWe\u2019re all in different stages of the grieving process,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cSome people are in withdrawal. Some people are still in anger. Some people are still very suspicious of how it happened. We\u2019re not ready yet to get back into the policy but we need to get there pretty quick.\u201d \u201cPolicy will trump all,\u201d he added. McConnell's plan to deal with Trump: Ignore him House and Senate elections are less than two years away, but the GOP is already confronting the crucial question of whether it wants Trump in or out of the party. Across the country, many Republican candidates have already tied themselves to Trump, blaming the mob for attempting to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 election on January 6, rather than the former President for urging his supporters to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d But some GOP strategists worry that that primary strategy could hurt Republicans in 2022, noting that Trump\u2019s reputation was damaged by efforts to overturn his loss that resulted in violence. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has nodded to both Trump supporters and those in his party who want to move on, saying Trump was directly responsible for the mob\u2019s attack on the Capitol, which is still encircled by razor wire, but voting to acquit him because he viewed the unprecedented impeachment trial of a former president to be unconstitutional. Burr said in a statement after the trial that Trump \u201cpromoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election because he did not like the results,\u201d and, after the pro-Trump crowd turned to violence, \u201cused his office to first inflame the situation.\u201d In his bid for the GOP nomination in North Carolina, former Rep. Mark Walker has branded himself as a \u201cconservative bridge builder.\u201d In an interview, he emphasized his work with Democrats on historically Black colleges and universities and criminal justice reform. He said that \u201cultimately\u201d Republicans need to focus their message on the conservative principles of individual liberty and prosperity. He noted he denounced the Trump-inspired cheers at a 2019 Greenville rally to \u201csend\u201d Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar \u201cback\u201d to Somalia. But Walker said he would \u201clove\u201d to have Trump\u2019s support in his campaign for the GOP nomination, and defended his post-Election Day actions. \u201cTo say that President Trump had a direct responsibility in driving those people to attack the Capitol I think is unfair, unwarranted, and that\u2019s why I would have certainly voted against the impeachment process,\u201d said Walker, who chose not to run for reelection to the House in 2020 after his district was altered in redistricting. There\u2019s also chatter that the GOP field could include the former President\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. But Republican operatives in the state privately worry that Trump\u2019s standing has worsened since January 6 and could drag down-ticket candidates with him. Richard Wernau, a Republican voter from Charlotte, said the riot was \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and  \u201cdeplorable,\u201d and that the former President needed to be \u201cpunished\u201d for his actions. \u201cI voted for Trump, and I was mad at myself,\u201d said Wernau. Several other Republicans who are considering a run for Burr\u2019s seat, like Rep. Ted Budd, voted to object to the 2020 election. Other North Carolina Republicans, including Rep. Dan Bishop, supported Burr\u2019s censure. \u201cThey\u2019re all making a play for the primary,\u201d said a North Carolina Republican strategist granted anonymity to speak freely about the Senate race. \u201cBut my worry is that we\u2019re going to lose the seat because we get the Trumpiest guy of the bunch.\u201d Republicans expect that running against the complete Democratic control of Washington will help them take back Congress during the midterm elections, when the party out of the White House has historically done well. Republicans already are bashing the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to cancel the Keystone pipeline, its bill to build an eight-year pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and its mixed messaging on when and how schools should reopen. \u201cThe question is going to be: Do they feel emboldened enough to overreach,\u201d said Paul Shumaker, a Republican strategist in North Carolina who has worked for both its senators. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do that, then what impact does that have on their base,\u201d he asked of Democrats. But Democrats are looking at the Republicans\u2019 internecine squabble with glee. Morgan Jackson, a Democratic strategist in the state, said Republicans are \u201cin the middle of an uncivil war\u201d that could turn off Republicans in the business community who are seeking to turn the page from Trump. \u201cThe Trump brand is in a horrible place with swing voters,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pledge to that, rather than a policy or an ideal?\u201d If McCrory decides to run, the former governor could face blowback for defending the controversial law that required people at government-run facilities to use the bathrooms that corresponded to the gender on their birth certificates. But it\u2019s clear that he thinks Republicans\u2019 best chance of success is to embrace principles that have traditionally guided the party rather than Trump\u2019s singular personality. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight for his policies that he implemented and make sure that (President Joe) Biden and (Vice President Kamala) Harris and (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi and (Senate Majority Leader Chuck) Schumer do not disband successful policies for the economy, for immigration, for trade, for foreign policy, keeping us out of war,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cWhat we need to focus on are the policies that were very successful during the past four years.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As he gently told a traumatized 8-year-old girl, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, honey. Don\u2019t be scared,\u201d Joe Biden showed that the days of presidential pandemic denial and indifference to America\u2019s suffering are over. His reassuring words to second grader Layla Salas came during a CNN town hall in Wisconsin on Tuesday night when he also tried to move the nation on from the divisive aftermath of the impeachment trial of the predecessor he referred to as \u201cthe former guy.\u201d \u201cFor four years, all that\u2019s been in the news is Trump. The next four years, I want to make sure all the news is the American people. I\u2019m tired of talking about Trump,\u201d Biden said, depriving the ex-President of the attention he craves. RELATED: 6 takeaways from Biden\u2019s town hall That particular moment emphasized Biden\u2019s chosen position in the center of American politics where he won the election. His unwillingness to seek public revenge against his just-impeached predecessor, or to join other prominent Democrats in vociferously condemning the Republican senators who voted to acquit former President Donald Trump over the US Capitol insurrection, may disappoint more radical members of his own party. But with his restraint, Biden practiced what he has preached: an effort to bring a fractured nation together and to ensure that political disagreements don\u2019t become \u201cuncivil wars.\u201d In these two answers, the President took care of the politics of his prime time appearance in which he needed to show compassion for a country demoralized by a year-long battle against the virus and to lead it out of Trump\u2019s dark shadow. The President also offered some hope \u2013 with a specific promise against which he will be judged \u2013 for 600 million doses of vaccine to be available by the end of July. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s going to continue to increase as we move along. We will have reached 400 million doses by the end of May and 600 million by the end of July,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in Milwaukee. But on some substantive questions that Americans desperately want answered \u2013 including how long the pandemic will last and when everyone can get the vaccine \u2013 Biden could not give definitive answers. And there is fresh confusion and some equivocation from the administration on when all kids will be back in school and whether or not vaccinating teachers is a prerequisite for it to happen. Biden\u2019s prediction that life could be back mostly to normal by Christmas may strike many Americans, who had longed for freedom to return with the spring and the summer, as daunting evidence of a long haul ahead. He also seemed to take pains not to over promise on the question of when children can return to in-person learning. He hoped kindergarten through eighth grade pupils could go back to five days a week, and that this could happen by the end of his 100 days in office in April. But he couldn\u2019t say when older students, who are more susceptible to spreading Covid-19, would get the same treatment. He did advocate for pushing teachers to the front of the line for vaccinations, in an effort to get schools open more quickly, amid criticism from Republicans that he is unwilling to upset teachers unions, a powerful Democratic constituency. Vice President Kamala Harris said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Wednesday that teachers should be \u201ca priority,\u201d but she left it up to states on who should get vaccinated when. And in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d the vice president\u2019s chief spokeswoman Symone Sanders repeatedly declined to answer whether the President thinks that kindergarten through grade eight schools can open even if teachers have not been vaccinated, repeatedly peddling the administration line that teachers should be \u201cprioritized\u201d that fails to clarify the question. Biden\u2019s caution could be the positioning of a politician who is setting low targets he thinks he can outperform. It is appropriate given the capricious nature of a virus that is mutating in a way that makes it more infectious and potentially more resistant to vaccines. \u201cI don\u2019t want to over promise anything here,\u201d the President said, contrasting sharply with his predecessor\u2019s predictions that church pews would be full by Easter 2020 and that the virus would magically disappear. The President was disingenuous when he blamed poor reporting and a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d on the perception that his team saw children in school buildings for one day a week as a mark of success. The comment came from his White House last week and was later walked back. Biden also said inaccurately that there were no vaccines when he took office \u2013 a puzzling statement given that he received both doses of the Pfizer/BionNTech vaccine before his inauguration. There were limited doses developed by private companies and scientists in an impressive initiative sponsored by the Trump administration, but the former White House made a poor first of the initial rollout that badly complicated Biden\u2019s own plans. Even still, about 1 million doses per day were being administered by the time Biden took office on January 20. Still, Biden\u2019s missteps paled in the comparison to the hurricane of lies, false statements, bitter political attacks and self-aggrandizement that regularly dominated Trump\u2019s appearances in rally speeches and town hall events on conservative media. And despite his characteristic stumbling over some precise figures, the President came across as far more engaged and well briefed on all aspects of the pandemic than senior officials in the Trump administration. With his self-deprecating asides, easy interaction with the audience and folksy recycling of his parents\u2019 \u201cGod love you\u201d wisdom, Biden displayed the capacity to emotionally connect with individuals and a sense of humanity that enabled him to cross over some partisan divides in his election win. This shone through his encounter with Jessica Salas, a Milwaukee graphic designer who told him that her children often ask whether they will get Covid-19 and die. \u201cKids don\u2019t get Covid very often. It\u2019s unusual for that to happen,\u201d Biden told Salas and her daughter, Layla, displaying a keen sense of the isolation of kids who can\u2019t go to school and go out and play with their friends. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, honey. Don\u2019t be scared. You\u2019re going to be fine, and we\u2019re going to make sure mommy\u2019s fine, too,\u201d Biden told the little girl. It was the conversation that millions of Americans have had with their children over the last 11 months, and reflected Biden\u2019s capacity as a grandfather to speak to children on their level and the emotional depth of a man who has known deep personal pain and tragedy in his own life. Salas told CNN that Biden addressing her daughter like that was a \u201ctotally unexpected\u201d moment. \u201cAnd that was really, really awesome. Afterwards she was like, \u2018Mommy, he told us everything\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019 Which, obviously, wasn\u2019t his exact words, but the fact that she felt his sentiment meant a lot,\u201d Salas said. The President also touched on other points during the more than 60-minute town hall, including immigration, promising a \u201creasonable path to citizenship\u201d for undocumented migrants who he said needed to be treated with \u201cdignity.\u201d In one meandering answer in which he meditated on the racial awakening sparked by the killing of Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of police last year, the President declared, \u201cWe have a chance now, a chance now, to make significant change in racial disparities.\u201d However, it was difficult to clearly pinpoint a clear set of policies in what even he admitted were long-winded remarks. In more reflective moments, Biden also revealed that every living President but one had called him since he moved into the White House last month. He didn\u2019t reveal private conversations but his mischievous grin directed at Cooper left no doubt that the missing connection was with Trump. The President also revealed that he had never been up in the White House residence before he took the oath of office, and talked of his discomfort at accepting help from the domestic staff that serves the First Family. \u201cI was raised in a way that you didn\u2019t look for anybody to wait on you. And it\u2019s where I find myself extremely self-conscious,\u201d he said, encapsulating a performance characterized by presidential humility that he sees as the antidote to a scary and polarized time in American history.",

            "article_content": "The FBI is investigating some of his followers. Others are already in custody and\u202ffacing decades in prison if convicted of federal charges\u202fconnected to\u202fthe January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\u202fBut the national leader of the extremist Oath Keepers group\u202fis carrying on as before. He might even be emboldened. \u201cYou gotta declare this regime to be illegitimate,\u201d Stewart Rhodes said on Infowars on\u202fJanuary 30 \u2013\u202f24 days after the riot amid the violence that left five dead and delayed the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election win. \u201cYou gotta to declare everything that comes out of King Biden\u2019s mouth as illegitimate \u2013 null and void from the inception because he is not a legitimate president.\u201d Rhodes is still peddling the falsehood that the election was illegitimate. He says Biden\u2019s administration and supporters in Congress should\u202fbe seen as\u202fan occupying enemy force and issues warnings about what he claims are 365 million armed patriots ready to \u201crise up.\u201d \u201cThere is going to be resistance.\u202fThe only question is what\u202fwill be the spark,\u201d Rhodes said in a January 30 interview on Infowars, a media organization that is one of the leading purveyors of conspiracy theories in the US. \u201cThey keep pushing,\u201d he said of who he calls \u201cleftists.\u201d \u201cThat is why\u202fit\u2019s\u202fimportant\u2026 Let them be the ones who draw first blood. Then you defend.\u201d Rhodes spoke to CNN in the days after the violent invasion of the Capitol, but did not return multiple calls and emails to comment on the future of the Oath Keepers for this story. But his rhetoric after the insurrection in interviews and postings reviewed by CNN mirrors what he urged his followers beforehand when he encouraged them to attend the January 6 rally. \u201cAll Patriots who can get to DC need to be in DC. Now is the time to stand. It\u2019s not too late to go. Jump on a plane! Jump in your car! Just get there,\u201d\u202fRhodes\u202fsaid\u202fon his\u202fgroup\u2019s\u202fwebsite on January 4. \u202f\u201cStand\u202fnow, or\u202fkneel forever.\u201d Rhodes\u2019 call was apparently heard and heeded by a number of people who entered the Capitol on that bloody day, including former members of the military who the Oath Keepers group actively recruits for membership Jessica Watkins, confirmed by Rhodes as being an Oath Keeper, has emerged as one of the central figures in the government\u2019s case against the insurrectionists. She was photographed with Rhodes \u2013 a figure made distinctive by a black eye patch  \u2013 in November during a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d and \u201cMillion Maga March\u201d event in Washington, DC. Watkins, who served in the Army, is charged along with two other military veterans and alleged Oath Keepers Donovan Crowl and Thomas Caldwell, with conspiracy and other charges related to the attack. \u201cWe are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it,\u201d Watkins said on a walkie talkie app, according to federal prosecutors. They say she was coordinating with others. Paramilitant communications under close scrutiny in Capitol riot investigation, court records show \u201cWe\u2019re in the f**kin\u2019 Capitol, Crowl!\u201d Watkins, rear, is said to have yelled to Crowl as Crowl shot selfie video, according to the complaint against them Watkins and Crowl are both being held in jail and neither had an assigned lawyer at the time this story was published. Caldwell is accused of coordinating with Watkins and Crowl before, during and after the assault. His lawyer says Caldwell denies involvement with the Oath Keepers. He also says Caldwell has worked for the FBI. An FBI spokesperson said it was \u201cpolicy not to comment on personnel matters and CNN is unable to confirm Caldwell\u2019s work for the FBI. But a source with inside knowledge of how the Oath Keepers operate told CNN there are members who are in federal law enforcement, but kept off the official member database for plausible deniability. The FBI is trying to identify a group of between 8 and 10 people wearing military tactical gear emblazoned with the Oath Keepers\u2019 paraphernalia on the Capitol Steps. One photo shows a few Oath Keepers inside the Capitol rotunda. Rhodes, who is not facing charges in connection to January 6, says he did not enter the Capitol building. But he was seen after the assault with the men in Oath Keepers gear now being sought by the FBI. The FBI has appealed for information on the group in the FBI photos. Rhodes told CNN shortly after the insurrection that he was not anti-government but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t trust the FBI right now.\u201d Rhodes, now 55, is an Army veteran and disbarred lawyer who incorporated the Oath Keepers in 2009, after the group rose to prominence during the first election campaign of Barack Obama. \u201cOur role is not to be obedient to whoever happens to be the leader. Our role is to defend the Constitution and the republic,\u201d\u202fRhodes told CNN in 2009. Rhodes and other militia groups began denouncing the government as tyrannical, according to Alex\u202fFriedfeld, an investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League. Rhodes boasted about trying to recruit active and retired military and law enforcement personnel. The \u201coath\u201d in the group\u2019s name refers to the pledge to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic, with the subtext that they were not necessarily beholden to obey orders from a government they believe is illegitimate. He found ways to insert his group into national flashpoints, positioning members as protectors of society\u202fwhile continuing to use charged rhetoric. Members of the Oath Keepers were in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 during the\u202fmonths-long protests in the wake of the police killing of Michael Brown. They said they were there to protect businesses.\u202fTheir presence\u202fwas applauded\u202fby some owners\u202fand shunned by others.\u202f Some Oath Keepers were involved in armed participation in disputes at the Bundy ranch in Nevada, according to the ADL. Rhodes also told people to flock to Washington DC after a standoff at the Bundy ranch. During the Obama years, the Oath Keepers were openly an anti-government in their views, according to the ADL and other groups tracking extremism. But the rise of political outsider Donald Trump brought a change. Trump\u2019s calls to \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d and his policy views were now more parallel to Rhodes\u2019 rhetoric than the campaigns of previous presidential nominees. In the 2016 election, Rhodes issued\u202fa \u201ccall to action\u201d\u202fdubbed \u201cOperation Sabot\u201d\u202fin which he told members and supporters to look for voter fraud or intimidation at polling locations.\u202fRhodes also frequently wrote and referred to Hillary Clinton who he vehemently opposed as \u201cHitlery.\u201d Even then, he used the language of making sure the election was not \u201cstolen from the citizens.\u201d When Trump came to power, Rhodes moved away from criticizing the political leadership and targeted issues on which he and the then-President shared similar feelings \u2013 anger about illegal immigration, China and those on the left, and protection for Second Amendment rights. He often spoke of deploying Oath Keepers to the US-Mexico border. He called on Oath Keepers to stand lawfully armed in front of schools after the Parkland school massacre of February 2018. Rhodes said his group provided security for VIPs who were attending Trump rallies. And he went further, saying they would help\u202fthe \u201caverage American\u201d\u202fprepare if they were to be\u202f\u201ccalled out by the president of the United States to serve as a militia of the United States to secure the schools, protect our borders, or whatever else he asks them to do\u202fto execute our laws, repel invasions and suppress insurrections\u201d which he claimed falsely was being carried out by the left. \u201cWe want to see a militia, basically, reestablished in this country and trained up,\u201d he added. As Trump ramped up his bid for re-election, Rhodes and other extremist groups started to fan the flames of what could come if he lost, making frequent mention of a \u201ccivil war.\u201d As early as July 2019, Rhodes told Alex Jones on Infowars that\u202fif Trump was not re-elected \u201cwe won\u2019t accept the results\u201d and will have \u201cno choice but to fight.\u201d He boasted his group had veterans who were well trained. \u201cIf this kicks\u202foff into a civil war, a bloody one, they will instantly go to work and take it to the left,\u201d he said. After Biden won the election, Rhodes wrote an open letter to Donald Trump  on\u202fDecember 23, urging him among many things to\u202finvoke the Insurrection Act, noting \u201cthere are millions of American patriots standing ready.\u201d\u202fThe Act allows, under certain limited circumstances involved in the defense of constitutional rights, the President to deploy troops unilaterally. \u201cDo not forsake them. Do not leave them to have to do it all themselves. Keep your promise. Drain the\u202fSwamp.\u202fDo it now!\u201d\u202fRhodes\u202fwrote. \u201cWe will help you at every step of the way.\u201d The way words turned to action did not altogether surprise those who have been monitoring groups like the Oath Keepers for years. \u201cIn late 2020 we saw a sharp uptick in Stewart Rhodes\u2019 violent rhetoric,\u201d\u202fFriedfeld, of the ADL told CNN. \u201cHe started to frame the election as a line in the sand where if the Democrat won, it would be the imposition of tyranny.\u201d Rhodes told CNN after the violence that he and his members were in Washington, DC, as part of their broad mission of protection. Watkins\u2019 boyfriend told CNN last month she traveled to the capital to \u201chelp protect some Trump VIP members\u201d and a man in Oath Keeper garb was seen apparently guarding Trump confidant Roger Stone on the morning of January 6. Rhodes has lost some followers after January 6. The North Carolina chapter quit Rhodes\u2019 group though it said it still supported the mission and would be rebranding, in a letter to their local sheriff that they agreed\u202fto share with CNN. \u201cWe could see the mayhem and wanted no part of it,\u201d\u202fwrote Doug Smith, who said he was in Washington DC that day but did not enter the Capitol. \u201cThe men of North Carolina believe that the National leadership (of Oath Keepers) could have stopped this and did nothing.\u202fThe men and\u202fmyself\u202fincluded can no longer be affiliated with Oath Keepers after this sad event in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d But there are many other chapters and members of the group. Accused leaders like Watkins are being held in jail or hunted down for their alleged involvement in the January 6 insurrection.\u202fAnd Rhodes is still preaching\u202fand\u202fissuing orders to\u202fanyone willing to listen.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden had been in office less than a week when a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking one of his first immigration-related actions. The order was a victory for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who crowed \u201cWE WON\u201d on Twitter. In fact, Paxton, a controversial conservative Republican, had successfully gambled that his challenge would land before a judge appointed by President Donald Trump. And indeed Judge Drew B. Tipton \u2013 appointed by Trump in 2020 \u2013 delivered. The order is a potent reminder of the power of the judiciary to cripple a president\u2019s forward momentum on an issue. It also highlighted the fact that elections matter \u2013 giving an incoming president the chance to create a lasting legacy. Trump, for example, was able to appoint 234 judges, including three Supreme Court justices. RELATED: Trump transformed the Supreme Court that mostly helped advance his agenda Now it\u2019s Biden\u2019s turn, and so far his administration is signaling that judicial nominations will be a major priority and that Democrats may even tear pages from Trump\u2019s playbook on the issue. There are 60 current eligible vacancies and 20 vacancies that will occur down the road as judges have formally announced their intentions to retire, take senior status or resign, according to the Administrative Office of the US Courts. One other factor could be a game changer for Biden: the lingering possibility that 82-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer might choose to step aside this term or next and give Biden his first chance to name a Supreme Court justice. Biden has vowed to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, and even before his inauguration his transition team sent a letter to Democratic senators seeking recommendations for district court vacancies that might arise. There is also an effort afoot to speed up the confirmation process by no longer allowing the American Bar Association to vet judicial candidates before they are nominated. Some progressives, however, have legitimate concerns regarding whether the White House and the Senate will maintain the discipline and stamina necessary over the coming weeks and months to keep judges a priority as attention shifts to other areas. They still remember that President Barack Obama came up short when faced with a similar opportunity early in his presidency, and they believe he squandered an opportunity to focus on the courts. Chris Kang, chief counsel for the progressive group Demand Justice, believes things will be different now. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s approach to judicial nominations is going to put the nail in the coffin of the conventional wisdom that Democrats don\u2019t care enough about the court,\u201d he said in an interview. As things stand, since Biden\u2019s inauguration, judges sitting on powerful courts have already announced plans to go into senior status, giving the new President the chance to replace them with younger nominees. Since Biden\u2019s inauguration there have been five announced vacancies on the appeals courts as well as a handful on district courts, and more are expected Judge Robert A. Katzmann, for example, who penned an opinion that would have allowed Trump\u2019s tax records to go to a New York prosecutor, has announced plans to take senior status on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who sits the US District Court in Washington and most recently oversaw the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, will also take senior status. Another notable vacancy will come up once Judge Merrick Garland of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is confirmed as Biden\u2019s attorney general. Democrats haven\u2019t forgotten that Garland, nominated by Obama early in 2016 to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, was denied a hearing by Senate Republicans, who simply sat on the nomination until the presidential election was over. The DC Circuit is considered a breeding ground for Supreme Court nominees and served as a steppingstone for Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Scalia and Brett Kavanaugh. Stephen Breyer gifted the chance for a liberal successor -- when will he take it? High on the list of potential contenders is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who sits on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. She is a former Breyer clerk who also served as a public defender. California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger is a potential nominee for Breyer\u2019s seat if he were to step down. In addition, in the coming weeks, Biden is set to reveal the membership for a bipartisan commission that will take a look at revisions to the Supreme Court, including the potential of term limits and adding more seats to the bench. Under Trump, a careful troika composed of White House Counsel Don McGahn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley worked immediately and almost seamlessly to change the face of the courts. Democrats were livid and accused the Republicans at times of ignoring the rules in order to bulldoze the process, but with Republicans in the Senate majority all four years of the Trump presidency, the Democrats were unable to stop all but a handful of nominations. The Republicans ran a closely held vetting operation, eased long-standing institutional norms and, perhaps most importantly, maintained forward momentum, avoiding distraction, as other issues blew up around the presidency. The process \u2013 no easy feat straddling three branches \u2013 required discipline and outside backing. Under Trump, the conservative Federalist Society and later a group called The Article III Project were supportive of Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s biggest and most consequential accomplishment was his transformation of the federal judiciary, including his solidification of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and his appointment of a near-record 54 circuit judges to the critically important federal courts of appeals,\u201d said Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project. \u201cThese lifetime appointments will provide an important constitutional check on government overreach by the Biden administration.\u201d In the early Obama years, outside groups often disagreed on potential nominees and the political branches lacked a laser-like focus necessary to accompany a nominee to confirmation. During the lead-up to the 2016 election, Trump made the Supreme Court and lower courts a campaign issue. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton rarely brought it up and some liberals squabbled over whether Garland should remain the Democratic pick. After Trump won, Democrats found themselves helpless as they fought the onslaught of nomination hearings. They were largely sidelined as Justice Neil Gorsuch got the seat once offered to Garland, Kavanaugh won confirmation after perhaps the most ferocious nomination fight in history and conservatives rushed to fill the seat of the liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg with the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Ginsburg died some four months short of Biden\u2019s inauguration. The Supreme Court now has a solid 6-3 conservative majority that could last for decades as issues such as abortion, immigration, affirmative action, religious liberty, voting rights and the Second Amendment reach the high court. A final wake-up call for progressives came at the end of Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing in October, when Democrats, still furious that Republicans had rushed deadlines in the run-up to the election, witnessed Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, hug Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and praise him for his efforts during the hearings. Then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he had had a \u201clong and serious\u201d talk with Feinstein. Progressives felt betrayed, and it wasn\u2019t long after that Feinstein announced she would step down as top Democrat on the committee. Now that Biden is in office, there\u2019s a new troika in town. White House Counsel Dana Remus, Schumer \u2013 now the majority leader \u2013 and Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, are in place. Brian Fallon, who runs Demand Justice, launched in 2018, is determined to keep the pressure on from outside of government. His group wants Biden\u2019s team to move away from recent models and nominate a diverse group of individuals including public defenders, civil rights lawyers and legal aid attorneys. On Friday, Fallon tweeted a stern reminder about the lessons learned from 2009 just after Obama took over. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to Rahm on how much to prioritize judges,\u201d he wrote. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, hadn\u2019t seen the judiciary as a priority. The three lessons from 2009 are:1. Dont spend months chasing Republican votes that will never come2. Dont listen to Rahm on how much to prioritize judges3. Dont listen to Larry Summers on the size of your stimulus package \u201cThis is clearly a new day. We are witnessing a revolution in how Democrats are considering and prioritizing judicial nominees, led by President Biden and embodied by chief of staff Ron Klain,\u201d Kang said. \u201cThey are upending the model of lawyers that Democratic presidents will consider for the judiciary. Prosecutors and corporate lawyers are out; civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor lawyers are in,\u201d he said. According to a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill, Durbin will follow the same rules that the Republicans did when the committee was led by Grassley and Graham. They expect to hold hearings at a regular clip and to put forward multiple nominees on any given hearing panel. There will be an emphasis on diversity but also, following Trump, they will look for young nominees who could serve for decades. Although some questioned whether Congress will prioritize Justice Department nominees over judges, the aide dismissed the concern. \u201cThere is time and there is precedent for moving DOJ nominees alongside of judicial nominees,\u201d the aide said. \u201cI have every reason to believe that the nominees you will see from this White House will be eminently qualified, which was not always true for nominees you saw put forward by Trump,\u201d the person added. Momentum will also come from other quarters of the White House, starting most obviously with a President and vice president who both spent time serving on the Judiciary Committee, with Biden as its former chairman. Klain is a veteran of countless confirmation hearings and a former clerk of Justice Byron White. Paige Herwig, a former top aide to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch as well as a veteran of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Demand Justice, will serve as the nominations counsel and will receive help from Tona Boyd, Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s former chief counsel. As Biden concentrates on nominations, he will find that his policies and initiatives, like the immigration action temporarily struck by Judge Tipton, will land in the courts. And while Trump\u2019s nominees did not always vote in his favor, a fact that was made clear as he fought to overturn the election, by and large his nominees will share a conservative legal outlook. When will Biden ask the Supreme Court to uphold Obamacare? Chief Justice John Roberts may have famously tried to distance the judiciary from Trump\u2019s attacks when he reprimanded the then-President in 2018 by saying that \u201cwe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges.\u201d But the reality is there are Obama, Trump and Biden nominees. And now, with a new cascade of judicial retirements and an expected avalanche of new executive orders, the judges will make a difference.",

            "article_content": "The delay in confirming President Joe Biden\u2019s Homeland Security secretary has left the department without clear direction as it confronts a series of stark challenges, including domestic terror threats, a massive cyber breach, uncertainty at the border and helping coordinate the distribution of Covid vaccines. Alejandro Mayorkas, the nominee for DHS secretary, will have a final confirmation vote this week after a holdup in the Senate that angered Democrats and caused a flurry of effort to get the confirmation done quickly. The vote, originally scheduled for Monday, has been pushed to Tuesday due to the winter storm that hit the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, which is impacting flights of senators coming into town, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office. \u201cYou can tell that we are in a semi-holding pattern at the very top until Mr. Mayorkas is confirmed as Secretary and starts giving more clear public direction and more specific leadership effort,\u201d one department official said. Mayorkas\u2019 nomination was moving through the Senate but was stalled last week by Republicans who argued that the nominee hasn\u2019t been properly vetted on immigration issues. On Thursday, his nomination successfully cleared a procedural hurdle and a final vote on confirmation is on track for Tuesday. That puts Mayorkas\u2019 start behind his predecessors. Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama had confirmed secretaries on their first days in office.   While DHS political appointees have begun to fill out their jobs, according to department officials, leadership roles continue to be filled by officials in acting capacities \u2013 a trend that was ubiquitous during the Trump administration. Another DHS official said the delayed confirmation was \u201cmore of the same,\u201d as acting officials have led the department for much of the past four years. \u201cMore than any other department with national and homeland security responsibilities, DHS is in severe need of new strategic vision and day to day operational leadership, as the Trump administration gutted the top leadership ranks across the department,\u201d said Carrie Cordero, CNN legal and national security analyst and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, who served at the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Last week, the White House delayed an executive order to launch a family reunification taskforce because of the holdup on Mayorkas\u2019 confirmation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday. The taskforce, aimed at reuniting children who were separated from their parents at the border under the Trump-era enforcement policies, will be led by Mayorkas once he is confirmed, she said. \u201cWe had hoped that Ali Mayorkas would be confirmed\u201d by the end of last week, Psaki added. Since Biden took office, DHS has been run by TSA Administrator David Pekoske, who stepped in until Mayorkas can be confirmed. Last Wednesday, Pekoske issued a rare threat bulletin, which included a warning that domestic violent extremists may be emboldened by the attack on the US Capitol. \u201cWe are facing unprecedented challenges and threats to our national security during these emergencies, and our country urgently needs our Secretary of Homeland Security in place to guard against these dangers and keep the American people safe,\u201d a White House spokesperson told CNN in a statement Friday. Heading into the second full week of Biden\u2019s presidency, the delayed transition at the top of DHS prompted two former Homeland Security secretaries to hold a press conference urging a swift confirmation. \u201cThe tradition has been, understandably, that national security positions within the incoming administration are confirmed on the day of inauguration,\u201d former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff said Wednesday during a virtual press conference. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security has been operating under temporary leaders for the last four years, certainly in the last two years. And the department is hungry to have permanent experienced leadership.\u201d Obama-era Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano argued that having a permanent, confirmed security \u201csends an important signal\u201d through the federal government and to states and localities that \u201cthis is the person they\u2019re going to be dealing with during President Biden\u2019s term.\u201d Once confirmed, Mayorkas will also be responsible for repairing a department that\u2019s been rattled by leadership turnover and vacancies for the better part of the last four years. The department has been without a Senate-confirmed leader since Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted in spring 2019. \u201cThe stability that you have from a confirmed appointment, versus a bunch of actors, would be refreshing,\u201d a DHS official told CNN. A number of top positions inside DHS require Senate confirmation, including the heads of FEMA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the immigration and border agencies, all of which remain helmed by officials in an acting capacity. Completing the confirmation process for the Secretary is a \u201ccritical first step,\u201d said Cordero. Meanwhile, pressure has mounted on the Biden administration to respond to one of the worst data breaches ever to hit the US government. Revelations surfaced in December that hackers had put malicious code into a tool published by SolarWinds, a software vendor used by countless government agencies and Fortune 500 businesses. The department\u2019s cyber agency is still working to understand the full scope of the data breach, and questions remain about whether it is up to the job. Biden is expected to install Rob Silvers, a top Obama-era official who previously led cyber efforts at DHS, to lead DHS\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, but he has yet to take the helm or be publicly announced. Silvers would join another of Obama\u2019s cyber officials, Eric Goldstein, who has already started as a senior CISA adviser and comes from Goldman Sachs where he worked as the head of cybersecurity policy. CISA has been led by a career official in an acting capacity since Trump fired his most visible cybersecurity official, Chris Krebs, after the presidential election. Officials have briefed new political appointees at DHS headquarters on the SolarWinds incident, a CISA official told CNN. \u201c[I]ncident response support is ongoing, as a cyber incident of this complexity, and because of the length of time that the adversary has had access to some of these networks, remediation \u2013 both short term and long-term rebuilding \u2013 will be a protracted process,\u201d the CISA official said. The Senate Homeland Security Committee voted Tuesday to advance Mayorkas\u2019 nomination to the floor and held a hearing into the nominee\u2019s qualifications to lead the department. But some Republicans wanted a hearing for Mayorkas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in addition to his hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. Mayorkas is the first Biden nominee who has met a Republican filibuster. Several GOP senators, led by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, called for the additional hearing, citing Mayorkas\u2019 role overseeing many of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies. Cornyn told reporters last week that \u201cthere\u2019s a number of problems\u201d with the Mayorkas nomination. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois called the request for a hearing \u201ctotally political.\u201d \u201cThis is indefensible. We are withholding the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Durbin added. The Senate voted Thursday to break a GOP filibuster and advance the nomination of Mayorkas.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will soon reveal the membership and agenda of a commission that would take the first modern-day look at reforming the Supreme Court, according to officials familiar with the commission. The move comes as liberals are calling for additional seats to balance out the conservative-dominated bench that is increasingly going to the right on abortion, immigration, voting rights and religious freedom cases. Biden first proposed a presidential commission as a candidate last October, partly as an alternative to immediate \u201ccourt packing\u201d demands from Democrats, as proposals for more seats on the nine-member bench are dubbed. Another idea that scholars have raised in recent years, and could be under consideration, is term limits for the justices, who currently enjoy life tenure. Trump transformed the Supreme Court that mostly helped advance his agenda Liberals pressing for dramatic change are trying to generate a sense of urgency by emphasizing just how different the high court is today. Trump appointments have accelerated the rightward tilt of judges across the county, and the Supreme Court is now controlled by the 6-3 conservative majority since the addition of Justice Amy Coney Barrett for the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Democrats remain incensed that Senate Republicans blocked the 2016 Supreme Court nomination of US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland for nearly a year, but then moved swiftly to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees, including Barrett just days before the November 2020 presidential election. \u201cDemocrats feel that seats were stolen from them, and that now their priorities will be struck down by the court,\u201d said University of Wisconsin law professor Joshua Braver, who has studied the history and consequences of \u201ccourt packing.\u201d Abortion drug ruling highlights Trump's wins on the Supreme Court 'shadow docket' Officials involved with the Biden commission say its membership and mission are being finalized and could be unveiled as early as next week. The co-chairs will be Bob Bauer, a former White House counsel to President Barack Obama and currently a New York University law professor, and Cristina Rodriguez, a Yale law professor who early in her career was a law clerk to former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. The full membership slate is not yet known, but it appears Biden, a Democrat, may fulfill his vow to appoint both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. Many members are law professors who have written on Supreme Court history, structure or reform. Bauer and Rodriguez declined to comment. Some of the commission\u2019s work would be conducted in public, under the usual rules for federal advisory panels, according to a person familiar with the set-up. Its report, with a six-month deadline, would likely be a starting point for executive-endorsed proposals, rather than a final recommendation for transforming the bench. Why SCOTUS is dismissing emolument cases against Trump When Biden first revealed the commission plan, in a CBS interview last fall, he said he wanted \u201crecommendations as to how to reform the court system because it\u2019s getting out of whack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about court-packing,\u201d Biden said, responding to a question about the topic. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated. \u2026 The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.\u201d Justices have historically bristled at loose proposals for the addition of seats or term limits. Congress sets the number of seats on the court, and any modification to life-tenure could arguably require a constitutional amendment. Some term-limit proponents suggest that life-tenure would be lifted if a justice were not stripped of his or her appointment after, for example, 18 years, but rather limited in what cases he or she could hear. The nine are known for their resistance to change. The court does not permit cameras in its courtroom and is not formally covered by a federal ethics code. Stephen Breyer gifted the chance for a liberal successor -- when will he take it? Bauer, who previously co-chaired a bipartisan commission on election administration, has argued for a deeper discussion of Supreme Court reform, including term limits, supermajority voting requirements and ethics codes. He opposed adding more seats to the Supreme Court in a 2018 Atlantic magazine piece headlined, \u201cDon\u2019t Pack the Courts.\u201d He said the move \u201cwould sap the Supreme Court of its legitimacy.\u201d Several liberal advocacy groups have joined together to promote four court-related priorities: the addition of Supreme Court seats; expansion of lower courts; term limits on justices; and new ethics rules for the high court. Polls have shown Democrats more inclined than Republicans to support enlarging the high court. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in early September, for example, found 46% of adults in favor of increasing the number of justices on the US Supreme Court, with 53% opposed. Among Democrats, 61% favored expansion vs. 34% of Republicans. \u201cIncrementalism isn\u2019t going to fly this time,\u201d Brett Edkins, political director of Stand Up America, said Friday. \u201cThe scale of the problem is huge. The Democrats have a narrow window of opportunity to repair it.\u201d With the result of the Georgia US Senate election earlier this month, both chambers of Congress are now controlled by Democrats. But the Democratic majority is slim, and there currently is no obvious appetite to add more seats to a bench whose numbers have not been changed since 1869. In earlier American history, there was more variation in the number of seats on the court, from a low of five to a high of 10. Politics often drove action to expand or contract the number of seats, although Congress would cloak its proposals in neutral justifications, for example, tied to caseload, as University of Alabama law professor Tara Leigh Grove has written. In a dramatic 1930s \u201ccourt packing\u201d attempt, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked Congress to add more justices to a bench that was invalidating his New Deal economic initiatives. FDR proposed a new justice for every sitting justice older than 70; six of the nine were then over 70. His plan failed. Roosevelt was targeting older conservative justices. Today, conservative justices are the relatively young ones. Barrett is 49, Neil Gorsuch is 53, and Brett Kavanaugh, 55. They are the three youngest justices. Stephen Breyer is the eldest, 82. Chief Justice John Roberts is 66. Don Lemon presses Kamala Harris on court-packing stance Braver, the University of Wisconsin professor, said that adding new seats carries significant dangers. \u201cCourt packing is a nuclear option. It would continue the political escalation and add new dangers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine people in the future thinking they can defy the court\u2019s rulings,\u201d because of shifts in the number of seats. He said a drawn-out study process may give the commission and the court time to observe each other. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sword of Damocles hanging over this court,\u201d Braver added on Friday. \u201cThe commission may or may not be pushed to certain positions based on how aggressive the court\u2019s rulings are in the meantime.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a threat bulletin due to the ongoing potential for violence in the wake of the presidential inauguration, including concerns that domestic extremists may be emboldened by the attack on the US Capitol. Acting DHS Secretary David Pekoske issued the National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin \u201cdue to a heightened threat environment across the United States,\u201d which DHS believes will persist in the weeks following the January 20 presidential inauguration. Threats against lawmakers fuel safety concerns for travel outside Washington \u201cInformation suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,\u201d the bulletin reads. Earlier this month, CNN reported that discussions were underway about raising the terrorism threat level, according to two sources familiar with the discussions at the time. The National Terrorism Advisory System \u2013 which replaced color-coded alerts of the Homeland Security Advisory System \u2013 falls under the Department of Homeland Security. The last advisory issued stemmed from an Iran-related terrorism threat to the United States last January and has since expired. A bulletin is used to describe current developments or general trends regarding threats of terrorism. The department can also issue an \u201celevated\u201d or \u201cimminent\u201d alert, which warns of credible or impending terrorism threats. Wednesday\u2019s bulletin, which is set to expire in April, comes as the confirmation of Biden\u2019s pick for Homeland Security Secretary secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, is being held up in the Senate. The bulletin reiterates several concerns about domestic extremists that the department has warned about over the past year, including anger over Covid-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results and police use of force. Long-standing racial and ethnic tension \u2013 including opposition to immigration \u2013 has driven domestic violent extremist attacks in the past, including a 2019 shooting in El Paso, Texas, that killed 23 people, according to the bulletin. In addition, DHS said some domestic extremists may be emboldened by the January 6 breach of the US Capitol to target elected officials and government facilities. DHS also warned that homegrown extremists inspired by foreign terrorist groups may remain a threat. Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst, said Wednesday that the bulletin goes directly after the \u201cbig lie\u201d \u2013 the false narrative that former President Donald Trump won the election \u2013 and those who push it. \u201cThis (bulletin) is a take no prisoners approach. And totally appropriate,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s never seen anything like this for domestic violent extremism. On January 6, rioters breached the Capitol after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes to confirm then-President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win. At least 150 people have now been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the insurrection at the Capitol, which  left five people dead, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements. Earlier this week, the US House transmitted to the Senate an article of impeachment against Trump for inciting insurrection. After becoming the first president in history to be impeached twice, Trump faces a trial in the Senate. \u201cWhile the DHS alert said absolutely nothing new, there\u2019s value in soliciting the public\u2019s assistance in identifying and alerting authorities about suspicious activity. The watchful public will always be the best \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 for law enforcement,\u201d Brian Harrell, former DHS assistant secretary for infrastructure protection, said Wednesday. Former Trump administration acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told CNN earlier this month that there are \u201climits\u201d to the usefulness of the National Terrorism Advistory System bulletins. He said the primary use is for education and awareness. In the wake of the Capitol attack, a joint bulletin from DHS, the FBI and eight other agencies warned that domestic extremists posed the most likely threat to the presidential inauguration, particularly those who believed the new administration is illegitimate. The assessment, dated January 14, also noted that since the attack on the US Capitol, Russian, Iranian and Chinese influence actors have \u201cseized the opportunity to amplify narratives in furtherance of their policy interest amid the presidential transition,\u201d adding that there was a lack of specific, credible information indicating that they were seeking to commit violence. In October, DHS\u2019 first annual homeland threat assessment said that White supremacist extremists would remain the deadliest domestic terror threat to the United States. Since 2018, White supremacists have conducted more lethal attacks in the US than any other domestic extremist movement, demonstrating a \u201clongstanding intent\u201d to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians and those they believe promote multiculturalism and globalization, according to the report. Senate Republicans are objecting to any efforts to quickly confirm Mayorkas, further delaying his confirmation as the department grapples with national security concerns, as well as the coronavirus pandemic and Biden\u2019s immigration plans. In confirming the GOP\u2019s plans to filibuster Biden\u2019s nominee, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters Wednesday on Capitol Hill that \u201cthere\u2019s a number of problems\u201d with Mayorkas\u2019 nomination. While several of Biden\u2019s nominees have been confirmed after moving at a slower pace than some of his predecessors\u2019 Cabinet picks, Republicans had not previously threatened to filibuster a nominee. Democratic lawmakers, the Biden administration, former Homeland Security secretaries and others have urged the swift confirmation of Mayorkas, arguing that it is vital for national security. This story has been updated with additional details and background information. Vivian Salama, Priscilla Alvarez, Alex Marquardt and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge\u2019s action Tuesday preventing President Joe Biden\u2019s 100-day pause in deportations demonstrated the land mines that await the new administration in the nation\u2019s courts. The short-term order by the Texas-based judge could also force a confrontation up to the US Supreme Court, where the Biden legal team already faces hard choices over how aggressively to press new legal positions before the nine justices \u2013 six of whom are conservatives, with three appointed by former President Donald Trump. US District Judge Drew Tipton, also a Trump appointee, sided on Tuesday with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Trump loyalist who has challenged Biden\u2019s temporary suspension of deportations. Judge temporarily blocks Biden's plan to halt deportations The nationwide scope of Tipton\u2019s order further intensifies debate over broad-scale actions against the executive branch imposed by a lone judge, which were the bane of the Trump administration. \u201cThese nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President\u2019s term with no clear end in sight,\u201d then-Attorney General William Barr declared in a 2019 speech. Trump Justice Department lawyers routinely were able to convince the Supreme Court to lift those injunctions, although that sometimes took months. The conservative Supreme Court majority may not be as sympathetic to Biden\u2019s ventures as it was to Trump\u2019s. A four-year timeline of Donald Trump and the Supreme Court All told, Tuesday\u2019s court action against an administration barely a week old reveals how tough it might be to advance a new agenda on immigration or any domestic policy if hit with lawsuits before judges who became increasingly right-wing during the Trump tenure. As Biden promotes new programs and encounters legal objections, there is no escaping that they will be resolved by life-tenured judges, 30% of whom were named by Trump. The pause on deportations, announced immediately after Biden\u2019s inauguration, reflects the desire to dismantle Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant practices. Biden also halted construction on the wall at the southern border. Department of Homeland Security officials said the 100-day hold on deportations would allow the administration to review current practices and to ensure \u201ca fair and effective immigration enforcement system focused on protecting national security, border security, and public safety.\u201d Biden wasting no time naming officials to reverse Trump's immigration policies The moratorium, which began last Friday \u2013 the day that Paxton sued \u2013 excludes some categories of individuals, including those who came to the US after November 1, are suspected of terrorism or espionage or pose a danger to national security, and have waived rights to remain in the US. Paxton, who led a failed lawsuit at the Supreme Court contesting Biden\u2019s election victory over Trump, contended that the 100-day suspension violated federal procedural requirements and breached a pact the Trump administration had made with Texas just before Trump left office. It dictated that the Department of Homeland Security would consult with the state before changing certain immigration practices. It is not clear whether such recent agreements made with various states could be legally enforced. Tipton said he would need more time and additional legal briefing to review the question as he set the 14-day temporary restraining order. READ: Judge\u2019s temporary order blocking Biden\u2019s halt of deportations But crucially, Tipton agreed with Texas that it appeared the suspension violated the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s safeguards against \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d executive action. The January 20 memorandum \u201cnot only fails to consider potential policies more limited in scope and time, but it also fails to provide any concrete, reasonable justification for a 100-day pause on deportations,\u201d Tipton wrote. John Roberts ducks the spotlight by skipping the second Trump impeachment trial Tipton said Texas had shown it could be hurt by the policy because of the millions of dollars it puts toward social services and other state benefits for undocumented immigrants. Regarding his imposition of a nationwide order, he wrote that the \u201c100-day pause plainly affects national immigration policy, which demands uniformity.\u201d Federal judges often shudder at the suggestion that they would ideologically align with the presidents who appointed them, and Chief Justice John Roberts famously answered Trump\u2019s disparagement of an \u201cObama judge\u201d with this admonition: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d Regardless of Roberts\u2019 declaration, the fact remains that Biden may find a skeptical judiciary. Trump filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Russell Wheeler \u2013 in addition to the three new Supreme Court justices.",

            "article_content": "Even now \u2013 after the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president, after the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, after the myriad lawsuit dismissals \u2013 Rand Paul can\u2019t bring himself to say that the 2020 election was not, in fact, stolen. In an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday, the Kentucky Republican was asked just that question by George Stephanopoulos. And here\u2019s what he said: \u201cWell, what I would suggest is \u2013 what I would suggest is that if we want greater confidence in our elections, and 75% of Republicans agree with me, is that we do need to look at election integrity and we need to see if we can restore confidence in the elections.\u201d Well, senator, no. Here\u2019s why: It is a FACT \u2013 based on a total lack of objective evidence and the rejection of lawsuit after lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump and his legal team \u2013 that there was no widespread election fraud in the 2020 race. (Which, by the way, makes it a lot like all the other presidential elections that experts have studied in search of fraud.) That FACT is not overridden by the opinion of Republican voters who say they don\u2019t have faith in the process. The reason they don\u2019t have faith in the process is that Trump \u2013 as well as his enablers like Paul \u2013 spent the last three months (and, really, the last four years) telling their supporters that the whole election system was rigged against them. So is it any wonder that so many Republicans \u2013 contra objective evidence \u2013 believe that the election wasn\u2019t entirely above board? Of course not! Paul didn\u2019t stop there, though. After Stephanopoulos said that President Joe Biden won a \u201clegitimate, fair election,\u201d the Kentucky senator interrupted to say this: \u201cI think where you make a mistake in \u2013 hey, George. George. George, where you make a mistake is that people coming from the liberal side like you, you immediately say everything\u2019s a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything. \u201cHistorically what would happen is if said that I thought that there was fraud, you would interview someone else who said there wasn\u2019t. But now you insert yourself in the middle and say that the absolute fact is that everything that I\u2019m saying is a lie.\u201d This is a classic appeal to both-sider-ism by Paul. His argument goes like this: I can say anything I want and it\u2019s not the job of the media to litigate whether it\u2019s true or not. Instead, there should be another guest on the show who says the opposite of what I am saying  \u2013 and then the viewers can decide who is right and who is wrong. Paul is right that journalism, for far too long, worked like this. Person A said something that was wrong \u2013 based on the facts. Person B disputed Person A\u2019s claim, pointing to established facts. The moderator said something like \u201cWell, a lot of heated views on this subject. Stay tuned,\u201d or something. And that was it. Which, candidly, did a disservice to viewers and readers. Because while there are absolutely issues \u2013 immigration, abortion, education, health care \u2013 where reasonable people disagree and can cite facts to back up their respective arguments, whether or not the 2020 election was stolen is not one of them. The FACTS make clear it was not stolen. And opinions that suggest otherwise are just that: Opinions. And facts \u2260 opinions. What Paul does in his responses to Stephanopoulos\u2019 questions then is to reveal the utter lack of seriousness in his arguments about the 2020 election.  A lot of Republicans think the election was stolen? No kidding! And Paul\u2019s false claims about the election should be treated the same as objective facts about the election? Really! The rottenness of Paul\u2019s argument \u2013 and the clear bad faith that serves as its architecture \u2013 should be evident to anyone who reads what he said. That it isn\u2019t \u2013 and that Paul will just keep repeating it \u2013 speaks to the challenges of our current political (and cultural) moment.",

            "article_content": "When President Joe Biden spoke with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Friday, the most controversial issues complicating the relationship between the two countries were not on the agenda. It\u2019s a sign that Biden is looking to reset his relationship with the Mexican leader who had developed a close personal relationship with former President Donald Trump, sources briefed on the content of the call tell CNN. In the months following Biden\u2019s election victory, L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 known in Mexico as AMLO \u2013 has challenged his new counterpart by talking up the bond he developed with Trump and making controversial policy decisions related to security. It will take a tremendous personal commitment from both sides to get Biden- L\u00f3pez Obrador relationship on a positive footing, explain people closely tracking the relationship. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador tests positive for Covid-19 \u201cI think the administration, and particularly President Biden, believe in letting bygones be bygones. He wants to build a constructive relationship going forward,\u201d said the former Mexican ambassador to the US Arturo Sarukhan, reflecting on the friendly initial phone call which avoided the most contentious issues. \u201cBut as with most things in life, the saying goes you need two to tango, or two to salsa in this instance. And the question is if L\u00f3pez Obrador will want to work with his American counterpart.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador was one of the last world leaders to congratulate Biden on his victory, and when they finally spoke during the transition period, the Mexican president bluntly reiterated to Biden that he had developed a positive relationship with Trump, according to sources briefed on the call. By contrast, readouts from the phone call last week seemed mild and friendly. It was the second call Biden had with a world leader, following his conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House said the two leaders largely focused on migration \u2013 agreeing to \u201cwork closely\u201d to stem irregular immigration \u2013 and on coordinating to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIt is a signal that the relationship could start to move in the right relationship with that phone call. It is a vital relationship to both countries and it is important that the relationship stabilize,\u201d said Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico.   But there is more than rhetoric to fix. Substance and style are also expected to be hurdles. L\u00f3pez Obrador took actions which put stress on the relationship with the US ahead of Biden assuming the presidency. In January, L\u00f3pez Obrador unexpectedly said his country planned to offer Julian Assange political asylum. He also welcomed a British court ruling rejecting a US request to extradite the WikiLeaks founder to the US, \u201cbecause he is a journalist and deserves a chance.\u201d In December, L\u00f3pez Obrador signed a security law placing restrictions on the presence of US drug agents in the country. It was clearly retaliation for the US arresting Mexico\u2019s former defense secretary, Salvador Cienfuegos, in Los Angeles in October and charging him with being tied to drug trafficking. After that arrest he was turned over to Mexican authorities and on his return to the country, the charges were dropped. It was also a decision that could impede the US-Mexico security relationship. \u201cIt was a shot over the bow,\u201d said Sarukhan, adding that AMLO also recently has said he is considering taking action against the US for allegedly fabricating information in the Cienfuegos investigation. \u201cNow, are you trying to use that as a negotiation point with the incoming Biden administration, or is it that you just do not get how the relationship works? That is the question that I have not been able to answer. Like so many things in life it may be a combination of both.\u201d Glad-handing Biden begins foreign diplomacy with the telephone The security aspects of the relationship and the future of Trump\u2019s border wall did not come up in the initial conversation between the two, according to the readouts and sources familiar with the call who added it\u2019s unclear when the more difficult matters will be addressed. But they all agree that those issues cannot be avoided. \u201cThe overarching concern is that the incredibly necessary and strategic intelligence, security and law enforcement relationship between both countries needs to be on sure footing,\u201d Sarukhan said. \u201cI think the administration needs to send that message clearly, that in the aftermath of 9/11 this is not just about drugs, it is about much more in terms of common security writ large.\u201d Immigration is an area where the two leaders are expected to work together. Due to the devastating toll that the coronavirus pandemic has taken on Latin America, thousands of immigrants are headed to the US border. L\u00f3pez Obrador said they are closely watching developments as a migrant caravan moves toward the US from Central America. But getting the two leaders synced up on issues across the board could be a challenge. Biden, who is known for being able to establish close personal relationships with world leaders, will be tasked with developing a personal bond with L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose leadership style does not mirror his. \u201cYou build the relationship because it is so important. Biden is a very good personal politician, as is L\u00f3pez Obrador. They are good schmoozers,\u201d said Richardson, who also added \u201cthere are going to be differences.\u201d The two leaders do not share the same bombastic and transactional governing style and L\u00f3pez Obrador is a populist who built a political brand on his own cult of personality, leading him to bond with Trump. Last fall, when he visited DC, L\u00f3pez Obrador praised Trump for his \u201cunderstanding and respect\u201d despite Trump\u2019s history of deriding Mexicans and attempting to use coercive measures including threatening tariffs and border closures against the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration. L\u00f3pez Obrador has more pressing problems though after announcing on Sunday that he had tested positive for Covid-19. And even the pandemic is an area where the two leaders will have challenge in seeing eye to eye. The two leaders have taken a contrasting approach to crisis which is devastating both nations. Biden has been very clear about the need to wear masks and maintain social distancing whereas L\u00f3pez Obrador has been dismissive of the virus and traveled throughout the country during the pandemic, often times without wearing a mask.",

            "article_content": "In the aftermath of a divisive election, a riot at the US Capitol and the unprecedented final days of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court kept many controversial issues in a holding pattern of sorts, sticking to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 objective of keeping his branch of government out of the political spotlight. But now Trump is an ordinary citizen, the Biden administration is in place and the justices are expected as soon as Monday to begin to act on a mound of lingering issues they have been sitting upon, including abortion and the question of former President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. Some of the disputes are closely linked to Trump, others are cases on the upcoming calendar that might become moot should the Biden administration reverse Trump policies. Stephen Breyer gifted the chance for a liberal successor -- when will he take it? Also, looming as a backdrop, is the possibility that Roberts might once again be tasked with presiding over Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial \u2013 although legal experts differ on the chief justice\u2019s role as it pertains to a proceeding against an ex-president. Finally, there is a new whisper campaign in town, as progressives wonder if Justice Stephen Breyer at 82 years old, might be thinking about retirement as early as this term in order to give Biden the chance to fill the seat with a younger justice. While much has changed in Washington, one thing remains the same: the composition of the court \u2013 thanks to Trump \u2013 is now split 6-3 along ideological lines. There will always be a significant number of unanimous cases, and other instances where strange bedfellows break expectations. But in the cases that most grab the public\u2019s attention down the road, including abortion, immigration, affirmative action and voting rights, the conservatives are likely to unite and treat the Biden administration very differently than they did the Trump administration. Friday morning, the justices held their regular private telephone conference to discuss an impressive array of substantial issues. Monday morning, they will release a list of cases they will take up or reject and also issue at least one opinion. All the way back in October, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers came to the court with an emergency request: they asked the justices to temporarily block a lower court decision that allows Trump\u2019s tax returns to go to the Manhattan district attorney while the legal challenge plays out. Last July, a 7-2 court had rejected broad claims of immunity from a state criminal subpoena seeking his financial documents. The justices sent the case back to the lower courts so that the President\u2019s lawyers could make more targeted objections regarding the scope of the requests. After more losses, Trump returned to the justices who proceeded to say nothing for over three months. Emoluments and the Trump administration Also related to Trump is a First Amendment challenge to his decision in 2017 to block followers on his Twitter account. That case is complicated by the fact that the former President was banned from Twitter in the waning days of his presidency and he is now no longer in office. Other disputes concern accusations that Trump violated provisions of the Constitution that bar the president from receiving an \u201cemolument\u201d or benefit from a foreign or domestic government. It stems from the fact that Trump, unlike other presidents, continued to retain an interest in his businesses and he let those businesses take money from foreign and domestic governments. Critics said his properties could be frequented by officials in order to curry favor with the now-former President. Pending from before Election Day is a request from Republicans in Pennsylvania challenging a state Supreme Court decision that allowed ballots received up to three days after Election Day to be counted. The justices displayed no appetite to review the last election, but the case offers them the opportunity to examine issues that could impact future elections, such as the ability of the US Supreme Court to review state Supreme Court rulings on state constitutions. The justices have been considering a strict abortion law in Mississippi \u2013 blocked by the lower courts \u2013 that bans abortion after 15 weeks that critics say violates almost 50 years of court precedent dating back to Roe v. Wade. Supporters of abortion rights hope the court denies the case but are fearful that Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s elevation could move the court to the right in the area of abortion rights. Another case concerns a Trump-era regulation that restricts family planning clinics that receive federal funds from providing referrals for abortion. On immigration, the court has in front of it a challenge brought by state and local officials against Trump\u2019s regulation issued in August 2019 that makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. Biden's solicitor general will play critical role in early efforts to undo Trump policies Next month, the court is scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump\u2019s border wall as well as his policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States. Biden has already announced reversals in those areas, and it remains to be seen what his Justice Department does in these cases. And as he was sworn in, Biden promised to act quickly to pass executive actions. If past is precedent, critics of the new President could act quickly to attempt to block the policies. Such challenges would eventually make their way back to the high court, a very different court, that reviewed Obama-era programs.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will name a powerhouse lawyer, Elizabeth Prelogar, to serve as acting solicitor general, in an acknowledgment that the office charged with representing the government before the Supreme Court will face an enormous workload both reversing Trump administration legal positions and developing a defense strategy as Biden\u2019s executive actions come under inevitable legal challenge. Under normal circumstances, when an election produces an administration of a different political stripe, the solicitor general plays a key role managing a wave of potential reversals on certain issues. As Biden replaces Donald Trump, however, it could look more like a tsunami. In the short term, for instance, the solicitor general\u2019s office is likely to notify the court of a new position in a blockbuster dispute concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, defending the law rather than seeking to overturn it \u2013 but also in other cases tied to controversial Trump policies, some of which the Biden administration may attempt to rescind before the Supreme Court can rule on them. Under the Trump administration, the solicitor general\u2019s office was particularly aggressive defending a broad array of Trump\u2019s policies in hot button areas such as immigration, religion and abortion, often asking the justices to jump in before an issue had made its way through the lower courts. Biden has yet to put forward his nominee for the permanent job. The solicitor general is the person who traditionally represents the US government in cases at the Supreme Court and regularly jousts with the justices in their majestic red velvet lined chamber \u2013 or, as with current practice, over the telephone. In the interim, Prelogar will be in the forefront. She is a veteran of the Office of Solicitor General having served as an assistant in the office and also worked recently as an adviser to former special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election. Prelogar worked as a former clerk to Judge Merrick Garland, Biden\u2019s nominee for Attorney General, as well as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Biden has yet to nominate a full-time solicitor general, and once that person is confirmed, she will be the principal deputy. \u201cShe\u2019s a spectacular lawyer with impeccable integrity and is ideal for this role in the Department,\u201d said Andrew Goldstein, a former top Mueller team prosecutor. But while moving quickly, the Biden solicitor general\u2019s office also must be careful so as not to irritate justices who expect the government to be an honest broker acting in the long-term interests of the United States, not on the particular whim of one president or another. The court treats government lawyers with special solicitude, but in turn, the justices expect a level of consistency even when an election triggers a change of party in the executive branch. \u201cThe credibility of the office in great measure depends on the idea that judges actually believe that is what you are doing,\u201d Kagan, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s solicitor general before her eventual elevation to the high court, said in 2018. Kagan said the office made clear that its mission was supposed to serve the interest of the United States. \u201cI think changing positions is a really big deal that people should hesitate a long time over, which is not to say it never happens,\u201d she allowed. \u201cIt\u2019s always a sensitive matter when the Solicitor General has to change positions,\u201d Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center said in an interview. \u201cBut Biden\u2019s pick will have no choice but to do so in a number of high-profile cases.\u201d In the case of the Affordable Care for instance, already there are blue and red states lined up on both sides of the issue. But the Trump administration argued that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the entire sprawling law should fall \u2013 leaving the health care of millions in legal limbo. It may only be a symbolic move that won\u2019t change the outcome of the case, but the new solicitor general will likely make clear to the court that the administration believes the signature legislative achievement of Obama\u2019s administration is on solid legal ground. The justices heard arguments on November 10. Because the lawsuit was brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, rather than the Trump administration itself, the Biden Justice Department can change its stance but that wouldn\u2019t result in the case becoming moot. On February 22 the justices are scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump\u2019s border wall. And on March 1 they are scheduled to take on Trump\u2019s policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States. How the Biden administration and court will proceed is an open question. The President on Wednesday ended the national emergency that the Trump administration had used to divert money for the border wall. And it is suspending the program regarding asylum seekers. The next day the court will consider a case concerning the Voting Rights Act. Although not scheduled for oral arguments yet the court has also agreed to hear two cases concerning the Trump administration\u2019s effort to allow states to impose work requirements in their Medicaid programs. \u201cEvery cross-party transition raises these kinds of issues, but this one seems different in two respects,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cFirst, the court has an unusually high number of cases challenging the old administration\u2019s policies on its docket this term, raising the specter that a number of those cases go away if and when the new administration rescinds them. Second, the Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in its litigation posture before the Justices \u2013 whereas the Biden administration may be inclined to move slower on high-profile, hot-button cases.\u201d Along with cases on the docket, the justices are also currently considering whether to take up additional cases linked to Trump \u2013 some of which might become moot after he is no longer in office. Cases that are currently pending concern Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, two cases concerning whether he violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, others concerning restrictions that bar family planning clinics that  receive federal funds from making referrals for abortion as well as petitions related to immigration. And there is an emergency petition arising from Trump\u2019s personal lawyers who are asking the court to block the release of his tax returns to a NY prosecutor. On his first day as president, Biden released several new executive actions and promised more to come. Critics are likely to race to court to try to stop them. \u201cThe Biden administration should take a both/and approach to executive action and legislative priorities,\u201d Wydra said. \u201cThere is a lot of damage from the Trump administration that can and should be addressed immediately through executive action \u2013 on police reform and immigration issues, for example \u2013 while simultaneously pushing Congress for broader and more permanent legislation,\u201d she said. The solicitor general position needs Senate confirmation which often takes some time. If Biden \u2013 perhaps thinking that he might get a Supreme Court appointment in the near term, perhaps from a retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer \u2014 wants to take a page from the Obama/Kagan playbook he could name someone like California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger so as to prepare her for a potential seat on the high court. But Kruger may not want to leave a good job to face a bitter confirmation battle that might in short order lead to another battle for the high court. No less than Chief Justice John Roberts once served as a deputy in the office. At his confirmation hearing in 2005 he spoke of the experience. \u201cI always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, \u2018I speak for my country,\u2019\u201d he said. For legendary Justice Thurgood Marshall, working as solicitor general was the \u201cbest job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On the first morning of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, America has changed utterly, and not at all. Already shredding Donald Trump\u2019s legacy, Biden is demonstrating the vast potential of his office to turn the nation\u2019s direction on a dime. He has watched nine presidents since coming to Washington, and it shows. The new commander in chief quickly reached for familiar levers of power and showed a mastery of the theatrics of his office to supercharge a new political era in the hours after taking his inaugural oath. Every step Biden took on Wednesday \u2013 from worshipping with rival congressional leaders before his swearing-in to an inaugural address that stressed healing, unity and truth through a trip to Arlington National Cemetery with three ex-presidents \u2013 sent a clear message: America is on a new course.   When Biden bowed his head in silent prayer in memory of pandemic victims during his address and spent the day behind a mask, he demonstrated respect for the virus\u2019s dangerous potential never shown by his predecessor. In the process he pointed to the route out of the most serious of what he said were \u201ccascading\u201d national crises that will assail his early months in office. Thanks to a towering pile of executive orders on the Oval Office desk, the US is returning to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and ending a travel ban from some mainly Muslim nations. In the time it took him to write his name, Biden choked off funding for the border wall, which was the single most galvanizing cause of Trumpism. Biden\u2019s swift signatures did not just send a signal around the world that America as its allies have known it for decades was back. They exposed a key weakness of Trump\u2019s presidency: Ill-thought-out executive power grabs to win a headline for a strongman president are easy to undo \u2013 and lack the permanence of legislative triumphs, which the former president had little interest in pursuing. An inauguration like no other: Notable moments of a momentous day All day Wednesday, there was a sense of lightness in the air as political opponents went out of their way to be courteous to one another, perhaps out of respect for Biden\u2019s call for an end to the \u201cuncivil war\u201d of modern politics. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri recalled how former President Barack Obama had sung \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at a memorial service after a South Carolina gun massacre. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called Blunt her \u201cfriend.\u201d Congressional leaders even shared jokes. There was none of the walking on eggshells or fawning before the commander in chief that had been required by Trump\u2019s brittle public persona. His removal from Washington, for a few hours at least, appeared to change the character of the city. Biden\u2019s early events, meanwhile, suggest that the President will now speak to the country in calm, well-measured speeches rather than raging tweets and rambling monologues. In the evening, Biden\u2019s new press secretary, Jen Psaki, delivered a news briefing that broke with recent tradition in that it was not designed solely to provide mic drop moments for Fox News. And Biden vowed to fire anyone who treated co-workers with disrespect \u2013 a code his predecessor would have quickly violated. In essence, Biden\u2019s conduct Wednesday, as he often reflected credit on his subordinates and coaxed the American people to live up to their country\u2019s core values, demonstrated deep respect for the institution of the presidency itself, and a willingness to make his term about something other than himself. Kindness and decency are back. The powerful duality of Kamala Harris' ascent In many ways, the 46th President has returned Washington to its old normal. And Trump\u2019s supporters no doubt will see the restoration of decorum at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a sign the \u201cestablishment\u201d is back in control. Yet the sight of the nation\u2019s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president, Kamala Harris, being sworn in suggested the capital isn\u2019t just back in the hands of its old White establishment. Sixty years ago, an aged Robert Frost recited a poem at the inauguration of a young President John Kennedy. On Wednesday, a young Black woman, 23-year-old national youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman, delivered an ode of stunning rhetorical power to bless the swearing-in of an old President. Her appearance reflected the shifted morality of the White House with its new occupant and previewed a culture of inclusion that honors the unfinished national racial reckoning of last year. By late on a chilly Washington night, it felt like far more than a few hours since Trump had lifted off from Joint Base Andrews as the fading bars of \u201cMy Way\u201d rolled over the closing credits of an aberrant four-year term. States appeal for more coronavirus vaccine doses as the US death toll moves past 400,000 Yet throughout the day there were reminders of the challenges that will decide the fate of Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 underscoring that while he nailed the early optics, reality is a tougher fix. Speeches can\u2019t correct the racial and economic inequality that scars America. A climate crisis is exacerbating drought and wildfires. Trump\u2019s presidency has validated surging White nationalism. Abroad, a new power in the East, China, is challenging American dominance. The eerie silence that greeted Biden\u2019s motorcade as he drove to the White House through empty streets was a reminder of the security net clamped on Washington after Trump incited an insurrection against Congress only two weeks ago. The new President is no fool, and he knows that many even on his own side roll their eyes at his somewhat old-fashioned belief that America is one country \u2013 even as millions of Trump voters believe falsely that he stole the election. \u201cI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy,\u201d he said in his inaugural address. \u201cI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.\u201d But Biden made a compelling case that despite national fractures that are as deep as at any time since the Civil War, the American experiment is strong. Never mind that the country often seems to be heading off in two separate cultural, racial and social directions. \u201cWe can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf we show a little tolerance and humility \u2013 if we\u2019re willing to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes just for a moment.\u201d Those are fine thoughts from a lifetime optimist. But the coming Senate impeachment trial of ex-President Trump will be sure to reopen old wounds. Some of the executive actions Biden took Wednesday on climate and immigration will have already closed off potential Republican votes for his own goals. The new White House will spend the first full day of Biden\u2019s term on Thursday addressing the crushing threat of the pandemic \u2013 after over 4,000 more Americans died as inauguration commemorations took place. While offering the tantalizing promise of a healthy future, Biden delivered a somber warning that the road ahead will be strewn with loss. \u201cWe will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter,\u201d he said, pleading for politics to be finally put aside during the pandemic\u2019s horrible endgame. Biden\u2019s frank talk was another notable break from the approach of his predecessor, who denied the virus was an issue, predicted it would miraculously disappear and undermined his own government\u2019s effort to slow its murderous spread. The plan Biden is proposing \u2013 masking, social distancing and a new push to speed up a disastrously slow vaccine rollout \u2013 will require a concentrated effort by a united country; a metaphor, in a sense, for his entire philosophy and approach to the presidency. \u201cI promise you this: As the Bible says, weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. We will get through this, together,\u201d Biden said. The days to come will show whether the new President\u2019s faith in his country is justified.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden assumed the office intent on healing a deeply fractured country and reversing former President Donald Trump\u2019s divisive legacy. \u201cA cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear, and now arise political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat,\u201d Biden said during his inaugural speech on Wednesday. For the past four years, the Trump administration embraced policies and initiatives targeting immigrants and undermining the nation\u2019s progress on civil rights. All while the President\u2019s own words incited violence and bigotry. Contrary to his predecessor\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric, Biden unveiled a comprehensive plan right away that included a multi-year pathway to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. On his first day in office, nine of the 17 actions he took directly reverse Trump\u2019s policies. Here\u2019s a look at some of the Trump-era policies and actions involving immigration, equality and bigotry that Biden is planning to tackle or that he could decide to alter: Immigrant family separations: The Trump administration announced on April 6, 2017, a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of prosecuting all immigrants who illegally cross the border. It led to the separation of thousands of families, including those with infants, some only a few months old, because children can\u2019t be kept in federal jail with their parents. It sparked protests in the streets and eventually prompted a rare reversal from the President himself. The policy ended in 2018 but officials are still scrambling to fix the problems it caused. Last year, lawyers said they haven\u2019t been able to reach the parents of 545 children from separated families \u2013 and that hundreds of those parents were likely deported without their children. One of Biden\u2019s executive actions undoes Trump\u2019s expansion of immigration enforcement within the US. \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy and the border wall: Migrants have faced insurmountable challenges to claiming asylum and have been required to stay in Mexico in deplorable conditions, waiting for immigration hearings in the US under the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy. The policy, officially known as Migrant Protection Protocols, was implemented in 2019 amid an increase in migrant arrivals at the southern border, with officials arguing that it would deter migrants from making the journey north. Nearly 55,000 migrants, many of whom are from Central America, have been sent back to Mexico, where they have been left to wait for weeks, if not months, in regions deemed dangerous by the US State Department. In another effort to seal the US off from immigrants and refugees, the Trump administration spent billions on building a border wall. The Trump administration took a series of steps to erect additional barriers along the southern border, including declaring a national emergency to access additional funds, filing dozens of lawsuits to acquire private land, and waiving environmental and contracting laws to expedite construction. On Wednesday, Biden\u2019s order halted the construction of the border wall by terminating the national emergency declaration used to fund it. Trump sought to cancel DACA:  The Obama-era program shielding undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation was under legal and political siege. The Trump administration tried ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2017 but the US Supreme Court blocked its attempt last summer. A federal judge ordered authorities to fully restore the program in December, allowing newly eligible immigrants to file new applications. Trump also spent years limiting the number of refugees coming into the country. For the current fiscal year, his administration set the lowest cap the US has seen in decades. Citing the pandemic, the Trump administration enacted what critics described as unnecessary immigration restrictions, including new rules for international students, and blocked thousands of guest worker visas. During his first day in office, Biden fortified DACA. Travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries: In one of his first moves in office, Trump signed the first travel ban, which caused chaos at airports and eventually landed at the Supreme Court. The policy has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the third version of the travel ban after the previous iterations were challenged in court. The current policy restricts entry from 13 countries to varying degrees, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, along with Venezuela and North Korea. The administration has argued that the travel ban was vital for national security and ensures countries meet US security needs, by requiring a certain level of identity management and information-sharing requirements. On Wednesday, Biden reversed the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on passport holders from seven Muslim-majority countries. Trump blasted NFL players protesting: Athletes took a knee, raised a fist or didn\u2019t take to the field while the National Anthem was played before games across the country to draw attention to systematic bias against people of color. Their actions infuriated Trump. He railed against the players, saying they were outraged about \u201csomething that most of them are unable to define\u201d and reiterated his belief that players who don\u2019t stand for the National Anthem should be penalized. The protests began in 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, sat and then knelt before several preseason and regular-season games. He said he did so to protest police shootings of African American men and other social injustices faced by Black people in the United States. Last year, Trump called the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement a \u201csymbol of hate\u201d and described people demonstrating for racial justice as \u201cthugs.\u201d Department of Justice all but abandoned broad police investigations: Former Justice Department lawyers told CNN the wide-ranging investigations and consent decrees that had defined the Obama administration\u2019s approach to police misconduct all but disappeared under Trump. Former US Attorney Jeff Sessions spoke against consent decrees and police investigations, arguing that the cases can lower police morale.  Before Sessions left the department in November 2018, he put in place a memo that required consent agreements to be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to the injuries caused by misconduct and limited the use of court monitors, among other stipulations. Trump banned anti-discrimination workplace training: Federal agencies were directed to identify and cancel contracts and agency spending related to training programs that suggest the US \u201cis an inherently racist or evil country\u201d or \u201cthat any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil.\u201d Trump consistently sided against efforts to reckon with America\u2019s fraught racial past and claimed some of those efforts amount to an erasure of history. A rule meant to combat housing segregation: The Trump administration ended the Obama-era rule known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing in 2020. The rule was enacted in 2015 as a way to bolster the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which outlawed restrictions on selling or renting homes to people based on race. In 1973, Trump and his father were accused in a federal civil rights case of violating those restrictions. The case was eventually settled after Trump attempted to counter-sue. Despite the Fair Housing Act being in effect for decades, many neighborhoods remained segregated, with communities of color less likely to have access to good schools, health care and public programs necessary to help citizens rise out of poverty. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule was considered essential to further level the playing field for underprivileged populations. White supremacist rally in Charlottesville: Trump\u2019s handling of the 2017 deadly White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was widely criticized and seen as dismissive. In a news conference, Trump blamed the violence on both sides of the conflict. He also took days to publicly acknowledge the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed while protesting the White supremacists and neo-Nazis. The President\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, considered quitting and the corporate titans who composed his business advisory council stepped down but the controversy appeared to have had few long-term consequences within the White House. Mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and the Tree of Life synagogue: Many Latinos and immigrants said they were living in fear after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on August 3, 2019, killing 23 people. The shooting was allegedly carried out by a suspect who published a four-page document filled with White supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos, including some phrases Trump had uttered in the past. In a national address days after the shooting, Trump called on the nation to condemn racism and White supremacy. But he stopped short of acknowledging his own divisive and racist rhetoric. A year before, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, an incident considered the deadliest attack ever on Jews in the US. Federal prosecutors filed hate crime charges against the suspect, who previously claimed Jews were helping transport members of migrant caravans from Central America.  The Trump administration described the group of migrants as a national security threat. While Trump denounced the Pittsburgh shooting, the massacre widened a national debate over the President\u2019s divisive rhetoric. Some people, including a local rabbi, said the President\u2019s hateful speech had led to the massacre. The US Capitol insurrection: Convinced that the presidential election had been stolen, Trump-supporting rioters touted themselves as \u201cpatriots\u201d and repeatedly chanted \u201cUSA, USA\u201d while vandalizing the building at the heart of America\u2019s democracy on January 6, the day Congress was meeting to finalize Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. Hours before the insurrection, Trump had addressed a crowd of supporters gathered on the Ellipse near the White House, fanning false allegations of voter fraud and telling them to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol. And we\u2019re gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we\u2019re probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them, because you\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong,\u201d he said. Trump was impeached for a second time because of his role inciting the insurrection. Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism. In his inaugural speech, Biden denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed. \u201cTo overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future America requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: Unity. Unity,\u201d Biden said, speaking from the same platform that had been stormed by armed insurrectionists two weeks ago. He acknowledged that speaking of unity can sound foolish these days, but the struggles the nation faces are not new. \u201cI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality of racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart,\u201d he said, before adding that the better angels of the nation have always prevailed.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Wednesday marks Joe Biden\u2019s first day as US president, but you\u2019re going to hear a lot about his first 100 days as he takes the reins, particularly when it comes to Covid. That gets us to April 30. The list of what Biden hopes to do between now and then, in part: He\u2019s also got a slate of Day One executive orders meant to undo what President Donald Trump has wrought over the past four years, including: Here\u2019s a full list. That will be followed by executive orders on Thursday and Friday regarding Covid and economic support for Americans.   Biden\u2019s also pledged the most diverse Cabinet in history and said it would look like America. Here\u2019s an interactive that shows how he did. Biden will be tackling this enormous to-do list as Congress navigates the impeachment trial of his predecessor (which may or may not feature Chief Justice John Roberts). It\u2019s a lot to get done in 100 days, far less than an NBA season, particularly when you pair it with the fact that the Senate has not confirmed or even scheduled a vote on a single one of Biden\u2019s Cabinet nominees. The first group had their initial hearings on Tuesday. Nobody needs deadlines more than lawmakers, although Congress rarely gets much of anything done before the last possible moment. \u201cAs a veteran of national politics, Biden understands that the most valuable commodity for any new President is time,\u201d writes presidential historian Julian Zelizer, casting back to LBJ\u2019s effort to make the most of his time before politics took over. For LBJ, that meant 1965 and half of 1966 before he expected to lose seats in Congress during the midterm elections. For Biden, in this hyperpartisan era, it almost surely means much less time. He is deeply aware of how Republicans played obstructionist during the entire Barack Obama administration and refused to materially buy into any major piece of legislation, including stimulus, Obamacare and Wall Street revisions, although there were exceptions on stimulus and Wall Street. Obama started his term with a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority in the Senate. Biden starts his with 50. Some unexpected thing will happen. Obama lost that key 60th seat when Teddy Kennedy died and a Republican won the special election. Obamacare has been set during the decade since as the flawed law that had already passed the Senate because it\u2019s impossible to fix things in frozen Washington. The closer analogy for Biden now is 2001, when Republicans turned off Sen. Jim Jeffords, who was unhappy that George W. Bush and his fellow Republicans in Congress were giving short shrift to funding for special education. Jeffords left the GOP in March, well within Bush\u2019s first 100 days, handing control of the Senate to Democrats and foiling Bush\u2019s first-term plans. That\u2019s the difficulty of leading. Biden will have to keep everyone who\u2019s in the Democratic tent on his team and get help from a non-insubstantial group of Republicans, which will require momentum and urgency. Zelizer compares Biden\u2019s 100-day plan with those of other presidents and sees a key difference: Unlike some other famous first 100 days, like FDR\u2019s in 1933, Biden\u2019s plan primarily aims to reverse the direction of policy under his predecessor and stabilize society from the pandemic rather than set out on a fundamentally new path that remakes public policy. Nonetheless, given the circumstances, the plan is extremely ambitious.",

            "article_content": "With just one day left until President-elect Joe Biden takes office, five of his Cabinet nominees faced Senate panels as part of the first step of the confirmation process. Nominees taking part in confirmation hearings on Tuesday include Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Treasury Department; Avril Haines, Biden\u2019s choice to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary designate for the Department of Homeland Security; Antony Blinken to lead to State Department; and Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense. The hearings\u2019 late start means that Biden is on track to take office without key Cabinet members confirmed. Still, aides have told CNN it is possible the Senate moves on Wednesday, after Biden is sworn in, to confirm some of the nominees. Nominees participated in hearings across the halls of Congress on Tuesday. Here are the key takeaways. Biden\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence underscored the need to keep politics out of the US intelligence community \u2013 an apparent attempt to turn the corner after years of tension between Trump and the intelligence community during his time in office. \u201cTo be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power \u2013 even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult,\u201d Haines said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cTo safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever.\u201d Notably, Haines, a former top CIA official and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, was introduced by Dan Coats, Trump\u2019s first director of national intelligence and a former GOP senator. Coats, who repeatedly clashed with Trump over Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, emphasized Haines\u2019 \u201ccommitment to bringing non-politicized truth to power and restoring trust and confidence in the intelligence community and the American public.\u201d Blinken also said during his confirmation hearing that the State Department \u201chas to be\u201d a nonpartisan institution, breaking sharply from his predecessor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has repeatedly engaged in political activity while serving as America\u2019s chief diplomat. Yellen, Biden\u2019s nominee to head the Treasury Department, told lawmakers that if confirmed, her core focus will be on the needs of America\u2019s workers and another coronavirus aid package. \u201cI will be focused from day one on providing support to America\u2019s workers and to small business, putting into effect as quickly and efficiently as I can the relief in the bill that was already passed and then, over time, working for a second package that I think we need to get through these dark times before the vaccination program enables us to go back to life as we knew it,\u201d Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee during her confirmation hearing. Yellen also reaffirmed that Biden eventually \u201cwants to repeal parts of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited the highest income Americans and large companies,\u201d as well as \u201creverse the law\u2019s incentives to offshore operations.\u201d But she added that Biden has been \u201cvery clear\u201d that he does not support a complete repeal of the 2017 tax law. Biden\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security reiterated Biden\u2019s commitment to stop further construction of the wall on the southern border of the US. \u201cPresident-elect Biden is committed to cease funding for further construction of the border wall. I would execute President-elect Biden\u2019s commitment in adherence to the laws that guide us,\u201d Mayorkas said during the hearing. He dodged questions about whether he thinks the physical barriers along the southern border be taken down or removed. That didn\u2019t satisfy Sen. John Hawley, for one, who moved to block Mayorkas\u2019 quick consideration after the hearing due to his border answer. Mayorkas also said the dismantling of existing immigration policies created under Trump will take time. He also told lawmakers that he does not recommend defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cI think President-elect Biden, and people who will be joining his incoming administration have spoken about the fact that there\u2019s a commitment to follow our asylum laws to enforce our asylum laws, and that means to provide humanitarian relief for those individuals who qualify for it onto the law,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cThat cannot be accomplished with just the flick of a switch and turned on and day one(.)\u201d Both Haines and Mayorkas addressed ongoing concerns about domestic terrorism and the spread of conspiracy theories during their hearings \u2013 held in the halls of Congress less than two weeks after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building. Haines said she felt \u201cconcern and obviously empathy\u201d for those working in the Capitol at the time, calling the images \u201cdisturbing.\u201d She also said she would work with the FBI and DHS to produce a public assessment of the threat that QAnon poses to the US. Mayorkas called the threat of domestic extremism \u201cis one of the greatest challenges the Department of Homeland Security confronts, and it has unique capabilities in confronting that challenge.\u201d \u201cIf I should have the honor of being confirmed, I will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror that you felt, your colleagues, staff and everyone present, will not happen again,\u201d Mayorkas said. Later Tuesday afternoon, Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, Biden\u2019s nominee to be Defense Secretary, pledged during his hearing to \u201cfight hard \u2026 to rid our ranks of racists and extremists.\u201d \u201cThe job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies,\u201d Austin said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.\u201d Nearly all of the nominees who participated in Tuesday\u2019s confirmation hearings previewed the Biden administration\u2019s approach to China. Blinken said at his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing Tuesday afternoon that \u201cthere is no doubt\u201d that China \u201cposes the most significant challenge of any nation-state to the United States.\u201d He also bluntly said that Trump was right for taking a tougher approach to China, even though he does not agree with the Trump administration\u2019s tactics. Blinken said the US had to \u201cstart by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness.\u201d Part of that strength, he said, was in working with allies and engagement with international institutions. Austin said during his hearing that he saw China as \u201ca pacing challenge\u201d for the Defense Department. And earlier Tuesday morning, Haines said she supports an \u201caggressive stance\u201d to deal with China \u2013 one that is \u201cmore assertive than where we had been in the Obama-Biden administration.\u201d She called China \u201ca challenge to our security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues\u201d and said the intelligence community\u2019s approach to China \u201chas to evolve.\u201d Yellen told lawmakers that if confirmed, she would not relax the US\u2019 approach on China, promising to take on \u201cChina\u2019s abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\u201d \u201cChina is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving away subsidies to corporations,\u201d she said. Nominees also further detailed how the incoming administration expects to approach Iran. Haines said that while the incoming Biden administration has indicated it would come back to the table with Iran if Tehran came back into compliance with the Iran nuclear agreement, she noted that \u201cfrankly, we\u2019re a long ways from that.\u201d Blinken said the incoming administration has \u201can urgent responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent Iran from acquiring \u2026 (a) weapon or getting close to the capacity to having the fissile material to break out on short notice,\u201d but did not offer specific steps with regard to rejoining the Iran nuclear deal. And Austin said he thinks \u201cIran\u2019s \u2026 behavior continues to be destabilizing.\u201d Blinken and Austin previewed their incoming administration\u2019s approach to Israel. The secretary of state-designate told senators that the incoming administration recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said it would leave the US Embassy in the contested holy city. And both men praised the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to normalize relations between Israel and other countries in the Middle East. Austin further said that he thought the recent agreements between several countries in the region to normalize relations with Israel is \u201ca good thing.\u201d \u201cI think certainly this has put a bit more pressure on Iran and I hope that it will have good effects,\u201d he added. Blinken said that while he applauded the Abraham Accords established during Trump\u2019s tenure in office, it presented an opportunity to \u201ccreate a greater sense of confidence and security in Israel as it considers its relationship with the Palestinians. Because whether we like or not, whether they like or not, it\u2019s not just going away.\u201d Austin told senators he supported the incoming administration\u2019s priority to overturn Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people enlisting in the military. And Blinken said during his hearing that he will swiftly appoint an LGBTQI envoy and will allow embassies to fly the pride flag \u2013 after the Trump administration denied multiple embassies the ability to fly the flag during pride month in 2019. \u201cThis is a matter, I think, of some real urgency,\u201d Blinken said of the envoy position, which was left empty under Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We\u2019ve seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color, that we\u2019ve seen ever. And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the department is going to take on and take on immediately.\u201d Blinken also affirmed that he would repudiate the findings of the \u201cCommission on Unalienable Rights\u201d \u2013 Pompeo\u2019s keystone initiative, which contended in its report that some rights were not worth defending. Rights groups and advocacy organizations feared it would have damaging effects on human rights abroad and the rights of women and LGBTQ people. If Biden\u2019s Cabinet picks are confirmed, they will make history as the most diverse group to ever lead federal agencies.  Four out of five of Biden\u2019s nominees participating in confirmation hearings on Tuesday are breaking ground in that regard. If confirmed, the nominees include the first female director of national intelligence, the first female treasury secretary, the first Hispanic and first immigrant DHS chief and the first Black Pentagon chief. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "After four exhausting years of raging tweets, lies, \u201cfire and fury\u201d rants and orders for far-right extremists to \u201cstand back and stand by,\u201d it\u2019s almost over. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is ending in a riot of division, discord and disgrace that encapsulates the pandemonium of his single term that culminated in him inciting an insurrection against Congress and a legacy that will take years to purge from the American psyche. Trump is expected to unfurl a new list of pardons, including for white-collar criminals and celebrity rappers, in his last full day in office Tuesday that is likely to reflect the self-dealing contempt for justice that was a dominant theme of his tumultuous term. And there are sure to be more political traps for Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration on his way out the door. The very experience of being alive in America will change at noon on Wednesday when the mandate expires of the loudest, most disruptive and erratic commander in chief in history \u2013 who forced himself into every corner of life on his social media feed and constant craving for the spotlight.   Millions of Americans who viewed the twice-impeached Trump\u2019s assaults on decency and the rule of law with shame and alarm will finally be able to breathe easily again, liberated from his strongman\u2019s shadow. Biden will be a President who seeks to unify an internally estranged nation in contrast to Trump\u2019s obsession with ripping at its social, racial and cultural fault lines to cement his power. Trump\u2019s cynical weaponizing of race reemerged on Monday when his White House chose the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to issue a commission report that minimizes slavery and insults the modern civil rights movement. But this is only one view of Trump. The 74 million Americans who voted to reward him with a second term saw him as a leader who voiced their anger at political, business and media elites. Trump channeled their belief that an increasingly diverse and socially liberal nation threatened their values, religion, gun rights and cultural heritage. His exit could trigger volatile political forces among a community that will mourn his White House. The continued devotion of Trump\u2019s loyal base voters means that while Biden can wipe out many of the outgoing President\u2019s policy wins, removing his influence from politics may well be impossible. As he moves into retirement, Trump\u2019s presidency will personify the divides between two halves of a populace \u2013 one largely conservative and rural and the other more liberal, suburban and city-dwelling. The two increasingly lack a common cultural language and definition of patriotism \u2013 and thanks to Trump and the media propagandists who sustained his personality cult, even a common version of truth. Trump's historic 2nd impeachment trial hangs over Biden and Republicans Trump\u2019s political career began with outrageous lies and a conspiracy theory over former President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. It is ending, at least for now, with another even more outrageous one: the false claim that he won an election he clearly lost. Trump\u2019s perpetuating of this alternative reality has caused catastrophic damage to faith in government that is the bedrock of any functioning nation. His shattering of the tradition of peaceful US transfers of power threatens to suffocate Biden\u2019s legitimacy and prolong the nation\u2019s agony at a time of dire crises. After his final White House departure on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s Marine One will fly over miles of iron fencing and troops protecting the US Capitol from a repeat of the mob insurrection he enlisted and inspired. There could not be a better metaphor for his assault on American democracy. Biden\u2019s inaugural celebrations will also be muted by the never worse pandemic that was fueled by presidential neglect. Nearly 400,000 Americans, many whose deaths could have been prevented, are dead on Trump\u2019s watch. Like his election sedition, Trump\u2019s denial over Covid-19 was rooted in an incessant focus on his own political needs rather than his oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency he swore in January 2017. The President\u2019s premature push to reopen the country in the service of his reelection campaign last summer helped spark a murderous second wave of the virus. Future generations will understand his contempt for science through his barely believable public pondering about whether ingesting disinfectant could cure Covid-19. A desire to promote his own interests was also reflected in the outgoing President\u2019s attempts to funnel cash and publicity toward his worldwide real estate and hotel empire. This was highlighted by his abortive effort to host the G7 summit at his struggling Doral golf resort in Florida. In many ways, Trump attitude to the presidency was the exact inverse of President John Kennedy\u2019s inaugural admonishment to his fellow citizens: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d Trumps' snub of Bidens historic in its magnitude In purely political terms, the President leaves office with some achievements that will long outlast his term. He fundamentally remodeled the Supreme Court and the judiciary on conservative lines. He presided over the first criminal justice reform in years. And he managed to avoid being drawn into foreign wars and beefed up US policy toward an increasingly hostile China while putting NATO nations on notice they must spend more in their own defense. At the same time, he trashed America\u2019s reputation among its friends abroad, treated another looming threat \u2013 climate change \u2013 with the same denial he brought to the coronavirus and fawned over autocratic US enemies such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. But perhaps his term will be mostly remembered for his adoption of \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d in midwestern and southern cities hollowed out by globalized free trade policies. Trump powerfully identified a populace badly neglected by Washington politicians of both parties \u2013 as well as an audience for his populist, nationalist politics. But the facts suggest the President\u2019s tax cuts and economic policies in practice did more for corporations and rich cronies that the heartland Americans he championed. His promise to furnish Americans with a \u201cbeautiful\u201d health care plan never materialized. And his immigration policy and southern border wall that Mexico never paid for turned out to be more successful as a demagogic prop than in addressing the causes of undocumented immigration.   Trump\u2019s post-election propagandizing has added a dangerous layer of radicalization to the grievances of his supporters, millions of whom now reject the structures of US government they believe unjustly ejected their leader. Partly because of this, he leaves behind a country that is now as divided as it has been since the Civil War, in which White nationalism is on the march and in which extreme groups like QAnon have infiltrated a shattered Republican Party. How Trump\u2019s voters react to his departure will not only shape the future of the GOP \u2013 a party that has shown itself to live in fear of Trump\u2019s base \u2013 but will have huge implications for American unity in time to come. Biden crafts inaugural address to unify a country in crisis Biden\u2019s inheritance is the most challenging of any new President since Franklin Roosevelt, who took office in the teeth of the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when Nazism was building its totalitarian horror in Europe. Despite Biden\u2019s ambitious goals on issues such as climate, health care and foreign policy, the success of his presidency will likely be judged on his ability to lead America out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and the economic nightmare it created. And every President faces crises that they could never have anticipated. But one thing is for sure \u2013 his White House will be far more conventional, quiet and stable than Trump\u2019s. In fact, America may never see anything quite like the last four years again.",

            "article_content": "Historians face a daunting task when it comes time to assessing Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, during which news often moved at breakneck pace, and the ramifications of his one-term presidency have yet to be determined.   CNN spoke with nine historians who largely agreed that Trump\u2019s final year in office \u2013 mainly, his failure to properly respond to the pandemic and his incitement of a mob of rioters at the US Capitol \u2013 has done more to cement Trump\u2019s legacy than the first three years of his presidency. In addition to his Covid-19 response and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump\u2019s handling of his first impeachment Senate trial, racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans and his challenge to the 2020 election represents his time in office boiled down to a year, they said. Trump has set himself apart for his style of communication, including freewheeling speeches and speaking off the cuff in an informal manner. He threw out personal insults, cursed publicly, and regularly repeated mistruths. He used Twitter to govern and issue directives, appeal directly to his supporters, and spread conspiracies. He amplified the cultural wars, stoked racial divisions, and emboldened right wing extremism. How Trump's most consequential policies have changed America He vilified judges and courts for rulings he disliked, railed against the \u201cdeep state\u201d and worked to undermine US intelligence agencies, attacked his own Cabinet members, and waged war against the oversight of his own administration by firing agency watchdogs. A recent directive from Trump makes it easier to push out career officials from the federal government and replace them with loyal political appointees. \u201cThe Trump legacy is an exhausted, divided, bruised country with strained institutions,\u201d Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian for CNN, said. Jeff Engel, a presidential historian and author of \u201cImpeachment: An American History,\u201d told CNN that he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink that anything that President Trump did this year surprised anyone \u2013 either his supporters, or his detractors, or neutral critics.\u201d \u201cWhat he managed to do over the first three years was to genuinely reveal who he was and everything the last year has just deepened the color palette for that portrait,\u201d Engel said. The coronavirus pandemic, upending all facets of American life, has consumed not only contemporary analysis of Trump, but also has shaped how the 45th President will be perceived long term, Engel said. As of Sunday, Covid-19 had claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 Americans and infected more than 23 million in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIf you had asked me before the pandemic, I probably would have talked a lot about the tax cuts, deregulation, even immigration,\u201d Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN contributor, said. \u201cThe pandemic swept up the country and defined what was going on. And so by definition, everything he has done this year will be elevated beyond anything in the first three years.\u201d Such a health crisis would have challenged any American president, but Trump downplayed the pandemic as it spread, pushed unproven treatments, flouted health recommendations, maligned his government\u2019s health experts and politicized mask-wearing. His government worked expeditiously to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in record time, which is being touted as a remarkable scientific achievement. But Operation Warp Speed has fallen behind meeting expectations in administering doses to Americans. Historians told CNN that the vaccine accomplishment has to be weighed against Trump\u2019s other decisions in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump, Engel said, had an opportunity to rise to the challenge and change the narrative of his presidency, and \u201cone of the things every President needs in order to go down in history as a significant or great president is a great crisis.\u201d Historians also told CNN that Trump\u2019s legacy will be marred by his refusal to concede the 2020 presidential election and advancement of misinformation and distrust in the American electoral process. All that crescendoed to January 6 \u2013 in a violent mob of pro-Trump rioters who breached the US Capitol and demanded that Congress stop its certification of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden. \u201cThose images will endure, have left profound damage on our democratic processes, and will define the Trump era,\u201d said Laura Belmonte, a history professor and dean of Virginia Tech\u2019s College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. Kathryn Brownell, an associate professor at Purdue University, told CNN that January 6 was a \u201cculmination of the ways in which Trump, supported and enabled by many in the Republican Party and in conservative media, has flagrantly flouted laws and norms over the course of his presidency.\u201d The attack on the Capitol, Brownell said, \u201cwith the encouragement and direction of President Trump, was shocking and unprecedented. It revealed the extent to which America\u2019s dark and violent history of white supremacy continues to threaten democracy today, just as it has for centuries \u2013 something that historians have repeatedly highlighted not just in the past week, but over the past five years.\u201d A week later, enraged by the January 6th events and threat to democracy and their lives, the US House voted to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d \u2013 making Trump the first president in US history to be impeached twice. Trump\u2019s first impeachment \u2013 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \u2013 in December 2019 and acquittal by the US Senate in February 2020 may be viewed as a \u201cjust something between commas in a long list of bizarre moments and breaking of norms,\u201d Engel said. Historians say that there\u2019s any numbers of ways that Trump shattered norms of the American presidency and politics, but Belmonte is not convinced much of Trump\u2019s legacy will be terribly enduring. She argued that Trump lacks a signature legislative achievement comparable to Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act or George W. Bush\u2019s No Child Left Behind Act. Presidential historian H.W. Brands told CNN that it\u2019s \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d what Trump\u2019s most lasting legacy will be but that \u201cif Trump had won reelection, then his novelties might have become new standards.\u201d \u201cTrump weakened the confidence of other countries in American leadership, but confidence can be restored. He challenged the legitimacy of elections, but the recent election took place, the votes were counted, and the winner is going to be the next president,\u201d Brands told CNN in an email. History scholar Lindsay Chervinsky, author of \u201cThe Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution,\u201d told CNN that the turnover in Trump\u2019s Cabinet has been \u201cun-paralleled in American history\u201d and is \u201cperhaps one of the most unprecedented things about his presidency.\u201d Johns Hopkins University history professor Martha Jones and others told CNN that the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant children separated from their families, will certainly be revisited and have historians grappling with how it\u2019s possible the policy was permitted. His targeting of legal immigration and birthright citizenship will also be memorable, Jones said. Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, told CNN that a definite lasting impact will be Trump\u2019s reshaping of the federal judiciary and US Supreme Court, by appointing three justices and giving America\u2019s highest bench a 6-3 conservative-liberal majority. And time will tell whether Trump\u2019s most lasting legacy was \u201cthe diminution of American democracy,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s supporters would likely tout his tax cuts, judicial appointments, hardline immigration policies, and economic and trade policies, historians said. Trump backers may also point to his administration\u2019s peace negotiations in the Middle East, his tough stance on China, and his withdrawal of American troops from overseas such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has removed the US from several international organizations and abandoned multilateral treaties including the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal, and the World Health Organization. He insulted the US\u2019 closest allies, while he cozied up to and praised dictators. Trump doesn\u2019t leave behind a \u201cTrump doctrine\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t left a structure in place that could be pointed to later as this is the Trump contribution to America,\u201d said Naftali, who argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d will not survive his administration. As the White House has declared the Trump doctrine to be that \u201cterrorists lose and peace wins,\u201d historians argue that Trump\u2019s foreign policy approach has damaged the US\u2019 global standing. While some of the historians CNN interviewed say that President-elect Joe Biden may be able to repair some of that damage, others such as Chervinsky believe it will take the US \u201cyears and decades to try and restore trust\u201d among its allies. \u201cThe loss of trust both domestically and internationally for the United States, for our institutions and our elections will probably be the most significant legacy, because that kind of thing takes so many decades to get back,\u201d Chervinsky said. \u201cOur international standing has really suffered.\u201d An important part of Trump\u2019s legacy, Zelizer said, is what he revealed about where the Republican Party was in 2020 and his exposure and aggravation of some of the most controversial and sometimes destructive elements of the GOP. Zelizer and others told CNN that as historians weigh Trump\u2019s legacy, they\u2019ll return to the question of how Trump managed to retain solid support within the Republican Party and his base despite his behavior and actions. \u201cEvery time he pushed the envelope on what would\u2019ve been considered normal behavior, not only \u2013 he didn\u2019t pay a price for that politically very often, and indeed that just seemed to make his supporters that more deeply entrenched,\u201d Belmonte told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I think that\u2019s going to take years for historians to piece out. What was the reason that there is this incredibly powerful loyalty to this President, irrespective of what he does?\u201d Historians also believe that Trump\u2019s legacy will be determined by the direction the Republican Party takes once Trump exits the political stage and how the GOP restructures itself. Elections are one way that presidential reputations are defined, Naftali said, and the midterm elections in 2022 and the presidential primaries in the 2024 election could all be indicators of the Trump legacy. The extent to which Trump will matter and remain a political influencer, Naftali told CNN, also depends on \u201chow many young ambitious politicos in this country look to his brand of leadership as a way to gain power. And that\u2019s a legacy that you can\u2019t describe yet.\u201d Already, the potential field of Republican presidential candidates for 2024\u2019s GOP primary is starting to shape up, with some hopefuls angling to inherit Trump\u2019s voter base. \u201cRepublicans are going to help define Trump\u2019s legacy and I can\u2019t predict how that will go,\u201d Naftali said, adding that it depends on the \u201cpolitical success of people who are carrying the Trump banner.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The nation is entering inauguration week with an unnerving police and military presence guarding the vestiges of democracy \u2013 with Americans holding their breath as federal officials warn about threats of violence and potential unrest fueled by President Donald Trump\u2019s corrosive and dangerous lies that the election was stolen from him. Normally the inauguration of a president is a joyful event that brings thousands of people to Washington to celebrate. But with authorities determined to stave off the terrifying scene that unfolded during the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, Washington, DC \u2013 once the crown jewel of democracy admired around the world \u2013 now resembles a police state as authorities try to ensure a peaceful transfer of power when President-elect Joe Biden takes the oath of office on Wednesday. Some 25,000 National Guard troops have been deployed, military vehicles are blocking some of DC\u2019s streets, the National Mall is closed, and tall fences and barricades protect this country\u2019s sacred buildings as movement is restricted. Terrifying scope of Capitol attack becoming clearer as Washington locks down for Biden's inauguration Deep within the fortressed capital city, Trump remained out of public view during his last weekend in power \u2013 unrepentant for the violence he incited and unwilling to abandon the false election claims that have riled up his supporters. In that absence of leadership, Biden tried to get Americans focused on a more hopeful future as his team outlined the first steps he will take in office to try to aid struggling Americans amid the pandemic and fulfill campaign promises on issues like climate change, criminal justice and immigration. But with fewer than four days left in the Trump presidency, the nation remains on edge. In another unsettling sign of the potential threats posed by homemade bombs or explosives \u2013 like the ones planted outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters earlier this month that didn\u2019t go off \u2013 the US Postal Service has removed blue mail collection boxes from certain jurisdictions in 18 states as a security precaution. With America forced into that security state by the actions of a careless and autocratic commander in chief, Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager in the House, argued Sunday morning that Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate should convict the President in the upcoming impeachment trial to make it clear that there are consequences for his actions that led to the siege at the Capitol. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would seriously argue that we should establish a precedent, where every president on the way out the door has two weeks, or three weeks, or four weeks, to try to incite an armed insurrection against the union or organize a coup against the union \u2014 and if it succeeds, he becomes a dictator and if it fails, he\u2019s not subject to impeachment or conviction, because we just want to let bygones be bygones,\u201d the Maryland Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThis was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America. The most dangerous crime by a president ever committed against the United States, and there are Republicans who are recognizing it, as well as Democrats.\u201d Though Democrats have argued that the President presents a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to the nation, Raskin said he did not know when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would transfer the article of impeachment to the Senate, which has been out of session. Biden has said that impeachment will be up to Congress and he has declined to offer his opinion about the upcoming trial in the Senate. But his incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told Tapper on Sunday that it is clear that Trump \u201cdid incite this mob on January 6\u201d and Biden officials remain concerned about the broader threats surrounding this week\u2019s ceremonies \u2013 even though they believe that the Secret Service, with assistance from the National Guard, will \u201ckeep the inauguration itself safe.\u201d Klain noted that Biden decided to run for president after hearing Trump\u2019s remarks following the demonstrations by White supremacists in Charlottesville and the murder of 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer, who was part of a group of counter-protesters opposing the presence of the alt-right groups that day. \u201cThe events of the past few weeks have proven out just how damaged the soul of America has been, and how important it is to restore it. That work starts on Wednesday,\u201d Klain said. In these final days of the Trump presidency, the National Guard presence in Washington is a stronger military footprint than the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined \u2013 a scenario that would have once seemed unthinkable in the nation\u2019s seat of democracy. But Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Saturday the added security was \u201cnecessary and warranted.\u201d \u201cThis is as if we were under attack from a foreign enemy,\u201d Van Hollen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s so sad about it is that it\u2019s an attack on our democracy from within, instigated by the President of the United States.\u201d Trump's 'pro-law enforcement' image crumbles in his final days Many state capitols are also ramping up security to avoid being caught flat-footed as US Capitol Police were on January 6. With the FBI warning last week that \u201carmed protests\u201d are being planned in all 50 states, Michigan State Police, for example, have mobilized personnel from across the state to secure the state Capitol in Lansing in coordination with the FBI and the National Guard. Michigan, in particular, is familiar with the threats posed by armed protesters, who gathered last spring to demonstrate against restrictions related to Covid-19. With demonstrations expected Sunday, a fence has been erected around the state Capitol, and Lansing Mayor Andy Schor asked Michiganders to stay out of the downtown area and avoid engaging \u201cwith demonstrators who come to our city with ill intentions.\u201d The Michigan House and Senate have canceled sessions Tuesday through Thursday because of \u201ccredible threats.\u201d And Airbnb is also reviewing reservations booked around Lansing during inauguration week, saying they will cancel reservations booked by guests associated with violent hate groups. Unwilling to take responsibility for the fear that has rippled across the nation after watching the January 6 attacks, Trump remained out of sight at the White House this weekend \u2013 still stripped of the ability to communicate with his followers via major social media channels like Facebook and Twitter. But in what appeared to be another overtly political move at the 11th hour, his administration tried install a Trump loyalist as the top lawyer at the National Security Agency \u2013 a civil servant job, not a political appointment \u2013 who would be harder to fire after Biden takes office, sources told CNN. Trump's final full week in office ends with the nation in disarray Eschewing the customary handoff between presidents on Inauguration Day, Trump plans to head to Palm Beach, Florida, hours before Biden takes the oath of office. But Trump remains keenly interested in how he will be celebrated when he leaves the White House for the last time, contemplating a departure ceremony that could include a red carpet, a color guard, a military band and even a 21-gun salute, an administration official told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. Trump is also preoccupied in these final days with building a legal team to defend him during his upcoming impeachment trial, as a number of high-profile advisers who defended him the last time he faced a Senate trial make it clear they are not interested in this second round. Though the President\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was seen Saturday at the White House, a Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley tweeted that the President has not yet selected the team that will represent him \u201cfor the disgraceful attack on our Constitution and democracy, known as the \u2018impeachment hoax.\u2019\u201d The President is leaving office with the lowest approval rating of his presidency (34%), according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, and 54% of Americans say he should be removed from office because of his role inciting violence at the Capitol on January 6. The President has resisted calls from his aides to give a final speech recounting the accomplishments of the administration. Instead, Pence \u2013 who will be attending Biden\u2019s inauguration \u2013 continues to be the public-facing leader of the administration, traveling to Naval Air Station Lemoore in California on Saturday to give a speech touting the administration\u2019s national security achievements. \u201cThe American people are grateful,\u201d Pence told sailors as he thanked them for their service on behalf of the Trump administration. \u201cAnd I want to assure you that you have our deepest respects for the selflessness and courage that you personify every day.\u201d The vice president argued that the military is now \u201cmore equipped than ever\u201d and added \u2013 with no irony, even though parts of the nation are currently locked down under heavy guard \u2013 that he was \u201cproud to say, with just a few days left in this administration, this is the first administration in decades not to get America into a new war.\u201d While it has been hard for Biden to capture the nation\u2019s attention after the security breach at the Capitol, Klain penned a memo detailing the executive actions Biden would take on his first day of office to reverse some of the policies of the Trump administration, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding the ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries.   Biden also rolled out his first signature legislative initiative this past week when he announced his $1.9 trillion relief package to mitigate the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic and expand and accelerate the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine across the United States. But Biden\u2019s advisers are concerned that the Senate\u2019s focus on impeachment could draw the Senate\u2019s attention away from critical tasks like confirming members of the President-elect\u2019s national security team and his Cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the Senate to do its constitutional duty, but also to do its constitutional duty to move forward on these appointments \u2013 on the urgent action the country needs,\u201d Klain told Tapper Sunday, noting that the Senate was able to conduct confirmation hearings for nominees during its morning sessions while Trump\u2019s previous impeachment trial was underway. \u201cI hope that the Senate leaders, on a bipartisan basis, find a way to move forward on all their responsibilities.\u201d Klain\u2019s memo about Biden\u2019s upcoming executive actions said the President-elect would sign orders halting evictions and giving relief from student loan payments to those struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden also plans to institute a mask mandate at federal sites and for travel between states. The President-elect has challenged Americans to mask up in his first 100 days in office. Biden also plans to introduce an immigration plan within his first 100 days that would include a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants living in the United States. In late January and early February, he also intends to ask the federal government to devise a system for reuniting children separated from their families at the US-Mexico border and will focus on moving criminal justice reform. On Sunday, Klain highlighted Biden\u2019s plans to streamline the nation\u2019s slow and lurching system for administering the Covid-19 vaccines by speeding up delivery, ensuring an adequate supply of second doses for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and by using the Defense Production Act to, for example, produce syringes that would allow health workers to extract six doses from each vial, instead of five, thereby increasing the vaccine supply by 20%. \u201cWe\u2019re inheriting a huge mess here,\u201d Klain told Tapper. \u201cBut we have a plan to fix it.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump will leave office with the lowest approval rating of his presidency, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, with more Americans than ever in support of removing him from office. A majority, 54%, say Trump ought to be removed from office before January 20 because of his role in the events of January 6, when Trump incited a mob of his supporters to storm the US Capitol \u2013 an unlikely prospect as Vice President Mike Pence has ruled out the use of the 25th Amendment to expel Trump from office and no Senate trial on the impeachment charge passed by the House is likely before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in this week.   That is larger than the share who favored impeaching and removing Trump from office at any point in 2019 or early 2020 as the investigation which led to his first impeachment progressed to a Senate trial. But the wide partisan gap that drove views on that question throughout that process continues now. Nearly all Democrats (93%) favor removing Trump from office before January 20, while just 10% of Republicans feel the same. The survey was in the field as the House voted to impeach Trump for the second time, and there is no significant difference in support for Trump\u2019s removal before versus after the vote. Overall, 34% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the presidency, down from 42% in a pre-election poll and one point below his previous low point in CNN\u2019s polling. Among his own partisans, Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped 14 points since October but remains largely positive with 80% approving. It has held steady in the low single digits among Democrats (3% pre-election, 2% now). Just over a third of Americans (36%) call the January 6 attack on the US Capitol a crisis for American democracy, and another 39% call it a major problem. Views on the significance of the attack are split by party, with most Democrats calling it a crisis (54%), and few Republicans in agreement (20%). The public mostly rejects the baseless conspiracy theory behind the rioting \u2013 that Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to become president: 65% say that he did legitimately win enough votes, but a sizable share (23%) \u2013 and particularly among Republicans (58%) \u2013 believe that conspiracy theory to be true and that there is solid evidence to support it. There is no evidence that the election was illegitimate, nor that there was widespread fraud in the vote count. CNN Poll: Republican Party favorability dips as most want party to move on from Trump The questions raised by the Trump campaign\u2019s legal team and echoed by GOP lawmakers and conservative media in the months since the election appear to have dented Republican confidence in the American election system generally. Fully 75% of Republicans say they have little confidence that US elections reflect the will of the people. Most Americans (55%) say Trump deserves a great deal of blame for the storming of the Capitol. Opinions are split by party, though, with 92% of Democrats placing a great deal of blame on Trump vs. 13% of Republicans. Likewise, the 4 in 10 who say that Republican lawmakers who objected to the results of the 2020 election deserve a great deal of blame is also divided by party (70% among Democrats, 14% among Republicans). There is greater agreement across party lines, however, that the rioters themselves bear significant responsibility for the storming of the US Capitol. Overall, 76% place a great deal of blame on their shoulders, including 88% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans. Far fewer (26%) lay significant blame at the feet of the Capitol Police force. Most say those who rioted at the Capitol have not been penalized enough (63%), and even there, a partisan gap holds. Among Democrats, 85% say the rioters have not faced sufficient punishment, while that drops to 38% among Republicans. Republicans are more likely than others to say they\u2019re not sure whether the rioters have faced enough punishment. Looking back over Trump\u2019s full time in office, 55% consider his term to be more of a failure than a success, while 41% call it successful. A larger number now say Trump\u2019s presidency changed the country (85%) than said so at any prior point in his time in office, but most (55%) say he has changed it for the worse, the first time a majority has said that. Among Democrats, 82% feel he changed it for the worse, while among Republicans, roughly a quarter agree (24%). Trump\u2019s final approval rating lags far behind his immediate predecessor\u2019s (Barack Obama left office with a 60% approval rating in 2017) and ranks among the worst since Gallup began tracking presidential approval regularly in the 1940s. Five of 12 presidents in that time have left office with approval ratings below 40%: Jimmy Carter and Trump each at 34%, Harry Truman at 32%, George W. Bush at 31%, and Richard Nixon at 24% just before resigning. The economy remains the high point for Trump in the eyes of the public: 53% say they approve of the way he handled the economy, the only issue tested for which he earns majority approval. The major crises of his final year in office \u2013 the coronavirus outbreak and race relations \u2013 earn sharply negative reviews. Just 34% approve of how he handled race relations, and 36% of the coronavirus. Approval is similarly low for the signature issue of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for the presidency, immigration. Just 36% approve of how he handled that. Trump\u2019s favorability rating \u2013 a measure of views of him personally rather than of his work as president \u2013 is among the lowest of his political career. Overall, 33% say they have a favorable opinion of Trump, 64% an unfavorable one. He\u2019s been viewed worse just twice since he declared his run for the presidency in June 2015, and both came before he was elected \u2013 in September 2015 and March 2016. Other findings from the same survey suggest that as Trump\u2019s standing has dipped in the eyes of the public, Americans are ready for the Republican Party to shift away from Trump. The GOP\u2019s favorability rating has taken a steep hit since before the election, and around three-quarters of Americans say they want the GOP to move on from Trump rather than continue to treat him as their leader. Views of Pence hold steady overall, but despite the lack of movement in the topline number there has been a partisan shift in views of Pence. Among Republicans, his favorability rating has dipped 12 points compared with an early October survey, while it has climbed 14 points among Democrats over that same time. More have an unfavorable view of first lady Melania Trump now (47%) than at any point since CNN first asked about views of her in February 2016. The methodology and weighting for this poll has been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cellphones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls. The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has largely been defined by his disregard for political norms and his historic two impeachments. Trump purposefully sought to upend conventional domestic and foreign policy, fundamentally altering America\u2019s role in the world. And he disrupted the status quo in Washington, recalibrating the federal government\u2019s role in everyday American life in ways both temporary and for a longer term effect. Trump's last year in office will define his legacy, historians say Some of Trump\u2019s most consequential decisions, such as his judicial appointments, will dictate the ideological make-up of the courts for decades. And the physical reminder of his immigration and border security policies, in the form of a US-Mexico border wall, will likely remain etched into America\u2019s landscape well past his presidency. Other actions, including many issued through the use of executive authority, can be undone through the regulatory process or with the flick of Joe Biden\u2019s pen once he\u2019s president. Still, those actions will have sometimes had a years long impact on American lives, affecting everything from their jobs to their schools to the kinds of lightbulbs they can buy. Here are some of the most significant ways Trump\u2019s policies and actions changed the country: The federal response to the coronavirus pandemic was the Trump administration\u2019s biggest focus during the President\u2019s final year in office \u2013 and its biggest failure. Trump made apparent political calculations that put optics ahead of the health of Americans. He held large rallies in the final months of the election filled with throngs of unmasked crowds as the pandemic was hitting a new peak, he declined to wear a mask or social distance in front of cameras and he publicly downplayed the seriousness of the virus while privately knowing its deadliness. Early on, the White House and the President were heavy on talk, but took little immediate action. The federal government struggled to deliver personal protective equipment and medical supplies to US hospitals and nursing homes. Testing efforts were disorganized. And, though not an official policy, Trump and his allies blatantly disregarded the guidelines his administration touted \u2013 such as wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding travel and avoiding large gatherings. It led to outbreaks among members of the administration (including Trump himself) and supporters. The US currently boasts more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country. The one victory was the quick development of two coronavirus vaccines that were authorized by December. But the rest of the handling on the pandemic was defined by major, and at times arguably fatal, missteps. There\u2019s no good, specific treatment for coronavirus infection and the US efforts to help speed development of new approaches was middle by an early emphasis on drugs that were proven to be completely useless, notably hydroxychloroquine. Prior to the pandemic, the opioid crisis was Trump\u2019s top public health focus. The President declared a public health emergency over the issue and signed Congressional legislation into law that increased funding for the epidemic. However, the efforts have had mixed results. Drug overdose deaths fell slightly in 2018, but there has been a substantial increase in fatal drug overdoses coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump\u2019s immigration policies were always going to be central to his presidency, ever since he announced his candidacy and declared that migrants coming into the US from Mexico were rapists and criminals. The administration rolled out hundreds of executive actions curtailing both legal and illegal immigration to the United States, starting with one of his first actions as President: the travel ban, which has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US. After many legal battles, including some instances where the ban was blocked by courts, the Supreme Court upheld an iteration of the ban in 2018. Some of the Trump administration\u2019s restrictive immigration efforts have been blocked by courts, including an attempt to include an immigration question in the census and end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The Trump administration also separated thousands of families at the US-Mexico border under the controversial \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy and built hundreds of new barriers on the border. Refugee admissions to the US plummeted. And in a pair of White House immigration moves this past spring, the administration suspended much of family-based immigration and a number of guest worker visas through the end of the year, with some exceptions, citing high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Day 1 of his presidency, Biden is expected to quickly issue executive actions undoing Trump\u2019s past immigration orders, reinstating DACA and repealing the travel ban. But ultimately, the administration overhauled the US immigration system to largely bar immigrants from the US through successive changes that will be difficult for Biden to undo. Though Trump has largely leaned on stock market gains, boosted take-home pay and record low unemployment as major highlights of his presidency, his full record on the economy is mixed at best. Many those economic achievements dissipated when the coronavirus hit. Nearly 8 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. The poverty rate jumped to 11.7% in November, up from 9.3% in June. That\u2019s nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s. The rise in the poverty rate has most dramatically increased among Black Americans, the research indicates. The President\u2019s only major legislative victory was signing new, sweeping tax cuts into law. Unemployment numbers in 2019 dropped to their lowest point since 1969, but that was before the coronavirus pandemic upended American businesses and the economy, skyrocketing unemployment claims. Now, more than 10 months into the pandemic, the US jobs market continues to flounder. And there\u2019s mounting evidence that the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the US economy, with about 4 million permanently lost jobs. He also promised to revive the coal industry and failed. And he will have overseen smaller growth in economic output than any of the previous 12 presidents. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have reached record highs during the Trump presidency, even as unemployment increased due to Covid-19, but those market gains have largely been driven by low interest rates set by the Fed. And while Trump can boast a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income, that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts. Trump cast himself as a businessman-turned-politician that would not allow the US to be taken advantage of by the rest of the world. That nationalist mindset manifested itself in several ways, but especially on trade \u2013 impacting the cost of goods from around the world and altering the US labor market. Trump exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership during his first month in office. His administration waged a steel and aluminum tariff war against key US trading partners, causing prices of many products made with the metals to rise. His administration also threatened to issue and, sometimes, followed through with tariffs against a range of European products \u2013 including cars, cheese, wine and whiskey. His administration renegotiated the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico, renaming it USMCA. The administration also struck a trade agreement with China, but after phase one of the deal was agreed upon earlier this year, relations with China were put on ice, largely due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The reasoning behind much of Trump\u2019s trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. But tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for Americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the US declined significantly during the first two years of Trump\u2019s tenure. Trump\u2019s tariffs ultimately levied $80 billion of new taxes on Americans. The President seemed to acknowledge that his trade war hurt farmers, and that to offset their struggles, he celebrated the implementation of subsidizing tactics that ran counter to the anti-socialist principles he said he believes in. The pandemic set off new crises for the industry, including damage to supply chains. Farm bankruptcies before and during the pandemic soared. Despite Trump\u2019s efforts to repatriate US companies\u2019 production to the US, American auto plants closed. And in 2020, major US car companies shifted into survival mode because new car sales entered a steep decline and production halted. Of all the President\u2019s policy legacies, his judiciary appointments promise to be the most enduring: He successfully appointed hundreds of federal judges and three Supreme Court justices, ensuring a strong conservative influence for decades. But Trump\u2019s approach to the Justice Department, a federal agency traditionally understood to work independently from the President, can best be understood by the fact that he has said he sees himself as the country\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. Still, he\u2019s made history as the first US president to be impeached twice. Throughout his presidency, Trump was vocal about his distrust of the Justice Department and fundamentally misunderstood its mission. He refused to accept losing the 2020 presidential election for months, directing a storm of Trump campaign lawsuits that largely failed in court and fomenting so much distrust in the democratic process among his supporters that it led to deadly violence at the US Capitol. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and publicly railed against his successor, Chris Wray. He fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and late last year, his successor, Trump loyalist Bill Barr, resigned less than two months before the end of the presidential term after publicly splitting with the President on several high-profile issues. And the President essentially adopted a pardoning policy that put his friends, former associates and individuals with connections to the administration before other formal petitioners. The Trump administration announced in July 2019 that it was reinstating the federal death penalty. Thirteen federal death row inmates have been executed in the six months since it has been reinstated. Trump faced an arguably unprecedented mountain of lawsuits challenging his policies, his business practices and his own personal behavior. Many of those legal fights will follow him once he\u2019s out of office. Trump\u2019s efforts around education largely revolved around school choice and symbolic efforts appealing to culture war issues. The administration had a few small-term successes on school choice, including the increase in annual fund for charter expansion and allowing 529 savings plans to be used for K-12 education. Adding to those victories, Trump also signed legislation passed in Congress that secured Historically Black Colleges and Universities with permanent funding. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also rolled back two Obama-era policies that were key to the previous administration\u2019s crack down on predatory for-profit colleges. In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida in 2018, Trump established a school safety commission that led to the rescinding of Obama-era guidance meant to address racial disparities in how students are disciplined. Two years after the shooting, the commission rolled out SchoolSafety.gov, a federal clearinghouse of information to help schools. Trump and the White House also proposed arming teachers. On another culture war front, the administration also withdrew Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. And in his final year in office, as Black Americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, Trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the \u201c1776 Commission\u201d to \u201cpromote patriotic education.\u201d But with Trump\u2019s presidency coming to an end, it\u2019s unlikely to have an impact on future US curriculums. The bathroom guidance and executive orders can easily be reversed by Biden. Trump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. He said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed \u201cdraconian\u201d financial burdens on the American people. It\u2019s one of many instances of Trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the US was treated unfairly. Biden has said he plans to have the US rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office. The US is about halfway toward achieving the accord\u2019s goal to cut emissions, but not on track to meet it, according to the New York Times. Besides Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the accord, the Trump administration\u2019s record on energy and the environment was largely headlined by efforts to roll back a slew of environmental protections in favor of perceived economic opportunity. Much like Trump reversed many of Obama\u2019s environmental policy achieved through executive order, Biden is expected to do much the same of Trump\u2019s. The Republican\u2019s administration targeted 50-year-old Clean Air Act protections, carbon emissions caps, methane regulations, energy efficient light bulb requirements, the length of environmental impact studies for infrastructure projects and gas pipelines, animal protections, herbicide limits and limits for auto emissions. They\u2019ve downsized major protected lands and proposed allowing logging in the nation\u2019s largest national forest. In Trump\u2019s final year in office, the administration has pushed forward regulatory changes that would remove penalties for killing birds, loosen water efficiency standards for showerheads, and loosen energy conservation standards for washers and dryers. The US has also opened vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. But Trump has issued a moratorium on offshore drilling in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia and North Carolina. In 2018, the US became the world\u2019s largest oil producer, a feat fueled by the shale boom and Congress\u2019 2015 decision to lift a ban on crude oil exports. The boom allowed Trump to take credit for lowering prices at the pump and encouraging economic expansion. The President has frequently touted that the US has the \u201ccleanest air\u201d and \u201ccleanest water\u201d in the world, but the US ranks 16th in air quality in the world and the US ranks 26th in quality of sanitation and drinking water, according to the Environmental Performance Index. However, one analysis shows that after rising sharply in 2018, US greenhouse gas emissions reversed course and dropped an estimated 2.1% in 2019. But that drop is largely due to drops in coal power generation \u2013 an industry the Trump administration has attempted to revive. Trump\u2019s defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the US to exit foreign wars. And his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the US was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies. He approached foreign relations much like his businesses, leaning on loyalists outside official diplomatic and military channels to push his most controversial efforts while insisting that he alone had the deal making prowess to deliver wins with dictators such as Kim Jong Un. Still, those efforts consistently fell short. While Trump was in office, the United States withdrew troops from Syria, Germany, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump authorized the use of America\u2019s most powerful non-nuclear bomb, killing nearly 100 ISIS fighters in Afghanistan in 2017. He authorized the killing of the terrorist group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 2019. The US and the Taliban signed a historic agreement setting into motion the potential full withdrawal of US forces in Afghanistan. Trump increasingly isolated Iran, pulling the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and ordering the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. His administration brokered Middle East peace agreements and moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The administration also put many of President Barack Obama\u2019s attempts to warm relations with Cuba on ice, with the US recently naming the country a state sponsor of terrorism. His administration also targeted Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime in Venezuela. Despite his repeated calls for the US not to serve as the world\u2019s policemen, he also successfully sought increases to military spending. And when Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law in 2019, he created the the newest military service and the first new service since the US Air Force came into being in 1947 \u2013 the United States Space Force. His administration also repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid. He also went over the heads of military commanders to institute controversial policies, blindsiding the US Joint Chiefs when he announced via Twitter that he would institute a blanket ban prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military. The ban went into effect in 2019, prohibiting transgender people from joining the military. It\u2019s likely to be reversed by the Biden administration. Trump\u2019s style of diplomacy both eschewed the conventions of the US\u2019 preferential treatment of allied nations and its intolerance of dictators. He led a charge to get NATO country members to pay more toward collective defense. He pushed allies to bring Russia back into the fold of the G7. He also attempted to warm relations with North Korea and embraced controversial, often nationalist leaders \u2013 such as Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Poland\u2019s Andrzej Duda. Another hallmark of his foreign policy was his approach to Russia \u2013 namely, his hesitation to single out Russian aggression and, at times, embrace its leader, Vladimir Putin, against his allies\u2019 and advisers\u2019 warnings. He declined to condemn Putin or his government over their role in foreign election interference and spreading misinformation, hacking federal agencies, the poisoning of dissidents, and the reported bounties on the heads of US troops in Afghanistan. Trump\u2019s health care efforts were largely motivated by attempting to undo his predecessor\u2019s landmark law \u2013 the Affordable Care Act. He also implemented a slew of regulations aimed at appeasing his evangelical base, such as religious freedom objections. In apparent efforts to appeal to seniors and his longtime nationalist focus \u2013 fighting for the US not to get \u201cripped off\u201d \u2013 he also pursued policies aimed at price transparency and matching the prescription costs in other countries. The Trump administration did many things to weaken Obamacare \u2013 including cutting the open enrollment period in half to six weeks, slashing the advertising budget by 90% and severely cutting funding for enrollment assistance. Also in 2017, the President eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies. Sign-ups on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, slipped in the first three years of the Trump administration before rising amid the pandemic in 2020. After the President\u2019s tumultuous first year in office, premiums edged down for three years straight and the number of participating insurers grew. Most notably, the administration is supporting a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general who are seeking to overturn the landmark health reform law. They argue that Congress\u2019 reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero invalidated the individual mandate, and the entire law must fall. The challenge is currently before the Supreme Court. The Trump administration released a 44-page blueprint of how the President would reduce drug prices in 2018, but few of the measures have taken effect or made a dent in prices. Some were blocked by courts, including his recent rule to tie Medicare\u2019s reimbursement of certain drugs to their cost in other countries and an attempt a few years ago to require drug makers to include list prices in television ads. The Trump administration also waged a multi-front battle looking to chip away at abortion access throughout the President\u2019s tenure. In 2019, the administration introduced a rule barring federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program, which provides taxpayer funds to health clinics that offer sexual health services, from referring patients for abortions. Trump reinstated and expanded the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, during his tenure. The Trump administration also reversed a directive which ordered that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood Trump frequently celebrated signing a \u201cRight to Try\u201d bill passed by Congress into law, which was aimed at helping terminally ill patients access drug treatments that have not been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The Trump administration sought to remove millions of people from public assistance programs over the last four years, but in many cases, these efforts failed to be finalized before the end of the President\u2019s tenure or failed to hold up in court. Prior to the pandemic, Trump saw poverty decline during his time in office, but as the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to ravage the US, hunger and poverty have surged. In 2019, the US Department of Agriculture proposed three rules that could strip an estimated 3.7 million people of their food stamp benefits. Like its efforts with food stamps, the Trump administration in 2018 also began allowing states to institute work requirements in their Medicaid programs, but federal courts struck down several of the approvals. The Supreme Court agreed last month to review the issue. Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently granted Tennessee\u2019s request to turn its federal Medicaid funding arrangement into a so-called modified block grant. It is the first state to receive such permission to receive a lump sum of federal support in exchange for increased flexibility in administering its Medicaid program and an opportunity to share in any savings with the federal government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also sought to strip protections for transgender Americans seeking housing in federally funded homeless shelters. The department argued that the change would \u201cbetter accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers,\u201d as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender Americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis. The rule has yet to be finalized and Biden will likely seek to keep the existing rule in place. And for years, the administration also fought to implement its controversial \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule \u2013 which would make it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. It was immediately met with pushback, and in December, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the administration, saying the rule has a chilling effect on immigrants who may need to seek medical assistance.

            "article_content": "Jonathan Fahey is resigning as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security official, only weeks after assuming the post. Fahey\u2019s departure is the latest in a string of leadership changes at the Department of Homeland Security, and he is the most recent acting ICE director to step down. Last month, Fahey\u2019s predecessor \u2013 Tony Pham \u2013 departed. Pham had assumed the post last August. Over the last four years, DHS has been encumbered by consistent turnover in leadership. This week, Chad Wolf, who served as acting Homeland Security secretary for 14 months, stepped down amid increasing scrutiny over the validity of his appointment. Wolf told CNN his decision to leave office earlier than planned was due in part to the most recent court case challenging his authority to lead the department. \u201cAs I talked with the attorneys, and we\u2019ve talked with the Department of Justice and others, there was no, there was no light at the end of the tunnel, there was no avenue to really fight this,\u201d he said. As a result, just days from a major security event, the department installed Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor to serve as acting secretary. ICE \u2013 an agency under DHS \u2013 has had six directors under President Donald Trump. The agency has never had a Senate confirmed director during the Trump administration. Fahey, a political appointee, previously served as acting principal legal adviser at the agency, overseeing ICE\u2019s legal portfolio. He took over the acting chief post at ICE on December 31. It\u2019s unclear what prompted Fahey\u2019s departure. An ICE spokesperson said Tae Johnson, the deputy director, will serve as acting director for the time being. In the run-up to the presidential election, the agency fielded criticism for singling out so-called sanctuary cities and signed off on putting up controversial billboards in the key swing state of Pennsylvania about immigration violators.

            "article_content": "The leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \u201cEnrique\u201d Tarrio, was arrested Monday in Washington, DC, for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally. A law enforcement official told CNN that the DC Metropolitan Police Department charged Tarrio, of Miami, with destruction of property related to a banner that was burned on December 12 outside a church in northwest DC. Ex-Proud Boys member on what it's like in the far-right group DC Metropolitan Police Department Public Information Officer Sean Hickman separately told CNN that Tarrio was charged with being in possession of firearm magazines. \u201cHe was charged with Destruction of Property related to an offense that occurred on Saturday, December 12, 2020 in the 900 block of 11th Street, Northwest,\u201d Hickman said. \u201cAt the time of his arrest, he was found to be in possession of two high capacity firearm magazines. He was additionally charged with Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\u201d Tarrio did not return CNN\u2019s calls or texts Monday. He took responsibility for the act last month, writing in a post on the social media website Parler that \u201cagainst the wishes of my attorney I am here today to admit that I am the person responsible for the burning of this sign.\u201d In the same post, Tarrio also dared the police to arrest him, writing: \u201cCome get me if you feel like what I did was wrong. We\u2019ll let the public decide.\u201d Tarrio also took responsibility during a \u201cWarBoys\u201d podcast interview last month, praising himself as \u201cthe person that went ahead and put the lighter to it and engulfed it in flames.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m damn proud I did,\u201d he said. CNN also attempted to reach Tarrio for comment in December after the incident. The sign burning came during a protest in Washington that saw at least four people stabbed and at least 33 arrested. Large groups of protesters and counterprotesters had gathered earlier in the day outside the Supreme Court building and at Freedom Plaza to protest the presidential election results. Videos circulating on social media showed scuffles and small fights had broken out sporadically, but the large gatherings were mostly peaceful. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser released a statement at the time calling for unity. \u201cThis weekend, we saw forces of hate seeking to use destruction and intimidation to tear us apart. We will not let that happen, and continue to stand together strong and United to Love,\u201d Bowser said. A far-right collective, members of the Proud Boys have been seen \u2013 many dressed in black and yellow polo shirts \u2013 at multiple 2020 Trump campaign rallies. Founded in 2016, the group \u200blists among its central tenets a belief in \u201cclosed borders\u201d and the aim of \u201creinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism.\u201d \u200bIn online statements, Proud Boys have claimed they have used violence only in self-defense. But members are often seen carrying firearms and bats and donning protective gear\u200b, and some have been convicted of crimes against anti-fascist protesters. \u200bThe group\u2019s ideology has been labeled \u201cmisogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigration\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.

            "article_content": "Andrew Lu moved to Georgia in 2017. By 2018, he was canvassing for Stacey Abrams\u2019 gubernatorial campaign. The 35-year-old, who was working in Oakland, California, before the move, said he was a registered Republican until his early 20s. But even when he had a change of heart politically, he says he usually didn\u2019t vote. That changed when he came to the East Coast. \u201cSince I\u2019m no longer in California, I can\u2019t hide behind, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a blue state,\u2019\u201d Lu, who grew up in Los Angeles, said. \u201cNow I have to put my words into action.\u201d Trump's tweets and actions put Georgia GOP senators on defense Lu is among the hundreds of thousands of Georgia transplants who experts say have played a part in helping shift the state\u2019s political demographics \u2013 a shift that made the once Red state a political battleground in 2020. Georgia voted for a Democratic president for the first time in nearly 30 years \u2013 but the win was narrow, with President-elect Joe Biden taking the lead with fewer than 13,000 votes. Now another crucial race \u2013 the US Senate runoffs \u2013 is just days away, since none of the Senate candidates received a majority of the vote in November. \u201cNew residents have absolutely played a role, not only in our shifting demographics, but also in what\u2019s possible with our politics, and soon with policy,\u201d says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan voter registration group. \u201cThis influx of people coming into our state from not only across the country but across the globe, has only sort of underscored Georgia as this (cosmopolitan) melting pot, gathering place, in the Deep South.\u201d Georgia ranked as the top fifth state to welcome the most newcomers in 2019, according to a US Census Bureau report. More than 50,000 people came from abroad, while thousands relocated from other states, including Florida, Texas, California and New York. It\u2019s worth pointing out the state\u2019s flip during the Presidential elections is largely credited to Black women and their years-long efforts to register voters and get them to the polls \u2013 efforts backed by community leaders like Abrams and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, among others. Newcomers have been just one part of the equation \u2013 and experts say it\u2019s hard to tell just how big of an influence they\u2019ve had in flipping Georgia. What experts do know however, is that many new residents are more likely to vote blue. \u201cWe know that the strongest Republican voters are people who\u2019ve been in Georgia more than 20 years,\u201d said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia in Athens. \u201cIndividuals who have been in Georgia less time are more likely to be Democratic.\u201d While it\u2019s hard to track down who the newcomers are, Bullock says Georgia\u2019s voter registration rolls offer clues. \u201cWe know that a million new voters registered since 2016,\u201d Bullock said, adding that the number doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all of those new voters were newcomers, but that number likely also includes new residents. About two-thirds of those voters were minorities, he said. Half of them were under 35, Bullock added. Black women helped push Democrats to the finish line in Georgia. Here's how they can do it again \u201cWe know that minority group voters are more Democratic than Republican and that young voters are more likely to be Democratic than Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cSo kind of triangulating on all that we can say, \u2018Okay, the folks who are moving here are bringing not only their furniture with them, but also their partisanship. And a lot of them are bringing Democratic leanings.\u201d People of color, residents ages 18 to 29 and unmarried women made up a significant part of the state\u2019s newcomers over the past decade, according to the New Georgia Project. The majority of newcomers are Black, Ufot, of the New Georgia Project, said. Many are Black Americans, moving back in a reversal of the Great Migration \u2013 a period roughly between the 1920s and 1970s, where many Black people left the South, fleeing racial violence and seeking better job opportunities. \u201cIt is why Black folks in Chicago trace their roots to Mississippi, Black folks in New York and New Jersey trace their roots to the Carolinas and to Georgia,\u201d Ufot said. \u201cNow those people are \u2026 moving back South or their children are, their descendants are.\u201d Others are African and Caribbean immigrants, who recently became US citizens, she said. Georgia teen apologizes for plot to kill Black churchgoers and is sentenced to time in juvenile detention \u201cBut to be clear, it is not just Black voters,\u201d Ufot said. \u201cWe\u2019re also talking about a significant influx of AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) and Latinx Georgians.\u201d With the changes that are taking place, Bullock says the Republican leadership in the state is \u201cbeginning to awaken to the challenges that they\u2019re going to confront.\u201d \u201cThat with the younger voters, these more diverse ethnically voters, the warning signs are out there that if Republicans don\u2019t come up with broader and more encompassing policies, yeah, they may still control the legislature right now \u2026 but their long-term positions are becoming perilous.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some serious re-thinking in the leadership of the GOP in terms of how do they want to present themselves.\u201d In his Southern politics course, Bullock said he no longer divides the region between the Deep South and the Rim South (the peripheral states) for his students, like he used to. \u201cNow, what I tell my students is that that no longer really captures things in terms of partisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we talk about now in my class is the growth South versus the stagnant South.\u201d Early voting in crucial Georgia runoff surpasses 2.5 million Georgia falls in the former category \u2013 one of several states across the Eastern seaboard, plus Texas \u2013 that are growing and attracting more investment. \u201cThe stagnant parts of the South, where people are either leaving or (have) very slow growth, in those areas \u2013 like Alabama, Arkansas, for example \u2013 the Republican party is still growing, as opposed to the Democratic party beginning to stage a comeback,\u201d Bullock said. Much of Georgia\u2019s influx is concentrated in and around the metro Atlanta area \u2013 the state\u2019s liberal hub. A 2019 US Census Bureau report ranked the area as the fourth fastest growing in the nation between 2010 and 2018 \u2013 with more than 660,000 new residents. It\u2019s where Biden\u2019s lead surged in November as votes were tabulated. Transplants are coming for all kinds of reasons. Many, like Lu, move because of job opportunities. But it\u2019s not just work: the state also offers an attractive housing market and a more affordable lifestyle, dissimilar to other populous areas of the country where the cost of living has skyrocketed. Diana Gu, a 29-year-old originally from Florida, has settled into Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward area in Fulton County \u2013 a heavily blue part of the state \u2013 after hopping around different parts of the country for months at a time to conduct botanical and wildlife research. \u201cI wanted to find a full-time job somewhere that was affordable,\u201d she said. \u201cSomewhere that was more diverse, and somewhere that it felt new, but also homey, I guess. And Atlanta fit all those things.\u201d The booming populations are making a difference. \u201cIf you look to see where Democrats are beginning to stage a comeback, well, Virginia is a blue state already,\u201d Bullock said. \u201cFlorida has voted Democrat for president \u2026 three of the last seven elections. North Carolina has a Democratic governor.\u201d Newcomers\u2019 priorities, Ufot said, are often no different than what many long-time residents want as well: safe communities, clear air and water, affordable healthcare, access to quality education and reliable transportation. \u201cI think A, they want the things that everyone else wants for themselves and their families and B, they\u2019re no longer \u2026 interested in any sort of platitudes or excuses about the way things are down here.\u201d \u201cAnd so it\u2019s contributed to a push for accountability from our elected officials.\u201d Gu said she began getting more involved in elections after the state\u2019s \u201cjarring\u201d 2018 gubernatorial race \u2013 which was riddled with allegations of voter suppression after Democratic candidate Abrams lost to Gov. Brian Kemp by about 55,000 votes. \u201cIt was kind of a wake-up call,\u201d Gu said. She estimates that she waited in line about three or four hours to vote back then. She voted again during the Presidential election, and has already cast her ballot for the January senate runoffs. The past year\u2019s harrowing experiences \u2013 everything from the summer\u2019s racial unrest to the devastating Covd-19 pandemic \u2013 are still fresh in her mind and issues she cares deeply about. Biden and Harris to campaign in Georgia in final days before Senate run-offs \u201cThe first thing on my mind would be police brutality,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget what this past year has felt and looked like in terms of going to protests and just what I saw out there.\u201d Young voters like Gu are energized by similar issues, said Helen Butler, the executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, a non-profit that works to register and mobilize voters across the state. Butler, who\u2019s been involved in voter registration efforts for more than two decades, looks at voters based on age demographics, ethnic demographics and gender. She said that the 18 to 35-year-old group \u201cthis time around played a tremendous role in terms of turnout.\u201d These populations now understand how public policy immediately impacts their lives, she said, in everything from criminal justice, to health care, to schooling. And they have been fueled by the raging pandemic and the demonstrations against police killings, she added. \u201cSo I think that really galvanized them to be engaged and really helped change the landscape,\u201d she said. \u201cWere there new people that were involved? Yes, because I know they\u2019re new citizens, especially because we do voter registration and naturalization ceremonies, and you see that they\u2019re so enthused about being able to exercise their right to vote for the first time.\u201d For Lu, the stakes are high. In some cases, his concerns are personal: During his time in Atlanta, he said he grew more passionate about issues like LGBTQ rights, immigration and racial discrimination. He saw first-hand how his wife\u2019s wholesale business was affected by the President\u2019s trade wars. He says he often finds himself enraged reading news about limits placed on certain minorities, who \u201cbasically share a similar story to how my parents got here.\u201d And a former public school student himself, he\u2019s also concerned about having a strong schooling system, something he said he wasn\u2019t confident about during the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s like death by a thousand cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does feel like no matter where you go, there\u2019s an important issue, and the stakes are always high.\u201d It\u2019s that sense of urgency, he said, that drives him to the polls.",

            "article_content": "Sheryl Threadgill-Matthews is paying close attention to how a delay in the release of redistricting data by the US Census Bureau could affect Alabama\u2019s Black community. Last month, the Census Bureau announced that it won\u2019t be delivering data that state lawmakers and redistricting commissions use to redraw legislative districts until the end of September 2021. Threadgill-Matthews is a board member for her local branch of the Alabama New South Coalition, an organization that works to mobilize Black voters in Alabama. Her concerns come as her home state\u2019s neighbor, Georgia, is the center of the national conversation over voting rights after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed SB 202, which voting rights groups have said would target Black residents and other voters of color in the state. \u201cIf this is enacted in Alabama, you can probably come back and cover the story because I\u2019m going to jail,\u201d Threadgill-Matthews told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of going to Georgia to offer (voters) some water because I feel like it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said, referring to a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hand out food or water to people standing in line to vote. Georgia\u2019s SB 202 offers a glimpse into how certain laws can reduce voting accessibility for communities of color across the Southeast, some experts say. It also serves as a warning for what could come next. Many advocates currently have their eyes on the chance for decreased transparency due to the possibility of a shorter redistricting process because of the data delay. \u201cUnfortunately, a pattern we have seen over and over again, is that when incumbents view a community as a threat to their maintenance of political power, they will use their own power to push back against that threat,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School. Redistricting data, originally due at the end of 2020, is late due to complications stemming from the coronavirus pandemic as well as the Trump administration\u2019s push to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted. Census Bureau announces delay in data needed for redistricting This has led the Black and Asian American electorate in Alabama and North Carolina, two of the states at the greatest risk for gerrymandering, per a report by the Brennan Center for Justice, to start sounding the alarm on how they could be impacted in major ways. For Chavi Khanna Koneru, this has everything to do with how much influence the state\u2019s Asian American vote will have. As the executive director of North Carolina Asian Americans Together, she works with organizations to increase the political participation of the state\u2019s AAPI community. \u201cThe time crunch is going to make everyone use that as a justification for having to move faster and not being as transparent. Because the community has grown, it really does impact our ability to have an impact on who gets elected and what that representation looks like.\u201d Threadgill-Matthews worries that the delay in redistricting data will lead to voter apathy in some cases. \u201cQuestions about redistricting and not knowing who\u2019s going to be the representative or what district voters might be in would cause some apathy. When voters get used to representation from one person they are familiar with it\u2019s easy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone got thrown into a district with an unknown candidate or someone that\u2019s been in office that\u2019s not known to us, that may cause some apathy and some low voter turnout.\u201d However, Alabama state Sen. Linda Coleman Madison is hopeful that voter apathy in the Black community will not be an issue, but she said that above all, she wants an accurate count. \u201cI don\u2019t think a delay will cause further voter apathy. We in the Black community are always concerned with gerrymandering, stacking and packing. My district is 32% White and 65% Black,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen lines were redrawn after the last census I picked up areas that were traditionally White and I\u2019ve worked to represent all areas fairly and get to know local leaders. I think people are beginning to look at what the person can bring and their commitment to overall good government.\u201d As in the previous decade, Republicans are set to control the redistricting process in Alabama and North Carolina, something that worries Democrats regarding the implications of how maps could be drawn. Gerrymandering -- explained Threadgill-Matthews worries splitting up congressional districts in Alabama\u2019s \u201cBlack Belt\u201d would lead to vote dilution and disruption in relationships between representatives and constituents that have been years in the making. Black voters in Alabama tend to vote Democratic. And although it hasn\u2019t posed a serious long-term threat to the \u201chegemony of the Republican Party\u201d in the state, there have been repeated concerns with incumbents using \u201cthe mechanisms of rules for how ballots are cast and counted \u2026 and drawing lines in order to diminish the voices of groups they disfavor for whatever reason,\u201d Levitt, the law professor, said. Threadgill-Matthews lives in the state\u2019s 7th Congressional District, which is 62% Black, with 45% of active voters self-reporting as Black in 2020, according to data from the Alabama secretary of state. In 2019, federal trials were held over claims that Alabama\u2019s 2011 congressional redistricting map packed one-third of the state\u2019s African American population into the 7th District, instead of creating two majority African American districts. The current maps remain unchanged and the way in which they will be drawn this time around will greatly impact constituents. \u201cWhen it comes to the questions of redistricting, the linking thread, whether it\u2019s suffrage restriction, or polling place restrictions, or redistricting questions, what they all come down to are questions of democracy, anti-democracy, and anti-democratic tendencies,\u201d said R. Volney Riser, a history professor at the University of West Alabama. \u201cIn American politics, because political partisanship tends to be so closely aligned with race, anything that involves one partisan seeking advantage over another partisan has the potential to introduce race into the equation,\u201d Riser added. In North Carolina, the Asian American and Pacific Islander electorate shares similar concerns over redistricting. Koneru said she has witnessed the rapid increase of the Asian American population in the past decade, which has grown by 154% since 2000. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders accounted for 3.5% of the state\u2019s electorate in the 2020 elections, according to data provided by non-profit APIA Vote. This means that close to 88,000 Asian Americans voted in the 2020 general election, Koneru said. Much of the state\u2019s Asian American population are concentrated in three counties that encompass North Carolina\u2019s primary metro areas. Koneru says that if districts are drawn fairly, Asian Americans have the potential to sizably impact the vote in these areas. Despite the growth in Asian American voters, gerrymandering threatens to reduce the political impact they can have. \u201cWe\u2019re finally in a place where we have a seat at the table, are getting our voices heard. Politicians or elected officials who aren\u2019t happy with that turnout will certainly push for gerrymandered districts,\u201d Koneru said. The Covid-19 pandemic motivated Asian American voters in North Carolina to become more politically engaged to combat the uptick in discrimination, Koneru said. The turnout of the AAPI voting-eligible population in North Carolina in 2020 was 62%, compared to 39% in 2016. \u201cWe talked to a lot of people who were first-time voters, even though they had been registered for a while. It was really about wanting to have their voices heard because discrimination was impacting them economically,\u201d Koneru said. Not everyone believes that these concerns surrounding redistricting are warranted. Patrick Ryan, a spokesperson from the office of state Sen. Phil Berger, president pro tempore of the North Carolina General Assembly, issued a statement on behalf of North Carolina Senate Republicans saying that in 2019, \u201cThe legislature conducted all map-drawing in a committee room fully open to the public, and the computers used to draw the maps were livestreamed for any and all to observe.\u201d The 2019 redrawing of those legislative and congressional districts was ordered by state courts, which found evidence of gerrymandered districts. Democrats picked up two US House seats in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to specifically address anonymous criticisms of a process that hasn\u2019t even begun, and it would seem that those lodging complaints are unaware of the widely praised model employed just two years ago,\u201d he said. North Carolina state Sen. Wiley Nickel, a Democrat, disagrees. \u201cThe issue of fair maps is especially important at a time when Asian Americans are facing increased discrimination and xenophobia across the country because of false COVID-19 related claims.\u201d The 2020 election produced a more conservative state Supreme Court that is likely to influence redistricting this time around, Nickel and others fear. State Sen. Ben Clark has been leading the effort in the Senate\u2019s Democratic caucus to monitor the redistricting process and the census data in North Carolina. \u201cThe delay in receiving census data coupled with the adverse impact of extreme partisan gerrymandering should be of great concern to all North Carolinians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my hope that the condensed timeline will not be used as justification to obscure the redistricting process from engaged citizens who deserve an opportunity to choose their representatives, rather than allowing representatives to \u2018choose their voters.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. While numerous US states are doing everything they can to make voting more difficult and shrink the number of people taking part in elections, New York City has gone the opposite direction and opened the polls to noncitizen legal immigrants. The suffrage is only for local elections, and only for legal permanent residents like green card holders and those protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. But it will instantly up the number of eligible voters in the city by nearly 800,000, according to the estimate CNN\u2019s Kelly Mena cited in her report. In a cosmopolitan city of immigrants, those 800,000 people come from all over. The Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Jamaica and Guyana are the most well-represented countries of birth for immigrants, according to city government data. New York will be the largest US jurisdiction to allow noncitizen voting, but it is not the only one. Cities in Maryland and Vermont, along with San Francisco, also allow it. Arguments for. Supporters argue that noncitizens pay taxes, own businesses and send their kids to public schools, which means they should also have a say in government. Arguments against. Opponents, like outgoing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, argue it will discourage legal permanent residents from pursuing full citizenship. Out of step with GOP-led states. New York\u2019s move is jarring when set against former President Donald Trump\u2019s fearmongering about election fraud, his previous unfounded allegations about undocumented immigrants voting and the new laws in GOP-led states that restrict ballot access. Not part of national voting rights efforts. While Democrats have raised the alarm about GOP efforts to make voting more difficult, they have not coalesced around noncitizen voting. The national standard for voting that Democrats have proposed on Capitol Hill, which remains stalled there, does not include allowing noncitizens to vote. Mena notes that multiple states \u2013 Alabama, Colorado and Florida \u2013 explicitly outlaw noncitizen voting. Far more energy has been spent by Democrats and some Republicans on re-enfranchising felons who serve their time \u2013 something voters have generally supported, such as in Florida. How many people cannot vote? Together, felons and noncitizens represent a fairly large proportion of society \u2013 tens of millions of people \u2013 that is not able to take part in federal and state elections. It\u2019s not easy to figure out exactly how many people live in the US but can\u2019t vote here. The 2020 census notably did not ask whether a person is a US citizen. Here\u2019s one estimate. The political scientist Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout, pegged the US voting-age population at around 258 million in 2020. A smaller population of about 239 million was eligible to vote, according to his calculations. He surmised about 3.3 million people were felons and ineligible to vote depending on state rules. The rest of the 19 million or so people who live in the US aren\u2019t citizens. The proportion of noncitizens varies by state. About 6.8% of the total US population was noncitizen, according to a 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation report. In most states, the noncitizen population is much smaller. But three of the nation\u2019s most populous states \u2013 California, New York and Texas \u2013 are also the only three states with noncitizen populations above 10%. The proportion of immigrants who can vote has grown in recent years. About half of immigrants to the US are now voting-eligible citizens, according to a Pew study in 2020, up from 38% in 2000. It takes about seven years to become a citizen. The US naturalized more than 800,000 people in fiscal year 2021, a rebound after the pandemic caused a dip. Where else is the topic of noncitizens voting an issue? This is not a uniquely American phenomenon. And the US noncitizen population is not as large, proportionally, compared with some other industrialized countries. CNN International reported last week on efforts to enfranchise noncitizens in Germany, where about 14% of the population cannot vote in federal elections like the one recently conducted there. CNN met three activists and politicians determined to change the system and open the door for immigrants and other non-German citizens to vote. In the US, where government is supposed to be \u201cof the people, by the people,\u201d Americans have been arguing about who can vote and how since the country was founded. And it varies from state to state. The voting amendments. As I first noted in 2019, there are not one or two but seven constitutional amendments that deal directly with who gets to vote and how. And a lot of laws have been passed since then, too. What\u2019s below comes from my earlier report: Basically, it took almost 200 years to get from \u201cthe people\u201d to a system that includes citizen men, women and Black voters 18 or older. Noncitizens could actually vote in some states until 1928. Congress didn\u2019t outlaw noncitizens voting in federal elections until 1996. Catch-22 for Puerto Ricans. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, so they can vote in presidential primaries and local elections. But only if they move away from Puerto Rico to the mainland US can they take part in congressional or presidential elections in their new state of residence. Felons voting. States also have vastly different rules when it comes to felons. Voters in Florida overwhelmingly said felons should get the vote back after they\u2019ve paid their debt. In Vermont, felons can vote while they\u2019re in jail. All of this means that our definition of \u201cthe people\u201d is different depending on where you live. And this democracy keeps changing.",

Paul Gosar on Wednesday in reaction to a photoshopped anime video he posted on Twitter in which he is shown killing New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and threatening President Joe Biden. While this is the highest-profile incident involving Gosar \u2013 and one that could cost him his seats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Natural Resources \u2013 it\u2019s FAR from the only time Gosar has drawn negative attention to himself during his decade in Congress. Consider: * Following the white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the summer of 2017, Gosar suggested that the gathering was, in fact, \u201ccreated by the left\u201d and organized by \u201can Obama sympathizer.\u201d  He also suggested that George Soros, the liberal billionaire, had something to do with funding the neo-Nazi rally. \u201cYou know George Soros is one of those people that actually helps back these individuals,\u201d Gosar told Vice News. * The day after Arizona Sen. John McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer, Gosar\u2019s chief of staff sent a text message to a lawyer for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey expressing the congressman\u2019s interest in being appointed to the seat. \u201cTo anyone who uses this as an opportunity to speculate or fan the rumor mill: Washington DC\u2019s obsession with this when there is no issue to be discussed is disgraceful,\u201d said a spokesman for the governor. * When several Democrats announced their plans to bring \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States \u2013 to then-President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 State of the Union speech, Gosar said that he had asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions as well as the Capitol Police to \u201cconsider checking identification .\u2009.\u2009. and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.\u201d * In a 2018 congressional hearing with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, Gosar told the witness: \u201cThis morning I watched \u2013 by the way I\u2019m a dentist. I read body language very well.\u201d * In 2018, six of Gosar\u2019s nine siblings appeared in ads for his Democratic opponent. \u201cPaul\u2019s absolutely not working for his district,\u201d one of his brothers said in the commercial. In response, Gosar offered up this: \u201cThese disgruntled Hillary suppporters (sic) are related by blood to me but like leftists everywhere, they put political ideology before family. Lenin, Mao and Kim Jung (sic) Un would be proud.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! * In September, Gosar, who has been a fierce backer of Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen, called for a re-run of the 2020 presidential election in Arizona. \u201cMy suggestion is that we actually have some hearings and look over this batch and set a new election for Biden and Trump before the end of the year,\u201d he said. There\u2019s more, but you get the idea. While House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has not publicly condemned Gosar\u2019s decision to post the photoshopped video, the Arizona Republican\u2019s penchant for controversy \u2013 and unwillingness to play nice with party leaders \u2013 has cost him in the past. Gosar was passed over for the top spot on the Oversight Committee in June 2020 despite being the committee\u2019s most senior Republican. The same thing happened to Gosar later that year when, despite again being the most senior Republican on the Natural Resources Committee, he was passed over for the top ranking job. At the same time, despite all of that controversy, Gosar has easily beaten back primary challenges. As the Arizona Republic noted in 2018: \u201cTwo years of controversial comments and stinging attack ads from most of his siblings seem to have done little to dent Gosar\u2019s support in Arizona\u2019s most-Republican-leaning district.\u201d In 2020, Gosar won the Republican primary with 63% of the vote against a challenger who said Gosar was not supportive enough of Trump. Could being stripped of his committee assignments \u2013 as seems likely with Democrats in control of the House \u2013 change how district voters see Gosar? Or could it encourage an ambitious Republican to make a primary challenge in 2022 \u2013 arguing that Gosar is no longer able to best serve the district?",

            "article_content": "Kari Lake, the Arizona gubernatorial candidate recently endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has embraced fringe far-right figures in her campaign events, including publicly thanking a Nazi sympathizer for his support and appearing with figures linked to the QAnon conspiracy, a CNN KFile review of her appearances has found. At a campaign event in late August, Lake posed for a photo and video with far-right personalities Ethan Schmidt-Crockett, the founder of the AntiMaskersClub, who harassed a store specializing in wigs for cancer patients this summer because it required customers to wear masks, and Greyson Arnold, a Nazi sympathizer who has a history of making White nationalist, racist, antisemitic and pro-Nazi statements, including once calling Adolf Hitler \u201ca complicated historical figure which many people misunderstand.\u201d \u201cAnti-maskers club here with Kari Lake,\u201d said Schmidt-Crockett alongside Lake and Arnold in the video. \u201cAmerica First,\u201d they each said. After Arnold posted a photo of the trio on Twitter, Lake replied, \u201cIt was a pleasure to meet you, too.\u201d Fact-checking Kari Lake, serial promoter of election lies and early frontrunner in GOP primary for Arizona governor Lake became an early favorite in the GOP primary by embracing the once-fringe extremism now mainstream within the Republican Party, including promoting election lies, doubling down against mask and vaccine mandates, and calling for the imprisonment of Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is also running for governor. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey cannot run again next year because of term limits. The former longtime TV anchor at a Phoenix Fox affiliate station has also earned the endorsement of other far-right conspiracy theorists, including Rep. Paul Gosar, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. In the wake of Trump\u2019s loss to Joe Biden in Arizona last year, the state GOP has censured Republicans who have spoken out against Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, while support for the partisan audit of Maricopa County\u2019s election has become a litmus test for candidates in GOP primaries for governor and Senate. On Wednesday, Lake\u2019s campaign held what it called an \u201celection integrity\u201d rally to commemorate the anniversary of the 2020 election, which she falsely promotes as the \u201cBig Steal\u201d in event flyers. Lake posed for a photo last month with Ron Watkins, a MAGA conspiracy theorist who helped spread and amplify the violent far-right QAnon conspiracy across social media. Watkins, who is running for Congress in Arizona\u2019s 1st Congressional District, wrote in the post, \u201cJust had dinner with Kari Lake, the next Governor of Arizona. She inspires me with her tenacity and willingness to lead the fight to take back Arizona from do-nothing RINOs.\u201d After publication, an attorney for the Lake campaign reached out to CNN and pointed to a statement from Lake denying she had dinner with Watkins, as he had described on Telegram, and saying he was among many she had met at a campaign event. \u201cThere were more than 75 Arizona voters there who showed up to hear me speak about our candidacy. I took photos with many of the people who asked for them. I take dozens of photos with Arizonans each day at campaign events across the state,\u201d Lake said. Timothy La Sota, an attorney for the campaign, added that Lake \u201cdoes not do a background check on everyone she takes a photo with or everyone whose name she ever mentions.\u201d At a Back the Blue campaign event in early October, Lake\u2019s campaign invited right-wing activist Mary Ann Mendoza, who lost her police officer son in a crash involving an undocumented immigrant, to speak. Last year, Mendoza promoted a QAnon-laced conspiracy theory tweet thread that baselessly alleged Jews were plotting to take over the world, causing the Republican National Convention to abruptly drop her from its speaking lineup. Lake also appeared at events with at least two Republicans who have run or are running for Congress and have engaged with the QAnon conspiracy theory, Josh Barnett and Daniel Wood. Barnett, who is running in Arizona\u2019s 6th Congressional District, previously shared numerous QAnon hashtags on his social media platforms (including the innocuous-looking #savethechildren). Although he has since distanced himself from the conspiracy theory, he has become active in pushing for Arizona\u2019s sham election audit. Some Arizona Republicans embrace election conspiracies as they bow to Trump Lake has praised Barnett on social media as \u201can American hero\u201d and \u201cpatriot\u201d who \u201cdeserves so much credit for making sure the debacle election of 2020 was investigated. The forensic audit would not have happened without you.\u201d There was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and the sham audit confirmed that Biden had defeated Trump in Maricopa County. While speaking at a Q&A in October, Lake praised Barnett, who sat in the audience, for assisting with that audit. \u201cWe have some people like Josh, in here, who\u2019s been helping get them rolling in Georgia, Pennsylvania. And this is a real patriot right here. Can Josh stand up? I\u2019m sorry. I have to call you out,\u201d she said. \u201cJosh Barnett is one of the most amazing \u2013 I always say that our grandkids will be toasting him in, in a bar in 50 years as one of the people who helped save the republic.\u201d In May, before she officially launched her gubernatorial bid, Lake also spoke at the same Arizona MAGA conference as Barnett and Wood, a Republican who ran in Arizona\u2019s 3rd Congressional District last year. Wood previously said he has followed QAnon \u201cat times\u201d and that while he\u2019s cautious about the movement, \u201cit has millions of followers who really want our country to succeed.\u201d This story has been updated Monday with a statement from Lake and an attorney for her campaign.",

            "article_content": "Another liberal dream was sacrificed in the cause of saving Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The Democrats ditched paid family leave Wednesday from their vast social safety net program in yet another cave to Senate moderates, dealing a shattering blow to House progressives \u2013 not to mention millions of Americans who must choose between their jobs and caring for newborns or elderly relatives. The latest jolt to the sweeping bill that once drew comparisons with Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal followed the removal of measures on tuition-free community college and climate \u2013 two campaign priorities for Biden last year \u2013 and came as negotiations drag on in increasingly frantic fashion. Senate Democrats working on a Medicaid compromise to cover those in coverage gap through Obamacare plans Desperate for a win before he flies off on a critical foreign trip, Biden plans to visit the House Democratic Caucus meeting on Thursday morning to beseech progressives to pass a parallel bipartisan infrastructure bill they have been holding up as leverage on his spending bill, which set out to transform health care, home care for the sick and elderly, the fight against climate change and to alleviate the plight of working Americans. Biden will provide details of the $1.75 trillion economic and climate package to House Democrats, the White House said. But not all Democrats have signed off on the framework, two people familiar with the plan cautioned to CNN\u2019s Katilan Collins, even though the President believes it\u2019s a consensus all Democrats should be able to support. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, questioned whether there was any point in Biden showing up if he cannot bring a solid framework for the spending plan that the Senate would stick to. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a deal, which is what I am still hearing \u2026 then I am not sure what the President is going to present to us,\u201d Jayapal told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday evening. The Washington state Democrat\u2019s comment was a sign that House progressives are not willing to cave. But it left two fundamental questions that are now critical to the future of Biden\u2019s agenda. First, will the brutal paring down of the social safety net plan, all in an effort to appease two Senate moderates, further undermine support for passing it among the large bloc of House progressives? Theirs are crucial votes in a chamber that Democrats only narrowly control. And will what is now a much-diminished measure so disappoint Democratic base voters and independents that it will fail to have the significant political impact the party needs to stave off a Republican rout in next fall\u2019s midterm elections? One thing is for sure: if progressives don\u2019t eventually come aboard, even if they are dissatisfied with the compromises made to get the package through the Senate, they could inflict huge damage on Biden\u2019s already wobbling presidency. Here's how Democrats want to tax billionaires to pay for their social spending plans The loss of paid family leave was the latest extreme disappointment for liberal Democrats desperate to leverage what could be a short grip on power to fundamentally reshape an economy currently tilted toward the wealthy. Its sudden demise left yet another strong impression that Biden and his Democratic Party are in disarray in Washington after months of failing to move his agenda. And it came on a day when various lawmakers came up with dueling ways to pay for the whole measure, some of which were quickly rejected, that looked a lot like throwing spaghetti on a wall in a desperate bid to pass something \u2013 anything. The jettisoning of family leave was the latest dramatic twist in a bitter and interminable bargaining process mostly between House progressives and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Manchin\u2019s refusal to budge on paid family leave caused extreme frustration among his fellow Democrats. \u201cPeople are pissed he wants to take out paid family leave,\u201d one senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Manchin, however, said that such a fundamental change to US social policy should not be passed in an already huge spending bill lawmakers are now negotiating and hoping to pass through a budget process known as reconciliation. \u201cTo expand social programs when you have trust funds that aren\u2019t solvent \u2013 they\u2019re going insolvent. I can\u2019t explain that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d Manchin told reporters. Joe Manchin has made millions from coal. His ties are now facing examination as Democrats scramble for a climate and economic agreement But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who wrote much of a $3.5 trillion spending plan that now looks likely to end up much nearer Manchin\u2019s $1.5 trillion ceiling, is increasingly disgruntled with his colleagues. \u201cThe problem is with members here who, although they are very few in number, they are a significant minority, think that they have a right to determine what the rest of the Congress should be doing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe minority should not be dictating to the majority.\u201d The news that paid family leave is being taken out of the bill was greeted with dismay by progressive campaigners outside Congress. Molly Day, executive director for Paid Leave for the US, called the news \u201coutrageous and shameful.\u201d \u201cA budget deal that does not include paid leave fails working families and will not allow us to build back better,\u201d Day said in a statement. While most of the Democratic Senate was on board with Biden\u2019s previous, more expansive plans, Manchin and Sinema have extraordinary power since the 50-50 breakdown of the chamber means Biden needs both of their votes. But in the cause of getting them on board, progressives have had to watch as a succession of their priorities have been scrapped, including an effort to roll back ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. A $150 billion program to wean utilities off carbon fuels is also gone. As is the promise for free community college that Biden touted on the campaign trail and is one of his most treasured proposals. Another priority, advanced by Sanders, that includes vision, dental and hearing coverage for Medicare recipients, may also be on the chopping block. Even before the latest negotiations on the spending bill, progressives had watched many of their hopes for Biden\u2019s term disappear. A bipartisan push for police reform in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder fizzled. Several moderate Democrats are balking at changing filibuster rules to pass a voting rights and election overhaul to respond to anti-democratic power grabs in Republican-led states that will make it easier to interfere in elections. Biden also failed in an earlier push to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. These busted dreams do not take into account the fact that Biden\u2019s spending plan \u2013 if it does eventually pass \u2013 will include some of the most significant social and climate reforms in decades. They include free universal pre-school, which could help millions of kids and parents. Expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies and housing subsidies appear likely to survive. As does an extension of a child tax credit that Democrats say lifted millions of people out of poverty \u2013 although a single year of extra funding pales against what progressives wanted. And despite the loss of the green power plan opposed by coal state senator Manchin, $500 billion in climate change spending is included. In essence, progressives will be forced to make a decision faced by political leaders of all stripes for eons: Do they swallow their disappointment about not getting everything they want in order to lock in real if more incremental change? White House prepares to roll out climate actions to help meet Biden's goals, with or without Congress Biden\u2019s excruciating experience trying to steer his agenda into law underscores that while Democrats have a technical majority in both the House and the Senate \u2013 with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 deciding vote \u2013 they do not effectively enjoy a stable governing majority. That\u2019s because the wish list of lawmakers from blue states must pass muster with two senators: Manchin, whose home state overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and Sinema, who is from a purple battleground and has an idiosyncratic and somewhat mysterious approach to legislating. Yet the consequences for not acting on Biden\u2019s agenda \u2013 even if it seems to diminish by the day \u2013 are daunting. If Democrats cannot show their own voters that they are able to wield the power they were granted in 2020 to forge meaningful change, their hopes of a strong turnout from the base in next year\u2019s midterm elections could be dashed. Already, the failure to pass Biden\u2019s priorities has caused a huge headache for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, who is fighting liberal apathy only a year after Biden won his state by 10 points. A fractured agenda would pitch Biden\u2019s administration into a deep political crisis at a time when the President\u2019s approval ratings are ebbing because of a prolonged pandemic, high gas prices, inflation and a surge of undocumented migrants at the border, which all give Republicans ammunition for 2022. Assuming some kind of bill eventually does pass, it will saddle progressives with a paradoxical task of selling to their voters a measure they increasingly appear to disdain. But failing to convince their voters of the historic nature of the measure will risk losing even their narrow majorities in midterm elections next year.",

            "article_content": "Anger is peaking among a wide range of Democrats toward Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema over their resistance to President Joe Biden\u2019s economic agenda, but the Democrats\u2019 struggle to pass Biden\u2019s sweeping plan is rooted in more than the personal idiosyncrasies and electoral calculations of two individual senators. It also illustrates the structural challenge of passing big legislation through a Senate that is more closely and deeply divided than in earlier generations. Compared with most of the 20th century, it has become much more rare since 2000 for either party to accumulate a comfortable Senate majority of 55 seats or more. And yet, even as each party is operating with fewer Senate votes of its own, it has also become more difficult for the majority to win votes from senators in the opposition party for its key initiatives. These two trends have produced a political environment in which the only plausible path for presidents to pass their major priorities is to achieve near- (or even complete) unity in their party. As Manchin and Sinema have demonstrated over the past week, that creates enormous leverage for even a tiny handful of senators to block their party\u2019s program \u2013 a point Biden acknowledged with obvious frustration at his news conference Monday. Something similar happened to Senate Republicans during President Donald Trump\u2019s first year, when dissent from just three GOP senators doomed a broadly supported effort in the party to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In the years ahead, the turmoil evident in the Senate over Biden\u2019s agenda may become more the rule than the exception, as both parties operate with extraordinarily little margin for error \u2013 and even the slightest cracks in the unity of the majority are magnified by the ferocity of lockstep opposition from the minority. Under these pressures, the Senate is simultaneously growing more polarized and more paralyzed. That dynamic has frustrated both sides, but it likely constitutes a greater long-term threat to Democrats, both because they typically try to pass more legislation than Republicans, but also because the core trend driving the polarization \u2013 the increasing alignment of presidential and Senate outcomes in the states \u2013 tends to magnify Republican influence in the chamber. The Democrats\u2019 current Senate majority is the most precarious possible: just 50 senators plus Vice President Kamala Harris as a tiebreaking vote. Such slim Senate majorities have become much more routine in this century than in the past. Since 2001, either party has reached 55 Senate seats only three times: Republicans immediately after President George W. Bush\u2019s reelection in 2004, and Democrats immediately after President Barack Obama\u2019s wins in 2008 and 2012. (The 2009 Democratic-led Senate, with 59 seats immediately after the election, was the only one since 2001 to exceed 55 seats.) By contrast, Democrats reached 55 or more Senate seats in every Senate from 1961 through 1980 but one (the only exception came in 1971); in fact, in six of those 10 Senates, Democrats held at least 61 seats. The elevated margins Democrats enjoyed in the body from the 1960s until 1980 were undermined when the party lost its hold on virtually all of the Southern Senate seats in the region\u2019s post-civil-rights realignment. But even after that advantage vanished, one side or the other still reached the 55-seat threshold seven times from 1981 through 2000. (Democrats did it four times, and Republicans three.) That reflected a more fluid political environment in which enough states could still swing between the parties to allow either side to accumulate a substantial Senate advantage when the national political current shifted in its direction. Even when you take policy arenas where you can imagine [bipartisan] cooperation happening in a lab, place it in our current system or structure of politics and it can\u2019t happen. Most of the ties to parties are negative ties against the other party \u2013 and that\u2019s especially felt keenly on the Republican side, but it\u2019s growing on the Democratic side. Thomas E. Mann, senior fellow, Brookings Institution That\u2019s much less true today. Fewer seats seem genuinely at play because of the tightening relationship between the results in presidential and Senate contests. It has become increasingly difficult for candidates in either party to win Senate seats in states that usually vote the other way for president. In 2016, for the first time ever, every Senate race went the same way as the presidential contest in that same state; in 2020, the same thing happened, except in Maine, where Republican Sen. Susan Collins won in a state that Biden comfortably carried. If anything, 2020 surpassed 2016 in underscoring the link between presidential and Senate outcomes: Democrats poured unprecedented sums of money into Senate challenges in North Carolina, Iowa, South Carolina, Montana and Kansas, among other states, but when Biden failed to carry any of them, their Senate candidates failed too. The Senate seats Democrats did gain in 2020 came in states that Biden also won: Arizona and Georgia. After that stark outcome, Democrats now hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Biden; Republicans, in mirror image, hold 47 of the 50 Senate seats in the 25 states that voted for Trump. Pulling back the lens only sharpens the picture. In the six presidential elections since 2000, 26 states have voted Republican a majority of the time: The GOP now holds 45 of their 52 Senate seats. Over that same period, 23 states have voted mostly for Democrats: The party now holds 43 of their 46 Senate seats. Iowa, the final state, has split 3-3 in presidential races since then (while shifting sharply toward the GOP in the past two): Republicans hold both of its Senate seats. This hardening underlying dynamic makes it difficult for either party to amass a comfortable Senate majority. Since \u201cthe Senate outcomes now line up with the presidential outcomes\u201d and about half the states lean toward each party in presidential contests, \u201cyou get a pretty even balance in the Senate in the same way,\u201d says Gary C. Jacobson, a University of California at San Diego political scientist who specializes in Congress. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to break out of that parity because there have not been a lot of Senate candidates who have shown the ability to win across party lines.\u201d The same correlation of presidential and Senate outcomes that makes it more likely that each party can scratch out only a narrow Senate majority also makes it less likely the majority party can attract enough support from the minority to reach the 60 votes required to break a filibuster. One implication of this alignment is that the vast majority of senators are sent to Washington by voters who also supported presidential candidates from their same parties. That creates enormous electoral pressure on Democratic senators to vote with a Democratic president and against a Republican one, and vice versa for GOP senators. The pressure is especially acute in this modern era, when any president faces overwhelmingly negative job approval ratings from voters on the other side. Why Kyrsten Sinema's tactics may backfire The force of that \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d says Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and longtime student of Congress, makes it almost impossible for senators to support initiatives from a president of the other party. \u201cEven when you take policy arenas where you can imagine [bipartisan] cooperation happening in a lab, place it in our current system or structure of politics and it can\u2019t happen,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the ties to parties are negative ties against the other party \u2013 and that\u2019s especially felt keenly on the Republican side, but it\u2019s growing on the Democratic side.\u201d Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, is in some ways a throwback to the earlier era when more senators (and House members) represented \u201csplit ticket\u201d constituencies that usually vote for the other party\u2019s presidential nominees (Trump won West Virginia by almost 40 percentage points in 2020). From the 1970s through the 1990s, those senators \u2013 southern Democrats like John Breaux or Sam Nunn, coastal Republicans like Bob Packwood or Jacob Javits \u2013 were often the Senate\u2019s most enthusiastic deal-makers, largely because they recognized it was in their interests to tamp down partisan hostilities. Sinema of Arizona, a Democrat representing a state that had supported Republicans for president almost entirely from 1952 through 2016, seems to envision a similar role. But, in fact, the maneuvering of Manchin and Sinema in the current budget fight actually shows how much Congress has changed since that earlier era \u2013 and why the role they are claiming is so diminished. In their heyday, the \u201csplit ticket\u201d legislators of the earlier era represented a large enough share of the Senate to build meaningful bipartisan coalitions on a regular basis. \u201cI used to have a coalition of about 10 people from both sides of the aisle that we could work with,\u201d Breaux told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t have that anymore \u2013 on both sides. The moderates are in the minority on both sides of the aisle, and that\u2019s why you are seeing the [conflict] we are seeing right now.\u201d Sinema and Manchin were able to help forge the bipartisan infrastructure deal. But that agreement, on an inherently less ideological issue, looks very much like the exception. Neither senator is suggesting that any changes they are proposing to the reconciliation bill would convince any Republicans to vote for it. No Republican senator has publicly endorsed the voting rights legislation that Manchin renegotiated with his Democratic colleagues; several of his most obvious targets, to the contrary, have already signaled their opposition. Nor did enough Republicans heed his plea to support an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Democrats likewise have been unable to attract 10 Republicans on other potential areas of agreement, including gun control, a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants and police reform. That leaves Manchin and Sinema in a very different situation from the earlier deal-makers like Breaux or Nunn. That older generation could, at times, advance a positive agenda that built a majority coalition across party lines; the influence wielded by Manchin and Sinema is now almost entirely negative. They can block their own party\u2019s ideas, but on virtually all issues they can\u2019t create the bipartisan alternative they claim to seek. \u201cThere is no one to deal with on the Republican side of the aisle; it just can\u2019t be done now,\u201d says Mann. \u201cSo all Manchin and Sinema can do is negative,\u201d by forcing Democrats to scale back their plans. Jacobson notes that the narrow Senate majorities discourage compromise in another respect: Because the minority party is now almost always close enough that it can envision regaining control in the next election, it has even less incentive to cooperate in legislative achievements that could buttress the majority. When \u201ccontrol is at stake in every election,\u201d he says, \u201cthat makes for intransigence, posturing and inability to compromise.\u201d The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Both parties have been affected by a Senate that is closely and deeply divided. Every Republican did vote together to pass Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017 (over the opposition of every Democrat) while the GOP held only 51 Senate seats. But a revolt that same year from just three Republican senators, combined with resistance again from every Democrat, blocked the GOP from repealing the Affordable Care Act, though the vast majority of Republicans in both chambers supported the repeal. But on balance these new patterns probably present a greater challenge to Democrats, for several reasons. One is that they have a much broader legislative agenda than Republicans, whose priorities are centered on two goals \u2013 cutting taxes and appointing federal judges and Supreme Court justices \u2013 that under existing Senate rules can already be passed with simple majority votes. (Taxes can be cut through the reconciliation process and judicial appointments are exempt from the filibuster.) As long as the filibuster remains in place, a bigger share of the Democratic legislative wish list \u2013 everything from immigration to gun control and voting rights \u2013 requires 60 votes. Representing a more diverse electoral coalition, Democrats are also dealing with a broader ideological range among their senators than the GOP. While moderates constitute a very small share of the GOP caucus compared with conservatives, left and center are more closely divided on the Democratic side \u2013 a dynamic Manchin pointedly underscored last week when he told those advocating for a larger reconciliation package to simply \u201celect more liberals.\u201d But that\u2019s easier said than done. The final problem for Democrats is that the ceiling for the number of Senate seats they can win under normal circumstances \u2013 with centrist or liberal candidates \u2013 is probably slightly lower than for Republicans. Even though Democrats have won the popular vote in five of the six presidential elections since 2000, Republicans, as noted, have won slightly more states a majority of the time during that period \u2013 which gives them a small but significant edge in the battle for Senate control. Moreover, in 2022, Republicans can reasonably expect to competitively challenge Democratic incumbents in at least four Biden states from 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. In Trump states holding Senate elections, Democrats are likely to be competitive in the North Carolina open seat and might be able to contest Ohio and Florida \u2013 but their best chance for gains is further consolidating their grip on the Biden states by winning seats the GOP now holds in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. To many observers, those limited opportunities underscore the need for Democrats to improve their competitive positive in at least a few more states. It\u2019s telling that the Senate seats they flipped in 2020 came not in states they had bombarded with late television advertising, but in Arizona and Georgia \u2013 states where they had invested for years in grassroots organizing that also lifted Biden to victory. North Carolina is a plausible next target for Democrats to add a Senate seat in 2022 with that strategy, but after that the options, particularly Florida and Texas in the Sun Belt or Ohio and Iowa in the Rust Belt, look more daunting. The other implication of these dynamics for Democrats is the increasing pressure in the party to end the filibuster so that they can govern during the periods when they squeeze out a narrow Senate majority. \u201cThere\u2019s no real room to build coalitions that give really any chance of overcoming a routine requirement of 60 votes to get anything done,\u201d notes Mann. What Manchin and Sinema can learn from the Lincoln Republicans on voting rights Even Breaux, a centrist who built his Senate career on finding deals with Republicans, thinks Democrats need to end the filibuster for what he calls \u201cconstitutional issues\u201d such as voting and abortion rights. The filibuster, he says, can encourage cooperation \u201cwhen you have an aggressive middle on both sides, and you don\u2019t have that now.\u201d As a result, he believes \u201cin getting rid of [the filibuster] for constitutional issues, like voting rights. We\u2019ve done it for the Supreme Court and federal judges, so I guess you could do a limited carve-out for constitutional issues. That at least would help get some things done.\u201d One final ingredient makes the operation of the modern Senate even more combustible. Because Republicans now so thoroughly dominate the less-populated, heavily rural, predominantly White states across the Plains and Mountain West, the GOP can exercise enormous power in the Senate even while representing many fewer people than Democrats do. If you assign half of each state\u2019s population to each senator, Democrats now represent 56% of the country and Republicans 44% \u2013 even though each side holds 50 Senate seats. As population continues to concentrate in the largest states, this partisan imbalance will likely widen. Without a change in the filibuster, that would allow states representing an ever-shrinking share of the national population to block legislative action supported by senators representing a clear majority of the country. \u201cThe dynamic is that a smaller and smaller segment of the American electorate will control more and more seats in the Senate,\u201d says Mann. \u201cSo that there will be, in my view, a distortion that is so great it puts into question the entire legitimacy of the Senate as a governing body.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong election year in a discussion of upcoming Senate races. They will take place in 2022.",

            "article_content": "Democrats were already attempting the near impossible with Joe Biden\u2019s presidential agenda in peril. But a string of recent setbacks is making it even more crucial \u2013 and difficult \u2013 to pass his legacy-defining agenda. Biden spent Wednesday urgently trying to mend splits between moderate and progressive Democrats that threaten to topple his foundational $3.5 trillion spending bill and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package within days. His efforts at classic Oval Office cajoling took place under extreme political pressure at a moment that will prove whether the President\u2019s party has the capacity to fully use the power it won in 2020. Minute majorities in the House and the Senate were always going to make it tough to live up to the soaring expectations of Biden\u2019s election win. Then the Senate Republicans\u2019 use of the filibuster forced Democratic leaders to cram almost all of his popular goals on health care, education, climate change and expanding the social safety net into one massive bill that could pass on a majority vote. The downside: If the monster spending plan fails it could take down much of Biden\u2019s legacy in one crushing collapse. Now a grim end to summer is turning into a defining political period for Democrats. Setbacks just on Wednesday included the failure of bipartisan police reform to new controversy over Biden\u2019s rocky exit from Afghanistan and fury among progressives over the administration\u2019s handling of a humanitarian crisis at the southern border. Earlier this week, the Senate parliamentarian ruled out inserting a path out of the shadows for undocumented migrants in Biden\u2019s spending plan, the conservative Supreme Court is quickly eroding the right to an abortion, there is no path for voting rights reform and midterm elections next year are shortening the legislative clock. All of this makes it even more vital that Biden scores a big success in the crucial weeks to come \u2013 a factor that is piling even more strain on the fault lines inside the Democratic Party. The current Capitol Hill showdown is often characterized as an ideological disconnect between obstinate moderates like West Virginia\u2019s Sen. Joe Manchin and progressives fighting alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But while a successful resolution to the high-stakes impasse would require both veterans and others to move off their positions, the situation is far more complicated and reflects the reality of a divided Democratic Party and nation. Plenty of commentators compared Biden\u2019s expansive social agenda to the New Deal reforms of Franklin Roosevelt in 1930s and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society programs in the 1960s. And while coalition building was sometimes complicated even in eras when ideological lines inside parties were not as rigid, both generally could rely on solid congressional majorities. Biden cannot, meaning that a successful outcome of the current intra-Democratic Party struggle over his agenda would be a huge achievement by itself. While there is no margin for error offered by small House and Senate majorities, the Democratic Party now spans a vast ideological divide \u2013 making it tougher to build the near 100% coalitions Biden needs and giving a few lawmakers at the pivot points great power. The moderate Manchin, for instance, might be holding the fate of the presidency in his hands and drive progressives to distraction. But if it wasn\u2019t for his reelection win in 2018 in a state where ex-President Donald Trump romped to victory twice, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell would be running the Senate. In some ways, Democrats have only themselves to blame. While upset wins in Senate run-off elections in Georgia secured the 50-50 balance that gives Vice President Kamala Harris a deciding vote, Democrats were disappointed with their performances elsewhere last year. Had they managed to capture reachable seats in purple states like Maine and North Carolina, it wouldn\u2019t really matter what Manchin thought about the size of a spending package that he senses is coming in too big and too soon. As it stands, Biden can only lose three votes in the House \u2013 and none in the Senate. And the President on whom Democratic leaders are relying to bring the party together is a little dinged up politically after a brutal August, and so might not have quite the same supply of political capital to spend as was once the case. That prevailing political environment might make a case for incremental, moderate change. But one lesson of recent years in Washington is that power can be fleeting with a split and ornery electorate stuck perpetually in a throw-the-bums-out mood. So, it makes sense for a party in power to attempt the most significant reform possible in the hope their triumphs endure. The repeated failure of Republicans to eradicate the Affordable Care Act despite their own congressional majorities shows how effective this strategy can be. But going big brings its own conundrum: Is the party trying to do too much with tiny majorities and, by going for broke, does it risk fracturing its own political conditions and achieving almost nothing? Biden\u2019s audiences with moderate and progressive lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday underscored how he has a foot in both camps. A shrewd presidential primary and general election strategy in 2020 allowed him to maximize the breadth of his support. He came across as having the temperament of a moderate but was still able to get more buy-in from his defeated rival Sanders and the left of the party than 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton managed. But the bill for that strategy may now be coming due, with little sign that either wing of the party is in the mood for the compromise that Biden and his legacy needs. Moderates like Manchin, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and other less vocal lawmakers fear that the $3.5 trillion spending bill will alienate their more conservative electorates, think it\u2019s too big and question its content. Some moderates in the House fear this price tag will cost them their seats in 2022 with Republicans favored to win back control and relishing a classic spending-focused campaign assault against Democrats. But progressives say they will refuse to back Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill with Republicans \u2013 another central plank of his presidency \u2013 unless the spending bill passes too. If one half of this complex legislative maneuver Democratic leaders are using to bring the party fails, the whole edifice could crumble. That prospect prompted veteran Democratic operative and climate change campaigner John Podesta to speak out on Wednesday. \u201cIf Democrats care about our nation\u2019s future and well-being, this is the legislative package we need. No excuses. This is it,\u201d Podesta wrote in a memo. The former senior White House aide for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama urged progressives not to dig in on the spending bill or moderates to think they could get everything. \u201cWe will not secure the full $3.5 trillion investment. It\u2019s time for Democrats to unite in finding the path forward. Similarly, to those Democrats who only favor the bipartisan infrastructure bill, know this: you are either getting both bills or neither \u2013 and the prospect of neither is unconscionable. \u201c This tense political moment is breeding real animosity Some progressives have angrily rounded on Manchin. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York accused him, for example, of holding weekly huddles with Exxon to get his instructions on oil and gas policy \u2013 an accusation that the West Virginian branded as false. It\u2019s true, however, that Manchin has long been an advocate for his state\u2019s coal industry, and that\u2019s one reason he may balk at climate provisions in the spending bill. Washington operatives, fellow lawmakers and reporters have spent years trying to work out what makes Manchin tick. One theory is that it\u2019s all political. His intentions for his 2024 reelection race are not known \u2013 but if he has future ambitions, he cannot afford to ignore the people of a state that has transformed into a GOP bastion during his career. And few politicians know their patch as well as he does, fueling a counter impression that Manchin is not just relishing his chance to wield huge power \u2013 he\u2019s actually serving his electorate in the way that they want. \u201cMy guess is there aren\u2019t too many people in the state who have not been touched by Joe Manchin on one way or the other,\u201d said John Kilwein, a professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cThis is a very small state, rural, retail politics kind of state. He is Joe from Farmington, he knows every part of the state.\u201d And with 2024 in mind, the Democratic leadership knows that without Manchin, they could take another seat off the table right now. \u201cIf you took a brand-new Joe Manchin and gave him a different name there is no way he can get elected right now,\u201d said Kilwein. But progressives also feel burning urgency. While not a dominant voice in the party, the progressive caucus has growing weight and power, especially in the House. And the events of recent weeks have been demoralizing for the group, fueling its desire to grab a huge win now. While Democrats control Washington, conservative power is running rampant across the country, as underscored by the Supreme Court\u2019s enabling of the controversial Texas abortion law. A chance at bipartisan congressional police reform, which grew out of the Black Lives Matter Movement and the murder of George Floyd, just foundered. And the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s ruling put yet another delay on a permanent legislative fix for undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children. If the $3.5 trillion bill fails or is significantly curtailed, it would be hard for left-wing Democrats to return to their constituents next year and say they delivered. That is why progressives say they are ready to trash the infrastructure bill if they don\u2019t get their spending package. But it\u2019s a hardball tactic that could bring both measures down. Referring to expectations that progressives would cave rather than destroy Biden\u2019s agenda and legacy, Washington state Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Monday: \u201cThey can take that bet if they want.\u201d In most periods of American political history, it would be a no-brainer for rival Democrats to come together in support of their president given the huge stakes for his administration and their constituents. But the ideological dynamics inside their party are so uncertain, and the margins for error are so small that no one can be certain that will happen. That is the magnitude of Biden\u2019s challenge.",

            "article_content": "If California Gov. Gavin Newsom is able to keep his job and avoid a recall later this month, he could have Latino voters to thank for it. A mix of Democratic campaigns, super PACs and organizations throughout the predominantly blue state have been working for weeks to turnout Latino voters for the September 14 recall election, fighting a mix of apathy, anger and confusion in their effort to get what has been a reliable voting bloc for the party to come out for an off-year election. Latino voters find themselves at the intersection of both the recall and the issue that partially spurred the effort \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic and Newsom\u2019s stringent response to it. A series of studies have found Latinos have been the demographic group most adversely impacted by the coronavirus in the state. RELATED: What to know about the California recall \u201cYou can\u2019t win California without reaching out to Latinos, so from the get-go there was an effort to connect with Latinos and Latino leaders to emphasize how important the recall was,\u201d said Angelica Salas, the head of CHIRLA Action Fund, an immigrant rights organization that has been working against recalling Newsom. \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to defeat this recall.\u201d Salas, whose organization has had over 20 volunteers knocking doors nearly every day since early August, said her organizers have found some people unsure about why they are having to vote in a nontraditional election year \u2013 along with some apathy about the effort. It\u2019s a problem for Newsom: Given California\u2019s overwhelming Democratic lean, Republicans will need both boosted turnout from their side and depressed turnout from traditionally Democratic voters to have a chance to oust the first-term governor. If the recall passes, voters will be asked on the same ballot to pick from a sweep of Newsom challengers, including Republican Larry Elder, a leading contender on the right who has made fighting Newsom\u2019s coronavirus pandemic orders central to his campaign. Newsom himself has looked to boost Latino turnout ahead of the recall election, telling Latino leaders on Thursday that echoes of Prop 187 \u2013 the now-void 1994 California proposition that barred undocumented immigrants from using a series of public services \u2013 is on the ballot with him. \u201cYou brought up Prop 187 \u2013 the xenophobia, the nativism. That\u2019s on the ballot September 14,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d have to live that again.\u201d Republicans like Elder are hopeful that frustration with the coronavirus pandemic and the way Newsom has handled the response could lead to his ouster. Newsom, like other Democratic governors, implemented strict rules in response to the pandemic, receiving politically motivated blowback from Republicans who argued he was costing the state vital jobs and business. This blowback was further heightened when Newsom was seen dining indoors at French Laundry, an upscale restaurant in California\u2019s Napa Valley, during the pandemic. To Gary Montana, a maintenance technician in Los Angeles, the scene smacked of hypocrisy and White elitism. \u201cI just saw the lack of leadership skills,\u201d the registered independent said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what when I thought we needed to recall the governor.\u201d Issues around Covid are personal for Montana. Every member of his family \u2013 nuclear and extended in the state \u2013 contracted the virus. As essential workers, like many Latino voters in California, Montana and his relatives kept working or suffered as their employers closed businesses during the stay-at-home orders. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really understood that the average person voted you in,\u201d the technician said. Montana added that his daily schedule is so packed, he doesn\u2019t care much about the recall effort. If he does send in his ballot, he plans to vote for either Elder or former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. Latinos make up an estimated 30% of all eligible voters in California, a significant portion that can easily make or break the success of any Democratic politician. Pro-Newsom groups have been running television ads in Spanish urging voters to stop those behind the recall and raising questions about their motives. This week, the California Latino PAC posted a four-minute video featuring more than a dozen Latino members of the state legislature. The elected representatives equated not voting to a vote for an anti-Latino governor. \u201cAll roads to victory on September 14 are going to lead through Latino neighborhoods in the state of California,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a Los Angeles City councilman who previously served in the State Senate as Senate Pro-Tem, at an event in Los Angeles. And Newsom has relied on support from Latino voters before, too. In 2018, when he won his first term as governor, 64% of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate, part of a resounding victory that vaulted Newsom to the governor\u2019s mansion. Newsom\u2019s policies while in office, especially during California\u2019s recovery from the pandemic \u2013 which directed aid to Hispanic neighborhoods and businesses \u2013 targeted Latinos. But analysts fear working Latinos feel a disconnect between the policies and the governor who has championed them. Concern about Latinos sitting out the recall election reached their zenith last month when a string of polling came out that suggested a lack of interest among key Democratic voting blocs. Most recent polls, however, show Latino likely voters broadly support keeping Newsom in office. But the concern for Newsom and his top operatives is that voters \u2013 including Latinos \u2013 will be either unaware of the election or uninterested in casting a ballot at all. \u201cThis is happening in an off year, in an off month \u2013 we are on the tail end of summer \u2013 so there was a lot of hand ringing in the summer, but no one was paying attention to the recall. There was no enthusiasm gap because there was no enthusiasm,\u201d said Matt Barreto, a professor at University of California Los Angeles and senior adviser for President Joe Biden\u2019s outside political group, Building Back Together. \u201cThe fact that it is all coming in the last month is normal and it just makes sense to me.\u201d Barreto said, however, that just because the polling and data is heading in Newsom\u2019s direction, that doesn\u2019t mean Democrats can slow any outreach to Latino communities: \u201cIt is never going to be on auto pilot, you have to continue reminding people to vote.\u201d To avoid a worrying scenario, outside political organizations are calling voters and going door-to-door to encourage Latino voters to send in their ballots or get out and vote. Organizers like Stephanie Avalos Villa, an 18-year old student who works for PowerCA Action, have been calling voters up and down California\u2019s Central Valley, focused particularly on turning out young Latino voters. \u201cMany of (the people she has talked to) want to keep Gavin Newsom in his position because they feel like it will better impact their communities, especially during Covid,\u201d she said. On a recent blistering 95-degree day, two volunteers for Lucha Action \u2013 a Los Angeles grassroots group formed to turn out the Latino vote \u2013 walked through the Boyle Heights neighborhood, using quarters to bang on the iron gates that protect homes in the predominately Latino, working class community. \u201cWe could end up with something worse,\u201d said a voter to the volunteers. \u201cSomething like Donald Trump.\u201d While nearly all the voters told Lucha Action they would vote against the recall, almost none of them had already sent in their ballots. \u201cIt is designed to catch you sleeping,\u201d Newsom said on Thursday in San Francisco during an event where he cast the recall, due to the spread of Covid-19, as a \u201clife and death\u201d decision for Californians. Although Latino voters in California have shown little willingness to break with Democrats in favor of Republicans \u2013 in part because of the galvanizing impact Prop 187 had on Latino communities \u2013 key segments of the voting bloc proved to be an issue for the party in 2020, with Trump making inroads among Latinos in South Texas and South Florida. The impact of that Republican success has led Democrats to question both their outreach to Latino voters and the way they counter Republican messaging. Republicans are looking to seize on a possible opening with a string of Spanish-language campaign ads and door knocking efforts to turn out Latino voters who are frustrated with the governor. \u201cYo soy Kevin Faulconer,\u201d the former Republican mayor of San Diego says in a spot. Elder also released his own Spanish language ad. And Republican operatives in the state hope one-time Newsom voters will take out their frustration against the governor, even if it means voting for a party they have rejected in the past. \u201cSometimes we show up and sometimes we just don\u2019t, it depends on what the issue is,\u201d said Luis Alvarado, a Republican strategist in the state. \u201cAnd sometimes we\u2019re the ones who can change the whole paradigm and sometimes we just don\u2019t show up and everybody wonders, what happened?\u201d To Democratic operatives like Salas, it is perfectly valid for voters to be angry with Newsom, even if she disagrees with that anger. That said, she argued, putting in a Republican governor is not the way to express the frustration. \u201cWe have the right to be upset and we deserve so much more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is, is our anger going to be channeled to Gavin Newsom. Or will we channel our anger to the people who are actually behind this recall and the people who are actually hurting us?\u201d",

            "article_content": "A colorful cast of more than 40 candidates from all political persuasions are vying to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in California\u2019s recall election, but only a handful have managed to break through the pack. The candidates have two weeks left to convince voters to boot Newsom out of office and choose them as a replacement. These are Newsom\u2019s most notable challengers: Republican John Cox may be most recognized for his campaign antics \u2013 barnstorming with a 1,000-pound live Kodiak bear named Tag, using an 8-foot ball of trash to symbolize the state\u2019s homelessness problem and standing on top of a giant \u201cGavinopoly\u201d board to attack high taxes and promote his plan to slash income taxes by 25%. Cox, a San Diego businessman, has been successful in generating headlines, including when he was served with a subpoena while onstage during the August 17 debate. Running as a political outsider, Cox has never held office before and lost badly to Newsom in 2018 when he challenged the Democratic governor, who won with more than 60% of the vote. Cox opposes California\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine mandates and mask requirements. During a debate early in August, he called Newsom\u2019s handling of the pandemic \u201can absolute disaster\u201d that \u201cresulted in far more danger and far more problems.\u201d His plan to end California\u2019s homelessness problem is to force the state\u2019s unhoused population to receive mental health and addiction treatment before being provided housing. Newsom\u2019s leading Republican replacement appears to be conservative talk show host and attorney Larry Elder, who would be California\u2019s first Black governor if he wins the recall election. Though a late entry to the race, Elder quickly rose to the top of the polls among the candidates vying to replace Newsom. Though a majority of voters would have to vote to recall Newsom on the ballot\u2019s first question, if the recall succeeds Newsom\u2019s successor would be selected by a plurality of California voters \u2013 meaning the winner may only have to get a fraction of the votes. But Elder\u2019s rise has come with heavy scrutiny \u2013 even calls from fellow GOP recall opponents to drop out of the race \u2013 because of his long history of disparaging remarks about women. He has also been accused of domestic violence and of brandishing a gun in 2015 by his then-fianc\u00e9e and former employee Alexandra Datig. Elder has denied the allegations. Like his rival Republican recall candidates, Elder would repeal Newsom\u2019s Covid-19 mask and vaccine mandates for state workers, who must either be vaccinated or tested weekly for the virus. He opposes minimum wage, cashless bail and defunding the police. He has said he will declare a homeless emergency and suspend the California Environmental Quality Act, which he argues contributes to the state\u2019s affordable housing crisis. Elder has skipped the debates, saying the only person he wants to debate is Newsom. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer has the experience of being elected to lead a Democratic-majority city as a Republican, which he has touted as an asset to governing the blue state of California. He has proposed $1 billion in annual wildfire prevention funding, an exemption for military retirees from income taxes, a cut in the marginal tax rate to 0% for the first $50,000 earned by individuals, and the first $100,000 earned by families, who make less than $1 million a year. During debates, Faulconer slammed Newsom for his approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, arguing that local school districts should make decisions about mask mandates in discussion with parents. While several of the GOP candidates have focused on Newsom, Faulconer has also attacked Elder, including for his \u201cunconscionable\u201d comments about women. Caitlyn Jenner created a lot of buzz around her candidacy early in the race, given her celebrity status as a former Olympic athlete and reality television star. But ever since, the Republican candidate has had to defend herself from criticism that she\u2019s not a serious candidate for governor. Her first press event \u2013 held 77 days after her campaign announcement \u2013 was brief and short on policy and details, according to reports; she has not demonstrated any deep grounding in policy; and she flew to Australia, reportedly to film \u201cCelebrity Big Brother,\u201d during a crucial phase in the campaign. Like Elder, Jenner has declined to appear at debates, saying she will not debate fellow recall candidates unless Newsom is present. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Jenner said she favors a path to citizenship for the 1.75 million undocumented immigrants in the state\u2019s labor force. She also opposes transgender girls participating in girls\u2019 sports and said she would consider changes to environmental regulations in California. First elected to the California State Assembly in 2016, Republican state lawmaker Kevin Kiley has made a name for himself as one of Newsom\u2019s \u201cchief antagonists\u201d in the legislature. Kiley has proposed ending California\u2019s state of emergency for the Covid-19 pandemic. Asked about school mask mandates for children during one of the debates, Kiley argued that parents \u201cknow what is best for their kids\u201d and should be making decisions themselves. He has knocked Newsom\u2019s spending of billions to address the homelessness issue, previously calling for a full audit of where funding was being allocated. Kiley is one of the younger candidates in the race. He\u2019s a former Los Angeles high school teacher and a former attorney and state prosecutor. Paffrath is a Democratic candidate hoping to replace Newsom, despite Newsom and Democratic leaders urging their party\u2019s voters to simply vote \u201cno\u201d on recalling the governor and leave the question of who should replace him unanswered. A real estate broker who built a following of 1.7 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, Paffrath describes himself as a \u201cJFK-style Democrat who can work with our Democratic legislature.\u201d Paffrath, who made his debate debut last week, has floated proposals like building an interstate pipeline to Mississippi to help solve California\u2019s water crisis and creating \u201cfuture schools\u201d that give $2,000 a month to adults who are homeless, living in poverty or incarcerated for nonviolent offenses to attend. He wants to get all homeless Californians off the streets in 60 days, by providing optional housing, by constructing or converting emergency facilities and by providing food along with mental health and medical support. Paffrath has advocated for no lockdowns in California as the Delta variant spread. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kathy Hochul was sworn in as New York\u2019s first female governor shortly after the stroke of midnight on Tuesday, replacing her disgraced predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid multiple scandals, including a report from the state attorney general that found he sexually harassed 11 women. A Buffalo native, Hochul served as Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2015. But the pair were rarely seen together outside of campaign seasons. In her public comments after Cuomo announced he would step down, Hochul sought to stress her distance from the tainted executive as she prepared to take the reins and launch her own bid for reelection next year. In Hochul\u2019s first remarks as the governor-in-waiting, on August 11, she stiff-armed Cuomo, promising to ditch any of his aides \u201cnamed as doing anything unethical\u201d in state Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 report as part of her efforts to remake a notoriously noxious executive chamber. \u201cNo one,\u201d Hochul said, \u201cwill ever describe my administration as a toxic work environment.\u201d Hochul\u2019s ascent coincides with the final act of Cuomo\u2019s decade-long run in charge of New York state, a period in which he ruthlessly consolidated power and become a national political star. During the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, his daily televised briefings won him the adoration of Democrats across the country, who held Cuomo up as the fact-driven antithesis of then-President Donald Trump. 19 states have never had a female governor But he burned out spectacularly in the months that followed, when a closer look at his handling of the crisis revealed questionable decision-making \u2013 most notably his administration\u2019s decision to send Covid-19 patients back to nursing homes \u2013 and put a spotlight on his alleged use of state resources to help in writing a triumphal memoir. By early this year, the former governor, once believed to be ticketed for a fourth term, was facing mounting allegations of sexual misconduct, which he still denies, and a backlash over the state health department\u2019s underreporting of Covid-19-related deaths in nursing homes. Facing impeachment in the state Assembly and conviction and removal by the state Senate, Cuomo announced nearly two weeks ago that he would step down. Assembly leaders hit pause on their investigation days later but then backtracked, eventually deciding to complete a report outlining their findings. It has not yet been released. Stepping out from Cuomo\u2019s long shadow and winning over leaders and lawmakers who clashed with him has been an early priority for Hochul, 62, who will immediately be faced with an onslaught of new and lingering challenges \u2013 from rising Covid-19 case rates to speeding up the dispersal of rental assistance and potentially extending the statewide eviction moratorium, which is set to expire on August 31. Reinforcing old relationships and building new ones with the legislature, which was often treated scornfully by Cuomo, could be crucial to Hochul\u2019s fate \u2013 now and as the next election season comes into focus. Following through on her promise to cast out top Cuomo aides would likely be a welcome start, said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to identify the leading thugs. Everybody in Albany can name them and most of the press corps can name them. They have never been shy about making the phone calls or doing it face-to-face,\u201d Sherrill told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be done. And I think that a lot of it has to do with building up a good relationship with the legislature.\u201d Hochul will be under pressure to pursue beefed-up ethical standards in Albany and private workplaces across the state. Leading advocates for survivors of sexual misconduct are calling on Hochul to act swiftly \u2013 and use her new power to press state lawmakers to take up dormant legislation that would expand oversight and offer new protections for workers. \u201cAt the end of the day, incoming-Gov. Hochul is part of an institution that has so far miserably failed to protect staffers and support survivors when they come forward,\u201d said Erica Vladimer, a co-founder of the Sexual Harassment Working Group, an organization founded by former state legislative employees. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of her connection to Cuomo, it\u2019s her connection to the entire institution of state government. She has a major responsibility stepping into the role as governor, but any elected official has a major responsibility to staffers and to survivors.\u201d Hochul is also facing early questions about a potential conflict of interest concerning her husband, William Hochul Jr., the general counsel and senior vice president at hospitality and gambling giant Delaware North, a company with significant business before the state. In her new job, Hochul controls New York\u2019s Gaming Commission, which regulates a large and growing gambling market. \u201cKathy Hochul, who had no power as lieutenant governor to really influence things, will have all the power as governor to be able to greenlight and influence deals between state regulators and state agencies and public authorities and Delaware North,\u201d said John Kaehny, executive director of the good-government group Reinvent Albany. \u201cBottom line: She\u2019s in a place to make Delaware North a ton of money if she was so inclined, by granting them favorable treatment and putting her thumb on the scale.\u201d Asked about those concerns by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d last week, Hochul said she has sought the advice of \u201coutside ethics experts to come up with an ironclad policy, so no one will ever question that there\u2019s any involvement with my husband in anything pertaining to the state of New York.\u201d \u201cMy husband was a federal prosecutor for 30 years. So even when I was in Congress, we\u2019re well-accustomed to keeping our work very separate,\u201d said Hochul, who had previously told CNN the couple would continue its current recusal policy. \u201cHe served as Barack Obama\u2019s US attorney for eight years. So no one can touch the integrity with which we have brought to our positions in the past and currently.\u201d Though the specific ethical questions raised by her husband\u2019s position might vex any newly elevated political leader, Hochul\u2019s situation has been further complicated by Cuomo, who despite having run on a promise to clean up state government presided over a further decline in the autonomy and independence of powerful agencies. \u201cUnder Cuomo, (public authorities and state agencies) have just been crushed over the last decade, so that they become accustomed to just doing whatever they\u2019re told by the governor\u2019s office,\u201d Kaehny said. \u201cThat firewall is gone.\u201d Hochul has publicly acknowledged that additional layers of oversight might be necessary and, as of Tuesday, Delaware North will, according to a Hochul adviser, create a \u201cfirewall\u201d that bars her husband from any involvement in state business, restricts his compensation from dealings with the state and puts a process in place to monitor his communications with the governor\u2019s office to assure compliance with the new rules. Hochul has embraced progressive leaders during her recent statewide travels and they, in turn, offered her political space and some kind words ahead of Cuomo\u2019s departure. But that honeymoon is expected to end as left-leaning potential gubernatorial candidates announce their intentions \u2013 and dig into her record \u2013 ahead of next year\u2019s election. In 2011, Hochul won a special election to represent New York\u2019s 26th Congressional District, a seat held by Republicans for decades before the resignation of former Rep. Chris Lee. But Hochul lost her reelection bid the next year after the district was redrawn. Her opponent then, former Rep. Chris Collins, would end up resigning in 2019, a day before he pleaded guilty in an insider trading case. Though her time in Congress was short, Hochul is a veteran state and local politician with deep roots in more conservative Western New York. A moderate, she has shifted left over the years with the Democratic Party. Back in 2007, during her time as Erie County clerk, Hochul emerged as a vocal opponent of then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer\u2019s plan to allow for the issuance of driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants. But her position, as she reiterated this month, \u201cevolved\u201d and she ultimately wrote a 2019 op-ed backing the \u201cGreen Light\u201d bill shortly before Cuomo signed it into law. Hochul also received an endorsement and \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association a decade ago \u2013 before running afoul of gun rights activist groups over her support for New York\u2019s post-Sandy Hook SAFE Act and joining forces with the incumbent governor as he sought a second term in 2014. Though she was not close to Cuomo, Hochul is likely to encounter criticism over their political alliance, which included her participation in the rollout of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, an organization the governor co-founded \u2013 ostensibly as a new vehicle for electing progressive lawmakers who support abortion rights \u2013 ahead of his 2014 primary campaign. The party, which endorsed Cuomo and was allowed on the ballot under the provisions of the state\u2019s fusion voting system, quickly dissipated and is widely regarded as emblematic of his cynical political style. The political ramifications of the Cuomo team\u2019s salt-the-earth departure tactics \u2013 illustrated most sharply in a recent op-ed by a top aide and the governor\u2019s grumbling farewell speech \u2013 remain to be seen, though they might be a gift for a new executive seeking to distinguish herself from the outgoing administration. \u201cWhat is clear is that Hochul is really seeking to define herself as a clear contrast to the governor,\u201d said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the progressive New York Working Families Party. \u201cShe is now seeking to craft an identity that might very well work for progressive and working people in the state. But it does not quite answer the question of what animates Kathy Hochul\u2019s political decisions \u2013 who is she accountable to? What drives her?\u201d On a ticket with Cuomo, Hochul in 2018 defeated a top New York City progressive, Jumaane Williams, who has since been elected the city\u2019s public advocate, by less than 7 percentage points. But Williams, who has been tipped to run against her again \u2013 this time for governor \u2013 next year, routed Hochul in Manhattan and Brooklyn, underscoring her need to build and shore up support in the city. Those efforts are well underway. Hochul spent much of Cuomo\u2019s two weeks\u2019 notice meeting with city officials, including Williams. The pair put out a joint statement after their meeting, calling it a \u201cproductive dialogue.\u201d Hochul on Monday morning also announced two high-profile hires: Karen Persichilli Keogh, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and head of global philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase, has been named the secretary to the governor \u2013 a powerful position previously held by Melissa DeRosa, who resigned shortly before her old boss. Elizabeth Fine will be Hochul\u2019s chief counsel after serving as chief legal officer at New York\u2019s top economic development agency. But Hochul has not yet announced her replacement as lieutenant governor, perhaps the most politically sensitive choice in front of her. She has said the pick will come from downstate, most likely in New York City. A Hochul adviser told CNN that a decision will come this week. Hochul has spoken to a number of Brooklyn- and Bronx-based leaders, including Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, a state Assembly member and chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Bronx Borough President Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Jr. and state Sens. Brian Benjamin and Jamaal Bailey, as first reported in The New York Times. Bichotte Hermelyn, Bailey and D\u00edaz Jr. all endorsed New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Eric Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president, before the June primary. Benjamin, who ran unsuccessfully in the comptroller race, announced his support for Adams earlier this month. The political calculus underlying Hochul\u2019s eventual choice has become a favorite parlor game of New York politicos. The lieutenant governor is, by law, a mostly ceremonial position \u2013 though Hochul\u2019s recent experience underscores the interest in who occupies the office. Still, the pick is a prime opportunity for Hochul to define her political persona downstate, which could make or break her reelection hopes. \u201cI really think that she needs a young, energetic progressive person as lieutenant governor. It\u2019s the easiest way, quickly, to reach out to the community that is most problematic for her in the primary,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cSome of me thinks she\u2019ll want to have a man (on the ticket), but I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything terribly politically problematic about having two women. I think that might help her in a primary.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump will rally the faithful in Alabama on Saturday, a boon to Rep. Mo Brooks, his favored Senate candidate, who is behind in the money race there and struggling to attract some Republicans unnerved by his brand of slash-and-burn politics. This year, the six-term congressman helped lead the charge in Congress to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and launched a run for Senate. He then earned the former President\u2019s support and put it at the forefront of his campaign, displaying \u201cENDORSED BY TRUMP\u201d above his own name on placards. Brooks is now the front-runner for the 2022 race. \u201cNo candidate in Alabama could say with a straight face they would pass on a Trump endorsement,\u201d said Republican Rep. Barry Moore, who supports Brooks. \u201cTo most Alabamians, a Trump endorsement is the best assurance out there that the receiving candidate will be out front in the fight for the issues they care about.\u201d The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip But the Senate race will test the enduring strength of Trump, as some Republicans look for an alternative to Brooks. Besides placing his baseless opposition to the certification of the 2020 election at the center of his candidacy, Brooks has made a series of controversial statements, talking about a \u201cwar on Whites\u201d and appearing to be sympathetic to a man police arrested this week in connection with a bomb threat near the US Capitol. \u201cAlthough this terrorist\u2019s motivation is not yet publicly known, and generally speaking, I understand citizenry anger directed at dictatorial Socialism and its threat to liberty, freedom and the very fabric of American society,\u201d Brooks tweeted Thursday. \u201cThe way to stop Socialism\u2019s march is for patriotic Americans to fight back in the 2022 and 2024 election.\u201d Among those running in the GOP primary against Brooks are: Katie Britt, the former president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama; Lynda Blanchard, Trump\u2019s US ambassador to Slovenia; and businesswoman Jessica Taylor. If any won, they\u2019d very likely become the first woman elected to the Senate from Alabama. While Blanchard poured millions into her campaign, Britt raised the most of any candidate in the second financial quarter of the year: $2.2 million, which is more than twice what Brooks brought in during that time. Britt also won the support of retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, her former boss and the man currently holding the seat. Shelby told CNN that Brooks is a \u201cfringe congressman\u201d and \u201cnot a mainstream guy,\u201d while Britt is \u201cby far the best qualified, promising candidate in that job.\u201d But the former President\u2019s rally in Cullman, Alabama \u2013 part of a congressional district where Trump received 81% of the vote, the most of any in the country \u2013 will remind voters who he supports for Senate. It is also likely to increase Brooks\u2019 war chest. The congressman has put ads on Facebook telling his supporters that if they donate $1,000 a person, he\u2019ll set them up in an air-conditioned tent and seats near the rally\u2019s stage. For $250, he will ensure they get \u201cexcellent seating.\u201d Other candidates have attacked Brooks, who was first elected to public office as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in 1982, as a career politician. But Trump\u2019s support could hold more sway in the GOP primary, leading candidates to go after his choice while linking themselves to the former President. Britt is already up with Facebook ads saying it\u2019s \u201ctime to finish Trump\u2019s border wall.\u201d \u201cWe take great pride in our hospitality here in Alabama, and we welcome President Trump back to our state,\u201d Britt said in a statement. \u201cHe showed the nation that we don\u2019t need ineffective career politicians in Washington. We need someone who\u2019s going to get things done in the U.S. Senate, and I\u2019m that person.\u201d Trump heads to Alabama but his Covid politics are everywhere And Taylor, who lost a 2020 House race before announcing her 2022 Senate campaign, attempted to attack Brooks for not being a strong enough Trump supporter. She noted that he blasted Trump during the 2016 race and did not donate to Trump\u2019s 2016 or 2020 campaigns, even though he gave to GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cHe\u2019s all talk and no action, as his congressional record will reflect,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cHe has been up there since 2010 and accomplished absolutely nothing.\u201d A Brooks aide declined a request to interview the congressman and did not respond to further questions for comment. Trump has a spotty record in recent Alabama US Senate races. His 2017 endorsements of then-Sen. Luther Strange in the GOP primary and of Judge Roy Moore in the general election were unsuccessful. But while Trump might not be a kingmaker, he can destroy an Alabama Republican candidate\u2019s campaign. In 2020, the then-President attacked Jeff Sessions, stemming from their fallout over Sessions\u2019 handling of the Russia probe as Trump\u2019s attorney general. That ended Sessions\u2019 bid to return to the Senate. Once beloved in the state \u2013 he faced no opponent in 2014 \u2013 Sessions lost to former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in the primary, who went on to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the general election. So far, Trump\u2019s involvement in the 2022 race has been limited to praising Brooks. \u201cFew Republicans have as much COURAGE and FIGHT as Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks,\u201d Trump said in April. After initially backing Texas\u2019 Sen. Ted Cruz for president in 2016, Brooks quickly became a diehard supporter after Trump\u2019s victory. In 2020, Brooks became one of the first members of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. The night before the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, he tweeted that Trump had personally asked him to speak \u201cabout the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.\u201d At the rally, Brooks said, \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Just hours later, the pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol to try to stop the congressional certification. After the insurrection, Brooks called for \u201cthe Capitol attack perpetrators\u201d to be \u201cprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d But he also falsely suggested that left-wing Antifa activists \u201corchestrated\u201d the attack. Two Democrats introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally. Brooks has offered no regrets for his remarks at the January 6 rally. \u201cI did my duty for my country,\u201d he told CNN in March. In a speech launching his Senate campaign that same month, Brooks, 66, lambasted cancel culture, \u201ctech censorship,\u201d the skyrocketing rise of the national debt, the media, transgender rights and undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border. He attacked the Biden administration\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill for providing $5 billion to farmers of color, claiming, \u201cThe socialist Democrat message: Whites need not apply.\u201d He then said that \u201call racism is repugnant,\u201d and that people should be judged by their characters rather than their races. He also mentioned that he had \u201cled the charge\u201d to overturn the 2020 election, had been twice endorsed by Trump and had stood by Trump twice during two impeachments \u2013 and that \u201cno other candidate\u201d can say that.

Now that the investigation has concluded \u2013 and found the governor sexually harassed multiple women, which he denies \u2013 Hochul is in the unique position of publicly condemning Cuomo\u2019s alleged behavior while being mindful that she could soon replace him if he is forced to leave office. \u201cSexual harassment is unacceptable in any workplace, and certainly not in public service. The AG\u2019s investigation has documented repulsive & unlawful behavior by the Governor towards multiple women. I believe these brave women & admire their courage coming forward,\u201d Hochul tweeted Tuesday. \u201cNo one is above the law. Under the New York Constitution, the Assembly will now determine the next steps. Because Lieutenant Governors stand next in the line of succession, it would not be appropriate to comment further on the process at this moment.\u201d Sexual harassment is unacceptable\u00a0in any workplace, and certainly not in public\u00a0service.The AG\u2019s investigation has documented repulsive & unlawful behavior by the Governor towards multiple women.\u00a0I believe these brave women & admire their courage coming forward. 1/2 For Hochul, a longtime Democrat, it\u2019s a delicate balance. She\u2019s served as Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant for nearly the last seven years and would take over a state whose political landscape he has dominated for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Cuomo has made no indication that he will resign despite calls to do so from nearly every prominent Democrat in the country, including President Joe Biden, shifting focus to whether the Democratic-led Legislature will impeach him. As a result, Hochul is preparing herself in case she needs to step in as governor, a state official told CNN. She\u2019s cleared her schedule and has been in back-to-back meetings with legislators and advocacy groups on Wednesday. Cuomo faces calls for resignation from powerful Democrats in wake of AG report Hochul, 62, would be New York\u2019s first female governor if Cuomo were to resign or be forced out. A Buffalo native, she was first elected lieutenant governor of New York in 2014 as Cuomo\u2019s running mate and won reelection alongside him in 2018. Her old campaign website touts her work on raising the minimum wage in New York to $15, push for the state\u2019s paid family leave law, and advocacy for women. She led the governor\u2019s \u201cEnough is Enough\u201d initiative to combat sexual assault on college campuses and co-chairs the state\u2019s heroin and opioid abuse task force. She first garnered national attention after winning a US House special election in 2011 for New York\u2019s 26th Congressional District. The seat had long been considered safe by Republicans, who held the district for four decades until Hochul\u2019s victory. The election was seen as a proxy battle over a then-House Republican proposal to reform Medicare. While in Congress, she introduced the Clothe a Homeless Hero Act, which directed airports to deliver unclaimed clothes at airport checkpoints to veterans organizations. Her bill became law in 2013. She lost her reelection bid in 2012 to former Republican Rep. Chris Collins in the redrawn district. Before her brief congressional stint, Hochul spent roughly 18 years in local state politics, including 14 years as a Hamburg Town Councilmember followed by nearly four years as Erie County clerk. Over the years, she has shifted from being a more conservative-leaning Democrat \u2013 previously opposing granting drivers licenses to undocumented immigrants as Erie County clerk and earning an endorsement from the NRA in 2011 \u2013 to backing more progressive stances on issues. Her other past jobs include working at M&T Bank, as an attorney for a Washington, DC, law firm, and as legal counsel and aide to two former New York Democratic politicians \u2013 US Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and US Rep. John Joseph LaFalce. Hochul, along with her mother and aunt, in 2006 founded a transitional home in Buffalo for victims of domestic violence called the Kathleen Mary House. She told Politico in 2014 that her grandmother had been a victim of domestic abuse, which prompted her and her family\u2019s activism on the issue. Here's how impeachment proceedings against Andrew Cuomo would work A majority of New York state assembly members \u2013 80 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 told CNN they would vote \u201cyes\u201d to impeach, if articles of impeachment are introduced. If the Assembly votes to impeach, Hochul would become governor, stripping Cuomo of his decision-making abilities while he undergoes trial in the New York state Senate. If acquitted, Cuomo would go back to the governor\u2019s mansion. But if convicted, Cuomo would be removed from office, leaving the governing of New York state to Hochul. The report released Tuesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, engaging in \u201cunwelcome and nonconsensual touching,\u201d and created a \u201chostile\u201d work environment for women. Cuomo denied some of the report\u2019s allegations while claiming that other aspects of his behavior detailed in the report were taken out of context. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly referred to the county for which Hochul once served as clerk. It is Erie County. It has also been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Even President Joe Biden doesn\u2019t know whether his new federal eviction moratorium for renters is legal and sustainable. But crushing humanitarian and political pressure left him no choice but to take a chance on an emergency move. The new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scheme was announced after the White House, hampered by a Supreme Court ruling and Congress\u2019 failure to act, had repeatedly argued it had no constitutional authority to extend the moratorium. Biden himself said on Tuesday that the new moratorium may not be constitutional, and is essentially an attempt to buy time to get backlogged funding out of state coffers and into the pockets of renters and landlords alike. The conundrum threatened to force millions of Americans who lost incomes during the pandemic out of their homes in an appalling twist to what has already been an agonizing year. The problem was that the moratorium expired on July 31 at a moment when much of the more than $40 billion in funds already provided by Congress to pay landlords for back rent for tenants is still yet to be handed out by states and local authorities. To head off mass evictions, the White House came up with a classic Washington fudge \u2013 not unfamiliar in an era of Capitol Hill gridlock \u2013 in which presidents, especially Democrats, have improvised with executive power to shield constituencies from consequences of a malfunctioning political system. The Covid-19 data backing up CDC's change in guidance In essence, the CDC declared a new moratorium until the end of October that applies to counties with substantial or high community spread of Covid-19. It reasoned that the new threat posed by the highly infectious Delta variant constitutes new circumstances and therefore merits an entirely fresh scheme. \u201cIn the context of a pandemic, eviction moratoria \u2013 like quarantine, isolation, and social distancing \u2013 can be an effective public health measure utilized to prevent the spread of communicable disease,\u201d the CDC said in a statement. \u201cEviction moratoria facilitate self-isolation and self-quarantine by people who become ill or who are at risk of transmitting COVID-19 by keeping people out of congregate settings and in their own homes,\u201d it added. While the public health argument is sound, it is not clear whether this formula will get around a ruling by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that stipulated that the original moratorium could only be extended if Congress gave the CDC \u201cclear and specific\u201d authorization to do so. At first sight, this new CDC move appears to have ignored that requirement with a semantic argument. Hastily cobbled together and legally questionable, the plan appears highly vulnerable to new court challenges, meaning that the new moratorium \u2013 covering 90% of renters \u2013 may only be a stopgap solution. The President told reporters on Tuesday that he had sought advice from constitutional scholars and still didn\u2019t have a complete picture about the chances of the new moratorium passing muster in the courts. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I don\u2019t know. There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it\u2019s not likely to,\u201d the President said. \u201cBut at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we\u2019re getting that $45 billion out to people who are in fact behind in the rent and don\u2019t have the money.\u201d In some ways, Biden\u2019s maneuvering on Tuesday recalls executive action taken by ex-President Barack Obama to shield undocumented migrants brought to the US as children from deportation after insisting he didn\u2019t have the power to do so. The Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program created by Obama in 2012 set off an extraordinary saga of legal and legislative battles that continue to this day but alleviated political pressure on Obama, and helped to ease the human toll of a situation that a divided Congress had failed to fix.   That Biden averted a humanitarian crisis is not in doubt. In one small snapshot of the nightmare, CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Monday featured Las Vegas mom of three Dasha Kelly who sold or pawned much of her furniture for cash after losing her job as a card dealer when casinos closed. A day later Kelly had a double celebration. First, there was the moratorium extension engineered by Biden, who she referred to as \u201cour precious President.\u201d And a GoFundMe page she set up raced past $170,000 after a return appearance on Burnett\u2019s show. \u201cI am still in denial \u2026 it\u2019s really overwhelming. These are tears of joy, trust me,\u201d Kelly said. The drama over the moratorium illustrated the treacherous political environment that the Biden administration must confront. First, it emphasizes the danger posed to his presidency by the resurgence of a pandemic that Biden had hoped was all but over. There is no guarantee that the situation will be improved when the latest moratorium expires in October. The President also came under extreme pressure from progressive Democrats, Several liberal lawmakers escalated their campaign for an extension of the housing moratorium by camping out on the steps of the US Capitol. The leader of the protest, Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, told Burnett that she was also \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d \u201cSo many people right now, millions of people you know, will not be forced out on the streets.\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have come to this, but I am glad that we are here.\u201d The moratorium controversy comes at an increasingly challenging time for the administration. The White House is having to ask progressives to trim their aspirations as Biden seeks to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill and get moderate Democrats to sign onto a massive spending measure. Failure to act on the moratorium could have damaged the President\u2019s hopes of uniting his party on those agenda items that will define the success or failure of his administration. Biden moved after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 among congressional Democrats criticized for acting too slowly to renew the moratorium \u2013 signaled that there would be no action from Capitol Hill. She was apparently concerned about exposing moderate Democrats from suburban districts to a tough \u2013 and likely futile \u2013 vote. Even as she works with Biden to pass his agenda, the powerful Pelosi still has independent power that can pose its own challenges to the White House. Politically, the spectacle of potentially millions of Americans being turned out of their homes would be an impossible one for any White House, let alone a Democratic administration built on the principle of using government power to alleviate the plight of poorer Americans. So, Biden had to do something. The crisis was an unwelcome new challenge for a White House suddenly facing a cascade of political threats, including the vicious rebound of the pandemic and a fast-deteriorating situation in Afghanistan that could become a genuine foreign policy disaster after Biden ordered all American troops home. Now at least, on housing, the administration has a viable political strategy that does not leave it looking helpless. Biden said that he hoped that the new plan would allow time for local and state governments to hand out more of the emergency rental assistance to those who need it. If a court blocks the move, the White House can at least argue the President took bold action to protect needy Americans and can blame Republicans ahead of midterm elections for refusing to cooperate to stop citizens being kicked onto the streets. The moratorium drama also reflects the limited room for maneuver faced by the White House and Democrats at a time when many of their voters are demanding audacious leadership. Even if an extension passed the House, it had little chance of attracting 10 Republicans in the Senate to overcome the filibuster rules hampering much of the rest of Biden\u2019s agenda.   This does not only underscore the near impossibility of fulfilling high hopes among Democrats for Biden\u2019s presidency with a narrow House majority and a 50-50 Senate. It is also a warning sign. There remains little appetite among Republicans \u2013 now locked into a midterm election message targeting big Democratic spending \u2013 for new, big and costly pandemic rescue efforts. This could be a problem if the Delta variant seriously slows the economy \u2013 which is crucial for Democrats\u2019 midterm election hopes \u2013 and Biden needs to ask for more stimulus. Ultimately, the entire housing moratorium panic of course stemmed from legal reasoning by Kavanaugh, a justice installed as part of ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s fashioning of a conservative majority on the nation\u2019s top bench. The sight of Democratic presidents struggling to deal with snares laid by a court specifically constructed to counter the aspirations of an activist liberal government could be repeated again and again in coming years.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden conceded during a CNN town hall on Wednesday that certain businesses will remain \u201cin a bind for a little while\u201d with labor shortages, part of a major set of problems that\u2019s unfurling as his six-month-old presidency reaches a critical juncture. Covid cases are rising, a testament to a vaccination effort that has stalled amid waves of disinformation and skepticism. Pent-up demand has caused an uptick in prices, leading to concerns over inflation. And Biden\u2019s much-touted bipartisan infrastructure deal remains in a state of limbo as Republicans and Democrats rush to finalize the plan. Asked by a restauranteur about how the federal government will incentivize returns to work among industries with labor shortages, Biden said, \u201cI think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things.\u201d   \u201cAnd there is a shortage of employees, people are looking to make more money and \u2026 to bargain. And so I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a bind for a little while,\u201d the President continued. Biden\u2019s visit to Ohio \u2013 a state that voted for former President Donald Trump in last year\u2019s election \u2013 is part of a pattern of visiting red-leaning areas to promote popular proposals, like a child tax credit or free community college. Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, Biden toured a union training center for electrical workers, part of his efforts to highlight the well-paying union jobs he says his economic plan will help create. He\u2019s visited Ohio three times since taking office, tying Michigan and Pennsylvania as his most-visited states \u2013 excluding Delaware, where he spends many weekends. The President promoted his economic recovery plans but downplayed inflation and job shortages, saying to the town hall audience at Mount St. Joseph University that \u201cthe economy is picking up significantly.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it\u2019s highly unlikely that it\u2019s going to be long-term inflation that\u2019s going to be getting out of hand. There will be near-term inflation because everything is now trying to be picked back up,\u201d Biden asserted. He pointed to a recent Moody\u2019s Analytics report, which indicated the bipartisan infrastructure plan and the President\u2019s $3.5 trillion proposal to widen the social safety net are unlikely to cause high inflation. The Biden administration is being forced to confront a troubling rise in Covid cases that has now spread to every state in the country. Driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, nearly all new hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people. But the new surge has already forced some localities to reapply mask mandates.   The President began the town hall event by telling moderator Don Lemon that the current pandemic is one of the unvaccinated. \u201cIt\u2019s real simple. We have a pandemic for those who haven\u2019t gotten a vaccination. It\u2019s that basic,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf you are vaccinated, you\u2019re not going to be hospitalized, you\u2019re not going to be in an ICU unit, and you\u2019re not going to die. So it\u2019s giantly important that we all act like Americans care about our fellow Americans,\u201d he continued. The President said what the White House is \u201ctrying to do is use every avenue we can, public, private, government, non-government to try to get the facts out.\u201d He pointed out recent testimonials from conservatives, including some from \u201cone of those other networks [that\u2019s] not a big fan of mine,\u201d in the recent days \u2013 an apparent nudge to recent pro-vaccine comments on Fox News. \u201cAll of a sudden, they\u2019re out there saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get vaccinated. Let\u2019s get vaccinated.\u2019 \u2026 But that\u2019s good. I shouldn\u2019t make fun. That\u2019s good,\u201d Biden said. Additionally, Biden predicted Wednesday that children under the age of 12 will be able to get vaccinated \u201csoon,\u201d pending approval federal public health agencies. He also suggested they\u2019d recommend that kids under the age of 12 \u201cshould probably be wearing a mask in school.\u201d The President departed Washington for Cincinnati around the same time the Senate blocked a vote to start debate on the infrastructure plan, a setback to Biden\u2019s attempts at fostering across-the-aisle cooperation. Negotiators say they will continue talking in hopes of striking a deal, but now Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must schedule another vote for next week.   Biden\u2019s aides have been working behind-the-scenes to bring the deal to fruition. In theory, it would spend $600 billion repairing roads and bridges and bolstering broadband networks, among other physical infrastructure priorities. A separate $3.5 trillion framework being advanced only by Democrats includes the remainder of Biden\u2019s family and jobs agenda, including education, housing and child care. Biden expressed the bipartisan infrastructure framework would pass a motion to proceed on Monday, telling voters at a town hall in Cincinnati, \u201cI take my Republican colleagues at their word. I come from a tradition in the Senate, you shake your hand, and that\u2019s it, you keep your word\u2013 and I found (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman does that.\u201d But the White House recognizes the narrow window he has to push through his agenda before midterm election season begins consuming Washington\u2019s political oxygen. They have worked with urgency to sell elements of his plans to the American people, including through town hall events and speeches. Biden blasted efforts by Republican legislators to curb voting rights, calling it \u201cJim Crow on steroids,\u201d while still maintaining his support for the legislative filibuster standing in the way of passing meaningful voting protections. The President also once again pledged to fight for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, saying that he\u2019s \u201cnot letting this go.\u201d \u201cThey come here with really no choice and they\u2019re good, good people,\u201d Biden said. On Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled that DACA, the Obama-era program shielding certain undocumented immigrants from deportation, is illegal and blocked new applicants. Biden also sought to counter the Republican argument that the Democratic Party is anti-police, noting the importance of changing police behavior as he advocated for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation is largely stalled in Congress, with bipartisan negotiations continuing behind the scenes daily as the reality of legislative calendar looms. Biden continued to call for an investigation into the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you think I\u2019m Satan reincarnate. The fact is you can\u2019t look at that television and say, \u2018Nothing happened on the 6th.\u2019\u201d Hours before the town hall, five House Republicans were pulled out of participating in the House committee investigation into the January 6 insurrection after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of the five Republicans House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had selected for the panel. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, an outspoken critic of Trump who was one of Pelosi\u2019s selections for the investigation, will remain on the committee. During the town hall, Biden went on to criticize Republicans and conspiracy theories, referring to \u201cvenom\u201d being spread and warned that the rest of the world is watching. Asked how he believes anything can get done in Washington when investigating the insurrection can\u2019t even be agreed upon, Biden showed optimism, telling the audience, \u201cI have faith in the American people.\u201d The President also specifically referenced the QAnon conspiracy theory, telling the audience: \u201cThe idea that the Democrats or Biden are hiding people and sucking the blood of children \u2026 we\u2019ve got to get beyond this,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is not who we are.\u201d Biden said he still believes bipartisanship can produce results in Congress, but conceded that the Trump-era did severe damage to working across the aisle. \u201cI still believe that\u2019s possible, but the well has been so poisoned over the last four years, and even now there\u2019s still this lingering effort,\u201d he added. This story has been updated with additional details from the town hall. CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, DJ Judd, Jason Hoffman and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A top Republican Party official in Oregon appeared on a YouTube show hosted by a man with a history of racist, anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi statements, in which the official, Solomon Yue, spoke supportively of another man who espouses White nationalist rhetoric. Now, Yue tells CNN\u2019s KFILE he wasn\u2019t aware of the comments made by either of them and both Yue and the Republican National Committee have condemned them. In a March episode of Pure Politics hosted by Greyson Arnold \u2013 who has posted enthusiastically about Nazi Germany \u2013 Yue was asked if a far-right activist named Nick Fuentes and the event he\u2019s best known for organizing, America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC), should have a role in picking candidates to run for office in primaries. \u201cYes,\u201d Yue, an RNC committeeman, replied. \u201cActually, in the ideal world, America First candidate is bottom-up process, it\u2019s not top-down.\u201d Fuentes, who has been banned from most social media platforms for his White nationalist rhetoric, said the United States needed to protect its \u201cWhite demographic core\u201d at February\u2019s AFPAC meeting, which was billed as an alternative to the annual Conservative Political Action Committee conference. Later in the interview, Yue said he could use his leverage as an RNC official to help elect America First candidates. \u201cIf somebody like the NRCC (National Republican Congressional Committee) came to us, asking for favors both in terms of money and in terms of a boots on the ground, I would have leveraged that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would ask, \u2018What are you going to give to me in return,\u2019 right? In return, you cannot support, in the primary, you can\u2019t support your incumbents. You have to allow people to decide, and Republican voters to decide.\u201d Yue told CNN in an email he was unaware of the views of either man, Arnold or Fuentes, at the time of the interview and rejected them. \u201cI have no idea that this individual made these offensive and racist statements. I believe these racist viewpoints not only have no place in our Republican Party but also should be rejected,\u201d Yue told CNN in an email. \u201cMy YES was based on Fuentes has his constitutional right to political assembly and to participate in political process so he should be allowed to compete with CPAC conference,\u201d he added. Yue is a \u201csenior RNC leader,\u201d according to his biography on the RNC\u2019s website. An immigrant from China, he has served as one of Oregon\u2019s committee members since 2000 according to his biography on the RNC\u2019s website, making him one of the longest serving RNC officials in the country. Yue is one of three officials representing the state in the governing body of the RNC. In addition to his role at the RNC, he also is the vice chairman and CEO of Republicans Overseas, a grassroots organization for keeping Republicans outside the United States active in politics. An RNC spokesperson told CNN that \u201cWhite supremacy, neo-Nazism, hate speech and bigotry are not welcome and have no home in the Republican Party.\u201d Yue led a push within the Oregon Republican Party to censure Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the January 6 insurrection. He has tweeted baseless conspiracies that the Capitol riot was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d event perpetrated by Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters. He also compared Black Lives Matter activists to Nazi storm troopers. Arnold, the YouTube host who interviewed Yue, has a history of pro-Nazi and White nationalist statements. He has advocated shooting refugees and punishing undocumented immigrants with death. Arnold did not comment on the nature of his posts when reached by CNN. In tweets and posts in 2021 on the messaging app Telegram, which has become popular with White nationalists banned or suspended from other social media websites, Arnold repeatedly shared memes saying the US fought on the wrong side in World War II. The posts pushed appalling conspiracies that there was a \u201cJewish cabal\u201d that controlled the US government during the war and Jewish plans existed to \u201cgenocide the Germany people.\u201d CNN is not amplifying or repeating the vile racist and anti-Semitic language of many posts. One of Arnold\u2019s tweets from May 2020 called Adolf Hitler \u201ca complicated historical figure which many people misunderstand.\u201d He also shared a meme last year calling Nazis a \u201cpure\u201d race. Yue repeatedly promoted his appearance on Arnold\u2019s show in tweets tagging Arnold\u2019s Twitter account to share that the interview was taking place. He later posted the interview, tagging Arnold in both tweets. Arnold did not hide any of his views on his public social media accounts. He solicited his interview with Yue via Twitter and advertised it on his Telegram account as well. Yue tweeted with Arnold as recently as Thursday At the time of the interview, Arnold\u2019s Twitter feed prominently featured tweets suggesting a journalist be killed, and a video from Pure Politics he pinned as his top tweet had the White nationalist slogan \u201cWhite Pride Worldwide,\u201d and other racist statements. In his hour-plus interview with Arnold, Yue drew on his Chinese background and his teenage experiences during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s to draw comparisons between the Black Lives Matter movement, \u201ccancel culture\u201d and Communist China. He said the United States is having its own cultural revolution and becoming more like China, which he called the \u201cnew evil empire.\u201d Yue also praised Trump for not being politically correct and for embracing an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and repeated the lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from Trump.

            "article_content": "The Senate is scheduled to hold a Tuesday vote on whether to move forward with a sweeping Democratic elections and ethics bill, known as the For the People Act, that was passed by the House of Representatives in March. The bill \u2013 which would make major changes to rules on voting, voter registration, campaign finance, redistricting, and other elections-related topics \u2013 has been the subject of repeated misinformation from its Republican opponents (along with, of course, some factual criticism). The bill\u2019s supporters do not appear to have the 60 votes required to overcome a Republican filibuster. Here is a brief guide to four significant false claims about the legislation. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has claimed more than once, including last week, that the bill would register to vote anyone at all who comes into contact with the government \u2013 including undocumented immigrants. Cruz has also claimed that the bill is \u201cintended\u201d to register millions of undocumented immigrants. Facts First: Cruz\u2019s claims are false. The bill does propose an automatic voter registration system, but its text repeatedly makes clear that only US citizens would be eligible to be registered to vote under that system; it is just not true that the bill would register anyone at all who interacts with the government or that the bill is intended to register millions of undocumented immigrants. You can read a longer fact check here. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina claimed Friday that the bill would stop Republican-controlled state governments from drawing the boundaries of congressional districts and instead give that redistricting power to \u201cDemocratic-appointed\u201d commissions \u201ccreated in Washington.\u201d Fact check: Lindsey Graham inaccurately describes Democrats' redistricting proposal Facts First: The bill would indeed transform the redistricting process, but Graham was wrong in two ways about the specifics of the transformation. The bill would require states to create their own independent redistricting commissions; redistricting power would not be handed to a commission in the nation\u2019s capital. And members of each state\u2019s commission \u2013 which would be made up of five Republicans, five Democrats, and five people unaffiliated with either party \u2013 would be appointed through a process that would have to involve cross-partisan consensus, not simply appointed by Democrats. You can read a longer fact check here. Cruz claimed at a press conference last week that the bill would mandate \u201cthat all felons be allowed to vote.\u201d Facts First: Cruz exaggerated when he said \u201call\u201d felons. The bill would require states to let citizens who committed felonies cast a vote if they are not incarcerated at the time of the election. The bill would not allow incarcerated felons to vote. Various Republicans have claimed that the bill would \u201cban\u201d voter identification laws or \u201cban voter ID\u201d in general. \u200b Facts First: This is false. The bill would not prohibit states from having voter identification laws and would not prohibit states from checking the IDs of in-person voters\u200b. Rather, it would require states to give voters an alternative to showing the ID the states normally demand \u2013 specifically, to allow voters who do not show that ID to instead submit signed statements under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote. 1 in 3 Americans believe the 'Big Lie' Critics are entitled to argue that this provision would weaken or undermine state voter ID laws; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday, for example, that the bill would mean a \u201cneutering\u201d of voter ID laws. But it\u2019s just not true to claim the bill completely prohibits ID laws or ID checks. For absentee ballot applications in particular, the bill says states can\u2019t require any form of identification except for a signature or \u201csimilar affirmation.\u201d It says, though, that this policy has \u201cno effect\u201d on ID requirements for first-time voters registering by mail. And as the National Conference of State Legislatures notes on its website, state voter ID requirements generally don\u2019t apply to mail-in or absentee ballots anyway.",

            "article_content": "Can President Joe Biden avoid the \u201csummer slump\u201d? For most Americans, the unofficial arrival of summer with Memorial Day is a cause for celebration. But for newly elected presidents, it\u2019s more often been a reason for dread. Sagging job approval ratings, unanticipated challenges at home and abroad and, above all, diminishing legislative momentum have been hallmarks of the first summer in office for recent presidents. The dynamic has afflicted presidents of both parties. But the problem was especially acute for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the last two Democratic presidents, who arrived in Washington, like Biden, with extremely ambitious legislative wish lists. During their first summers, both Clinton and Obama found themselves sinking into legislative quagmires that sapped their public support and energized their opponents. Biden has advantages Clinton and Obama did not: The economy is recovering faster today than it did for either of them, opponents have not mobilized as energetic a grassroots backlash against his plans today as they did in 1993 and 2009, respectively, and Biden\u2019s approval rating has remained remarkably stable through late spring, while Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s support (as well as Donald Trump\u2019s) had already started slipping by then.   But many observers nonetheless see Biden facing a similar risk of a long, draining summer as crunch time in Congress approaches on his sweeping infrastructure and human capital plans and a long list of liberal priorities that have passed the House (headlined by national voting rights legislation) stack up in the Senate with little chance of approval unless Democrats can somehow reach agreement on retrenching or eliminating the filibuster. Almost all recent presidents have seen their approval ratings sink from their inauguration through the end of their first summer in office, notes Brian Newman, a Pepperdine University political scientist who studies presidential performance. In Gallup polling, the approval ratings for Clinton and Obama fell by about 14 percentage points from the first survey after they took office through late August; George W. Bush and Trump (the only President to start with an initial approval rating below 50%) suffered declines at about half that level. George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan ended their first summers with higher approval ratings than when they began (though Reagan reverted to his starting point by the end of September). The trajectory wasn\u2019t identical for all of the recent presidents. Clinton, for instance, suffered his sharpest declines in late spring and early summer (right around now), and actually recovered some of his lost ground in July and August. Obama suffered more steady erosion through his first months; W. Bush bounced around the most (until his response to the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, catapulted him to an elevated approval rating he maintained for months), while Trump\u2019s numbers started very low (44% approval in his first Gallup survey) and edged into the thirties, a nadir that only Clinton also hit by the end of his first summer. Why is a summer slump so common for new presidents? Newman says the dominant answer among political scientists is shifting behavior among other political leaders and the media. \u201cEarly in a president\u2019s term, media coverage and many politicians from both parties stay relatively positive (or at least less negative than later),\u201d he wrote me in an email. \u201cOpposition politicians tend to mute their criticism, at least a bit, in the wake of an election defeat, offer mild assurances along the lines of \u2018let\u2019s wait and see what policies the new president will pursue\u2019 and maybe mention hopes of working together on common goals. Media coverage tends to follow suit such that the overall tenor of coverage is relatively positive.\u201d But with time, that deference dissolves. \u201cAfter six months or so, opposition politicians (and maybe even some politicians in the president\u2019s own party) have leveled more criticism and media coverage has become more negative compared to earlier,\u201d Newman added. \u201cWhen given more negative coverage and hearing critiques from prominent politicians, the public\u2019s support dips.\u201d Like a new car traveling a rocky road, presidents also inevitability accumulate nicks and dents the longer they stay in office. Nominations fail; scandals (of varying magnitude like Clinton\u2019s May 1993 \u201ctravelgate\u201d imbroglio) develop; controversies multiply (such as W. Bush\u2019s tilt toward social conservatives in his August 2001 decision limiting federal stem cell research). The worst damage is sometimes self-inflicted: Trump\u2019s \u201cvery fine people\u201d comments about White supremacist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, came during his first August. Every administration starts with news that gets covered as \u2018action\u2019 \u2013 executive orders, Cabinet slots being filled \u2013 all pushing a new agenda different than their predecessor. (But over time) executive orders run out and the action is replaced by transactional and messy legislative back-and-forth. Favorable numbers drop. Republican pollster Bill McInturff But perhaps the most common thread in the summer slump for these presidents is a shift in focus from executive action, which typically comes across as crisp and decisive, to legislative negotiation, which is inevitably lengthy and messy. As the veteran Republican pollster Bill McInturff notes, immediately upon taking office, presidents routinely unleash a flood of executive actions; when the White House shifts partisan control, that torrent includes reversing many of the executive actions taken by their predecessor. \u201cEvery administration starts with news that gets covered as \u2018action\u2019 \u2013 executive orders, Cabinet slots being filled \u2013 all pushing a new agenda different than their predecessor,\u201d McInturff points out. But over time, he adds, \u201cExecutive orders run out and the action is replaced by transactional and messy legislative back-and-forth. Favorable numbers drop.\u201d Long legislative fights during their first year have weakened presidents in both parties. Even Trump\u2019s approval ratings reached some of their lowest points ever as he pushed his effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in summer 2017. (The Republican-controlled House voted to repeal the law in early May 2017 but the Senate rejected the plan in late July.) Clinton and Obama may have suffered sharper first-summer declines than Trump or George W. Bush (who pushed little legislation after the passage of his big tax cut in May 2001) precisely because their legislative ambitions were so much greater. David Axelrod, the former chief political adviser to Obama and a senior CNN political commentator, for instance, says flatly that \u201cOur summer slump was directly related to the size of our ambitions.\u201d Clinton spent his first summer ensnared in the excruciating effort to pass his budget plan, which didn\u2019t clear the House and Senate until August 1993 and then only by a single vote in each chamber. Obama, after quickly passing his economic stimulus plan in early 2009, became bogged down in a summer-long negotiation between Senate Democrats and Republicans over his health care plan, talks that ultimately failed to produce a bipartisan agreement. While the health care plan stalled, the conservative tea party movement \u2013 in many ways the antecedent of Trump\u2019s preponderantly White, non-urban political movement \u2013 erupted in opposition to the proposal. Rowdy, sometimes threatening, crowds filled town halls for Democratic legislators that summer, their bristling belligerence foreshadowing the conservative turnout surge that swept the GOP to massive gains in the 2010 election. But legislative difficulties weren\u2019t the only reason the two recent Democratic presidents suffered the sharpest first-summer declines. Clinton faced a headwind during his first months because the economy was only slowly recovering from a recession, while Obama faced a gale in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the nation\u2019s worst economic downturn since the Depression. Police accountability provisions hold up reform while activists grow frustrated \u201cFor Clinton and Obama their \u2018recession\u2019 had ended but the recovery had not begun,\u201d says Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obama\u2019s chief of staff and a senior White House adviser to Clinton. Bush and Trump, the two most recent Republican presidents, inherited economies on stronger trajectories. With the economy steadily recovering from the pandemic, Biden is in a stronger position on that front than either Clinton or Obama. And Republicans so far have failed to mobilize against him anything like the grassroots resistance from the tea party or even the eventual uprising from gun owners, small business groups and conservative Christians that coalesced against Clinton. Even so, Biden is clearly following down the tracks laid by Clinton and Obama into a summer of difficult legislative combat. Biden, notably, has deferred a big fight on health care \u2013 the issue that ignited such volcanic conservative opposition to Clinton and Obama. But, overall, Democrats now are seeking to pass legislation on an even broader range of issues than in either of those presidencies at this point. The priority list for Biden and congressional Democrats ranges from his proposals for massive new spending on physical infrastructure, education and the child tax credit to a long list of non-economic priorities that have already passed the House, including voting rights, citizenship for young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, LGBTQ rights, gun control and policing. The Clinton and Obama experiences during their difficult first summers offer complex lessons for Biden today. Clinton ultimately passed his economic agenda through the special budget reconciliation process without any Republican support by unifying just enough Democrats in each chamber. Obama initially chose the opposite route on his health care plan: He let Senate Democrats spend months in negotiations seeking agreement with Republicans, while the bill lost momentum and opponents mobilized. Eventually, Obama was also forced to pass his Affordable Care Act without support from a single Republican in either chamber. Biden now stands at the crossroads between those two precedents. In an echo of Obama\u2019s experience on health care, Biden has spent weeks trying to negotiate an agreement on his physical infrastructure plan with Republicans. But he\u2019s facing rising calls from congressional Democrats to truncate those talks and seek to pass the bill on a party-line basis through reconciliation, as Clinton did. Cutting a deal offers Biden the chance to notch a legislative victory and show progress on one of his core campaign promises \u2013 proving he can bring the parties together \u2013 but at the cost of what would likely be a significant retrenchment of his plans. Trying to pass a bill with support only from Democrats might eventually allow Biden to achieve much more of his policy goals, but at the cost of a summer of heightened partisan conflict and weeks of precarious congressional wrangling \u2013 the formula that has damaged so many previous presidents. Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the deputy assistant for domestic policy during Clinton\u2019s first year, believes Biden and Democrats would be best served by taking a deal, even if it substantially retrenches his plan. \u201cIf he could get agreement on a $1 trillion or $1.1 trillion traditional infrastructure bill that would be what he called on another occasion \u2018a big f-ing deal,\u2019 \u201d Galston says. While that might mean postponing or downscaling some of the priorities Biden has identified, Galston adds, it would allow him to say that \u201cafter decades\u201d of partisan conflict, \u201cI have put together what people said couldn\u2019t be done, a coalition spanning the parties.\u201d Besides, Galston continues, even if Biden chooses to pursue a Democrats-only strategy it\u2019s not clear that he can secure support from all 50 Senate Democrats \u2013 particularly Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2013 for an infrastructure package nearly as expansive as he proposed. Biden also faces the issue of how often he can pressure Manchin, Sinema and perhaps other Democratic Senate moderates to provide him with decisive votes on legislation opposed by every Senate Republican. The two already enabled him to pass his $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan on an entirely party-line Senate vote. The fear among some Democrats is that if Biden also asks them to pass his infrastructure plan on a purely party-line vote, he might not be able to go back to that well on other issues for which bipartisan agreement is considerably less likely, particularly legislation to establish a national floor of voting rights that would override some of the restrictions on ballot access that red states are passing. Axelrod agrees that on balance those considerations should push Biden toward accepting an infrastructure deal with Senate Republicans, if at all possible. \u201cThat would be important for Manchin because then he can point to it and say we did find common ground, the administration did stay at the table, they did show their good faith,\u201d Axelrod told me. If Manchin can tout such a deal, Axelrod adds, that might it easier for him to differentiate Republican resistance to voting rights as unreasonable partisanship \u2013 and thus make it easier for him to support such legislation, even if that requires exempting it from a certain GOP filibuster.   \u201cIf you get this infrastructure deal you may then be able to get Manchin to vote for a carve-out on issues that relate to issues on voting and elections,\u201d says Axelrod. However the legislative fights unfold this summer, public attitudes about each new president are so polarized along party lines that Biden\u2019s approval rating, which has remained quite steady at slightly more than 50%, may not oscillate as much as previous presidents\u2019 did. \u201cThat variability has definitely declined,\u201d says Newman. But the serious possibility that Republicans could regain at least the House in 2022 \u2013 the GOP needs only five seats to regain the majority and the president\u2019s party has lost at least that many in almost all midterm elections since 1870 \u2013 adds an enormous sense of urgency to the administration\u2019s choices. Adding even more urgency are the signs proliferating in red states and in Washington that much of the GOP coalition is willing to weaken the core pillars of American democracy to obtain power, where and when it has the leverage to do so. The Trump-inspired retreat from democracy spreading in the GOP leaves Biden facing complex decisions few presidents have confronted. On one hand, polls show a clear public desire for greater bipartisan cooperation; on the other, civil rights and voting rights groups are raising unprecedented alarms about the threat to democracy that\u2019s spreading in Republican-controlled states. To the frustration of many activists, Biden so far has put much more emphasis on negotiating with Republicans over his economic plans than condemning their actions on voting. That approach could prove successful on both fronts, if Biden achieves a bipartisan infrastructure deal that also encourages Manchin and Sinema to act on a party-line basis to protect voting rights. But his outreach just as easily could yield a stalemate or disappointing results on both issues. Either way, like his predecessors, Biden will likely find the steamy months of his first White House summer to be the blazing crucible that shapes his first term.",

            "article_content": "The top Republican in the House of Representatives said he doesn\u2019t think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election \u2013 even as many Republicans continued to publicly question the legitimacy of the presidential election. A prominent Republican senator claimed that Democrats wrote a bill to register millions of undocumented immigrants to vote \u2013 even though the bill explicitly and repeatedly says only US citizens would be eligible to register. A bunch of other Republican legislators made brazen attempts to rewrite the reality of the Capitol insurrection \u2013 even though we saw what happened with our own eyes. That all happened this week. And that wasn\u2019t all that happened. More than three months after President Donald Trump left office, members of his party continue to utter the kind of wildly dishonest claims that Trump himself was known for. Here is a quick roundup of some of the false and misleading claims Republicans in Congress made this week. After meeting with Biden and other congressional leaders on Wednesday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy claimed that \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. I think that is all over with. We\u2019re sitting here with the President today.\u201d Facts First: McCarthy\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Many Republicans continue to groundlessly question the legitimacy of the presidential election. One of them is former President Donald Trump \u2013 who issued a Monday statement that falsely alleged the election had been marred by \u201cthe greatest Election Fraud in the history of our Country,\u201d a Thursday statement that falsely alleged it was a \u201ccorrupt, third world election\u201d and a Friday statement that falsely alleged \u201cthe election was rigged and stolen.\u201d McCarthy was responding to a question about Rep. Elise Stefanik, who was about to be elevated to a party leadership position. Stefanik herself continues to groundlessly question the election\u2019s legitimacy, telling a Washington Examiner interviewer on Monday that there were \u201celection irregularities,\u201d \u201cunconstitutional overreach\u201d and a \u201clack of ballot security.\u201d South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman suggested Wednesday, at a House hearing on the insurrection, that we don\u2019t know whether it was actually Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol. Reading from a timeline of January 6, which said that \u201cTrump supporters\u201d breached the steps of the Capitol at 2:07 pm, Norman interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t know who did a poll that it\u2019s Trump supporters.\u201d Facts First: This is nonsense. As CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen noted on Twitter, participants in the insurrection wore Trump gear, flew Trump flags and chanted pro-Trump slogans. Numerous participants have said \u2013 in media interviews, social media posts and interviews with federal investigators \u2013 that they are Trump supporters. Also, Trump had asked supporters to come to Washington on January 6, then said in a January 6 video message directed to people at the Capitol \u2013 officially aimed at getting them to leave the building \u2013 that \u201cI know your pain,\u201d that \u201cwe love you,\u201d and that the election was stolen from \u201cus.\u201d We can\u2019t speak for the political views of every single participant, especially because not everyone involved has been publicly identified. But there\u2019s no question that this was a riot overwhelmingly perpetrated by Trump fans. On the House floor on Friday, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert downplayed the events of January 6. Gohmert said that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that \u201cthis was an armed insurrection.\u201d He then clarified that he meant \u201carmed\u201d to refer to firearms in particular, claiming \u201cthere were no firearms.\u201d Facts First: There is extensive evidence that participants in the insurrection were armed; people involved carried a wide variety of weapons or objects they used as weapons, from bear spray to a stun gun to a baseball bat to a flagpole. As for guns, one man has been charged with having a loaded gun on Capitol grounds that day. Another man has been accused of parking a pickup truck filled with Molotov cocktails, an assault rifle and a handgun two blocks from the Capitol that day. He has also been accused of illegally carrying a handgun in Washington, DC, that day without a license. It\u2019s also worth noting that many participants in the riot were allowed to leave the Capitol on January 6, without being searched, before being arrested in the following months after returning home \u2013 so the absence of numerous immediate gun charges is not definitive proof that there were \u201cno firearms\u201d on Capitol grounds that day. Prosecutors have alleged that one participant claimed in a secretly recorded conversation that he was carrying a gun that day and that others around him were too. Prosecutors have also alleged that members of the Oath Keepers paramilitary group likely stored weapons at a hotel in nearby Arlington, Virginia, as part of an alleged plan to have an armed rapid-response force at the ready. Here are some false and misleading Republican claims we fact checked in previous articles this week:",

            "article_content": "A bust in the latest US government jobs report is electrifying the Washington battle over Joe Biden\u2019s massively ambitious programs and offering an early hint of the political peril the President could face if the economy doesn\u2019t bounce back strongly. The data, showing 266,000 new positions were added in April, a quarter of the number analysts had expected, had the effect of convincing both Republican and Democratic lawmakers \u2013 who return to Washington this week \u2013 that their dueling economic and political positions are justified. The report will further juice an already tense atmosphere in Washington as divisions are hardening after Biden\u2019s first 100 days in office. The President will deliver remarks on the economy Monday, then host the four top leaders of the House and Senate for talks for the first time on Wednesday. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will attend the meeting just days after saying 100% of his focus is on obstructing the new presidency. The White House is, meanwhile, readying a strong push for Biden\u2019s infrastructure package. The plan\u2019s billing as a massive jobs package will take on even more resonance given the invigorated debate about unemployment. It\u2019s always unwise to draw sweeping conclusions about any single employment report \u2014 especially as there are other statistical and anecdotal signs that the economy may be poised for a post-pandemic boom. But try telling that to Washington politicians who are on hair trigger alert for any development that might define the early months of a new administration.   The GOP pounced, as it seeks to build public mistrust of Biden\u2019s economic policies, arguing that his strategy of spending trillions of dollars in big federal programs is already proving to be counterproductive. The below-expectations report also offered the party an issue to unite around that did not involve the internal recriminations over an attempt by House Republicans to oust Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from her leadership position over her refusal to buy ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud, which will take center stage with a conference vote likely this week. Democrats seized on the same evidence that Republicans claim show Biden is damaging the economy to argue that the government must double down on efforts to help less well-off Americans still mired in the pandemic\u2019s economic dislocation. That group has historically benefited less from previous recoveries than wealthier Americans and is the key constituency that the President is targeting in the broadest attempt to remake the economy in decades. White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients styled the report as a blip in a generally positive trend, following a bumper report in March that blew past expectations and showed that 916,000 jobs were created, although that has since been revised downward to 770,000. \u201cWe\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Zients told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, hit back at claims by Republicans that unemployment benefits provided under Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan were convincing many Americans not to go back to work \u2014 after a group of GOP governors announced they would block the extended federal help. Biden tries to sell his agenda while Republicans go after their own \u201cI will tell you we may be talking about the big lie as it relates to the election, but very close to that is this notion that people don\u2019t want to work. I have not met any of those people who don\u2019t want to work,\u201d Clyburn said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that it was appropriate for governors in some regions to respond to their local jobs market. But she also criticized the rationale of the Republican argument that unemployment benefits were stopping people from going back to work. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the data which would suggest that that\u2019s the reason people are out of work,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cWe have to remember that, when the President moved to make this happen, this unemployment insurance has been a lifeline, a survival lifeline for so many Americans,\u201d she added. With Biden gearing up for a bipartisan push on the next phase of his economic agenda, Republicans seized on the disappointing numbers released Friday to claim that Biden\u2019s big spending ways are already damaging the economy and that his plans to raise corporate taxes to pay for a broad infrastructure overhaul would crimp growth. They are also demanding the end of all social distancing measures even in areas where the pandemic is still raging. Why Republicans are ready to kill the $300 pandemic unemployment boost \u201cIf Joe Biden had done nothing, the jobs report would be greater and more people would be in work today,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on Fox News. Republicans, enjoying the luxury of being in the opposition, are making politically expedient arguments that fit their ideology. Before the jobs report, they were saying the economy was doing so well that further big-ticket government spending is unnecessary. Now they are arguing that extended federal unemployment benefits are stopping people from getting back to work. The group of GOP governors slashing the $300 weekly in extended unemployment benefits are trying to force people back to work in low-wage jobs. Utah\u2019s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox told Tapper that cutting those benefits was \u201ca good idea.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of those funds were absolutely critical during the pandemic, as we struggled. Now we\u2019re towards the end of the pandemic. And here in Utah, our unemployment is at 2.9%, the lowest in the nation,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThe biggest problem we have right now in the state of Utah are finding workers for the jobs that are available.\u201d As the economy continues to open up, more vaccines go into arms, and the country is poised for a strong summer of travel, it\u2019s possible that future Labor Department jobs reports will show significant improvements. But Friday\u2019s shock news also suggested there are unique circumstances at play in a post-pandemic economy that are not usually in the mix after a recession. Given still genuine fears about public health and with the virus still at high levels, it would not be surprising if some workers in close to minimum wage positions feel safer continuing to draw unemployment benefits \u2014 even with more and more Americans taking advantage of vaccines. Sectors including the restaurant industry, which relies on intense, grueling and often poorly paid work, are having huge difficulties in attracting sufficient staff to operate fully. While Republicans say that the answer is to cut benefits, Democrats, including in the Biden White House, stress that such conditions are exactly the reason why vulnerable industries, like the hospitality trade, need public support. Biden spent time last week, for instance, promoting a program specifically aimed at helping the restaurant trade through a still tricky period. Biden's economic agenda isn't quite as 'transformational' as it seems The new unemployment report could actually add some momentum to Biden\u2019s warnings that an aggressive government effort is needed to ensure that the economy better caters to the needs of the less well off. Biden is asking Congress to spend tens of billions of dollars, for instance, on free childcare and home health care for sick and elderly Americans that can help their relatives, who currently look after them, back into the work force. \u201cThe number one reason now that people aren\u2019t going back to work is what you said, fear, or they can\u2019t find childcare or schools are still closed,\u201d Raimondo said on CBS on Sunday. The jobs report was one of the few occasions in his first months in office where Biden has suffered setbacks with polls showing most Americans favor his management of the pandemic. Republicans have sought political advantage on another such issue \u2013 overly high numbers of undocumented child migrants flowing over the US border with Mexico. It is unclear whether one single jobs report has the capacity to alter the delicate political dynamics the President faces. He may get some political insulation from the fact that 54% of Americans in the latest CNN/SSRS poll see the state of the economy as good. That number is up significantly from 43% three months ago and far higher than it was under Trump in May 2020. Still, the dynamics of power in Washington, with tiny Democratic majorities in the Senate and the House, mean that a prolonged slowdown in jobs growth could make tougher the President\u2019s task of getting moderate Democrats like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to back his expansive agenda. And the multi-trillion-dollar gamble that Biden is making could end up leaving him politically exposed unless the economy delivers in the run-up to the midterm elections next year, when the party out of the White House almost always gains seats following a change in administration. A strong economy is one way Biden may be able to buck that trend, though it remains to be seen whether pocketbook issues even in a good environment will overcome the cultural arguments that Trump used to earn his bond with grassroots conservative voters.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The GOP\u2019s identity crisis is entering a pernicious new phase for Republicans who won\u2019t live in former President Donald Trump\u2019s alternate reality, push his big lie and rewrite history. \u201cThe Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!\u201d Trump declared in a statement Monday. The layers are thick; he\u2019s calling the election a lie because he can\u2019t or won\u2019t admit defeat, and in the process weaving the biggest lie around him like a security blanket. Cheney: What Trump did 'is a line that cannot be crossed' Facts are hazardous things for certain Republicans at the moment. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the most vocal truth-telling Republican, and so perhaps the most endangered, tweeted a new rebuke to the false narrative Monday. \u201cThe 2020 presidential election was not stolen,\u201d Cheney tweeted. \u201cAnyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system.\u201d Possible new challenge to Cheney. She survived a challenge to her leadership post as the third-ranking House Republican earlier this year. But patience is wearing thin among Republicans, according to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Alex Rogers. They write: Multiple Republican lawmakers and aides say that Cheney is on very shaky ground internally and whether she can hang on to her post in a secret-ballot election is highly uncertain. When Cheney easily survived a bid to oust her in February, (House Minority Leader Kevin) McCarthy came to her defense and called on the House GOP Conference to keep her in the spot in a speech delivered behind closed doors. This time, however, could be different. A House GOP source who has been in contact with McCarthy said the GOP leader has been \u201cfurious\u201d at her for weeks amid her comments about Trump. The Romney Republican era feels ancient. Add Cheney\u2019s peril to the boos and heckling heaped on Sen. Mitt Romney when he spoke in Utah and narrowly escaped a vote censuring him for his votes to convict Trump during the former President\u2019s impeachment trials. That\u2019s the most recent Republican presidential nominee and the daughter of the former Republican vice president on the outs with the party\u2019s base.   The ground is shifting under our feet. But the party has been moving in this direction for some time. Romney, although disgusted by Trump\u2019s antidemocratic power grab, courted some of the same sentiments that Trump pushed. He won the 2012 Republican nomination in part by pledging to be severely conservative and making life so difficult for undocumented immigrants that they would want to leave the country, for instance. Why can\u2019t we just move on? What\u2019s interesting is that even Republicans who voted to reject the Electoral College results, seem to want to move on from the Big Lie, even as Trump keeps pushing it. \u201cLook, Pamela, we\u2019re just so ready to move on,\u201d Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown over the weekend. She asked if he has regrets about joining the effort to throw out millions of American votes and the misinformation about the election that is still alive and well among Republican voters. \u201cI made a decision based upon the facts that I knew at that point in time,\u201d he said, arguing states improperly changed their election laws during the pandemic.  But anyway. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s time for this country to heal. It\u2019s time for a spirit of forgiveness to be happening. It\u2019s time for this country to work together and focus on the goals that we can solve together.\u201d Unintended consequences. Voters in Florida, Arizona and Texas won\u2019t be able to move on. Trump\u2019s big lie has led to changes in the way they\u2019ll vote. The Washington Post has an interesting look at early voting by mail, which historically benefited Republicans in Florida, and whether changes pushed through by the GOP-controlled state government could hurt Republican candidates more than Democrats. Poll watchers unleashed. CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten has a must-read look at the next phase of new voter laws spawned by Trump\u2019s allegations of fraud, by which Republican-controlled states would give new powers to partisan poll watchers to challenge a voters\u2019 registration and monitor voting in more obtrusive ways. The big lie worked. He\u2019s not President, but 70% of Republicans in a CNN poll in April said they don\u2019t think Biden legitimately won enough votes. That means despite all the fact checking in the media, Trump\u2019s big lie worked. What does the party stand for? Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had sought to start an America First in Congress to push Anglos-Saxon political traditions. That effort appears to have been snuffed out, but there is clearly desire bubbling out of the party to embrace racial heritage. That\u2019s not a good look, according to George W. Bush, the former two-term Republican president who was asked about it by The Dispatch. (Reminder: His vice president was Liz Cheney\u2019s dad, Dick.) \u201cIf the Republican Party stands for exclusivity \u2013 you know, it used to be country clubs, now evidently it\u2019s White Anglo-Saxon Protestantism \u2013 then it\u2019s not going to win anything,\u201d he said. What is real and what is imagined? Bush was asked about Taylor Greene\u2019s proposed caucus, but how far is the leap from Anglo-Saxon political ideals to the anger shown by Republican lawmakers at the 1619 Project, written to to uncover the paradox of American ideals of freedom being built upon the sin of slavery and now featured in some US school curriculum. 1619 is the year the first slaves were brought to North America. Countering the 1619 project was President Trump\u2019s 1776 Commission, which although it was ended by President Biden when he took office, submitted a 41-page refutation of the 1619 project on Monday. The Columbia scholar Nicole Hemmer writes for CNN that \u201cthe 1776 Commission\u2019s report insists that real history is history that focuses on the country\u2019s successes, with only an occasional nod to its failures.\u201d Focus on the freedom rather than the slavery, in other words. From there, it\u2019s much easier to simply write off racial injustice and severe inequality. But Hemmer also draws a line between the fight over how to teach history and a larger gaslighting of the American public. She describes them as \u201cpart of the alternative reality constructed by conservative media.\u201d She specifically cites Fox News personalities, but I also enjoyed this Wired takedown of the historical inaccuracies in Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s new book, which it argues raises some valid criticisms of tech companies today, but places them upon a complete misrepresentation of US history. It\u2019s arguably all part of the big lie, where facts are mangled to create a black and white reality.",

            "article_content": "With 10 weeks to go before New York City Democrats vote in their primary for mayor, the question dominating Big Apple politics is simple: Can Andrew Yang actually win this thing? The answer, to the astonishment of many, is yes. And with each passing day, time is running out for Yang\u2019s rivals \u2013 a diverse field loaded with governmental, civic and business leaders \u2013 to chase him down. In a year of death, drudgery and economic destruction, Yang, a tech entrepreneur whose moonshot 2020 presidential primary bid amassed more goodwill than votes, has distinguished himself from the pack with an uncomplicated message: He wants to make New York fun again. The defining clarity of his campaign has, for now, largely obscured the most powerful argument against it \u2013 that even for those who admire Yang\u2019s ambition and joyful candidacy, the 46-year-old is still a political newcomer and ill-suited to lead the city out of its worst crisis since bankruptcy beckoned in the 1970s. In an interview on Coney Island last week \u2013 one briefly interrupted when he obliged an onlooker\u2019s request to reenact the baby-punching scene from \u201cThe Campaign,\u201d a 2012 comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis \u2013 Yang dismissed concerns over his sometimes self-contradicting personal politics and lack of experience in government. His time in the private sector, launching start-ups and then running a presidential campaign, he argued, made him New York\u2019s best bet to juice the kind of recovery that delivers for both workers and their corporate bosses. \u201cThere are a number of people who\u2019ve been in government for years in this field, but many of us have felt let down by city agencies over the past number of months,\u201d Yang said. \u201cSo you have to ask yourself, do you really think that someone who\u2019s been embedded in these bureaucracies is going to be the best person to lead us out of this crisis?\u201d The stakes are stark \u2013 and Yang has sought to become a better-rounded candidate in his second campaign. His advocacy for a universal basic income and warnings that automation could decimate the American workforce, the pillars of the presidential run, have largely taken a backseat to talk about creating more affordable housing, attracting investments from business titans, who have threatened to flee if their tax burden rises, reviving the arts and restoring public safety. Here and around the country, the pandemic has laid bare old inequities and exacerbated others. More than 30,000 New Yorkers, a heavily disproportionate number of them from working poor, minority communities, are dead. Many multiples more are grieving. Even as the candidates spell out their post-Covid plans, the virus continues to spread, with new cases hovering at a dangerously high plateau. The city has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, countless small businesses, and even with the shot of financial adrenaline provided by the recent federal aid package passed by Democrats in Washington, the city\u2019s robust public sector \u2013 bus drivers, sanitation workers, subway operators \u2013 could still, in the absence of astute leadership, face devastating cuts. Yang\u2019s campaign likely hinges on undecided New York City Democrats, the largest bloc in every poll of the race to date, embracing a fundamental trade-off \u2013 by choosing an exuberant cheerleader over candidates with deeper understandings of the city\u2019s infinitely complicated levers of power. His rivals remain publicly confident that they won\u2019t. There are debates to come and millions of dollars of television ads to roll out. At about the same stage in 2013, the last open mayoral primary, Anthony Weiner was the favorite and future Mayor Bill de Blasio looked like an afterthought. Candidate Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer and former counsel to de Blasio, suggested in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that Yang\u2019s advantage in name recognition would fade alongside his lead in the polls. \u201cMy daughter had a Howard Dean Beanie Baby and that didn\u2019t help him,\u201d Wiley quipped. \u201cT-shirts don\u2019t win elections.\u201d The challenge for Wiley and others, in what could charitably be called an eight-deep field of candidates, is to figure out a path up or around him. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former police captain who advocated for reforms during his time on the force before serving as a state lawmaker, is widely regarded as best-positioned to overtake Yang, something even his top advisers acknowledged in a recent press briefing. Wiley and New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, along with former nonprofit executive Dianne Morales, are the liberal favorites, though only Wiley and Stringer appear to be in touching distance. Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation commissioner with a deep knowledge of city government, has lagged behind. So too have Ray McGuire, the former Citigroup executive, and Shaun Donovan, who served as commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development under Mayor Michael Bloomberg before going to work for the Obama administration. Both have independent expenditure groups ready to boost them as election day nears. \u201cRight now, there are so many candidates and so little attention being paid to the campaign because of other things that are going on \u2013 the pandemic, everything in Washington and (with the scandals surrounding Gov. Andrew Cuomo) \u2013 it\u2019s impossible for any candidate to communicate positions on issues to a large number of voters,\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. The draw of Yang, he added, was easy to name. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a happy warrior,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cPeople may well just be craving happiness. And I\u2019m not talking about a comedian. I\u2019m not talking about a clown. I\u2019m not talking about a demagogue \u2013 just somebody who likes people and likes life.\u201d Yang has mostly worn his frontrunner status lightly, pivoting \u2013 like the more seasoned politician he is now \u2013 from questions about the prospect of taking on such a heavy responsibility. But the historic implications of his campaign, which could end with Yang becoming the city\u2019s first Asian American mayor, have been heightened by a citywide surge in anti-Asian violence. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s affected everyone. But it certainly hits home for Asian Americans, who feel like our race is putting us in a position to worry more about being able to go on the subway or walk down certain streets at night,\u201d Yang said. \u201cSo I feel these issues very personally, but I think a lot of Americans do. It\u2019s just a really devastating time for the Asian American community.\u201d On the boardwalk at Coney Island on Friday afternoon, as some of those other candidates came and went to mark the landmark\u2019s formal reopening, Yang took questions from a smattering of reporters and few inquisitive cameramen. He said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the freshly approved New York State budget, which includes new aid to schools, a tax hike on the wealthy and financial aid to undocumented workers who had been excluded from federal legislation. The legalization of marijuana, which passed separately but almost concurrent to the budget, also got his stamp of approval. On the issue of his Nathan\u2019s hot dog order, he confessed to keeping it simple \u2013 ketchup and mustard, self-applied, declaring himself \u201ca little sauerkraut dubious.\u201d He then paid tribute to the rapper and actor DMX, a beloved New York native, whose death had been announced earlier in the day. When the would-be gotcha question came \u2013 what was his favorite DMX song? \u2013 Yang named \u201cRuff Ryders\u2019 Anthem\u201d and talked affectionately of the \u201cbad action movies\u201d he starred in. \u201cLike, good bad action movies,\u201d Yang clarified after being accused by a photographer of suggesting \u201cBelly\u201d was not, in fact, good. \u201cLike action movies that were in the target and I was very much the target during that era.\u201d That brand of gleeful, accessible campaigning was the trademark of Yang\u2019s unexpectedly strong presidential campaign, transforming him from a no-name gadfly to a regular on the debate stage. But the issues facing New Yorkers, in this race, are much different. Yang leads in the polls \u2013 and his every utterance is coming under harsh scrutiny from the other candidates, the press and skeptical voters. Lis Smith, a veteran New York operative who is planning to run a pro-Yang independent expenditure group, according to a source familiar with the plan, said the \u201cbiggest hurdle\u201d the candidate has to overcome is proving \u2013 again and again \u2013 that he could take a punch and stay on his feet. \u201cCould he withstand the scrutiny of being a frontrunner?,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe simple answer, so far, is yes.\u201d Yang\u2019s flirtations with a bid to become New York\u2019s 110th mayor began almost immediately after he exited last year\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. He seemed to be shying away from the prospect, though, when he signed on for a brief stint as a CNN political commentator and founded a nonprofit. By mid-December, though, the chatter picked up. Private conversations became public knowledge. Yang spoke to local leaders, like Rep. Grace Meng of Queens and the Rev. Al Sharpton, and eventually enlisted some of the city\u2019s top political operatives to chart his path. Then, on January 13, he made it official. \u201cSeeing my city the way it is now breaks my heart,\u201d Yang said in a video directed by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. In it, he introduced a signal endorsement, from newly elected Rep. Ritchie Torres, chatted with his wife, Evelyn, about his favorite sports teams (Mets over Yankees; the Knicks, in spite of himself) and school funding, ticked through his signature policy proposals and greeted passersby who, months later, still clamor for selfies and snips of conversation. But Yang\u2019s appeal on the street and its evidence in the polls also set off a backlash. On Twitter, he is under constant scrutiny from critics who question his knowledge of the city and commitment to its civic life. He was mocked for taking pictures in a \u201cbodega\u201d that looked more like a supermarket. And piled-on again after posting a snap from a subway line that didn\u2019t run to his stated destination. (His campaign subsequently told reporters that he transferred lines en route.) More substantially, Yang struck a nerve early on when he revealed that, at the height of the pandemic last year, he and his family left the city for their second home \u2013 a couple hours away, upstate. And his recent suggestion on Twitter that the city more strictly enforce rules against unlicensed street vending angered advocates who worry a new crackdown would target immigrant workers. Yang has also said he wanted to increase the number of licensed vendors, which could put him at odds with brick-and-mortar shops. (On Monday, he backed off \u201cthe sentiment as it was described on that thread\u201d and said he didn\u2019t view the issue as a \u201czero-sum game\u201d between vendors and retailers.) Under sometimes harsh examination from local media and activists, Yang\u2019s big ideas \u2013 guaranteeing a basic income for the half-million New Yorkers in greatest need, establishing a public bank, appointing a police commissioner \u201cwhose career is not primarily in law enforcement\u201d \u2013 can sound less inspired than half-baked. His plans to fuel an economic revival with public-private partnerships and skepticism over tax hikes on big businesses and the wealthy, coupled with distrust of his idiosyncratic ideological bearings, have made Yang an enemy of the city\u2019s ascendant progressive and leftist political organizations. The speed and sharpness of the attacks from his rivals has also accelerated as the election nears. Stringer recently accused Yang of peddling \u201cmunicipal Reaganomics.\u201d Adams, in perhaps the most heated back-and-forth to date, slammed his business record and falsely claimed Yang had \u201cnever held a job in his entire life.\u201d A spokeswoman for Wiley, responding to his call for de Blasio to slow the spending of federal stimulus funds, labeled Yang a \u201cmini-Trump.\u201d Asked on Friday about that particular turn of phrase, Yang half-laughed. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know how to respond to that,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI just find that very confusing. Genuinely.\u201d Yang\u2019s campaign has also aggressively pushed back on the assertion that handing him the city\u2019s top political job during a period of historic uncertainty could imperil its recovery. \u201cWhat is a risk,\u201d top Yang strategist Chris Coffey said, \u201cis doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same results.\u201d Whether Yang can maintain his lead \u2013 and bring in new voters \u2013 as the other candidates crack open their war chests could boil down to a few key strategic decisions by the remaining, undecided political movers in a city where the old machers, like the county parties, have mostly been relegated to the sidelines. The big labor unions have largely split their support among Adams, Stringer, Wiley and Garcia. Progressive groups seem to be hesitating, though, stuck between Wiley, Stringer and their affection for Morales. A number of increasingly influential, young, liberal city-based state lawmakers backed Stringer early on, but it is unclear if their support will help fuel a consolidation on the left. That uncertainty has been heightened by the introduction of ranked-choice voting, a system that typically rewards candidates who, even when they are not a voters\u2019 top pick, can maintain some level of popularity \u2013 and acceptability \u2013 across various constituencies. But there is no indication, at this point, that the candidates trailing in the polls are prepared to alter course and consider strategic cross-endorsements. The prospect of an anti-Yang coalition began to take shape on Tuesday night, though, when the liberal Working Families Party doled out its ranked endorsements. The top slot went to Stringer, a decision that strengthened his push to shore up the progressive vote, with Morales coming in second and Wiley in the third slot, a WFP spokesperson said. Emboldened by its staying power despite Cuomo\u2019s best attempts to unravel it, the WFP is one of the few progressive organizations with the name brand and grassroots power to drive support to one (or more) of the leading liberal candidates. \u201cThe @NYWFP and their affiliates are the heart of the progressive movement in our city \u2013 and I am deeply honored to have their endorsement for mayor,\u201d Stringer tweeted after the news broke. \u201cLet\u2019s win this for all the working people of this city!\u201d Last week, WFP state director Sochie Nnaemeka told CNN that the party\u2019s choice \u2013 which followed a process that included member surveys and a long interview and questionnaire process with the candidates \u2013 would be a pragmatic one. \u201cDuring a pandemic year, where candidates aren\u2019t campaigning traditionally, we need to have a real path to victory,\u201d Nnaemeka said. \u201cWe cannot solely make our endorsement about value signaling. It has to be about who is the best vehicle for the progressive movement, for working people in the city to have representation at City Hall.\u201d With the WFP\u2019s picks in, two more major dominoes remain to fall: The New York Times editorial board and the United Federation of Teachers, which has a losing record in recent elections but has seen its membership unified by the backlash over school reopenings. Yang\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, is projecting optimism while digging in for a dogfight. \u201cNo one here is going to say there is no way for us to lose this race. There absolutely is,\u201d Coffey, his strategist, said during a recent briefing. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather be us than anyone else.\u201d This story has been updated with further developments.",

In a defiant news conference the day after the vote, Cuomo brushed back suggestions that a progressive wave was sweeping the state. \u201cNot even a ripple,\u201d he said. But as the results came in on election night, they arrived with a warning \u2013 and a signal that the political dynamics in a state Cuomo has ruled now for more than a decade were beginning to shift under his feet. A slate of progressive challengers in state Senate races nearly wiped out a band of incumbent Democrats who had for years, up until a few months before the primaries, caucused with Republicans as part of a power-sharing deal that assured a GOP majority and kept the legislature at an impasse. The demise of the breakaway Independent Democratic Conference was not only a rebuke to the powerful governor, who used the gridlock to tighten his grip on power, but the early rumblings of a political earthquake now rolling through New York Democratic Party politics. A new generation of mostly young, diverse and progressive Democratic lawmakers, unbound to the traditional power brokers, entered the state Senate in 2019 determined to demystify its opaque machinations and hammer through an aggressive agenda that had been tied up for years in the capital. Within months, new abortion rights guarantees had been written into state law, rent stabilization rules were expanded, marijuana decriminalized and undocumented immigrants offered access to drivers licenses. The list goes on. Cuomo signed off on the new measures, but progressives insisted his support was largely driven by lawmakers who had backed him into a corner. As the governor now contends with a series of scandals that could derail his plans to seek a fourth term next year, or potentially result in his impeachment before he has the chance, New York Democrats are entering a period of upheaval unseen since the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. At the state level in New York City, which will elect a new mayor this fall, and throughout the party\u2019s traditional political power bases, leadership is either changing or in flux. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases are on the rise again and the roiling debate over how to rebuild a battered economy seems poised to create new alliances and further endanger old ones in an increasingly blue state. For some, it is an unraveling to mourn. For others, a renaissance to celebrate. But the transformation has been a long time coming. The demographic and ideological makeup of the city and some of its suburbs have been evolving for decades and the party machinery that zealously guarded the political pipelines has often failed to keep up. County parties in the city have suffered a series of embarrassing defeats over the past three years. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 2018 primary victory over 10-term Rep. Joe Crowley threw the Queens Democratic Party, which he chaired, into turmoil. Two years later, Rep. Jamaal Bowman shook up the status quo in the Bronx when he denied Rep. Eliot Engel, by then the longest serving New Yorker in the House, a 17th term. Months later, the Covid-19 pandemic arrived and, through successive cataclysmic waves, set the stage for a mayoral race in 2021 whose winner will inherit from term-limited New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio a shell-shocked city now beset by racist violence against Asian Americans. The city council is also poised to see historic turnover thanks to term limits, approved by voters two decades ago, that are now in full effect \u2013 leading hundreds of candidates to run for places on the 51-seat body. \u201cThere is a huge generational shift happening. The old guard is retired, being defeated or getting indicted and they are being replaced by younger people,\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. These are heady days for New York progressives, but in a mirror of the debate that consumed Democrats during the 2020 presidential primary, moderates are quick to warn that an unchecked left could threaten the party\u2019s foothold in less blue parts of the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough state, and you\u2019ve got to balance these various constituencies because you have Democrats from the city who are being pushed by the far left, or in some cases are members of the far left,\u201d New York State Democratic Committee Chair Jay Jacobs told CNN. \u201cBut you balance that with (the risk of) passing things that will put a target on the back of moderate Democrats who have a tenuous hold on their districts here in the suburbs.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s primary triumph three years ago stunned the city and state political establishment, including many outside organizations, like the Working Families Party, which along with union allies, parlayed the new sense of possibility \u2013 and a super-charged progressive grassroots \u2013 into a bull rush against the turncoat Democratic state Senate incumbents. The upheaval continued over the next two years with progressive and leftist candidates ousting incumbents and seasoned, machine-backed candidates up and down the ballot. \u201cThe defenders of the establishment were in denial for a couple of years,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Mike Gianaris, the deputy majority leader, told CNN. \u201cEveryone had an excuse for everything that was happening other than what was staring them in the face, which is that there is an energized movement of progressives that is now affecting results on the ground.\u201d The left\u2019s gains, however, exposed some deep-seated cracks in the traditional progressive coalition. In the run-up to the 2018 gubernatorial primary, the alliance of labor and community groups that made up the Working Families Party, which was founded in New York two decades earlier, blew up over the party\u2019s decision to endorse actor and activist Cynthia Nixon\u2019s campaign. Unwilling to break so spectacularly from the governor, who would end up spending more than $26 million on the race, the unions left the Working Families Party. Their defection underscored Cuomo\u2019s consuming hold on the state, but also signaled the opening of a gap between progressive and leftist groups, like the ascendant Democratic Socialists of America, and organized labor. The liberal revival, which had shifted the window of legislative possibility to the left, also exposed fundamental divides between the approaches favored by activist organizations and most of organized labor\u2019s largest political operations. That quiet rift is on display now as top unions have scattered their support among the New York City mayoral hopefuls and stand by quietly as New York Attorney General Letitia James investigates multiple claims of sexual harassment and other improper behavior against Cuomo. Even the most historically progressive unions, including those who backed challengers to the erstwhile turncoat Democratic members even after leaving the Working Families Party, have stopped short of calling for the governor to resign as they weigh their interests \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 during a period of remarkable uncertainty. The president of 32BJ SEIU, Kyle Bragg, told CNN that while the union has \u201czero tolerance for sexual harassment,\u201d it would withhold judgment on Cuomo until the state attorney general\u2019s probe had run its course. \u201cThere\u2019s an investigation that\u2019s taking place by a Black woman, who\u2019s our attorney general who carries the respect of many people in this state, 32BJ included in those ranks, and believe that she will do a very competent, thorough job of investigating that,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cAs she completes her investigation and we have access to the facts as exposed to through the investigation, we will be better positioned to decide what we want to say and do publicly about the governor.\u201d Cuomo has denied ever touching anyone inappropriately and apologized for making others feel uncomfortable. Whether the governor ultimately stays or goes, labor leaders suggested that their alliances with liberal groups going forward would be considered on a case-by-case basis. \u201cWe will always make decisions that are based on protecting the interests of our members. And that might not always align with other organizations. It might not always align with the WFP,\u201d Bragg said. \u201cWhere we can find places to work together, we\u2019ll work together. But it\u2019s not a formal relationship because my responsibility is to my membership. Not to any other organization.\u201d Hae-Lin Choi, the New York state political and legislative director for the Communications Workers of America, District 1, another traditionally progressive union, whose leadership helped found the Working Families Party, said the new dynamic posed difficult questions for her organization and others. \u201cWe have members to represent and institutional relationships to maintain,\u201d Choi said, \u201cand now that the field to the left has broadened, sometimes we\u2019re constrained in how far we can go.\u201d All through the state and in the city, traditional sources of power and influence are finding themselves either split or their standing diminished. County political machines in the city, for example, have been waylaid over the past few years. \u201cThe (county) parties have grown weaker in the city,\u201d said Jacobs, the state party leader. \u201cThere\u2019s no question \u2013 you see what happened to Joe Crowley, who was the chair in Queens, and you look at Brooklyn, which used to be the strongest Democratic organization in the country, perhaps alongside Cook County in Chicago, and you see how those parties have fractured. They\u2019re far less influential. They\u2019re not without influence, but they don\u2019t have the strength that they used to have.\u201d Their ebbing sway was underscored in 2019, when former Queens Borough President Melinda Katz, with the backing of the county party, barely scraped by public defender Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who fell only a few dozen votes short of an upset that would have rivaled Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, in a Democratic primary for Queens County district attorney. Cab\u00e1n, who campaigned with the support of the Working Families Party and DSA, is running again in 2021 \u2013 this time for a city council seat in Queens. If she wins, Cab\u00e1n will be among the most prominent new faces in the body, a traditional launching pad for ambitious politicians. New York\u2019s estimable Black political establishment, like the county parties, is also facing questions over its leadership amid a reordering determined as much by ideology as age and newly emerging pathways to power. Much of the old guard in New York has either stood by Cuomo or stopped short of calling for his resignation. Cuomo, in turn, has sought refuge in their embrace, appearing alongside leaders like Hazel Dukes, president of the New York State chapter of the NAACP, and prominent Black clergy. Former New York Rep. Charlie Rangel and state Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, a veteran city and state elected official, have been among the most willing and forceful advocates against calls for Cuomo to immediately step down. The two most powerful Black New Yorkers in Congress, Reps. Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks, have also refused to join the chorus. But even as Cuomo and his allies point to his strong standing among those figures and Black voters, as seen in recent polling, mostly younger and more progressive Black political leaders and activists have pushed hard in the opposite direction. Late last month, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams \u2013 who ran a strong but unsuccessful campaign for lieutenant governor in 2018 and is expected to seek higher office again \u2013 headlined an anti-Cuomo rally in New York City, where Citizen Action of New York political director Stanley Fritz accused the governor of using Black people as \u201cprops\u201d to distract from the scandals swirling around him and his top aides. Cuomo\u2019s fate has also become one of, if not the most significant, dividing lines in a large and chaotic mayoral field. Less than three months before the Democratic primary, businessman and 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang has emerged as the favorite, but recent polling suggests at least half of primary voters remain undecided. Yang\u2019s idiosyncratic politics have added another layer of uncertainty to the mix, but for now at least, his energetic, happy-go-lucky campaign appears to be outpacing other, more familiar contenders, like Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and Maya Wiley, a former counsel to de Blasio and chair of the city\u2019s police oversight board. Stringer, Wiley and others have called for Cuomo to resign. Yang and Adams have not, instead asking that he step aside during the investigation. The race, which will be determined with a ranked-choice vote, has been mostly driven from the headlines by the drama in Albany, making it difficult even for those paying closer attention to parse the candidates\u2019 messages. Community activists have been among the governor\u2019s harshest critics and their clashes are becoming even more fierce now as the state faces a deadline to agree on its annual budget, a legislative leviathan in which progressives want to include taxes hikes on the richest New Yorkers to help raise revenue to fund a post-pandemic recovery that prioritizes the public sector. The lawmakers at the center of the fight are many of the same figures who came into office over the last five years \u2013 a generation that ascended from the grassroots and fancies, rather than shies away from, challenging Cuomo and other establishment bulwarks. \u201cThere is no longer a center of gravity which solely fits within the Democratic establishment under Cuomo\u2019s thumb, but poles of power outside and leaders who have broad, popular backing of voters cheering them on,\u201d said Working Families Party state director Sochie Nnaemeka. \u201cThey are opening up the chambers to public view, shedding lights and forcing out of the darkness a lot of the shadowy figures that thrive in Albany.\u201d State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, both Working Families Party allies, have emerged as two of the governor\u2019s most aggressive critics. Their condemnations of Cuomo\u2019s bullying style of politics predated the current round of scandals. Nnaemeka compared the young lawmakers\u2019 \u201creally sophisticated use of social media\u201d to the pioneering style that Ocasio-Cortez has popularized at the national level. \u201cAlessandra Biaggi also uses social media to unearth what was meant to be hidden in the process and fundamentally forces her colleagues, whether they do subscribe to those type of politics or not, to act differently because they are now on notice,\u201d Nnaemeka said. Niou, who first met Biaggi in 2016 and officiated her wedding, arrived in Albany two years ahead of her close friend and political ally after being elected on the same night Donald Trump won the presidency. \u201cIt felt very weird. I couldn\u2019t even celebrate,\u201d Niou said of her first victory. \u201cI literally felt like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m definitely here for a reason.\u2019\u201d She now occupies the seat once held by longtime Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is serving a prison sentence after being convicted \u2013 twice \u2013 on federal corruption charges. While Silver became emblematic of the capital\u2019s pervasive culture of secrecy and double-dealing, Niou has taken special care to be hyper-communicative about nearly every decision she makes. When, at the beginning of the pandemic last year, she voted against giving Cuomo emergency powers, Niou explained in a video her frustration over the closed process, which ended with the legislature approving a measure many lawmakers had little time to consider. \u201cIt is easy to give up power during times of fear,\u201d she said then, \u201cbut history tells us that it is rarely easy to take it back. We, as the legislature, are supposed to be the check on this and here we are, ready to hand all of the power to the governor. In a day.\u201d More than a year later, Cuomo, even after the legislature clawed back some of the authority it granted to him last March, has largely dictated the pace of reopenings, which have continued to move forward despite a recent jump in Covid-19 cases, and the parameters of vaccine eligibility. The Cuomo of last spring, who was celebrated for his daily press conferences and the fa\u00e7ade of transparency he projected to the public, is in a very different place now \u2013 his poll numbers have begun to tick down, though they have not plummeted, and his political fate increasingly appears tied up in the results of a series of potentially career-ending investigations. In addition to the state attorney general\u2019s probe, the governor is also being investigated \u2013 on multiple fronts \u2013 by lawyers retained by the state legislature, whose findings could set off impeachment proceedings. And the US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, along with the FBI, is scrutinizing the handling of data surrounding Covid-19 deaths in long-term care facilities in New York, according to a law enforcement official. Asked if he expected Cuomo to seek reelection to a fourth term next year, Jacobs, the state party chair and a close ally of the governor, demurred. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know the answer to that question,\u201d he said. Should Cuomo resign, be forced out or simply choose not to run again in 2022, the upheaval of this year would be cast into overdrive. Over a decade in office, the governor has commanded state politics \u2013 even after his power was diluted by the progressive resurgence in the state legislature \u2013 with an unbending will. For a time, the way Cuomo projected his political will on state government and his reputation as a strict manager fueled his appeal with frustrated voters. His election in 2010 followed former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer\u2019s 2008 resignation following a prostitution scandal and the wobbly tenure of his successor, Gov. David Paterson, who served out Spitzer\u2019s term. \u201cAmong the political class, both Democratic and Republican, there was a yearning for strong leadership,\u201d Sherrill, the political scientist, recalled of the 2010 elections. \u201cEven people who had been subject to the Andrew Cuomo treatment in his years as his father\u2019s campaign manager were so happy to have somebody who could take charge that they willingly ceded power to him. And he used it very skillfully. He simply consolidated almost all power in the state by force of personality and by virtue of the absence of any serious opposition.\u201d Whether the progressive movement, which has often defined itself in opposition to the domineering executive, can stick together in his potential absence is an open question few are ready to breach. The splintering of the left in the mayoral race suggests that it will not be a slam dunk. The consensus, instead, is that predicting the future is a fool\u2019s errand \u2013 and that uncertainty is, for now, the only guarantee. Former state Sen. Daniel Squadron, whom Niou recalled being among the first of those who encouraged her to run, said the state is currently in an \u201canticipation stage\u201d and only seeing a \u201cpreview of the preview\u201d of what\u2019s to come. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tumult, a lot of headlines going on, but no shifts yet,\u201d Squadron said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming. The water has started to recede from the beach, but we don\u2019t yet even see the wave cresting towards us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Senate Rules Committee held a hearing Wednesday on a Democratic bill, called the For the People Act, which would make major changes to laws governing campaigns, voting and government ethics. Republicans have attacked the bill \u2013 also known as HR 1 in its House form and S 1 in its Senate form \u2013 as a partisan power grab that will damage the country\u2019s democracy. Democrats have argued the bill is needed to preserve democracy in the face of widespread Republican efforts to restrict access to voting. Here is a fact check of some of the claims lawmakers made at the hearing; the Republicans present made a larger number of checkable assertions about what is in the bill, so we checked more claims from them than from the Democrats present. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas claimed: \u201cUnder this bill, there\u2019s automatic registration of anybody \u2013 if you get a driver\u2019s license, if you get a welfare payment, if you get an unemployment payment, if you attend a public university. Now everyone knows there are millions of illegal aliens who have driver\u2019s licenses, who are getting welfare benefits, who attend public universities. \u2026 \u201d Facts First: It is not true that the bill automatically registers \u201canybody\u201d to vote. The bill does not change current law banning people who aren\u2019t US citizens, including undocumented immigrants, from registering to vote in federal elections. While the bill does require every state to adopt an \u201cautomatic voter registration\u201d system, it repeatedly makes clear that only citizens are eligible to be registered. The bill says people would have to affirm that they are US citizens before they were added to the voter rolls. It also says the government agencies involved in the registration process would inform only US citizens that they would be registered to vote unless they chose to opt out. And it says the agencies would be required to send elections officials not only people\u2019s names but also \u201cinformation showing that the individual is a citizen of the United States.\u201d The word \u201cautomatic\u201d in \u201cautomatic voter registration\u201d does not mean that there can be no verification measures. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson testified later in the hearing that her state\u2019s automatic voter registration system includes \u201csix checks\u201d to ensure that only eligible citizens get registered. It is true that there have sometimes been errors under state automatic voter registration systems that resulted in noncitizens getting registered to vote. But there have also been errors in states without automatic voter registration. Daniel Weiner, deputy director of the Election Reform Program at New York University\u2019s liberal Brennan Center for Justice, said in an interview that automatic voter registration \u201cincreases the accuracy\u201d of the voter rolls, \u201cnot the other way around.\u201d West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican, expressed concerns about the automatic voter registration provisions. Warner warned that the bill \u201coverrules checks and balances in our election security. It mandates AVR, including 16-year-olds.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. While it\u2019s true that the bill would require states to allow individuals as young as 16 to register to vote, the text explicitly says that nothing in the bill requires states to let individuals vote before they turn 18 \u2013 and that the bill has \u201cno effect\u201d on states\u2019 own voting age requirements. The policy of registering people before they turn 18 but not yet allowing them to vote, known as preregistration, already exists in several states in varying forms. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 23 states allowed individuals under 18 years old to preregister to vote as of February 2019. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia allowed preregistration at 16 years old, while four states, including West Virginia, allowed 17-year-olds to preregister. (The other five states have different age requirements.) Specifically, the West Virginia secretary of state\u2019s website says that people who are 17 years old and will turn 18 before the next general election can register. (It also says \u201c17 year olds may register and vote in primary elections if they turn 18 before the next general election.\u201d) \u201cThis bill is designed to get criminals to vote,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis bill says, \u2018If you\u2019re a murderer, if you\u2019re a rapist, if you\u2019re a child molester, we the Democrats want you voting.\u2019 \u201d Facts First: This needs context. The bill would not force states to allow incarcerated felons to vote. It would require states to allow people who committed felonies to vote once they are no longer incarcerated. \u201cIndividuals who have completed a felony sentence would have their right to vote in federal elections reinstated once they are released from custody or receive a probation sentence,\u201d Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, said in an email. \u201cStates would be required to notify these individuals of their re-enfranchisement.\u201d In a bipartisan vote on March 2, the House voted 328-97 to defeat an amendment from progressive Democrats to extend federal voting rights to people who are still incarcerated. Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi claimed that voter fraud is \u201crampant.\u201d Facts First: This is just not true. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 general election. Warner, the West Virginia secretary of state, said the bill \u201cbans ID laws.\u201d Facts First: This is false. The bill does not prohibit states from having voter identification laws. Rather, it requires states to give voters an alternative to showing the ID the states normally require \u2013 specifically, to allow voters who do not show ID to instead submit signed statements under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote. Critics are entitled to argue that this provision weakens or undermines voter ID laws, but it\u2019s just not true to say the bill \u201cbans\u201d such laws. For absentee ballot applications in particular, the law says states can\u2019t require any form of identification except for a signature or \u201csimilar affirmation.\u201d It says, though, that this policy has \u201cno effect\u201d on ID requirements for first-time voters registering by mail. And as the National Conference of State Legislatures notes on its website, state voter ID requirements generally don\u2019t apply to mail-in or absentee ballots anyway. \u201cMany states allow registered voters to request an absentee ballot completely online if they are already registered to vote,\u201d Weil said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, made a more nuanced claim than Warner did, saying that \u201cpopular policies like voter ID requirements would be banned unless states neutered them with loopholes.\u201d This claim at least hinted that the bill does not include a total prohibition on voter ID laws. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi said: \u201cAs I recall, a member from North Carolina, a Republican, was elected in a close election and was expelled or not seated from the House of Representatives because he engaged in ballot harvesting, which was illegal under the law of North Carolina but would be not only legal but required to be legal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\u201d Facts First: This is misleading. While the Democrats\u2019 bill would require states to allow voters to designate other people of their choice to submit their sealed absentee ballots for them, it would not legalize the fraudulent activity that allegedly occurred in this 2018 congressional race in North Carolina. Associates of a Republican operative in that race have said that they forged witness signatures on absentee ballots, cast votes in races that voters had left blank on unsealed ballots and were paid based on the number of ballots collected. All of that would be illegal under the Democrats\u2019 bill. In addition, the House of Representatives did not expel any Republican because of the election scandal, and it wasn\u2019t the House itself that decided not to seat the Republican in question. Here\u2019s what actually happened. In the US House election for North Carolina\u2019s 9th District, Republican Mark Harris received 905 more votes than Democrat Dan McCready. Because of the allegations against Leslie McCrae Dowless, an operative for Harris who ended up getting indicted \u2013 he said he had done nothing wrong, and his trial has not occurred yet \u2013 the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted not to certify the results. The board called for a new election, which was won in 2019 by Republican Dan Bishop. (Harris declined to run in the new election.) It\u2019s also worth noting that, according to a National Conference of State Legislatures web post in February, 26 states already permit voters to let someone else submit a ballot for them. Twelve of those states have limits on the number of ballots any one person can collect and return; the Democrats\u2019 bill would not allow such limits. McConnell, arguing that this federal bill is unnecessary, claimed that \u201cstates are not engaging in trying to suppress voters, whatsoever.\u201d Facts First: Since the 2020 election, Republican state legislators around the country have put forward proposals that would make it more difficult to vote. These include stricter identification requirements and reduced access to mail-in ballots, ballot drop boxes, early voting and voter registration. Here is a CNN look at what is happening. According to the Brennan Center, the legislatures with the largest number of restrictive bills as of February 19 were in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, which all flipped from electing Donald Trump in 2016 to Joe Biden in 2020. Criticizing Republican election proposals in various states, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said that \u201cthe most reprehensible effort of all might be found in Georgia, where Republicans recently passed a bill to eliminate early voting on Sunday. On Sunday, a day when many churchgoing African Americans participate in voter drives known as \u2018souls to the polls.\u2019 \u201d Facts First: This needs context. The current version of the Georgia Republican bill \u2013 which has not been passed into law \u2013 does not include a ban on early voting on Sundays. On March 1, however, the Georgia House did pass a Republican bill that would have reduced early Sunday voting. And before that, Georgia Republicans had initially proposed to fully eliminate early voting on Sundays. State Republicans have now backed away from these initial proposals for weekend reductions, though they are continuing to push voting restrictions of other kinds. They now appear poised to make both Saturdays of the three-week period mandatory for counties \u2013 at present, only one Saturday is mandatory \u2013 and to give counties the option of allowing early voting on both Sundays. Voting rights activists say there is an important caveat: The bill does not appear to require any weekend early voting in runoff elections. (Democrats won two Georgia runoffs in January to earn control of the US Senate.) We\u2019ll update this item if we get further information on the bill\u2019s runoff provisions. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Dianne Gallagher and Kelly Mena contributed to this item. McConnell said, \u201cThis bill is such an attack on citizens\u2019 privacy that even the left-wing ACLU opposes this bill.\u201d Facts First: McConnell has a solid basis for this claim: The American Civil Liberties Union publicly opposed the bill in 2019, warning, among other things, that it would unconstitutionally infringe on \u201cthe right to associational privacy.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth noting for context that the ACLU has since softened its stance \u2013 saying that while it continues in 2021 to have serious concerns about certain provisions of the bill, it has not \u201ctaken a public position opposing the bill\u201d as a whole this year, spokeswoman Gabriela Mel\u00e9ndez Olivera said in an email. ACLU lawyers wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post this month that they \u201cstrongly support many of the critical reforms\u201d contained in the bill but called on legislators to fix certain other provisions. The ACLU has expressed privacy concerns about a provision that would require the disclosure of the names and addresses of people who donate $10,000 or more to entities that make \u201ccampaign-related disbursements.\u201d The ACLU lawyers warned in the op-ed that such disbursements \u201ccould include paid political speech that discusses a public issue such as immigrants\u2019 rights, voting rights or reproductive freedom if the communication merely mentions a candidate for public office,\u201d and they said that groups working to advance civil rights through paid communications should not be \u201cdeterred from doing so\u201d because of a government-imposed funding disclosure requirement. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the committee chair, entered into the record three letters that she said were in support of the bill. One of them was from the National Disability Rights Network. Facts First: Klobuchar had a reasonable basis for her claim that the National Disability Rights Network supports the bill; the network sent her and the committee\u2019s top Republican member a letter that called the bill \u201csorely needed\u201d and said \u201calmost all\u201d of its provisions \u201cwill positively impact all voters in America, including voters with disabilities.\u201d However, as with McConnell\u2019s claim about the ACLU, there is nuance here. The letter also expressed \u201cgreat concern\u201d about the bill\u2019s requirement for states to use paper ballots, saying that any such mandate would mean \u201cthis important reform legislation could disenfranchise many voters with disabilities.\u201d (You can read more here.) Michelle Bishop, the National Disability Rights Network\u2019s voter access and engagement manager, said in an email to CNN that the organization does not have an overall position in support of or opposition to the bill.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Mo Brooks announced his campaign for Senate on Monday, placing his baseless opposition to the certification of the 2020 presidential election at the center of his candidacy. \u201cOur republic\u2019s election system, which is the underpinning of every republic, is under attack,\u201d said the Alabama Republican. \u201cIn 2020, America suffered the worst voter fraud, and election theft, in history.\u201d Brooks, 66, also lambasted cancel culture, \u201ctech censorship,\u201d the skyrocketing rise of the national debt, the media, transgender rights and undocumented immigrants crossing the southern border. He attacked the Biden administration\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill for providing $5 billion to farmers of color, claiming, \u201cThe socialist Democrat message: Whites need not apply.\u201d He then said that \u201call racism is repugnant,\u201d and said people should be judged by their character rather than their race. He then mentioned he \u201cled the charge\u201d to overturn the 2020 election, was twice endorsed by former President Donald Trump, that he stood by Trump twice during two impeachments \u2013 and that \u201cno other candidate\u201d can say that. \u201cMo Brooks is a fearless fighter who will not submit to the demands of socialist Democrats, weak-kneed RINOs, or to the fake news media,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cPlease help me take America back to the foundational principles that have combined to make us the greatest nation in world history.\u201d Brooks is immediately a leading contender for the seat left open by the retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby due to his strong connection to the former President\u2019s supporters. Stephen Miller, a Trump senior adviser, introduced him to the crowd. The business community abhorred the effort to overturn the 2020 election, and was shocked when the pro-Trump mob breached the US Capitol to stop the certification of the vote. Corporations suspended their donations to the 147 Republicans who objected. The simmering discontent could leave an opening for a business-friendly candidate. Other potential Senate Republican candidates include Business Council of Alabama CEO Katie Boyd Britt, who served as Shelby\u2019s former chief of staff, and Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill. But Republicans in the state say that those who can serve as Trump\u2019s tribute will win the primary and the seat in ruby red Alabama. The only Alabama members of Congress who actually voted to certify the election were the man Brooks seeks to replace \u2013 Shelby \u2013 and Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell. The five-term congressman\u2019s strongest competition may come from Lynda Blanchard, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Slovenia, who is less well-known but boasts the ability to self-fund her campaign. She and her husband John, the co-founders of a real estate investment management company and the anti-poverty 100X Development Foundation, donated more than $1.9 million to Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. Lynda was rewarded with the ambassadorship to then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s home country. Blanchard held a fundraiser last week at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida; the former President showed up and took a picture with her. \u201cI think the person that\u2019s going to win this primary is going to be somebody that is in that Trump-MAGA lane,\u201d said former Alabama GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, who ran for Senate in 2020. \u201cAnd so right now, just looking at the field, the two candidates that are the most likely to get in that lane \u2013 and be successful \u2013 are Mo Brooks and Lynda Blanchard.\u201d While Brooks blasted Trump in favor of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas during the 2016 presidential campaign, he quickly became a diehard supporter after Trump\u2019s victory. He ran for Senate in 2017 after Trump picked then-Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and came in third in the GOP primary with the support of conservative personalities Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. In 2020, Brooks became one of the first members of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of then-Democratic President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory. The night before the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, he tweeted that Trump had personally asked him to speak \u201cabout the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.\u201d At the rally, Brooks said, \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Just hours later, the pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol to try to stop the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s victory. After the insurrection, Brooks called for \u201cthe Capitol attack perpetrators\u201d to be \u201cprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d But he also falsely suggested that left-wing Antifa activists \u201corchestrated\u201d the attack. Two Democrats introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally. In a recent interview with CNN, Brooks offered no regrets for his remarks at the January 6 rally. \u201cI did my duty for my country,\u201d Brooks. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In an opinion article published on Wednesday, former Vice President Mike Pence did something he used to do in office: echo a lie from former President Donald Trump in a slightly more sophisticated way. Pence\u2019s op-ed, published on the Daily Signal website run by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, was mostly filled with attacks on a Democratic elections reform bill known as HR 1. But Pence also made claims about what happened in the 2020 election. Most notably, he began the article by claiming that the election involved \u201csignificant voting irregularities.\u201d Unlike Trump, Pence did not say the election involved significant \u201cfraud.\u201d But he left his vaguer claim about \u201cvoting irregularities\u201d wide open for readers to interpret as an endorsement of Trump\u2019s fraud lie. Facts First: There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Trump-appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray, who remains in the job under President Joe Biden, testified to Congress on Tuesday that the FBI is \u201cnot aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome in the election.\u201d Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr said in December, when he was still in the position, that the Justice Department had not seen any such evidence. And no court has endorsed the claim that there was major fraud in the election. Now let\u2019s turn to Pence\u2019s more specific claims about HR 1, which is also known as the For the People Act. The bill would make major changes to numerous elections rules; it also contains significant provisions on government ethics. Voter identification Pence claimed that under the bill, \u201cvoter ID would be banned from coast to coast.\u201d Facts First: This is false. The bill does not prohibit states from having voter identification requirements. Rather, it requires states to allow voters who do not show ID to instead submit a signed statement under penalty of perjury attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote. Pence could fairly argue that this provision weakens voter ID rules; Heritage Action for America, an advocacy organization connected to The Heritage Foundation, has argued that the provision \u201csabotages\u201d and \u201cundermines\u201d state rules. But Pence\u2019s declaration that voter ID would be \u201cbanned\u201d is not true. Undocumented immigrants and voting Pence suggested that the bill would allow undocumented immigrants to register to vote. Specifically, he claimed that by requiring \u201cautomatic voter registration for any individual listed in state and federal government databases,\u201d like the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare offices, the bill would ensure \u201cthat millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.\u201d Facts First: This is false. The bill does not change current law that bans people who aren\u2019t citizens of the United States, including undocumented immigrants, from voting in federal elections. The bill makes clear that people would still have to affirm that they are US citizens before they are added to the voter rolls. It also says that the government agencies involved in the process are to inform only US citizens that they will be registered to vote unless they choose to opt out. And it says the agencies are required to send state elections officials not only people\u2019s names but \u201cinformation showing that the individual is a citizen of the United States.\u201d It is true that in states that already have automatic voter registration, there have sometimes been errors that resulted in non-citizens getting registered to vote. But there are also errors in states without automatic voter registration. Daniel Weiner, deputy director of the Election Reform Program at New York University\u2019s liberal Brennan Center for Justice, said in an interview that automatic voter registration \u201cincreases the accuracy\u201d of the voter rolls, \u201cnot the other way around.\u201d Regardless: Pence was wrong in suggesting that \u201cany individual\u201d listed in government databases would be registered to vote regardless of their citizenship status. The deadline for mail-in ballots Pence wrote that \u201cstates would be required to count every mail-in vote that arrives up to 10 days after Election Day.\u201d Facts First: This is misleading at best. The bill requires states to accept mail-in ballots that arrive up to 10 days after Election Day only if these ballots are mailed on or before Election Day. Ballots mailed after Election Day would not be counted even if they arrived before the 10-day deadline. \u201cThis proposal does not allow individuals to vote after Election Day and would help ensure that all valid ballots are counted regardless of postal delays that are outside the control of the voter,\u201d Sarah Brannon, managing attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project, said in an email. Voting by formerly incarcerated people Pence wrote that the passage of the bill would mean \u201cfelons would be able to vote the moment they set foot out of prison.\u201d Facts First: This is correct. Under the bill, people who have committed felonies would be allowed to vote in federal elections unless they are currently incarcerated. \u201cIndividuals who have completed a felony sentence would have their right to vote in federal elections reinstated once they are released from custody or receive a probation sentence,\u201d Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, said in an email. \u201cStates would be required to notify these individuals of their re-enfranchisement.\u201d In a bipartisan vote this week, the House voted 328 to 97 to defeat an amendment from progressive Democrats to extend federal voting rights to people who are still incarcerated. \u201cUniversal\u201d mail-in ballots Pence claimed that \u201cthe bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots.\u201d Facts First: The accuracy of this claim depends on how you define the phrase \u201cuniversal mail-in ballots.\u201d Specifically, it is only accurate if you define the phrase differently than Trump himself appeared to define it during the 2020 campaign. Trump used the phrase \u201cuniversal\u201d mail-in ballots to criticize the states that sent a mail-in ballot to every eligible registered voter without requiring the voter to request a ballot. The Democrats\u2019 bill does not require states to send out ballots that voters have not explicitly solicited. Rather, the bill requires states to give all voters the option of requesting a mail-in ballot without an excuse. \u201cH.R. 1 would require a no-excuse absentee voting process for all federal elections. This is different from what some call \u2018universal mail-in ballots,\u2019\u201d said Weil of the Bipartisan Policy Center. Redistricting Pence said that, under the bill, \u201ccongressional districts would be redrawn by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.\u201d Facts First: This claim is subjective, but it\u2019s worth explaining what Pence was talking about: the bill proposes to end the practice of gerrymandering by state legislators. Under the bill, district boundaries in each state would be drawn by 15-member \u201cindependent redistricting commissions\u201d composed of five Republicans, five Democrats and five people unaffiliated with either party. What constitutes an \u201cunaccountable bureaucrat\u201d is up for debate, but the commissions are not designed to be filled by government employees as Pence\u2019s language may have suggested. Members of the public would be able to apply; political consultants, lobbyists and government contractors would be banned. Major democracies including Canada, England and Australia use independent bodies to draw district lines rather than allow legislators to do so. Undocumented immigrants and representation Pence said that, under the bill, \u201cillegal immigrants and law-abiding American citizens would receive equal representation in Congress.\u201d Facts First: True, but it\u2019s important to note that this is already the case. Under US precedent and law, congressional districts have long been apportioned based on total population regardless of citizenship status. While Trump sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the calculations, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in January reversing the Trump policy. Weiner of the Brennan Center said that Pence was \u201cdressing up the status quo as something new and nefarious.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The reeling nomination of Neera Tanden as White House budget director is highlighting the crucial early battles on Capitol Hill that will shape the future of the Biden presidency, the terrain of the midterm elections and the fate of the Republican Party. Two Senate committees overseeing Tanden\u2019s nomination postponed votes on Wednesday on whether to move her candidacy to the full chamber. The White House insisted it would not fold on trying to get her confirmed but her path forward \u2013 amid controversy about her past tweets slamming Republicans \u2013 is looking increasingly impossible. Aides to Joe Biden know this first big fight over a key nominee will help set the terms of the new President\u2019s relationship with Congress. The controversy shows how after four years of politics by tweeted decree in the Trump era, normal service is resuming inside the Beltway in all its brutal, hypocritical, and high-stakes glory as everyone with power tries to wield it to set the tone for the coming years. Other bitter confirmation hearings are turning into early de-facto fights on the great issues of the Biden era, like climate change and expanding access to health care. Republicans are meanwhile beginning to mobilize against Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid rescue package in the hope of billing it as an example of massive liberal overreach and winning a political payoff. Yet they are making a significant gamble. If Biden pulls the country out of the pandemic with the help of the bill \u2013 that is currently popular \u2013 the GOP will look mean and irresponsible. Republicans seize on Biden's domestic policy nominees as Tanden nomination in limbo The Covid relief plan is meanwhile stretching the papered over unity observed by Democrats in their election-year zeal to beat Donald Trump, with a split widening over including a minimum wage hike in the huge plan. The internal Democratic tussle begs many questions, including, when will Biden step in and impose his authority? How fair is he willing to appease moderate Democrats who want a watering down of some aspects of the package? And would any Democrat \u2013 however infuriated they might be over compromises made to either the right or the left \u2013 dare to break with their new President on the test of his power in a 50-50 Senate? The Republican Party is even more divided than Democrats. While some senators like Mitt Romney are working through principled objections to Biden\u2019s policies and nominees, Trump loyalists like Sens. Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and Ron Johnson are performing for their watching leader in exile and, perhaps more critically, his base of supporters. They are forcing their party into what may turn into a four-year fight over Trump\u2019s lies about an election he lost. The traumatic reality of Trump\u2019s legacy again reverberated through the US Capitol on Tuesday in a hearing that probed security failures exposed when the mob he told to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d invaded the corridors of power. \u201cThese criminals came prepared for war,\u201d said former US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund. The most important senator in Washington Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress has fallen foul of Republicans upset by her outspoken tweets and some progressives like Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders with whom she sparred as a senior aide to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. After West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat walking a tightrope over his deeply conservative state, said he couldn\u2019t back Tanden, her prospects of confirmation appeared bleak. But the White House is not yet willing to fold and is searching for a Republican to get Tanden over the line. The White House is not pulling Tanden\u2019s nomination for now. \u201cNeera Tanden is a leading policy expert who brings critical qualifications to the table during this time of unprecedented crisis,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN after the vote was postponed. \u201cShe also has important perspective and values, understanding firsthand the powerful difference policy can make in the lives of those going through hard times. She has a broad spectrum of support, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to labor unions, and has a strong record of working with both parties that we expect to grow in President Biden\u2019s cabinet as the first South Asian woman to lead OMB.\u201d Another under pressure Biden nominee, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland, who would become the first Native American Cabinet member if she makes it to the Interior Department, faced fierce attacks from Republicans during her confirmation hearing Tuesday. How to view the fight over Deb Haaland and fracking The GOP, with a clear eye on midterm elections that are usually tough for first-term presidents, is driving a case that Biden\u2019s climate policies \u2013 including a pause on new leases for oil and gas extraction on federal lands \u2013 are a massive job killer. \u201cWhy not just let these workers keep their jobs?\u201d Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso asked Haaland, as part of an emerging strategy by Republicans to leverage the hearings to highlight their own policy goals. Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell captured the underlying dynamic of the hearing. \u201cI almost feel like your nomination is this proxy fight for the future of fossil fuels,\u201d she told Haaland. In a fresh sign of tensions inside the Democratic Party, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard bearer for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, rebuked Manchin after his office said he had \u201cremaining questions\u201d for Haaland, noting that the West Virginian voted to confirm Trump\u2019s first Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who she called \u201copenly racist.\u201d \u201cYet the 1st Native woman to be Cabinet Sec is where Manchin finds unease?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. In another hearing, Romney pressed Biden\u2019s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, Xavier Becerra, on another defining disagreement between the parties: abortion. \u201cI raised a question about partial birth abortion that he chose not to answer. That is obviously a concern,\u201d Romney said, raising additional concerns about Haaland and Tanden. The hearings also reflected another dominant theme of the new administration. While there is fierce debate over their credentials, the ethnicity of Tanden, an Indian American, Haaland, a Native American, and Becerra, who is Hispanic, reflect the diversity at the heart of Biden\u2019s administration. Elsewhere in the Capitol on Tuesday, Republican senators worked through the intricacies of the budget procedure known as reconciliation, which Democrats plan to use to ease the Covid rescue bill past filibuster attempts. At their weekly conference lunch, the GOP caucus also strategized on how to challenge Democratic unity during debate on the package, CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox reported. In one possible troublemaking maneuver that would double as points on the board ahead of congressional elections in November 2022, Romney and Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton are working on a plan to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour on condition that there are mandatory requirements on business to discourage the hiring of undocumented migrants. GOP begins new push against Biden's relief plan as Republican leaders expect no defections in the ranks Their gambit followed Manchin\u2019s proposal to hike the rate to $11 per hour over two years. Neither suggestion is likely to be acceptable to progressive Democrats who are seeking to include a $15 per hour minimum wage in the Covid rescue plan. This could all be academic \u2013 at least for now \u2013 since both sides are waiting from a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian on whether including minimum wage changes is allowed under reconciliation rules. The White House added to the sense of uncertainty on Tuesday by refusing to say whether Biden would sign a bill that included the $11 an hour figure. \u201cThe President proposed $15 because that\u2019s what he thinks is right for American workers,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said. Tugs of war over economic policy and the shape of relief legislation \u2013 and ideological fault line issues like abortion \u2013 are necessary features of the adversarial democratic process. But some Republicans, who abetted the ex-President\u2019s assault on America\u2019s political system fraud, can\u2019t break the habit Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who led the charge in the Senate to stop Biden\u2019s legitimate election win, tried to re-up Trump\u2019s misleading claims that Biden wanted to \u201cdefund the police\u201d during a hearing on the nomination of attorney general designate Merrick Garland on Monday. Hawley hit back Tuesday at reporters who asked whether he was complicit in the riot after challenging Biden\u2019s election win. \u201cI would say that\u2019s absolutely outrageous and an utter lie and no one I think who knows any of the facts alleges any such thing,\u201d he said. Also in the Garland hearing, Texas Sen. Cruz complained about the politicization of the Justice Department during the Obama administration, ignoring former Attorney General William Barr\u2019s role in acting almost as Trump\u2019s personal attorney during the previous administration. And Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of Trump\u2019s favorite senators, on Tuesday used the Senate hearing into the insurrection to imply on the thinnest of evidence that the rioters who desecrated the Capitol were not Trump supporters at all, in referring to an article that suggested that security forces might have overreacted to the violence.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s choice for the nation\u2019s top health official largely avoided hostile fire from Republicans while testifying before the Senate Health Committee Tuesday, though several GOP senators expressed concerns about his lack of direct health care experience as well as his support for abortion rights. Xavier Becerra, who is California\u2019s first Latino attorney general, was tapped by Biden to be his Health and Human Services secretary in early December. Becerra, who would be the first Latino HHS secretary if confirmed, defended his health care experience in his current job and in his long tenure in the House of Representatives. \u201cI understand the enormous challenges before us and our solemn responsibility to faithfully steward this agency that touches almost every aspect of our lives. I\u2019m humbled by the task. And I\u2019m ready for it,\u201d Becerra said. \u201cThe mission of HHS \u2013 to enhance the health and well being of all Americans \u2013 is core to who I am.\u201d He is also set to testify Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee, which will vote on his nomination. As secretary, Becerra would play a key role in combating the pandemic, which has now claimed more than 500,000 American lives, up from more than 283,000 when he nominated. The Biden administration has been operating without anyone in the post for more than a month. Stressing that the nation\u2019s coronavirus response must be guided by science and by experts, he said backed Biden\u2019s Covid strategy and supported the President\u2019s plan to broaden health care access by building on the Affordable Care Act. And in largely amicable exchanges, he promised lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to work with them on health care issues in their states. Becerra, who referenced his upbringing as a son of a Mexican immigrant, also brought up his father\u2019s recent passing and his mother\u2019s access to health insurance when she fell ill. Several Republicans on the committee focused on Becerra\u2019s lack of experience in the health care field and his support for abortion and other liberal policies. \u201cMembers of Congress do not become subject matter experts just because they are members of Congress, just because they sit on a committee that has health responsibilities,\u201d said North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s ranking member. \u201cI\u2019m not sold yet. I\u2019m not sure that you have the necessary experience or skills to do this job at this moment.\u201d Burr also argued that Becerra undervalues the input of the private sector and has called for policies that would undo decades of investment in American biomedical research. Among the most heated moments of the two-and-a-half-hour hearing was Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s questioning of Becerra\u2019s vote against a ban on partial birth abortion. The nominee responded that \u201cas attorney general, my job has been to follow the law and make sure others are following the law.\u201d \u201cWe may not always agree on where to go, but I think we can find some common ground on these issues,\u201d Becerra said. Romney responded: \u201cI think we can reach common ground on many issues, but on partial birth abortion, it sounds like we are not going to reach common ground there.\u201d One of Becerra\u2019s highest-profile health care roles recently has been chief defender of the Affordable Care Act in court. He has also battled the health care industry to keep costs down for consumers. In 2018, he filed a lawsuit against Sutter Health, a system of 24 hospitals and more than 12,000 doctors in Northern California, for using anti-competitive practices to consolidate market power, resulting in higher health care prices. The attorney general secured a $575 million settlement that requires Sutter to change some of its practices. In addition, Becerra has been outspoken on the fight for women\u2019s health, the rights of undocumented immigrants and his support for Medicare for All. Becerra has so far avoided the fate of Neera Tanden, Biden\u2019s nominee for the Office of Management and Budget, who is facing public rejection from lawmakers in both parties. The White House said Tuesday it is standing behind her. Republicans have been targeting Becerra since his selection was announced. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton on Monday launched a digital advertisement in Georgia and New Hampshire tying Becerra to California\u2019s response to the pandemic \u2013 while pressuring any lawmakers up for election next cycle. Cotton has been campaigning against Becerra for months, highlighting multiple issues with the nominee, from keeping California\u2019s schools, churches and small businesses closed to his support for abortion rights. \u201cXavier Becerra is a radical liberal with no real public health experience besides enforcing California\u2019s disastrous lockdowns,\u201d according to a statement released by Cotton\u2019s office. \u201cIf confirmed, Xavier Becerra will put the health insurance we get at our jobs at risk. Any senator who votes for Xavier Becerra will face a reckoning from voters in the next election.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton\u2019s home state. This story has been updated with details from the hearing.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s nominee for the nation\u2019s top health position Xavier Becerra will stress his upbringing as a son of a Mexican immigrant, his father\u2019s recent passing and his history expanding health care access during his time as a longtime congressman and California\u2019s attorney general, in a pitch to senators at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, according to his prepared opening statement first obtained by CNN. \u201cI am here because my parents Manuel and Maria Teresa \u2013 who had only their health and hope when they settled in Sacramento \u2013 were tireless believers in earning the American Dream,\u201d Becerra plans to say in his opening statement. He would be the first Latino HHS secretary and served as the first Latino California attorney general. \u201cWe lost my dad last year on New Year\u2019s Day. When the end came, my Dad knew we were there with him \u2013 at his side, in our home. Sadly, hundreds of thousands of Americans haven\u2019t had that closure this past year. That, senators, is why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he is expected to say. Biden selected Becerra, currently California\u2019s attorney general, as his Health and Human Services secretary in early December. Becerra is set to testify before the Senate Health Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. Only the finance committee will vote on his nomination. His nomination has already attracted controversy, with Republicans citing his support for abortion rights and other Democratic policies. It comes as Biden\u2019s nomination for the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, is on the brink of collapsing, with at least one Democratic senator and a couple moderate Republican lawmakers announcing they will not support her. Becerra\u2019s pick has been controversial since the start, in part because he does not have a direct background in health care. \u201cI think it is going to be a lot of focus on his lack of qualifications. You have someone whose only experience on health care is suing people about it,\u201d a Republican aide familiar with the planning said. Tanden's OMB confirmation on brink of collapse after two GOP senators say they won't support her nomination The hearing Tuesday, however, will also give a snapshot into how some more moderate Republicans may approach the nomination as Republican Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski all serve on the committee. In private meetings, one aide familiar with the conversations said that the questions to Becerra have been less hard-charging and more specific to things members might need from the administration on health care. \u201cThis is one of the few opportunities for members,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIf you spend all your time trying to ding him or score points instead of asking for his help on some issues you care about, it could be a missed opportunity.\u201d Another source familiar with his remarks said their attacks are anticipated. But he\u2019s expected to defend himself against those critiques, explaining his nearly 30 years of career focus on health care including strengthening Medicare and Medicaid, and vow bipartisanship. \u201cThe mission of HHS \u2013 to enhance the health and wellbeing of all Americans \u2013 is core to who I am. When I was a child, my mom had a health scare: she was rushed to the hospital after hemorrhaging at home. The image is seared in my memory.  We were lucky: my mom is now 87 years old,\u201d Becerra is expected to say. As secretary, he would play a key role in combating the coronavirus pandemic, which is soon expected to claim a milestone of 500,000 American lives. The Biden administration has been operating without anyone in the post for more than a month. In his opening statement, Becerra plans to address how he, as attorney general, responded to the pandemic in his own state. Becerra will say that HHS has a \u201ccentral role\u201d in meeting the ambitious goals Biden set to battle the pandemic and do it in a bipartisan fashion. \u201cAs attorney general, I saw the importance of this on the frontlines. I worked with colleagues in other states \u2013 both Republicans and Democrats \u2013 to make COVID treatments more readily available. I am ready to work with you, our state and local partners, and across government, to get this right,\u201d Becerra is expected to say. One of his highest-profile health care roles recently has been chief defender of the Affordable Care Act in court. While the Trump administration joined a coalition of Republican state attorneys general fighting to invalidate the landmark health reform law, Becerra has led a group of Democratic attorneys general arguing why the law remains valid. At issue is whether Congress\u2019 reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional, which would cause the entire law to fall. In the past, Becerra has been outspoken on the fight for women\u2019s health, the rights of undocumented immigrants and his support for Medicare for All, making him a target for attacks from republicans and potentially more conservative Democrats. But the goal will be for Becerra to avoid the same reaction Tanden, who is facing public rejection from lawmakers in both parties. One source close to the White House, said they were \u201cconfident,\u201d with Becerra\u2019s nomination and ready to move \u201cfull-steam ahead.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general has been met well in meetings with dozens of Democrats and we are confident in the nominee,\u201d another source familiar with his confirmation preparation said. Republican senators have been attacking Becerra since he was nominated, but they alone don\u2019t have the votes to deny Becerra as Democrats are in the hold a narrow Senate majority with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the 51-50 tie-breaker. In a floor speech last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell highlighted Becerra\u2019s liberal leanings. \u201cCuriously, the President\u2019s candidate to run the Department of Health and Human Services is the famously partisan attorney general of California,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHis recent experience in health policies seems largely limited to promoting abortion-on-demand and suing groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, which dare to live out their religious convictions.\u201d Conservatives also oppose him because of his support of Medicare for All and abortion rights, with Heritage Action for America committing $600,000 to an advertising and grassroots campaign to torpedo the nomination. And on Monday, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas launched a digital advertisement in Georgia and New Hampshire targeting Becerra and tying him to California\u2019s response to the pandemic \u2013 while pressuring any lawmakers up for election next cycle. Cotton has been campaigning against Becerra for months, highlighting multiple issues with the nominee, from keeping California\u2019s schools, churches and small businesses closed to his support for abortion rights. \u201cXavier Becerra is a radical liberal with no real public health experience besides enforcing California\u2019s disastrous lockdowns. If confirmed, Xavier Becerra will put the health insurance we get at our jobs at risk. Any senator who votes for Xavier Becerra will face a reckoning from voters in the next election,\u201d a statement in the announcement read. CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A Cabinet nominee not making it to the finish line is a story as old as Washington. In the past, nominees have been forced to withdraw because of things like hiring undocumented workers or a questionable business deal or an unwillingness to be as transparent about your past life as our modern politics demands. But with Neera Tanden\u2019s nomination by President Joe Biden to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget, we may be witnessing the first nominee derailed by Twitter. On Friday, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin announced that he wouldn\u2019t support Tanden\u2019s nomination because of her past tweets savaging a number of Manchin\u2019s colleagues. \u201cI have carefully reviewed Neera Tanden\u2019s public statements and tweets that were personally directed towards my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from Senator Sanders to Senator McConnell and others. I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,\u201d said Manchin. \u201cFor this reason, I cannot support her nomination.\u201d   Manchin\u2019s announcement imperiled Tanden\u2019s nomination, as Democrats control only 50 seats in the Senate. With Manchin against her, Tanden now needs at least one Republican senator to back her nomination for her to make it. And early Monday morning, the Republican considered one of the most likely to back her said she would not \u2013 again because of Twitter. Here\u2019s Maine Sen. Susan Collins on her opposition to the Tanden nomination: \u201cNeera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency. Her past actions have demonstrated exactly the kind of animosity that President Biden has pledged to transcend. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Tanden\u2019s decision to delete more than a thousand tweets in the days before her nomination was announced raises concerns about her commitment to transparency.\u201d And on Monday, a statement from Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s office made clear that he would be a \u201cno\u201d on the Tanden nomination, citing Twitter as the reason. \u201cSenator Romney has been critical of extreme rhetoric from prior nominees, and this is consistent with that position,\u201d spokeswoman Arielle Mueller said. \u201cHe believes it\u2019s hard to return to comity and respect with a nominee who has issued a thousand mean tweets.\u201d While Tanden\u2019s chances are significantly less good than they were even 72 hours ago, the White House is insisting that they will continue to push for her to be confirmed. \u201cNeera Tanden=accomplished policy expert, would be 1st Asian American woman to lead OMB, has lived experience having benefited from a number of federal programs as a kid, looking ahead to the committee votes this week and continuing to work toward her confirmation,\u201d tweeted White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday morning after the Collins statement came out. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! It remains to be seen how long the White House will stand behind her. What\u2019s fascinating about Tanden\u2019s confirmation problems is that they are almost entirely due to her active and aggressive Twitter presence. She once referred to Collins as \u201cthe worst\u201d and urged people to pay attention to the \u201cenablers\u201d of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 listing a handful of GOP senators she thought fit the bill. Tanden, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, also battled it out with liberals via Twitter. \u201cYour attacks were not just made against Republicans,\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said during her confirmation hearings. \u201cThere were vicious attacks against progressives, people who I have worked with \u2013 me personally.\u201d Tanden did her best to distance herself from her Twitter persona. \u201cMy language and my expressions on social media caused hurt to people, and I feel badly about that,\u201d she said in her confirmation hearing. \u201cAnd I really regret it and I recognize that it\u2019s really important for me to demonstrate that I can work with others. I would say social media does lead to too many personal comments and my approach will be radically different.\u201d (Side note: Tanden clearly understood how problematic her tweets were going to be for her. As KFile reported late last year, she began deleting thousands of tweets from her personal account soon after Biden won the election.) There is, of course, hypocrisy here \u2013 particularly among Republicans, who spent the last four years saying they hadn\u2019t seen whatever the latest wild attack was that had emerged from Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account or that it didn\u2019t matter. That suddenly someone attacking them on Twitter is disqualifying for a job in a presidential administration is quite the double standard. That said, if Tanden either withdraws or is rejected in a final floor vote, it will send a very clear message to those with ambitions to wind up in a presidential cabinet one day. That message? \u201cNever tweet.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this analysis.",

            "article_content": "With the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump set to begin in February, nine prominent Republican lawyers, including two former officials in the Trump administration, have signed a letter urging GOP senators to \u201cconsider the evidence\u201d before deciding how to vote on conviction. The letter, obtained by CNN and organized by the nonprofit Republicans for the Rule of Law, is addressed to Republican senators and calls the impeachment article passed by the House a \u201cgrave accusation\u201d and says the trial is \u201cnot the time for petty, partisan politics.\u201d \u201cWe urge every Senator to consider the evidence presented by the House without prejudice or political tint, and with an open mind,\u201d reads the letter. \u201cWe particularly urge that, if the evidence supports a vote to convict the former president and disqualify him from future office, no Senator let partisan or electoral considerations alter that conclusion.\u201d Among the signatories are former Trump officials John Mitnick, former general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, and Robert B. Shanks, the general counsel for the Peace Corps from 2017 to 2020 and a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan. Mitnick was fired in 2019 after pushing back on a White House proposal to release undocumented immigrants into sanctuary cities. \u201cFor national security and the rule of law, it is necessary that former President Trump be held accountable for inciting the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol, the aim of which was to prevent the Congress from carrying out its constitutional function to count the votes of the Electoral College,\u201d Mitnick told CNN. Both Mitnick and Shanks say they support convicting Trump. Last October, they both endorsed Joe Biden for President in a statement organized by the anti-Trump group Defending Democracy Together and signed by over 70 former lawmakers and national security officials in past Republican administrations. The letter does not take a position on whether Trump should be convicted. Republicans for the Rule of Law is run by Republican operative Sarah Longwell and former Weekly Standard editor William Kristol. The group is affiliated with Defending Democracy Together and has advocated for positions in opposition to Trump, including running TV ads during the previous impeachment investigation calling on Republicans to seek out the facts. \u201cI think that for me, at least, the importance of this letter is to try to make the point that we are at a seminal moment in American history,\u201d Shanks told CNN. \u201cNo President has ever tried through force, threat of force, intimidation, to prevent a free and fair election from being consummated. It just demands consequences.\u201d Many of the lawyers who signed the letter served under previous Republican presidents, and several are members of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal organization. Among the names are former Justice Department officials Charles Fried (under Reagan), Donald Ayer and Stuart Gerson (under George H.W. Bush), and Peter Keisler (under George W. Bush); former George W. Bush Homeland Security official Paul Rosenzweig; former Reagan White House lawyer Alan Raul; and Marisa Maleck, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The letter is the latest example of how influential Republicans are lobbying senators ahead of the impeachment trial. The effort includes multiple former Trump administration officials, donors, former members of Congress, and current and former Capitol Hill aides \u2013 all encouraging Republican senators to vote to convict Trump. A set of talking points circulating among Republicans charges that \u201cit is difficult to find a more anti-conservative outburst by a U.S. president than Donald Trump the last two months.\u201d For Trump to be convicted, 17 Republican senators would have to join all 50 Democrats. While no Republican has publicly declared their intent to support conviction, several have denounced Trump\u2019s actions surrounding the January 6 attack on the Capitol. On the other hand, an increasing number of Senate Republicans have said they oppose convicting Trump, and loyalists to Trump have argued in the conservative media against taking a stand against the former President. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, has signaled his openness to vote for conviction. In a deal struck Friday between McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the ceremonial functions of the impeachment trial will occur this week, with the articles being presented to the Senate on Monday and senators being sworn in as jurors on Tuesday. Then the trial will pause, while the House impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s legal team exchange pre-trial briefs for two weeks. The final briefs would be due on February 9, allowing the trial itself to begin. Some of the debate among Republicans in the Senate concerns whether it is constitutional to convict a former President who has already left office. Republican senators who have said they will vote to acquit cite a Jan. 12 op-ed in The Washington Post by former federal judge and conservative legal luminary J. Michael Luttig, who writes that an impeachment trial after Trump left office would be unconstitutional. \u201cI think a lot of people would like a reason not to convict,\u201d said a former Republican Senate staffer. But other Republican legal experts are pushing back with GOP senators. \u201cIt feels like the weight of the energy in Washington with legal conservatives is pretty strongly in favor of impeachment,\u201d said Gregg Nunziata, a former counsel to the Senate Republican conference who has reached out to senators himself. And Mitnick told CNN that he concurs with a recent letter signed by more than 150 constitutional scholars arguing the Senate can convict a former federal official who has been impeached by the House. \u201cDespite the expiration of President Trump\u2019s term of office, the Senate may lawfully take up the article of impeachment, try and convict him, and disqualify him from holding future office,\u201d Mitnick said.

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s a timeline of key events involving Trump and the Supreme Court over the past four years: Jan. 20: Chief Justice John Roberts administers the oath of office to President Donald Trump, who swears to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Jan. 27: Trump signs an executive order for a new travel ban, a key provision of which bars foreigners from seven countries, most of them majority-Muslim. Jan. 31: Trump nominates Neil Gorsuch, a judge on a Denver-based US appeals court, for the Supreme Court vacancy that has been open since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. Trump transformed the Supreme Court that mostly helped advance his agenda Feb. 3: US District Court James Robart temporarily blocks the Muslim travel ban. The next day, Trump calls Robart a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and says, \u201cif something happens blame him and the court system.\u201d (Litigation over the travel ban continues, and the administration twice amends the order before the case reaches the Supreme Court.) March 16: Appeals court Judge Jay Bybee, an appointee of President George W. Bush, implicitly calls out Trump\u2019s tirade against Robart and other judges: \u201cThe personal attacks on the distinguished district judge (Robart) and our colleagues were out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourse \u2013 particularly when they came from the parties. \u2026 Such personal attacks treat the court as though it were merely a political forum in which bargaining, compromise, and even intimidation are accepted principles.\u201d April 7: The Senate confirms Gorsuch by a 54-45 vote after Senate Republicans abolished the 60-vote threshold that had been needed to cut off a Democratic filibuster. April-June: Supreme Court sides with the Trump administration\u2019s position in a series of 5-4 decisions favoring employers over workers, including to stop states from requiring \u201cfair share\u201d union fees from non-members to pay for collective bargaining on pay and benefits; by the same 5-4 vote, the justices uphold an Ohio voter purge law. June 26: The most prominent case of the session, Trump v. Hawaii, also breaks along those 5-4 lines, as the five-justice conservative majority upholds the third iteration of the Trump travel ban. Roberts says Trump\u2019s order \u201cis an act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President.\u201d He brushes aside dissenting justices\u2019 reminders of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric and says the court must consider \u201cthe authority of the Presidency itself.\u201d June 27: Justice Anthony Kennedy, a 1988 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, announces his retirement. July 9: Trump nominates appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Kennedy. Oct. 6: The Senate confirms Kavanaugh in a 50-48 vote following weeks of partisan divisions, including over claims by a California psychology professor, Christine Blasey Ford, that he sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers. Oct. 8: Trump holds a ceremonial investiture for Kavanaugh in the White House\u2019s East Room, at which he apologizes to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation, saying, \u201cYou, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.\u201d That misstates the situation. Kavanaugh denied all allegations but no trial or hearing on the charges was held and the claims were neither conclusively validated nor rejected. Nov. 21: After Trump disparages a judge who ruled against the administration in an asylum dispute as an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts issues a rare and striking response that begins, \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\u201d January: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg misses a two-week sitting of oral arguments after she is treated for lung cancer; two cancerous nodules were removed from her lung in late December. Jan. 22: The Supreme Court lets the Trump administration ban most transgender people from serving in the military by a 5-4 vote along conservative-liberal lines. Trump had announced the ban via Twitter in July 2017. Feb. 19: Ginsburg returns to the bench to participate in the most important cases of the annual session, over partisan gerrymandering and the 2020 census questionnaire. June 27: Chief Justice Roberts sides with the court\u2019s four liberals to effectively end the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question to the census. At the same time, Roberts casts the fifth vote with conservatives and writes the opinion declaring that federal judges may not resolve challenges to partisan gerrymanders. July 26: The Supreme Court lets the Trump administration redirect $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds to begin building a wall at the southern border, by a 5-4 vote controlled by the conservative majority. Dec. 13: The Supreme Court agrees to take up long-running disputes over subpoenas for Trump tax records and other financial documents on the same day that a Democratic-led US House committee votes articles of impeachment against Trump. The full House impeaches Trump later in December. Dec. 31: As part of his year-end report, Chief Justice Roberts writes, \u201cWe should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability. But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable.\u201d Jan. 21 to Feb. 5: Chief Justice Roberts presides over the US Senate trial of Trump. The Republican-led Senate easily acquits Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. February: A Supreme Court dispute over a new rule for green-card applications prompts Trump\u2019s ire, although the administration prevailed. After the five-just conservative bloc let the Trump administration enforce a new \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule immigrants who might need food stamps or other public benefits, Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissents, pointing up the majority\u2019s pattern of siding with the administration. Trump lashes out on Twitter against Sotomayor and Ginsburg. June 18: Chief Justice Roberts breaks with his conservative brethren and joins the four liberals to reject Trump\u2019s effort to roll back the Obama-era DACA program for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors. Trump tweets: \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d July 9: By a pair of 7-2 votes, the Supreme Court rejects Trump\u2019s arguments to keep his finances secret in the face of subpoenas from US House committees and the Manhattan district attorney. But the compromise court decisions give Trump additional ways to fight the subpoenas. Trump leaves office having relinquished none of the disputed financial documents. Sept. 18: Justice Ginsburg dies, after months of struggles with cancer and other health problems. Sept. 26: Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett on September 26 in a Rose Garden ceremony that turns out to be a coronavirus \u201csuper-spreader\u201d event. Oct. 26: The Senate confirms Barrett on a 52-48 vote, along strictly partisan lines. Oct. 26: The five-justice conservative majority declines to extend a deadline for mail-in ballots in Wisconsin. The decision reinforces a pattern of rejecting changes in absentee ballot deadlines and other election practices because of Covid-19. Dec. 11: The nine justices unanimously reject a case brought by Texas and other Republican states challenging the Nov. 3 election results that showed Joe Biden beating Trump. The Texas attorney general had sued Pennsylvania and three other battleground states that Biden won. Trump backed the litigation with his own filing to the justices and called the case \u201cthe big one.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump will exit the White House on Wednesday but leave behind three of the nine Supreme Court justices and a majority that was willing to partner with him for much of his agenda. Trump\u2019s imprint on the Supreme Court and overall three-tier federal judiciary represents one of the most significant right-wing successes of his tenure, even as his instigation of the US Capitol assault and final destructive days appear to be leaving the most indelible mark of his legacy. John Roberts can't escape the shadow of Donald Trump With forceful leadership from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Republicans enabled Trump to make lifetime appointments to nearly 30% of the 870-seat federal bench. A majority of the powerful US appellate courts are now dominated by Republican appointees. RELATED: A four-year timeline of Donald Trump and the Supreme Court At the Supreme Court, the Trump administration won more than it lost during the past four years, largely prevailing as it argued against immigrants\u2019 rights and for corporate interests. The conservative majority endorsed Trump\u2019s rush to execute 13 federal defendants in recent months and last week reinstated restrictions on women trying to obtain a prescribed abortion drug.   The justices also have delayed for months action on the latest chapter of a Manhattan district attorney\u2019s long-pending subpoena for Trump tax returns. The Supreme Court and lower US court judges, however, failed to give Trump what he desired most at the end. They swatted away his attempts to discard valid 2020 presidential election results. For that, Trump called the Supreme Court \u201ctotally incompetent and weak.\u201d One person who stood between Trump and more sweeping success was Chief Justice John Roberts. The administration lost major cases at the Supreme Court when Roberts gave his decisive vote to the liberal side of the bench. Still, Roberts often afforded the administration some measure of victory even in its losing cases, such as a broader reading of executive discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act, or a chance to return with stronger arguments. When the administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and wanted to end the Obama-era \u201cDreamers\u201d program for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors, the Trump arguments were hurt by contrived and flawed justifications as much as anything. A four-year timeline of Donald Trump and the Supreme Court Trump responded to the Roberts\u2019 opinion in the dispute over the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by saying, \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d Trump and conservative advocates effectively triumphed on a goal dating to the 2016 election campaign when Trump took the unorthodox step of issuing a list of possible candidates for the high court, and McConnell ensured that the vacancy caused by that February\u2019s death of Justice Antonin Scalia was waiting for the new president. Just days after taking office in January 2017, Trump nominated US appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Scalia vacancy. The next year, Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired after 30 years on the bench. Four months ago, a new vacancy suddenly appeared with the September 18 death of prominent liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Trump chose Amy Coney Barrett. McConnell had also stalled on Obama lower court nominations in 2016, ensuring that about 100 lower court vacancies also awaited Trump in 2017. After four years, the President has filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships (26%) and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships (30%), according data compiled by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Russell Wheeler. When Trump first came to office, four of the 13 US appeals courts had Republican majorities, Wheeler said, and today, seven of the 13 are now dominated by GOP appointees. These regional appeals courts usually have the last word on legal disputes because the Supreme Court accepts fewer than 1% of the petitions that arrive at its door. Of cases that were heard by the justices, Trump generally saw bigger victories at the start of its tenure than the finish, beginning with the June 2018 decision that upheld Trump\u2019s travel ban. In a 5-4 opinion written by Roberts, the majority called Trump\u2019s order \u201can act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President.\u201d Over protests from dissenting liberals to consider Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric, Roberts wrote in Trump v. Hawaii that the court must consider \u201cthe authority of the Presidency itself.\u201d In a case that drew far less attention but reinforced the Trump agenda limiting eligibility for asylum in the US, the justices in June curtailed court review for asylum seekers in an expedited removal process who claim they cannot return home because they have a credible fear of torture or death. The administration won several major cases favoring employers over labor. In one of the most contentious, the five-justice bloc on the right in 2018 reversed a 1977 ruling that had allowed states to require employees who declined to join a union to pay \u201cfair share\u201d fees to finance bargaining for pay and benefits but not political activities. \u201cBig loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter after the ruling. Equally consequential were some decisions that arose through Trump requests on the so-called \u201cshadow docket,\u201d which were never fully briefed and heard in oral arguments. Department of Justice lawyers repeatedly persuaded the conservative majority to block adverse lower court orders that would have prevented the administration from enforcing its initiatives while legal challenges were pending. Abortion drug ruling highlights Trump's wins on the Supreme Court 'shadow docket' The justices by 5-to-4 votes, conservatives over liberals, let Trump divert funds to build the wall at the US southern border; to institute a new rule disadvantaging green-card applicants who seek food stamps and other public assistance; and, most recently, to reinstate a Food and Drug Administration requirement that women prescribed mifepristone, to end a pregnancy in its early weeks, pick up the pill in person at a hospital or clinic despite the Covid-19 pandemic. One of Trump\u2019s most conspicuous losses appeared, at the time, to be July 2020 rulings rejecting his attempt to block subpoenas from US House committees and the Manhattan district attorney for his personal business records. But the compromise 7-2 court decisions offered Trump additional ways to fight the subpoenas, and by the end of 2020 Trump had relinquished none of the disputed financial documents. The decision in Trump v. Vance regarding a Manhattan grand jury\u2019s subpoena had appeared most lethal to Trump\u2019s desire to keep records secret. Reaching back 200 years in court history, Roberts wrote, \u201cNo citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding.\u201d After that July 9 decision on the subpoena directed to Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, lower court judges reviewed new Trump defenses that the subpoena was overly broad and issued in bad faith. The Trump claims were again spurned, and in October the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that these are anything but run-of-the-mill documents typically relevant to a grand jury investigation into possible financial or corporate misconduct.\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been seeking the financial records as he investigates any Trump or Trump Organization involvement in \u201chush money\u201d payments to women who alleged sexual affairs with him during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has denied the affairs. Explaining the Supreme Court's ruling denying Trump and how Alito and Thomas didn't dissent Trump\u2019s lawyers in October asked the Supreme Court to postpone the effect of the Second Circuit decision and hear the merits of their defense. Vance\u2019s lawyers countered, \u201cThis litigation has already substantially hampered the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u201d For the past three months, the justices have not acted \u2013 with no public explanation. Despite his many victories and what will be a transformative legacy, Trump, of course, always wanted more and suggested he was being denied the respect he deserved. Last July, when the Supreme Court spurned Trump\u2019s immunity claim and sent the Vance case back to lower courts, Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cI have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration! \u2026. Courts in the past have given \u2018broad deference.\u2019 BUT NOT ME!\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump made a large number of false claims in a rambling speech. His allies then made some more in Congress. Both before and after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, Trump and a group of congressional Republicans repeated some of the same baseless election-related nonsense that has agitated much of the President\u2019s base. Trump was speaking at a rally near the White House. Members of the House and Senate were speaking as they objected to some of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral votes. Here is a sampling of their inaccuracy: Trump peppered his rally speech with his usual series of wildly false claims about the presidential election he lost \u2013 claiming that \u201cwe won it by a landslide,\u201d that the election was \u201cso corrupt,\u201d that unnamed people \u201crigged\u201d the process, and that Joe Biden got \u201c80 million computer votes\u201d rather than legitimate votes. Facts First: That is all false. Trump lost a free and fair election to Biden \u2013 306-232 in the Electoral College. Biden earned more than 81 million legitimate votes, exceeding Trump\u2019s total by more than 7 million. There is no evidence the election was rigged in any way. According to Trump, \u201cif Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.\u201d He added, \u201call Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify,\u201d which Trump claimed Pence has \u201cthe absolute right to do.\u201d Facts First: This is totally false. There\u2019s nothing in the law about Pence doing anything but calling on tellers and announcing the results. The Constitution only gives him the power to count the votes. According to CNN contributor and law professor Steve Vladeck, Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cjust not true.\u201d Vladeck pointed to the 12th Amendment which outlines the Vice President\u2019s traditional role in the certification process as largely ceremonial. The Vice President, in his or her role as President of the Senate, is given the power to \u201copen all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no discretion on [the Vice President\u2019s] part, nor has any Vice President previously claimed the power to reject any properly formatted certificates,\u201d Vladeck told CNN. Even the President\u2019s longtime attorney Jay Sekulow has said Pence doesn\u2019t legally have the authority to trigger such an outcome. \u201cSome have speculated that the vice president could simply say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to accept these electors,\u2019 that he has the authority to do that on the Constitution. I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the Constitution has in mind. If that were the case, any vice president could refuse any election,\u201d Sekulow said on his radio show this week, adding that Pence\u2019s role is \u201cmore of a ministerial procedural function. The President claimed that while many people were watching the Georgia election unfold Tuesday night \u201cthey cheated like hell anyway.\u201d \u201cLast night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut they cheated like hell anyway.\u201d Facts First: This is false. Whether in the general election or in Tuesday\u2019s Senate runoff, there is no evidence of mass voter fraud in Georgia. Trump\u2019s allegations have been personally and repeatedly debunked by Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voting systems implementation manager. Trump tweeted out several false claims Tuesday and Wednesday, alleging fraud in the election. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that \u201creports are coming out of the 12th Congressional District of Georgia that Dominion Machines are not working in certain Republican Strongholds for over an hour\u201d adding that \u201cballots are being left in lock boxes.\u201d His campaign sent out emails and text messages suggesting this was part of a Democratic plot to steal the election. But there was no stealing or cheating. On Tuesday morning there were some issues with security keys in Columbia County, Georgia. The problem was resolved, according to Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, by 10 a.m. and people were able to vote through backup paper ballots in the meantime. Sterling refuted these claims on Twitter, writing the \u201cissue in Columbia Co. was resolved hours ago and our office informed the public about it in real time\u201d and \u201cThe votes of everyone will be protected and counted.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump wrote, \u201cThey just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools.\u201d Sterling again debunked this conspiracy theory, first on CNN then on Twitter, writing in response to Trump\u2019s post, \u201cNo Mr. President, there weren\u2019t \u2018found\u2019 ballots. We have known the number of advanced votes since this weekend.\u201d \u201cWe saw record Election Day turnout,\u201d Sterling added. \u201cAs of Monday 970,000 absentees had been accepted. 31k more were added in yesterday\u2019s totals. That leaves 60k that came in yesterday.\u201d Trump claimed that, in Pennsylvania, there were \u201c205,000 more ballots than you had voters.\u201d Facts First: False. There were not more votes than registered voters in Pennsylvania; state officials and fact checkers have repeatedly explained that this claim is false. Trump appeared to be invoking an incorrect figure from a Republican state legislator who had relied on incomplete data. Trump claimed that the election \u201cwas over at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening\u201d on Election Night, when he had leads in the vote counts in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania, but then \u201cexplosions of bullshit\u201d occurred. Facts First: It is obviously false that the election was over at this early stage of the counting process. There is a simple explanation for Trump\u2019s big initial leads in some states he ended up losing, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan: he led because many mail-in ballots had not yet been counted. There is no indication he lost the leads for any suspicious reason. Media outlets and political analysts had noted for weeks prior to Election Day that we were likely to see a \u201cred mirage\u201d in which Trump would initially appear to be up big in some states that counted mail-in ballots last. Mail-in ballots favored Biden so heavily in large part because Trump had regularly discouraged his own supporters from voting by mail. In a number of states, legislatures disallowed election officials from processing votes early, leading to delays. Trump continued to lie about mail-in voting, saying there was widespread fraud in mail-in voting. \u201cThis year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election,\u201d he said. \u201cTheft and there\u2019s never been anything like this. It\u2019s a pure theft in American history, everybody knows it.\u201d Facts First: The President is repeating a lie he\u2019s made since even before Election Day. Mail-in voting is safe, has been around for decades and studies have shown absentee fraud is extremely low. Trump may have been leading on Election Night in battleground states, but that\u2019s because states counted the votes cast on Election Day first, and mail-in and absentee votes second. Millions of Americans voted by mail in the 2016 election, and again during the 2020 election, and there has not been widespread fraud. Comprehensive studies of billions of ballots cast over many years indicate that the rate of voter fraud is less than 0.0001%. Trump said that in Fulton County, Georgia, on election night, officials pulled \u201csuitcases of ballots out from under a table,\u201d which was \u201ctotally fraudulent.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are entirely baseless. After reviewing footage of the polling station in question, state and county officials determined the poll workers\u2019 actions were part of the normal process, not fraud. And the objects pulled from under the table were ballot bins, not suitcases, according to election officials. You can read a longer fact-check here. Trump claimed \u201cnot a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots.\u201d Facts First: This is false. At least two swing states conducted audits but found no evidence of widespread fraud. Georgia conducted both a statewide audit, hand-counting about 5 million ballots and an additional recount while Arizona conducted audits in its four largest counties. On the floor of the House, New York Rep. Lee Zeldin echoed Trump\u2019s claims that poll watchers were banned from counting locations or otherwise prevented from observing the count and denied the access they legally deserved. According to Zeldin, \u201cThere were poll watchers denied the ability to closely observe ballot counting operation.\u201d Facts First: There have been no reports of systematic irregularities with poll watchers anywhere in the US. There is no evidence supporting claims that poll watchers were shut out of the process. You can read more about what happened with poll watchers in specific states here. Objecting to Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan claimed the Supreme Court extended Election Day in the commonwealth. \u201cPennsylvania law says mail-in ballots have to be in by 8 p.m. election day. Democrat Supreme Court said, \u2018Nope we\u2019re going to extend it, Election Day doesn\u2019t end on Tuesday now.\u2019 They took it to Friday,\u201d Jordan said. Facts First: This is misleading and needs context. While it\u2019s true that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court extended the deadline for Pennsylvania to accept mail-in ballots, Election Day itself was not extended and it\u2019s false to suggest that votes cast after Tuesday were somehow counted. Prior to the election, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court allowed ballots received up to three days after the election, even without a valid postmark, to be counted. As CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue previously reported, Republicans asked the Supreme Court to step in to reinstate an Election Day deadline for mail-in ballots. On October 19, the US Supreme Court announced it was deadlocked 4-4, meaning the three-day extension could stand. After Trump\u2019s Supreme Court Nominee Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed, Republicans brought their challenge back to the court, but Barrett did not participate in the case and the justices denied the request on the grounds there was not enough time to decide before the election. Rep. Mo Brooks claimed that \u201cJoe Biden gained roughly 1,032,000 votes from illegal alien voting.\u201d Facts First: This is entirely unfounded. There is no evidence that more than a million undocumented immigrants voted, and experts say voter fraud of any type is exceedingly rare. This is not the first time Brooks has brought up the subject of undocumented immigrants in an effort to challenge the 2020 results. On December 3 he accused Biden of \u201c\u2018buying\u2019 illegal alien block votes\u201d through promises of amnesty and claimed that Trump \u201cwon [the] electoral college & reelection.\u201d This story is being updated CNN\u2019s Melissa Tapia contributed to this article.",

            "article_content": "Georgians elected Jon Ossoff to the US Senate, CNN projected Wednesday, giving the Democratic Party control of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade and delivering a stark repudiation of President Donald Trump as he tried to overturn his own loss. Ossoff\u2019s victory and that of fellow Georgia Democrat the Rev. Raphael Warnock flip the Senate, giving President-elect Joe Biden the power to potentially enact sweeping, liberal legislation and push through Cabinet nominations without Republican support. The Senate\u2019s party split will be 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking tie votes. LIVE UPDATES: Georgia Senate runoff election Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Ossoff will respectively be the first Black and Jewish senators to represent Georgia. \u201cAt this moment of crisis, as Covid-19 continues to ravage our state and our country, when hundreds of thousands have lost their lives, millions have lost livelihoods, Georgia families are having difficulty putting food on the table \u2013 fearing foreclosure or eviction, having difficulty making ends meet \u2013 let\u2019s unite now to beat this virus and rush economic relief to the people of our state and to the American people,\u201d Ossoff said earlier Wednesday ahead of CNN\u2019s projection. After no Georgia US Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs with control of the Senate at stake. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged. Trump\u2019s ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters. Despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in supporting an objection to Congress\u2019 certification of the Electoral College\u2019s results on Wednesday in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters. \u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed,\u201d said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist. \u201cClearly the distractions and sideshows impacted the outcome.\u201d Progressives are already looking at how Democrats should use their newfound power, advocating for the Senate to \u201cgo nuclear\u201d and eliminate the filibuster, which requires that most legislation obtain 60 votes to advance, in order to pass a more ambitious agenda. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York dodged a question on Wednesday on whether his caucus will lower the threshold to a simple majority vote, saying it is united in wanting \u201cbig, bold change\u201d and would \u201cdiscuss the best ways to get that done.\u201d He said that \u201cone of the first\u201d bills he\u2019d like to pass as Senate majority leader would provide $2,000 stimulus checks to help Americans suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, recently blocked despite President Donald Trump\u2019s support for enhanced aid. Democratic senators, who have been in the minority for six years, are now evaluating how to wield their gavels across various committees to address the health and economic crises. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now,\u201d said Biden in a statement. \u201cOn Covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more.\u201d Schumer will have a minuscule margin for error balancing the priorities of the left and the politically vulnerable. Democrats acknowledged the intraparty fight to come. Maine independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN that he is \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to eliminate the filibuster but looks forward to changing the rules to disincentivize its \u201cabuse.\u201d Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate who faces a 2024 election in his red state, said on Wednesday that he hoped the filibuster would remain to encourage bipartisanship. \u201cBipartisan legislation tends to stand the test of time,\u201d said Tester. Black Georgia voters' high turnout helped solidify a historic win, organizers say But the left wants Schumer to get rid of it so that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and the Senate can pass their long-awaited wish list. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley tweeted on Wednesday that \u201cthe movement\u201d to end cash bail, abolish Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and support Black lives \u201corganized to deliver\u201d Congress and the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s time we deliver for them,\u201d she said. A Democratic-led Senate could also confirm Biden\u2019s nominees without Republican support, allowing the new administration to go bolder in its Cabinet picks and begin to overhaul the conservatives\u2019 massive gains on the judicial bench over the past four years. Biden plans to pick federal Judge Merrick Garland for attorney general, creating a vacancy on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. If McConnell were in charge of the Senate, the Biden administration might\u2019ve gone with someone like former Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones to avoid the Kentucky Republican\u2019s influence over that critical judicial vacancy. \u201cObviously, with Democratic control [of the Senate], the ability of Joe Biden to move nominations forward will be easier,\u201d said Schumer. Perdue and Loeffler entered the Senate runoffs with some advantages. Loeffler, one of the richest members of Congress, spent tens of millions on her race, while Perdue, a first-term senator and former Fortune 500 CEO, has earned over 88,000 more votes than the 33-year-old Ossoff two months ago. Warnock and Ossoff campaigned on ending the coronavirus crisis, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They pushed for debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they attacked the Republican senators for their multimillion-dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing. But Loeffler\u2019s and Perdue\u2019s campaigns were quickly subsumed by Trump\u2019s attacks on the Democratic outcome. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse his loss in Georgia, a state that every GOP presidential candidate had won since 1996. Raffensperger, a Republican, refused. Perdue and Loeffler attempted to sidestep the intraparty fight by focusing their remarks on their Democratic opponents. Perdue\u2019s closing message was littered with attacks, saying in a minute-long video that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans\u2019 private health insurance will be \u201ctaken away,\u201d and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police. \u201cWe win Georgia, we save America,\u201d said Perdue to the camera. But Warnock and Ossoff countered that they would \u201cdemilitarize\u201d rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court. \u201cKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you,\u201d said Warnock in an ad. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to make you afraid of me because she\u2019s afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she\u2019s used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you\u2019ll realize that we can do better.\u201d Now, Democrats will confront the question of how far they will go following the Trump administration. They spent Wednesday celebrating their quick reversal of fortune after being so long out of power. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do big things,\u201d said Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. \u201cI think that the overwhelming number of Democrats are pointing in the same direction on all of this.

            "article_content": "The Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, will be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday, a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump. The Democratic Party appears closer to retaking the US Senate, as Georgia Republican David Perdue narrowly trails in his fight to keep his seat against Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. Both candidates claimed they would win after all the ballots had been counted, but CNN has not yet called the race.   Warnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years, and his election is the culmination of years of voter registration drives conducted by former state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams and other activists. President-elect Joe Biden also won Georgia, the first time for a Democratic presidential candidate since the 1990s. \u201cI am an iteration and an example of the American dream,\u201d the senator-elect told CNN\u2019s John Berman Wednesday morning on \u201cNew Day.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen I think about the arc of our history, what Georgia did last night is its own message in the midst of a moment in which so many people are trying to divide our country, at a time we can least afford to be divided.\u201d CNN\u2019s live Georgia election results After no Georgia Senate candidate received 50% of the vote in November, the races turned to two runoffs. While Ossoff and Warnock ran on a unity ticket, Trump refused to concede his own loss, sparking a fight within the Republican Party and disenchanting some of his supporters, who believed his false claims that the vote was rigged. Trump\u2019s ongoing onslaught against the Republican officials in charge of the elections pressured the two GOP senators to make a choice: Join the President in seeking to overturn the democratic outcome or risk losing Trump supporters, some of whom have become disenchanted with the electoral process. Trump recently appeared to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on a private call, urging him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to reverse the results. Raffensperger refused. But despite three recounts and no evidence of widespread fraud, Loeffler and Perdue decided to join the President in objecting to Congress\u2019 certification of the Electoral College\u2019s results in a final, deluded display of devotion to Trump supporters. \u201cThe American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed,\u201d said Loeffler in a statement on Monday. Asked if it was appropriate for her to vote against certification of the electoral votes, Warnock told CNN Wednesday that his opponent \u201chas consistently put what she perceives to be her own short-term political interests over the concerns of ordinary people.\u201d \u201cWhat is unfolding in the Senate today or in the House, what\u2019s unfolding in this moment is a distraction. It\u2019s a distraction,\u201d he told Berman. \u201cThese senators know better and the people that I\u2019m talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives.\u201d While Georgia is a rapidly diversifying state, the Republican candidates came into the Senate runoff elections with an advantage. In November, Perdue received over 88,000 more votes than Ossoff, while Loeffler and the other Republican candidates received more votes than Warnock and the other Democratic candidates in the special election (Warnock received most of the vote \u2013 33% \u2013 overall). How to watch the Georgia runoff elections Republicans hoped their message that Georgia should be a check on Washington would prove successful, noting that if Warnock and Ossoff win, Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will be in charge. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the future of the country, and we can\u2019t just turn it all over to one party,\u201d said Eric Tanenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, before Election Day. \u201cThat could be wishful thinking on my part. But I do think that that\u2019s going to be a big motivator.\u201d But Republicans are worried that Trump\u2019s unwillingness to concede jeopardizes the party\u2019s hold on the Senate, even though the state has not elected a Democrat to the chamber since 2000. Heath Garrett, a campaign manager for former Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, told CNN that Trump\u2019s attacks on Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger were \u201ccounterproductive for trying to motivate grassroots, base Republicans to go vote,\u201d and said they\u2019ve threw Perdue and Loeffler \u201coff message\u201d in the final days of the campaign. \u201cSenator Perdue and Senator Loeffler are being whipsawed by the President on one side and by the Democratic money on the other side,\u201d he said. Perdue and Loeffler had attempted to avoid the intraparty feud sparked by Trump by focusing on Ossoff and Warnock. Perdue\u2019s closing message in a recent video was littered with attacks, saying that if Republicans lose, undocumented immigrants will vote, Americans\u2019 private health insurance will be \u201ctaken away,\u201d and Democrats will pack the Supreme Court and defund the police. \u201cWe win Georgia, we save America,\u201d Perdue told the camera. What we've learned so far from the Georgia Senate runoffs The Democratic candidates counter that they would \u201cdemilitarize\u201d rather than defund the police, create a legal pathway for undocumented immigrants and support a public option to decrease the number of uninsured. Neither Democratic candidate has advocated adding justices to the court. They argued they would do a better job ending the health care crisis over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 20.8 million Americans and killed at least 354,000, in order to reopen the economy. They\u2019ve pushed policy goals, including debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. And they\u2019ve attacked the Republican senators for their multi-million dollar stock transactions during the pandemic, alleging that they profited off it. The senators have denied any wrongdoing. Warnock told CNN Wednesday that he believes tackling the pandemic by effectively distributing the vaccine and passing $2,000 stimulus checks should be the new Senate\u2019s top priority. The special election was particularly brutal, starting last year when GOP Rep. Doug Collins forced Loeffler, who Kemp appointed to the role in 2019, into a race to the right. After no candidate received 50% of the vote, the runoffs turned even more vicious, as Loeffler portrayed Warnock an anti-police Marxist who would destroy America in the Senate. \u201cWe have to have Georgians come out and vote because we know that Chuck Schumer\u2019s radical agents of change are Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,\u201d said Loeffler on the campaign trail Monday. \u201cThey would defund the police. They would lock down our economy. And we have to make sure that we hold the line right here in Georgia.\u201d Warnock has in turn promoted his background from the Savannah projects to the pulpit of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic church, while firing back at Loeffler. Georgia election will advance this fundamental change in US Senate \u201cKelly Loeffler spends tens of millions of dollars to scare you,\u201d said Warnock in an ad. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to make you afraid of me because she\u2019s afraid of you. Afraid that you understand how she\u2019s used her position in the Senate to enrich herself and others like her. Afraid that you\u2019ll realize that we can do better.\u201d Perdue, a 71-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, has dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, saying the Democrat does not know how to create a job. At their debate in the fall, Ossoff called the senator a \u201ccrook\u201d who was \u201cfending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading\u201d while attacking \u201cthe health of the people\u201d who he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for \u201cthe mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China\u201d \u2013 claims Ossoff called \u201cridiculous.\u201d The Georgia US Senate races have attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state\u2019s shift from red to purple. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open \u2026 Republicans are expected to have a strong Election Day,\u201d said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights organization founded by Abrams. Most Georgia voters say runoff Senate election conducted fairly, CNN exit poll shows Political groups spent about $520 million to advertise in the two runoff races, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, averaging more than $8 million per day. Republicans outspent Democrats by tens of millions of dollars. With the Senate on the line, Trump rallied his supporters in northwest Georgia on Monday, while President-elect Joe Biden held an event in Atlanta. Biden said electing Ossoff and Warnock would end the gridlock in Washington and allow Congress to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans. Trump urged the state to elect Perdue and Loeffler, and claimed that Biden would not take the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight like hell,\u201d said the President.

Women in Texas need allies. And not the silent kind who quietly grumble to like-minded people about how heinous it is that a group made up of mostly well-off White men decided to pass an abortion law that would disproportionately affect the poorest women of color: those who can\u2019t afford to travel out of the vast state of Texas for a safe abortion, can\u2019t take time off work to do so, can\u2019t get child care for their children while they are away, don\u2019t have private health insurance or are undocumented. Perhaps with the recent case of a Texas doctor being sued at least twice after he said he violated  the law \u2013 and the fact that both plaintiffs have indicated they either oppose the law or are pro-choice but are trying to force a federal court to intervene \u2013 we are seeing what allyship can look like for the most vulnerable victims of SB 8. But more should be done. With some notable exceptions, including President Joe Biden and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, there has been a dismaying lack of male allyship for women in Texas. Why are hordes of outraged men not streaming onto the streets to march alongside their daughters, wives, mothers, sisters, friends and coworkers in defense of their ability to be in charge of their own bodies? Where are the mixed mass protests? In polls, Texans \u2013 like Americans at large \u2013 are generally split between those who identify as being pro-life and those who support a woman\u2019s right to choose. If this is the case, shouldn\u2019t nearly half the population of Texas be furiously protesting? Shouldn\u2019t half the nation? This is how you mess with Texas Second, the women in Texas need to hear from US corporations. If your website features a values statement about inclusivity, how can you not be boycotting Texas right now, or at the very least making public statements denouncing SB 8 and setting up support funds for any Texas employees who might want to relocate or need to travel out of the state to obtain a safe abortion? Some businesses, including Salesforce, Uber, Lyft and Bumble, have stated their opposition to the new law, pledging their support for any employees impacted by it, but most large corporations have so far deafened us with their silence. If as a company you claim to value human rights and equality and condemn discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, age, sexuality or religion, how can you stay quiet? Do you really think your shareholders and customers won\u2019t notice that you have chosen to sit on the fence on this? Do you think they won\u2019t conclude that the rest of your stated values must be meaningless, having been produced from within the same moral vacuum? Texas' repugnant abortion law is pure Republican hypocrisy Finally, to my fellow Christians \u2013 although the Bible has long been misappropriated by many to justify an anti-abortion stance, I am convinced that there is absolutely no religious reason to oppose abortion. But whatever your personal beliefs on this, please remember that as followers of Christ we are exhorted to love our neighbor, and to practice forgiveness. If you do not speak out against this law, ask yourself, do you really condone punishing those who try to help a woman in need of support at what is perhaps the most difficult moment in her life, leaving her isolated and afraid? Do you condone criminalizing and possibly bankrupting the good Samaritan, the loving friend, the caring physician, the anxious partner or parent who tries to help her, all in the name of God? Let\u2019s face the stark facts here \u2013 God has nothing to do with SB 8. This whole debacle is about GOP strong-arming. If you want to indulge in a petty show of strength, aimed at intimidating your opponents, you choose the most vulnerable victims possible (and in American society you don\u2019t get much more vulnerable than low-income, young Black and brown women), because you already see them as not having much of a voice. The sinister genius of Texas abortion law You think no one is going to step up to defend them. This is how school bullies select their victims, too. But brave Texas women are fighting back; let\u2019s all join them. Let\u2019s not give these Republican extremists the satisfaction of looking the other way while they trample on women\u2019s rights and simultaneously line up their next targets, whomever they may be. Who knows? Maybe you will be among them. Because beware: This kind of flagrant assault on the US Constitution may not be limited to Texas and Mississippi for long. SB 8 hopefully won\u2019t survive the current legal challenges against it indefinitely, but everyone should think about what this episode says about the future of our political system. In the past year alone we\u2019ve seen attacks on election results, voting rights and women\u2019s bodies \u2013 what\u2019s next? Vigilantism being codified by red states to deny people their constitutional rights in other contested policy areas? And don\u2019t make the mistake of naively thinking that these Republicans will be held back by a reluctance to go against popular opinion \u2013 58% of Americans do not want to see Roe v Wade overturned, yet now it is under threat.  The shock of this law going onto the statute books in Texas, even temporarily, should be a wake-up call to all Americans who still care about the sanctity of our Constitution. We can\u2019t afford to ignore the warning signs here, or we might one day discover that it is our democracy itself whose heart is no longer beating.",

View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends. When federal Judge Andrew Hanen ruled Friday that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is unconstitutional, he threw into doubt the future of the Obama-era initiative that protects from deportation undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The future of DACA now rests with federal courts of appeals, and the legal landscape isn\u2019t promising for the program\u2019s survival \u2013 unless Congress steps in to rescue it. If DACA \u2013 created through executive action by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 \u2013 does fall, the result will be potentially catastrophic for hundreds of thousands of innocent young beneficiaries, commonly referred to as \u201cDreamers.\u201d DACA protects an estimated 700,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States before age 16. Without DACA\u2019s protections, these young people will be subject to deportation, even if they have committed no crime and done nothing wrong.  Even former President Donald Trump \u2013 whose administration sought to repeal DACA, unsuccessfully \u2013 has described those protected by DACA as \u201cgood, educated and accomplished young people.\u201d Just last year, DACA survived an existential legal challenge when the Supreme Court, by a five to four majority, rejected the Trump administration\u2019s effort to repeal the Obama-era executive action that created the program. The Court ruled that, while one president generally has broad authority to modify or repeal the executive actions of a prior president, such action still must comply with certain administrative procedures. The Court found the Trump administration failed to follow these guidelines because it never offered a \u201creasoned explanation for its action.\u201d But the 2020 Supreme Court opinion should provide little comfort to those who rely on DACA\u2019s protections. First, last week\u2019s ruling must go through the intermediate Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is one of the country\u2019s most conservative (arguably the most conservative) federal courts of appeals. If the Fifth Circuit upholds last week\u2019s decision to strike down DACA and the Supreme Court declines to hear the case \u2013 and the Court declines to hear far more cases than it accepts \u2013 then DACA is a goner. Bigoted tortilla-throwing incident reveals a troubling bigger picture Second, the 2020 case presented a different legal issue. That case involved the authority of one president to un-do a predecessor\u2019s executive action, while the new case involves the underlying constitutionality of DACA itself; Judge Hanen ruled that DACA is unconstitutional because it was created by executive action rather than legislation. Third, since the 2020 opinion that (barely) upheld DACA, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed, and has been replaced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In the 2020 decision, Ginsburg sided with the other three liberal justices plus Chief Justice John Roberts; if Barrett sticks with her conservative colleagues on the bench, last year\u2019s 5-4 win for DACA would become a 5-4 loss. But all is not lost for DACA, yet. Congress has the power to step in and save the program by passing legislation encoding it as federal law.  President Joe Biden called Friday\u2019s decision \u201cdeeply disappointing,\u201d and Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats hold majorities in both the Senate and the House. But the real question is whether the Democrats are willing to take action to match their party\u2019s rhetoric. It\u2019s one thing to decry the potential end of DACA in press clippings, but another to exercise the political will necessary to save it. It\u2019s unclear whether the Democrats are willing to act, up to and including potentially limiting or ending the filibuster, which would require at least 60 votes \u2013 all 50 Democrats plus at least 10 Republicans \u2013 to pass legislation.  Now, your questions: Fran (Arizona): Can DOJ step in and put an end to the so-called \u201caudit\u201d of Arizona ballots cast in the 2020 election? The Justice Department has notified Arizona authorities that it is aware of the purported \u201caudit,\u201d and that it will monitor for potential violations of federal law. Specifically, DOJ warned Arizona officials about potential voter intimidation and suppression, and about potential violations of federal law requiring state and local officials to maintain custody of ballots for 22 months following an election. To date, the dispute has not come to a head, but, if necessary, the Justice Department could go to court seeking to limit or shut down the ongoing Arizona \u201caudit.\u201d Alberto (Florida): If prosecutors can\u2019t get anyone inside the Trump Organization to cooperate, can they still bring charges against Donald Trump? I\u2019m skeptical about whether New York prosecutors can develop sufficient evidence to charge former President Trump without cooperation from Trump Organization insiders. Thus far, prosecutors\u2019 efforts to flip longtime Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and Chief Operating Officer Matthew Calamari have not succeeded. That could change; I\u2019ve seen plenty of people cooperate later in the process, particularly after being charged or convicted. But at the moment, it appears prosecutors do not have cooperation from these insiders. Keep in mind that it is not enough for prosecutors to argue that a fraud occurred within the Trump Organization, hence the bosses must be liable. That might be logical, and it might even be true, but prosecutors must be able to prove specifically and beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual knew of and participated in a criminal scheme. Unless prosecutors have smoking-gun evidence that we don\u2019t currently know about \u2013 an incriminating email or text or recording for example \u2013 then they\u2019ll need a well-positioned cooperator to supply the necessary proof.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. As one of the directors of psychiatric operations for the Air Force during World War II, my grandfather, Roy R. Grinker Sr., learned that no one is immune from mental illnesses in a global crisis. In fact, most of his patients were soldiers with no record of mental illness who developed emotional symptoms amid the stresses of war. He also met soldiers whose combat wounds, and sicknesses like dysentery and hepatitis, caused them great psychological distress. He said his patients were not abnormal; they were normal people in abnormal circumstances. We now find ourselves in another global crisis affecting mental health \u2013 one many world leaders have likened to a world war. \u201cThis is a wartime undertaking,\u201d President Joe Biden said of the Covid-19 pandemic on his first full day in office. Decades ago, President Harry S. Truman leveraged World War II to jump-start mental health treatment and research, and to battle the persistent stigma so often associated with mental illnesses. In 1946, Truman established the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in response to the high incidence of mental illnesses among soldiers and civilians. During the war, as many as 450,000 to 500,000 soldiers were discharged for psychiatric reasons, according to different estimates. Truman then ordered the military to adapt its own manual of mental illness diagnosis (called Medical 203) for all Americans. It would be called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-I (DSM-I). Strongly influenced by William Menninger, who was chief of psychiatry for the US surgeon general during WWII, and who massively enlarged his own training programs in Topeka, Kansas, after the war, universities throughout the country soon expanded psychology departments and launched new psychiatric training programs in their medical schools. The Covid-19 pandemic is an invitation to make similar progress. But throughout the country today, mental health professionals are scratching their heads trying to figure out why neither former President Donald Trump nor President Biden appointed senior mental health scientists to their Covid-19 task forces. To his credit, President Biden appointed Jane Hopkins, a nurse and union leader with experience in treating mental illnesses, to his transition force, now dissolved after the inauguration. At any rate, he appears to have done so to give representation to nurses and other essential health care workers, not to focus on mental health care. Are you OK? I'm not. Post-inauguration, Biden has not made any announcement that prominent mental health experts will be added to his pandemic advisory team. Yet there\u2019s no doubt that the social isolation and economic hardships associated with efforts to stem the infection rate are having a profound impact on mental health. I don\u2019t know anyone who isn\u2019t suffering emotionally to some degree as a result of the pandemic. Like the soldiers my grandfather treated, many people who now meet the criteria for a mental illness have no history of any significant psychological disturbances. One large study of 69 million US patient records found that survivors of Covid-19 with no psychiatric history had an increased incidence of a first mental illness diagnosis. Indeed, 18% of the patients who survived met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis within three months after testing positive. What\u2019s more, the researchers found that people of all ages, sexes and socio-economic circumstances with a pre-existing mental illness were more likely to contract the virus. With the help of a senior behavioral health scientist and clinician, Biden\u2019s advisers could promote federal research on ways to reduce class, ethnic or geographic disparities in access to the computers and internet technologies needed for psychotherapy telehealth. It could spur software developers to adapt technologies, like smartphone applications and virtual workspaces, for mental health outreach and surveillance (for example, assessments of suicide risk and substance abuse), and propose methods that federal agencies could use to reduce the isolation and marginalization of the elderly, undocumented immigrants and people experiencing homelessness. To get kids back in school, we need a huge push to vaccinate all teachers It could encourage hospitals to establish multidisciplinary teams that include mental health professionals both as a preventive strategy and to treat the emotional consequences of Covid-19 for patients, their families and caregivers. It could support scientific research on any number of pressing needs, such as the psychological consequences of school closings for children, especially those with developmental disabilities, and the short- and long-term effects of the virus itself on brain function. Just as importantly, by acknowledging mental illnesses as a public health concern on par with \u201cphysical\u201d illness at the highest level of government, the President would send an important and potentially lasting message: There is no shame in seeking mental health care. Wars sometimes produce changes that are needed, and which reflect society\u2019s values. We should remember that when the United States entered World War II, the American medical and military communities had little respect for mental health professionals. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, soldiers who sought mental health care were routinely discharged, bringing shame to themselves and their families for what the British called a \u201clack of moral fibre.\u201d Gen. John Lucian Smith, a Medal of Honor recipient, angry at even the suggestion of sending psychiatrists overseas to the war itself, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any damned psychiatrists making our boys sick.\u201d But war altered those views. As early as 1944, The New York Times reported that my grandfather and his colleagues had \u201cexploded as a myth\u201d the idea that mental illnesses are a sign of weakness. Will the pandemic change our views, too?  If the pandemic is truly like a war, it provides us an opportunity to advance mental health research and treatment, and to reduce the stigma that makes people reluctant to seek care. \u201cAs a society,\u201d President Biden wrote before the election, \u201cwe need to work together to eliminate the stigma felt by those who are suffering and struggling with their mental health.\u201d Now is the time to make good on that campaign promise.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden announced \u201cAmerica is back\u201d on Thursday and declared that \u201cdiplomacy is back at the center\u201d of US foreign policy as he said the US will end all support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s offensive operations in Yemen, one of several changes he announced in his first major foreign-policy speech since taking office. Biden\u2019s announcement at the State Department was just one of the significant changes he said he will make to US foreign policy, including freezing troop redeployments from Germany, raising the cap for refugees allowed into the US and reaffirming US support for LGBTQ rights worldwide. In a call for values-led engagement with the world, Biden stressed that the global challenges of the moment, including the need to counter \u201cadvancing authoritarianism,\u201d will \u201conly be solved by nations working together.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t do it alone. \u2026 We must start with diplomacy rooted in America\u2019s most cherished democratic values,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDefending freedom. Championing opportunity. Upholding universal rights. Respecting the rule of law. And treating every person with dignity.\u201d Biden acknowledged the threat to those values and to US global standing from the attempted insurrection encouraged by former President Donald Trump. \u201cThough many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, even pushed to the brink in the last few weeks, the American people are going to emerge from this moment more determined and better equipped to unite the world to defend democracy because we have fought for it ourselves,\u201d the President said. Secretary of Defense orders all military to pause and review handling of extremism in ranks He delivered his speech after making less formal remarks to State Department employees, telling them that \u201cwe\u2019re going to rebuild our alliances. We\u2019re going to reengage the world and take on the enormous challenges we face dealing with the pandemic, dealing with global warming and again, standing up for democracy and human rights around the world.\u201d The President, who visited the State Department on Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris, used the speech not only to unveil policy changes, fulfill campaign promises and reverse Trump administration policies, but also to reassert US global leadership and realign foreign policy to better service the middle class. \u201cEverything\u201d the Biden administration does when it comes to foreign policy will be examined as to whether it makes life \u201cbetter, safer and easier for working families,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters in a briefing to preview the President\u2019s remarks. Biden announced that \u201cwe are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arm sales,\u201d and said he will appoint an envoy to focus on the long-standing conflict. He said the conflict is \u201ca war that has created humanitarian and strategic catastrophe,\u201d but he also made clear the US will \u201ccontinue to help and support Saudi Arabia.\u201d Biden said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will lead a \u201cglobal force posture review\u201d and, while that review is ongoing, will \u201cfreeze any troop redeployments from Germany \u2026 so our military footprint is appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national security priorities.\u201d The President also announced his intention to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States after years of historical lows under the Trump administration, and fulfill a campaign promise in doing so. The Trump administration set a refugee cap of 15,000 for this fiscal year, the lowest since 1980. On Thursday, Biden said he will raise the admissions cap back up to 125,000 persons for the first full fiscal year of his administration and will direct the State Department to work with Congress on the issue. \u201cThe United States\u2019 moral leadership on refugee issues was a point of bipartisan consensus for so many decades when I first got here. We shined the light of the lamp of liberty on oppressed people,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged. But that\u2019s precisely what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d The President also announced he would issue a presidential memorandum to agencies \u201cto reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues, and do it internationally\u201d as part of an effort \u201cto further repair our moral leadership.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers,\u201d Biden said. His comments build on the commitments Secretary of State Antony Blinken made during his confirmation hearing to swiftly appoint an LGBTI envoy, allow embassies to fly the pride flag and formally repudiate the findings of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s controversial \u201cCommission on Unalienable Rights.\u201d Biden put particular emphasis on the need to rebuild America\u2019s moral standing after four years of a president who rebuffed traditional alliances and increasingly scorned democratic norms; a tenure that saw peaceful protesters violently dispersed before a photo op; an embrace of conspiracy theorists and White nationalist groups; and ultimately a deadly insurrection aimed at overturning the results of a free and fair election. \u201cWe will compete from a position of strength by building back better at home, working with our allies and partners, renewing our international institutions and reclaiming our credibility and moral authority, much of which has been lost,\u201d Biden said. US extends nuclear arms treaty with Russia The President touted his administration\u2019s moves to elevate cyber by appointing the first national deputy security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, to weave climate objectives into all diplomacy and to rejoin the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement. And he touched on a few specific cases. He called on the Burmese military to \u201crelinquish power they have seized. Release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions in telecommunications and refrain from violence.\u201d Biden hailed Wednesday\u2019s agreement to extend the New START Treaty with Russia, to preserve the only remaining nuclear arms agreement between them, but also criticized Russia for jailing opposition activist Alexey Navalny. \u201cHe should be released immediately and without condition,\u201d he said. The President spoke only generally about China, saying the US will confront Beijing\u2019s \u201ceconomic abuses, counter its aggressive, coercive action to push back on China\u2019s attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global governance.\u201d But some thorny issues \u2013 including nuclear negotiations with Iran and the continuing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2013 he didn\u2019t mention at all. Biden and Harris\u2019 visit to America\u2019s oldest Cabinet agency was meant \u201cto make sure we know that we have their support, and that means a great deal,\u201d Blinken said. The top US diplomat emphasized the President\u2019s organizing principle for his foreign policy: that it benefit middle-class Americans. \u201cForeign policy is domestic policy, and because our strength at home determines our strength in the world, domestic policy is foreign policy too,\u201d he said. Biden and Harris \u201chave made it clear that the first question we must ask ourselves here at State is: How will this benefit our fellow Americans? How will this policy answer their needs? How will this outreach reflect their values? How will this initiative make their lives just a little bit better?\u201d Biden and Harris repeatedly told the diplomats gathered in the auditorium and those watching online how much value the administration places in their work. Harris told the department that \u201cthis is the foundation on which we stand\u201d and \u201ceverything you do \u2026 makes a difference in the lives of everyday Americans.\u201d Biden in particular hammered the point home. \u201cIn our administration, you\u2019re going to be trusted and empowered to do your job,\u201d the President first said in his remarks to staff and then reprised the theme in his second, more formal speech. \u201cThis administration is going to empower you to do your jobs,\u201d Biden said, \u201cnot target or politicize you.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Jason Hoffman and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cWailing in fear,\u201d the crew of Odysseus\u2019 boat row toward two \u201cenormous crags.\u201d To starboard was the cave of Scylla, a \u201cterrible, savage, wild\u201d creature with 12 legs, six \u201clong swaying necks, a hideous head on each \u2026 barbed with a triple row of fangs.\u201d To port was \u201cawesome Charybdis,\u201d a treacherous whirlpool. As the panicked sailors stare at the churning water, six of their number are snatched by the monster and swallowed up. Homer\u2019s Odyssey bequeathed to us the model of a nightmare travel story \u2013 along with the phrase \u201cbetween Scylla and Charybdis\u201d to vividly describe the dilemma of choosing between two dreadful alternatives. No comparable terrors awaited President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as they set out on high-stakes, official trips this past week \u2013 he to Europe and she to Latin America \u2013 but there were indeed political dangers lurking amid their travels. \u201cNo US President has ever left the nation\u2019s shores with democratic values under attack as broadly and systemically at home as they are abroad,\u201d observed CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson. David A. Andelman noted that Biden arrived in Britain, the first stop on his trip, with \u201ca single, unified theme \u2013 one he\u2019s enunciated at virtually every opportunity since his arrival and that he clearly intends to repeat at the G-7 summit this weekend and the NATO summit that will follow. That message? America\u2019s back. And you can count on us.\u201d First lady Jill Biden\u2019s \u201cLove\u201d blazer \u2013 a sharp contrast to Melania Trump\u2019s \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do U?\u201d jacket, which she wore on a trip to visit immigrant children in McAllen, Texas, in 2018 \u2013 helped drive home the point. Andelman, who conferred with some European diplomats, wrote that \u201cit will take a lot to convince them that Biden represents a return to normalcy and not simply a peaceful interregnum before America snaps back to a toxic nationalism.\u201d At the outset of the G-7 summit, Jill Biden and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, met in Cornwall with experts on education, a subject in which both women have taken a special interest. \u201cEarly childhood care and education should be seen as among the defining, strategic issues of our time,\u201d they wrote for CNN Opinion. \u201cWhat would happen if we really followed the science of early childhood and started focusing on the things that would make the biggest difference for children and those who guide them? We could transform the prospects of an entire generation.\u201d Ahead for Joe Biden lies a politically volatile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Switzerland, along with potentially fraught sessions with US allies who differ with the US government\u2019s stances on Russia and China. Still, the trip has offered the President an opportunity to demonstrate international leadership amid the pandemic: In remarks from the seaside village of St. Ives in Cornwall on Thursday, Biden committed the US to donating to the world 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19. In 1940, with the UK fighting for survival against Nazi Germany, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called America the \u201cgreat arsenal of democracy,\u201d producing \u201cplanes and ships and guns and shells\u201d for its own defense as well as for the British. Biden talks of the US being an \u201carsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world,\u201d noted historian Thomas Balcerski. \u201cIf he is successful, a new Covid-19 Marshall Plan that simultaneously saves lives and stimulates the global economy may be on the horizon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt stake may also be America\u2019s role as a world leader.\u201d During Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 trip to Mexico and Guatemala, she warned potential migrants, \u201cDo not come.\u201d Those three words dismayed progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as Raul A. Reyes observed. \u201cHarris was wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy law, asylum-seekers are required to be present in the US when they make their case. This is as true now as it was when Donald Trump was President. So advising people simply to stay home is brushing aside what could be legitimate fears of persecution in their own countries.\u201d Then Harris \u201cswatted away\u201d a question from NBC\u2019s Lester Holt on why she had not visited the US southern border. \u201cTo some observers she came across as flippant and ill-prepared for what should have been an easily foreseeable question,\u201d wrote Reyes. Republicans are targeting the vice president, partly because their attacks on Biden have not resonated. \u201cIt may well be that as a woman of color and a daughter of immigrants Harris is being held to an impossible standard for success,\u201d Reyes added. \u201cMultiple administrations have wrestled with problems at the border, and people expect Harris to solve it in a matter of months?\u201d Even before the President\u2019s trip began, Biden faced an attack at home \u2013 by a cicada on his neck. \u201cWatch out for the cicadas. I just got one, it got me,\u201d he warned reporters. The insects, part of a brood in the middle of their once-every-17-years emergence, also swarmed the engines of the White House press pool plane, forcing its grounding. CNN commentator Elliot Williams spotted a cicada on his pants just as he was about to go on Wolf Blitzer\u2019s show. \u201cAm I the only one who thinks we might be mere days from submitting to the rule of our sentient insect overlords? When we\u2019re all put to work harvesting tree sap, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d Williams wrote. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency ended more than four months ago, but the full picture of his administration\u2019s abuses is still emerging. On Wednesday, CNN\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel David Vigilante revealed that he had been placed under a secret gag order last July by a federal judge as the Trump Justice Department sought email records of CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr. In December, Vigilante recalled, a judge hearing an appeal filed by CNN described the Justice Department\u2019s explanation of why it needed the records as based on \u201cspeculative predictions, assumptions and scenarios unanchored in any facts.\u201d Vigilante wrote, \u201cHistory teaches us that secret tribunals are ripe for abuse by even well-intentioned officials. Given recent revelations about other (William) Barr DOJ abuses, it is fair to question whether the very high standard for requesting these secret orders was ever satisfied.\u201d On Thursday, CNN reported that the Trump Justice Department secretly compelled Apple to turn over data from the accounts of Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, their staff and family members. \u201cThese new reports are another reminder of the extreme exercise of presidential power that took place under Trump,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cAlthough it is easy to dismiss his four years in office as defined by a lot of loud Twitter noise and vicious political invective, this period also witnessed the aggressive deployment of presidential authority, sometimes conducted in secret, and in ways that threatened our fragile balance of power and the rights of American citizens.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that Barr \u201cpoliticized the Justice Department,\u201d wrote former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. The new disclosures show he went a huge step further. \u201cBarr used the staggering power of his position to selectively pursue Trump\u2019s perceived political rivals. This is eerily similar to former President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u2018enemies list\u2019 and his efforts at retributive action.\u201d Inside Trump\u2019s administration, White House counsel Don McGahn refused the former president\u2019s instructions to seek the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 US presidential campaign, McGahn confirmed in testimony this week to a House committee. Michael D\u2019Antonio concluded, \u201cDon McGahn proved that truth-tellers can be found, and his testimony confirms Trump wielded the power of his office with little regard for truth, democracy, impartiality or the law. For millions of Americans who bought into Trump\u2019s lies, we\u2019ll need a lot more of that McGahn-style truth in order to move forward.\u201d For more on politics: Frida Ghitis: What the Jan. 6 riot report was too afraid to say Nicole Hemmer: The shocking government leak that changed everything in 1971 Issac Bailey: Obama is still a \u2018hope and change\u2019 guy.

Airline crews have been taking abuse from passengers, one of whom punched a Southwest Airlines flight attendant in the face, causing her to lose two teeth. Southwest and American Airlines reacted by calling off plans to resume serving alcohol. But American made an exception for first-class and business-class travelers, noted neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky. Research does show \u201ca substantial increase in the likelihood of \u2018air rage\u2019 among coach passengers when boarding required that they walk through the first-class section to get to their seats\u201d but \u201chaving coach passengers board through the first-class section also increased belligerent behavior in the FIRST-class passengers,\u201d Sapolsky observed. \u201cSo, maybe airlines haven\u2019t made their alcohol exception because of the exemplary behavior of first-class passengers. Instead, it could simply be the bottom line \u2013 keep the booze flowing or the high rollers will take their business elsewhere.\u201d Democrats\u2019 efforts to pass a sweeping voting reform bill and greenlight trillions in social spending came to a screeching halt last Sunday, when Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia wrote in his home state\u2019s Charleston Gazette-Mail, \u201cDo we really want to live in an America where one party can dictate and demand everything and anything it wants, whenever it wants? I have always said, \u2018If I can\u2019t go home and explain it, I can\u2019t vote for it.\u2019 And I cannot explain strictly partisan election reform or blowing up the Senate rules to expedite one party\u2019s agenda.\u201d Many fellow Democrats blasted Manchin. Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York wrote, \u201cThe senior senator from West Virginia either doesn\u2019t understand or doesn\u2019t care about the stakes of this fight. Democracy is fragile, and right now, ours is hanging by a thread. Not too long ago in this country, someone who looked like me had to take a literacy test or pay a poll tax before they could vote in many states.\u201d  Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan argued that Democrats are making a mistake in lashing out at Manchin, who represents the reddest of red states. The party holds the thinnest of majorities in Congress and \u201cAmerica is not an overwhelmingly progressive country \u2026 If Democrats are to have continued success as a viable national coalition, they need to maintain a party \u2013 in red states as well as blue states \u2013 that is inclusive and welcoming of a much wider array of political viewpoints \u2013 even those that might be right of center, as is the case of Manchin.\u201d Biden\u2019s negotiations with Republicans in the Senate for an infrastructure package broke down Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d wrote Scott Jennings. \u201cThere was more value for both parties in striking a deal than in winning yet another Washington blame game over why nothing is happening. Biden should have taken the last GOP offer and run with it \u2013 nearly $1 trillion, most of it paid for by repurposing unspent Covid relief funds, and limited largely to roads, bridges, highways, airports and seaports. The progressives don\u2019t like it, but there\u2019s nowhere else for them to go.\u201d For more: John Fetterman: On transformative legislation, Joe Manchin should step up Lincoln Mitchell: Here\u2019s how Joe Manchin can show he\u2019s a true patriot The world\u2019s richest person, Jeff Bezos, posted on Instagram Monday that he will board one of his company\u2019s rockets for a brief flight into space on July 20. The next day, ProPublica revealed that it had obtained from an unknown source a \u201cvast cache\u201d of confidential IRS data showing that billionaires often pay little or nothing in federal income taxes \u2013 Bezos paid zero in 2007 and 2011, for example, according to the non-profit journalism site. Economist Jeff Sachs wrote, that \u201cnot only is our tax system not collecting taxes from America\u2019s richest individuals \u2013 it\u2019s designed not to do so. Suppose that in a given year Bezos\u2019 shares rise by $20 billion and, instead of selling those shares, he borrows $1 billion against them to fund his luxurious consumption. He won\u2019t owe or pay a penny of income tax.\u201d Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon, the company he led to dominance of online retail. He owns The Washington Post, Whole Foods and MGM, wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cJeff Bezos seems to have run out of things to colonize here on Earth,\u201d she observed. \u201cFor a better model of what to do with his money, Bezos might look at his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott \u2013 who, along with her new husband, Dan Jewett, has signed the Giving Pledge, promising to donate the majority of their wealth. In 2020, Scott gave away almost $6 billion. Recently, she has focused on supporting historically Black colleges and universities, proving that she has the ability to empathize with people whose experiences are different from her own.\u201d In The Washington Post, Megan McArdle raised a question about the tax story. \u201cProPublica\u2019s reporting suggests they didn\u2019t pay taxes in years when they made no money, and the deductions they were taking seem to be largely legitimate ones you\u2019ve heard of \u2013 think charitable donations, not hidden offshore accounts. The main complaint is that ProPublica thinks the ultrawealthy ought to be taxed on a broader definition of income than the IRS uses.\u201d \u201cProPublica\u2019s formulation makes it sound like a loophole. In fact, that\u2019s how everyone\u2019s taxes work: Ordinary Americans don\u2019t pay income tax every time our stock portfolios go up or our homes appreciate a bit. We pay the tax when we sell. Why should American billionaires be different?\u201d Many people are emerging from Covid lockdowns haltingly \u2013 sometimes anxiously \u2013 as they try to relearn the basics of social skills in a changed world. Dr. Megan Ranney and Elizabeth Stuart wrote, \u201cwho among us hasn\u2019t had the recent experience of running into a friend we haven\u2019t seen in a year and not knowing what to do. Our social interactions these days so often start out with an awkward question: \u2018Can I give you a hug?\u2019 Or, \u2018You OK with a handshake?\u2019 Or even just, \u2018Vaccinated?\u2019\u201d It \u201cremains frustratingly difficult to figure out what\u2019s right, what\u2019s safe, and what\u2019s respectful.\u201d Read their advice. David Holtgrave, dean of the University of Albany School of Public Health, wrote that people should be mindful of the more transmissible Delta variant of the virus that causes Covid-19. It \u201cfirst devastated India, and still poses a major international health threat,\u201d Holtgrave wrote. \u201cThere should be an expanded and urgent campaign to encourage mask use and social distancing among partially and unvaccinated persons, while encouraging vaccinations for those who have not yet received them. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins recently said that states with low vaccination rates are \u2018sitting ducks\u2019 for the next Covid-19 outbreak. He is correct \u2013 and I would add that this is true not only for states but also for smaller geographic areas with low vaccination rates.\u201d Also: David Perry: This school year\u2019s end feels like a miracle Ed Morales: \u2018In the Heights\u2019 is glorious eye and ear candy \u2013 with something missing Jill Filipovic: Ellie Kemper really doesn\u2019t deserve this Anshel Pfeffer: Netanyahu is failing, but not exactly the way Trump did Alexander J.

Here\u2019s how everything changed Gina Piscitello: These bonuses for doctors create an immoral conflict If you thought Odysseus had a tough journey going home to Ithaca, consider the Blackpoll warbler. It weighs \u201cless than an empty soda can,\u201d wrote Dr. Elizabeth Gray, the National Audubon Society\u2019s first woman president. The bird \u201ctravels more than 12,000 miles round trip every year from Alaska and Canada\u2019s Boreal Forest, across North America and the Atlantic Ocean, to South America where it spends the winter.\u201d \u201cJust like change is a necessary part of our lives, these migration journeys are necessary for the survival of birds. Yet, they are getting harder and harder. Birds face shrinking habitats, more extreme weather, like droughts, and poorly managed industrial activity,\u201d Gray wrote. \u201cWe have lost three billion birds in North America since 1970 \u2013 and two-thirds face the threat of extinction if we do nothing to manage climate change. Birds are a bellwether of what is happening in the environment. They are telling us they are in trouble. And if they are in trouble, so are we.\u201d",

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. The era of small government, or at least a long chapter in it, ended last year when the economy started sliding into a coma in the midst of the worst health crisis in a century and the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression. With millions infected with the coronavirus and millions more unemployed, there was no question the magnitude of the problem required the government to step in boldly, and it did. Now, President Joe Biden is leveraging the crisis to correct problems that existed before the pandemic but became more visible during the disaster. Big spending had already started under former President Donald Trump. Biden is doubling down and making a sharp turn. His budget proposal, revealed Friday, presses the accelerator to speed away from most of Trump\u2019s policies. Watching Biden over the past 10 weeks, Americans may have wondered what happened to the centrist candidate who won the election. Until now his raft of economic and social programs had little in common with traditional middle-of-the road positions. This budget shows that, despite his aggressive push to leverage the power of the federal government to shape economic and social change, Biden still has enough areas of disagreement with the left wing of the Democratic Party to make decisions that can also bring their blood to a boil. In a budget filled with hundreds of millions of dollars for education, housing, and poverty alleviation, Biden also fortified the country\u2019s already robust defense budget, even expanding it to 1.7% more than the previous year, to a massive $753 billion, a sharp divergence from the 10% cut recommended by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The defense request, which officials defended as necessary to lead the Western alliance and out-compete China, is smaller than Trump had requested, and less than Republicans insist the Pentagon needs. Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican in the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the spending \u201csignals weakness to China and Russia.\u201d But California Rep. Ro Khana, of the Progressive Caucus, accused Biden of \u201cpouring more money into price gouging defense contractors & wasteful projects.\u201d The 30% who could end the pandemic Beyond the defense request, Biden\u2019s budget shows a President eager to undo not just the wounds from the pandemic but also the damage of the Trump years at home and abroad. These are plans meant to have a potent impact at home, but also keeping a sharp focus on America\u2019s global position, aiming to fortify its diplomatic muscle without weakening its military one. In that combination, there\u2019s something for the left and for the right to dislike. Biden is trying to reclaim and redefine his centrist credentials. He wants the United States to remain a global power, a global leader. But his principal focus is a domestic transformation that will cost an eye-popping amount of money. The discretionary budget request, $769 billion for non-defense items in addition to the $715 billion for defense, does not include the $1.9 trillion Covid relief already approved, or the more than $2 trillion infrastructure plan Biden is proposing. A full budget will come later. But we now have a clear look at what Biden wants to do. Biden wants to boost diplomacy, proposing a 12% increase for the State Department. Recall that Trump tried every year he was in office to decimate State\u2019s budget, announcing sharp cuts. An already-reenergized State Department said in a statement that the new funds will help work with allies and partners to tackle the pandemic and climate change \u201cas well as the growing ambitions of China and global threats to democracy.\u201d Why Joe Biden is a man in a hurry The numbers also confirm a new approach to dealing with the border. Gone is any money for Trump\u2019s border wall (the one he said Mexico would pay for) with the emphasis shifting drastically. Money for the Department of Homeland Security stays little changed, but funding is elsewhere, with a long-term effort to change the conditions that lead people to leave their homes. As promised earlier, Biden is proposing an initial $861 million to improve conditions in Central America, combating corruption and violence, and seeking to strengthen the economies of the countries from where most asylum seekers come to the United States. The budget gives a massive 23% boost to the Department of Health and Human Services, including $8.7 billion more for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s another U-turn from Trump\u2019s disastrous slashing of HHS funding. His 2019 budget was bemoaned by the American Public Health Association as \u201cdevastating,\u201d to public health in keeping with the practice every year he was in office. Another favorite target of Trump cuts, now slated to receive support, is the Department of Education. Trump slashed its budget, Biden proposes to boost it sharply, by 41%, with most of the new funds going to help the schools where the poorest children are getting their education with inadequate resources.  The discretionary request includes money to fight climate change, improve energy efficiency, combat homelessness, poverty and inequality. In keeping with what we have since Biden came to office, it shows an extraordinarily ambitious presidency, with a whole new philosophy of governing. It\u2019s not just because there\u2019s a new man in the Oval Office. It\u2019s because that man was elected during a time when the country discovered that, while there\u2019s much that free markets can achieve on their own, some problems are so big that only the government can solve them.",

            "article_content": "Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating Sen. Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, was recommended for parole on Friday. After 53 years in prison, the 77-year-old inmate\u2019s fate is now in the hands of California\u2019s governor. Two of Kennedy\u2019s surviving sons, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, supported the release during Sirhan\u2019s 16th appearance before the parole board, yet several of Kennedy\u2019s other children have strongly opposed the move. Sirhan arrived at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in May 1969 after being convicted of first-degree murder and assault with intent to murder. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr. Sirhan face to face,\u201d Douglas Kennedy, who was a toddler when his father was gunned down in 1968, said during the virtual hearing. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.\u201d Sirhan, wearing a blue uniform with a paper towel folded like a handkerchief into his pocket, smiled. \u201cI do have some love for you,\u201d Douglas Kennedy told the inmate, who nodded and lowered his head. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has favored Sirhan\u2019s release in the past, wrote in support of parole. He said he was moved when he first met Sirhan \u2013 \u201cwho wept, clinching my hands and asked for forgiveness\u201d \u2013 and offered to be \u201ca guiding friend for him.\u201d The two-person panel recommended parole, but said the decision is not yet final. Despite the recommendation for release, the board\u2019s decision could be reversed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who will determine if the grant is consistent with public safety, a process that could take a few months. Newsom is in the midst of a campaign battle, facing a recall election on September 14. Though it was Sirhan\u2019s 16th parole hearing, it was the first time state prosecutors did not oppose his release. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n did not make his prosecutors available to speak during Sirhan\u2019s parole hearing, affirming his stance that the role of a prosecutor ends at sentencing. Los Angeles law enforcement submitted a letter in opposition to Sirhan\u2019s release, according to Parole Board Commissioner Robert Barton, who said there were also letters from the public and members of the Kennedy family. Barton said the panel considers all submissions but also attempts to determine whether Sirhan poses a danger to society. \u201cI have no such intention whatsoever,\u201d Sirhan said at one point about being a repeat offender. Barton said Sirhan qualified as a youth offender and was youth parole-eligible, and the board is required to give that \u201cgreat weight\u201d under law. He also qualified for elderly parole at age 77 after serving more than 20 years. Gasc\u00f3n adviser Alex Bastian, in a statement this week, noted that the parole board has all the pertinent facts and evaluations, along with behavior during incarceration. \u201cIf someone is the same person that committed an atrocious crime, that person will correctly not be found suitable for release. However, if someone is no longer a threat to public safety after having served more than 50 years in prison, then the parole board may recommend release based on an objective determination,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cOur office policies take these principles into account and as such, our prosecutors stay out of the parole board hearing process,\u201d Bastian added. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s office said the previous practice, typical of many district attorneys across the country, involved almost always objecting to inmate releases, based solely on the circumstances of the crime and not on the actions of the inmate in the years following. The new directive aims to leave the decision up to the parole board. Barton said the DA\u2019s absence made no difference in the decision because prosecutors had opposed parole in the past. Gasc\u00f3n was elected DA late last year on a promise of sweeping criminal justice reforms, including ending cash bail for certain minor offenses, the death penalty and the practice of charging juveniles as adults. In response to Sirhan\u2019s parole recommendation, six of Kennedy\u2019s children issued a statement excoriating the decision. \u201cAs children of Robert F. Kennedy, we are devastated that the man who murdered our father has been recommended for parole. Our father\u2019s death is a very difficult matter for us to discuss publicly and for the past many decades we have declined to engage directly in the parole process,\u201d said the statement from Kennedy\u2019s children Joseph P., Courtney, Kerry, Christopher, Maxwell and Rory. \u201cGiven today\u2019s unexpected recommendation by the California parole board after 15 previous decisions to deny release, we feel compelled to make our position clear. We adamantly oppose the parole and release of Sirhan Sirhan and are shocked by a ruling that we believe ignores the standards for parole of a confessed, first-degree murderer in the state of California,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are in disbelief that this man would be recommended for release. We urge the Parole Board staff, the full Board, and ultimately, Governor Newsom, to reverse this initial recommendation.  It is a recommendation we intend to challenge every step of the way, and we hope that those who also hold the memory of our father in their hearts will stand with us.\u201d Sirhan shot Kennedy to death in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles following a campaign event in which Kennedy celebrated primary victories in his run for the Democratic nomination for president in 1968. Initially sentenced to death for the murder, Sirhan\u2019s punishment was commuted to life in prison in 1972 after the California State Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. Angela Berry, Sirhan\u2019s attorney, provided sentencing memorandums focusing on her client\u2019s youth at the time of the murder \u2013 he was 24 \u2013 and his childhood. Describing Sirhan as a Palestinian who became a refugee at age four, he \u201cwitnessed atrocities most of us only see in movies or in our worst nightmares\u201d before emigrating to the US as a teenager. Berry praised the panel for \u201ckeeping the politics out and following the law.\u201d She said she and Sirhan congratulated one another and that she was concerned about other inmates trying to \u201cjeopardize\u201d his eventual release date. Barton asked Sirhan what his life intention was at 24. The inmate said he wanted a career, to marry and settle down as a \u201cgood solid member of the community\u201d and that\u2019s what he hoped to do now if released. Barton asked Sirhan if he follows the Middle East conflict and his feelings about it. Sirhan said he did not follow the situation but thinks about refugees and their suffering. He broke down. \u201cTake a few deep breaths,\u201d Barton said. Barton reminded him the conflict has not gone away. Sirhan said he felt \u201cthe misery that those people are experiencing. It\u2019s painful.\u201d He called them \u201ckindred,\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t be human if their plight didn\u2019t move him. \u201cAlthough whatever I would want to do in the future, it would be towards resolving that peacefully,\u201d Sirhan added. \u201cI think peaceful means are the best way to resolve that conflict in the Middle East.\u201d Barton said the panel had no control over whether Sirhan is deported to Jordan. \u201cTo me, the concern would be that you would become some type of, you know, symbol or lightning rod to foment more violence,\u201d Barton said. If released on parole, Sirhan plans to live with his only surviving brother in Los Angeles, according to the filing. Barton said, if released, Sirhan would likely be placed in a transitional home at first and transferred to his brother\u2019s home six months later. \u201cI want to be there for him,\u201d Sirhan said of his brother during the hearing. Sirhan said he was not a heavy drinker and that he had hard liquor the night of the shooting. He vowed to remain \u201calcohol-free\u201d and said he was learning to manage his anger. \u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d Sirhan said. He said he is Christian and meditates regularly. Sirhan said he took responsibility for taking the gun into the hotel and firing the shots. Barton pressed Sirhan about the Middle East conflict, and his bouts of impulsivity and poor judgment clouded by alcohol at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to establish by asking you questions if you\u2019re still that person,\u201d Barton said. \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d Sirhan said. An attorney for the Kennedy family did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Sirhan was convicted of killing Kennedy and wounding five other people during the June 5, 1968, shooting inside the kitchen service pantry of the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Three bullets struck Kennedy\u2019s body while a fourth bullet passed harmlessly through the shoulder of his suit coat. Kennedy, the most seriously wounded of the six victims, died the next day. The other five people survived their wounds. In 1968, the 42-year-old Kennedy, younger brother of the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, was a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination against Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Sen. Eugene McCarthy. On the night of his assassination, Kennedy had just appeared on live television in an Ambassador Hotel ballroom, where he had claimed victory over McCarthy in the California primary election. Moments later, he was fatally wounded in the hotel service pantry while on his way to a news conference set for a small banquet room just beyond the pantry. The shooting in the pantry was not captured by any cameras. At Friday\u2019s hearing, Sirhan was asked what he would say about people who believe he\u2019s angry after decades behind bars. \u201cI disagree with them outright,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for having my life spared from the gas chamber. I value my life so much \u2026 I would never put myself in jeopardy again.\u201d He added, \u201cYou have my pledge. I will always look to safety and peace and nonviolence.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jack Hannah and Natasha Chen contributed.",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The FDA has granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people 16 and older, paving the way for more vaccine mandates and hopefully encouraging more hesitant people to get the shot. New mandates are already rolling out for teachers in New York City and state employees in New Jersey. The US military also will now require all service members to be vaccinated. The daily pace of vaccinations in the US has been over 400,000 every day through August, and Dr. Anthony Fauci says if most eligible people get vaccinated, the US could have control of Covid-19 by this coming spring in 2022. But for now, case rates are still soaring, with about 147,000 new cases a day in the US. In Kentucky, the National Guard has been called in to help overwhelmed hospitals, much to the relief of desperate health care workers. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. G7 leaders meet today in an emergency summit to discuss the August 31 deadline for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. International leaders are likely to encourage President Joe Biden to extend the deadline to allow for more evacuations, but Biden hasn\u2019t agreed to a change yet. About 6,500 people are still waiting at the Kabul airport for evacuation flights. And countries are still in the process of figuring out how to accommodate this influx of Afghan refugees. Airbnb\u2019s CEO Brian Chesky called the situation \u201cone of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time,\u201d and pledged free housing to 20,000 refugees. Another complication of the chaotic situation in Afghanistan: an intelligence vacuum. Intelligence agencies have had to move some resources out of Afghanistan, potentially leaving gaping security holes just as extremist groups and terrorist networks get a boost from Taliban victories. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Kathy Hochul was sworn in a few hours ago as New York\u2019s first female governor, replacing her disgraced predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid multiple scandals. Hochul has promised to remake any toxic areas of the executive chamber she inherits, including ditching any aides found to be \u201cdoing anything unethical\u201d by the recent state attorney general\u2019s report that found Cuomo had harassed 11 women. In his parting remarks as governor, Cuomo launched a series of attacks on his political rivals and questioned the motives of the state AG. And he\u2019s not out of the clear: The New York State Assembly forged ahead with an investigation into Cuomo\u2019s misdeeds despite his resignation; that report has not yet been released. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. The final report detailing the findings of Arizona\u2019s sham \u201caudit\u201d of 2020 election ballots was supposed to be released yesterday but was delayed because three of the five members of the auditing team have tested positive for coronavirus. That includes the CEO of Cyber Ninjas, which was hired by the Republican-led Arizona Senate to audit the 2.1 million votes cast in Maricopa County in the presidential race. Some state leaders have warned the report from the audit, which is highly partisan, will contain \u201cunreliable\u201d conclusions. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, civil rights groups are cheering a preliminary ruling that could clear the way for some 56,000 state residents who have been convicted of felonies \u2013 but who aren\u2019t currently serving prison time \u2013 to register to vote. Advocates challenged a state law that denies felons the right to vote until they have completed all aspects of their sentence, including probation and parole. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The global shipping crisis, which has seen snarled supply chains and shutdowns in the pandemic, is only getting worse. The Delta variant is sparking more critical port closures, like the partial Covid-19-related shutdown of a facility in China that\u2019s the world\u2019s third-busiest container port. Complications like this create shipping backlogs, which have a ripple effect on jammed warehouses and stretched road and rail capacity. They also increase shipping prices. Some consumer goods producers are taking drastic steps to meet demand, such as changing where products are made and moving them by plane instead of boat. But ultimately, the situation will wear on consumers\u2019 wallets, and shoppers are going to face higher prices and possible shipping disruptions going into the holiday season. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) To understand why the CDC changed its face mask guidance for vaccinated people, just look at what happened in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The town, which attracts thousands of visitors for the Fourth of July, saw a Covid-19 outbreak in the weeks around the holiday \u2013 and about 75% of cases were among fully vaccinated people. That suggests that even those who got the shot can spread the virus. Still, CDC data shows 99.99% of fully vaccinated Americans haven\u2019t had a breakthrough case that resulted in hospitalization or death. It\u2019s the unvaccinated who are currently filling up hospitals. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. After months of negotiation, a bipartisan group of senators has finalized the text of a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The more than 2,000-page legislation includes federal funding for roads, bridges, passenger and freight rail, and the electric grid, among other projects. The Senate could still make amendments to the bill before voting, but Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he expects the legislation to pass the chamber in a matter of days. It would then need approval from the House \u2013 where it could face pushback from progressives who feel it doesn\u2019t go far enough \u2013 before making its way to President Biden\u2019s desk. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. There were 91 large wildfires burning across the US as of yesterday. The blazes have burned more than 1.8 million acres, with more than 400,000 acres burned in Oregon by the Bootleg Fire alone. Monsoon rains moving into the West could stomp out some of the fires, but lightning and gusty winds could contribute to new ones. The US isn\u2019t alone: More than 100 blazes have swept Turkey in the past week, too. In Lagos, Nigeria \u2013 Africa\u2019s most populous city \u2013 residents are facing a different climate change problem: destructive floods and rising seas. Experts warn it could soon be unlivable. The Taliban is threatening to seize its first of Afghanistan\u2019s provincial capitals. Fighting between the Taliban and the Afghan government intensified over the weekend, and US airstrikes have been hitting Taliban targets in three cities considered to be \u201cendangered\u201d by Taliban advances. The clashes have been especially heavy in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. Local journalists say the Taliban now controls several districts of the city, which sits on strategic routes in all directions. This comes as the US is in its final stages of withdrawing from Afghanistan. Since American troops started pulling out in May, the Taliban has rapidly gained control of large parts of the country. The speed at which it has gained on the government has shocked many and prompted concerns that Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital, could be next to fall. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. Myanmar\u2019s military ruler has declared himself prime minister of the country. In a speech yesterday, he announced a newly formed caretaker government and pledged to hold elections by 2023. The move comes exactly six months after Myanmar\u2019s military seized power in a coup and detained the country\u2019s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Since then, military authorities have faced months of protests and responded with deadly force. The strikes have brought cities to a standstill and sparked armed conflicts in borderlands. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": "An American family visiting Gaza say they were left \u201cstranded in a hellish situation\u201d for months due to the coronavirus pandemic and a blockade surrounding the Palestinian territory. Hani Almadhoun and his wife, Roa Alhelou, traveled in November with their two daughters, ages 6 and 4, to say goodbye to Almadhoun\u2019s dying grandfather. They had planned to stay in Gaza for four weeks, but it took them nearly three months to leave. Almadhoun said the \u201cnightmare\u201d began on November 3, when the family, who are Palestinian-Americans, left their home in Alexandria, Virginia, and embarked on the trip. \u201cWe voted in the US election and took the plane a few hours later, straight to Cairo, where we got into Gaza through the Rafah Border Crossing,\u201d Almadhoun told CNN. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we saw my grandfather before he died. He was filled with stories and history, and our goal was spending as much time with him as we could.\u201d The Rafah Border Crossing, a point between Gaza and Egypt, is run by Egyptian and Palestinian authorities and is the only border crossing accessible to most Palestinians who live in Gaza. About a week after Almadhoun\u2019s grandfather died on November 19, the crossing was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions. With the Erez Crossing, an entry point into Israel, also closed, the family was stuck. \u201cWe realized we were stuck around December 25 \u2026 that\u2019s when we started worrying,\u201d Almadhoun said. Almadhoun and Alhelou were familiar with the dire situation in Gaza. Not only did they emigrate from there, but Almadhoun works as a director of philanthropy for a United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees. For their US-born daughters, however, Almadhoun said it wasn\u2019t like anything they had ever experienced. The territory is only 140 square miles, but home to nearly 2 million people. That\u2019s roughly the same size as Detroit, but with nearly three times the population. Vaccination rates highlight stark differences between Israelis and Palestinians -- amid row over responsibility It is governed by Hamas, a Palestinian political and militant group designated by the US and others as a terrorist organization. Since 2007, Israel has maintained a blockade of Gaza\u2019s land, air and sea, while Egypt oversees the southern Rafah crossing. Israel regulates civilian movement and the importation of basic goods into Gaza. It also routinely carries out military operations there. Israeli officials say these measures are necessary to prevent Hamas and other armed groups from smuggling weapons or carrying out attacks on Israel. Palestinians say the measures are violent and oppressive. The United Nations has described the blockade of Gaza as the \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of the Palestinian people living there and says the circumstances make the territory \u201cunlivable.\u201d On many nights, while spending time with his family or working remotely, Almadhoun said he could hear the sounds of drones flying overhead and what sounded like missiles striking targets not far from their home in Gaza City. \u201cBeing in Gaza is hard. At times it was hell. You get maybe six or eight hours of electricity a day, and some days there is not even water,\u201d Almadhoun said. \u201cDrinking water is scarce, potable water is so salty and in some cases dangerous. There is severe poverty with more than half of the population unemployed, and it can cause all kinds of other problems.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic has only made the situation worse, he said. Decades of conflict have left Gaza\u2019s medical system in shambles. Medicines, ventilators and other vital medical equipment are hard to come by. As of February 13, Gaza has recorded more than 53,000 coronavirus cases and 536 deaths, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. \u201cGaza is not the place you want to get the coronavirus,\u201d Almadhoun said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to deal with a serious health matter, with little to no health supplies, let alone ventilators.\u201d Almadhoun said his concern for his family grew with every new report of coronavirus cases. The Rafah Border Crossing would open sporadically, but he said he could never get his family through. \u201cWe were registered on the waiting list for travel through Rafah but our name just never came up,\u201d he said. Every day he would check. The family attempted to leave four times, but Almadhoun said they were always turned away by border officials. That\u2019s because their names wouldn\u2019t show up on the local government\u2019s list at the border, even though the list published online included their names. Almadhoun had traveled to Gaza in 2009, before he was a US citizen, and had encountered similar frustrations trying to enter and exit the blockaded territory through Rafah. In 2013 and 2018, he visited as a US citizen, and was able to leave through Rafah without delays. On New Year\u2019s Day, Almadhoun reached out to the US Embassy in Jerusalem but said he was rebuffed in a \u201cdehumanizing and humiliating\u201d way. He said the embassy\u2019s answers were short and did not provide any assistance or explanation. Ultimately, he felt as if his family did not matter to embassy officials. In an email seen by CNN, the US Embassy denied his family help, saying \u201cdo not request assistance until after the lockdown is over.\u201d When asked for comment, the US Embassy in Jerusalem referred CNN to the US State Department. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Almadhoun\u2019s case, citing \u201cprivacy considerations,\u201d but said \u201cthe welfare and safety of US citizens abroad is one of the highest priorities of the Department of State.\u201d The spokesperson directed CNN to a travel advisory issued in September warning Americans: \u201cDo not travel to Gaza due to COVID-19, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict.\u201d \u201cThe US government is unable to provide emergency services to US citizens in Gaza,\u201d the advisory added. Almadhoun was aware of the advisory, which is ever present for the territory. But for Palestinians wishing to see loved ones in Gaza, he said it\u2019s a risk they must take. \u201cIf I were to follow the advisory, I would effectively be cut off from my family and my elderly parents,\u201d Almadhoun said. Given his past experiences traveling to Gaza as a US citizen, and the Covid-19 pandemic, Almadhoun expected the US Embassy would help. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we went to Gaza to smoke hookah. We went to see our dying grandfather,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a human thing to do. We didn\u2019t expect not to get any help, or even just kind words, from the American embassy. All their replies were robotic and scripted.\u201d Almadhoun believes that if his family was not Palestinian, the US Embassy in Jerusalem would have treated them differently. \u201cI never received help from them in the past, but I hoped with the pandemic they were feeling more human,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, you\u2019re an American citizen yet when they see you\u2019re Palestinian, that\u2019s all you are, and that\u2019s how you\u2019re treated. If they ask if you have a Palestinian ID card and you do, they stop listening.\u201d The State Department spokesperson told CNN: \u201cWe provide the same services to US citizens regardless of their background.\u201d Finally, Almadhoun said after weeks of messaging US officials, the family received the help they needed. Almadhoun said Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine\u2019s office reached out to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, DC, and made a case for the family to cross through the Rafah Border Crossing into Egypt. Kaine\u2019s office did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment. On Febuary 11, Almadhoun and his family left Gaza for Cairo. They will arrive in the US on Wednesday. \u201cEven when it gets hard, leaving Gaza is never easy. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever see your family again, so it\u2019s like yes we want to go home, but it\u2019s very emotionally taxing,\u201d Almadhoun said. \u201cAs a Palestinian, you are a stateless person. Even as an American, when you\u2019re Palestinian, it doesn\u2019t matter. We were abandoned, forgotten by everyone. So we are fortunate to be here and to tell this story.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voters head to the polls to cast ballots for mayor in key American cities on Tuesday. Divisions that have played out in Washington between moderate and progressive Democrats are also very much alive in these races in predominantly Democratic cities as the party tries to chart its future. Overhauling policing procedures has been top of mind for many voters and mayoral candidates after a year of intense advocacy for change following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The fate of a ballot measure in Minneapolis that would create a new department of public safety is likely to color the national debate heading into the 2022 as Republicans look for opportunities to blame Democrats for rising crime. Mayoral races are typically non-partisan contests, but some of these Democrat-on-Democrat races may offer a preview of the ideological battles in next year\u2019s primary races. Here are five mayor\u2019s races to watch on Tuesday night. Perhaps no city has experienced more upheaval over the relationship between the police and its citizens than Minneapolis after Floyd was killed by a police officer, which inspired Black Lives Matter protests across the country and around the world. The mayoral race here has touched on issues like affordable housing, the climate crisis and rent control, but the debate has centered on the historic problems faced by the city\u2019s police department and how to make city government more accountable to residents. Voters will decide on the future of policing in Minneapolis. The question goes beyond 'defunding the police' Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Mayor Jacob Frey, first elected in 2017, is fending off challenges from 16 candidates. The most progressive candidates and allied groups have increasingly framed the race as a referendum on Frey\u2019s handling of the city\u2019s police department and whether he did enough to rein in what critics perceive as over-policing by the department before Floyd\u2019s death. Frey has been endorsed by prominent Democrats including Gov. Tim Walz, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and state Attorney General Keith Ellison. The winner will be decided by ranked choice voting, which lets voters rank their choices in order of preference. If no one receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are reallocated to voters\u2019 second choices. That process repeats until one candidate wins more than 50% of the vote. Progressives have championed Sheila Nezhad, a community organizer, and former Minnesota state Rep. Kate Knuth, both of whom have the backing of US Rep. Ilhan Omar and have joined forces to encourage voters not to rank Frey on their ballots. No candidate reached the 60% threshold required in the DFL\u2019s caucus to notch the party\u2019s endorsement. But in the final round of that group\u2019s ranked-choice voting, Nezhad led with 53.1%, followed by Frey with 40.3% and \u201cno endorsement\u201d with 6.6%. Differing views on the ballot\u2019s \u201cQuestion 2\u201d have animated the race. It\u2019s a proposed amendment that would remove the Police Department from the city\u2019s charter and replace it with a new Department of Public Safety. If the city continued to employ police officers, they would be organized under that department. It would also remove a requirement to employ a minimum number of officers and would split authority for the new department between the mayor and city council. Frey, who currently has executive oversight over the police department, opposes the measure, arguing that it would place daily public safety operations \u201cin the hands of 14 different officials\u201d and \u201cdilute accountability.\u201d He has stressed that the city already has one of the lowest number of officers per capita of any major city in the country and argues that residents would be better served by investing in and hiring more community-oriented officers. Nezhad and Knuth both favor the measure. Nezhad argues that it would allow the city to move away from spending as much as a third of the city budget on the police department, while fully funding 911 and 311 dispatch systems, violence prevention services, as well as conflict resolution and diversion programs. She has also called for decriminalizing homelessness, drugs, drug use and sex work in Minneapolis. Knuth told CNN the constant refrain she has heard from voters is, \u201cI just want to be able to call for help and not fear who shows up.\u201d She added that Minneapolis does not need \u201cto choose between justice and safety,\u201d but views the proposed transition to a Department of Public Safety as a \u201ccommon sense solution to change a system that has been failing many of our neighbors by over-policing and under-protecting.\u201d Another progressive candidate, attorney AJ Awed, who immigrated to the US at age 5 as the son of Somali war refugees, has outraised Knuth and Nezhad. But he differs with them on the two key measures on Tuesday\u2019s ballot: one giving greater power to the mayor, which he favors, and the second removing the police department from the city charter, which he opposes. Awed underscored that he believes there is \u201cno plan\u201d for the new system described in Question 2 and noted in an email to CNN that \u201cmany people still feel comforted by the presence of police.\u201d He said he believes funding policy alternatives within the department \u201ccan provide for a policing system that is better prepared to face the public safety challenges of our city.\u201d With so many candidates on the ballot, it\u2019s likely no one will surpass 50% in the first round of ranked choice voting. Here is the city\u2019s primer on how votes will be counted. Boston will make history regardless of who wins on Tuesday, with the city\u2019s voters set to elect a Democratic woman of color after a long history of leadership by White men. Polls have shown Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, a champion of progressive policies, opening a commanding lead over her more moderate rival Annissa Essaibi George, who also serves as a Boston city councilor-at-large. Both women have highlighted their family roots as the daughters of immigrants. Wu\u2019s parents came from Taiwan. Essaibi George is the daughter of a Tunisian father and a Polish mother, who was born in a displaced persons\u2019 camp in Germany. Essaibi George, who has joked about her thick Boston accent, has tried to make her experience as a lifelong Bostonian a key credential, pitching herself as a small business owner who attended and later taught in Boston schools, coaching softball on the side. Wu grew up in Chicago and attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where she was a student of then-professor Elizabeth Warren \u2013 the Massachusetts senator whom Wu calls one of her personal heroes and her biggest backers. Wu has written extensively about how she was forced to put her career plans on hold in her early twenties to deal with her mother\u2019s mental illness, becoming a caregiver for her mother and younger sisters at the age of 23. She was just 28 years old when she was elected to the Boston City Council in 2013, later serving as council president, and made it a point to tend to some of her duties with one of her young sons on her hip. Essaibi George has criticized some of Wu\u2019s ideas as too unrealistic and expensive, particularly her fare-free transit proposal, which Wu calls \u201cFree the T.\u201d She opposes rent stabilization, stating in a recent debate that rent control would unfairly impact \u201cour mothers, our fathers, our grandparents \u2013 those who have built some legacy wealth for their families\u201d and predicted it would create greater gentrification while driving families farther out of the city. Wu countered that the policy would give struggling renters predictability and a chance to stay in their communities. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to sit back and say this is something that is impossible and we\u2019re not going to fight for what we need,\u201d Wu said during the recent NBC10 Boston, Telemundo Boston and NECN debate. Essaibi George has opposed reallocating funding from the Boston Police Department\u2019s budget toward programs to address root causes of crime and said the city needs about 300 more officers. Wu\u2019s public safety plan includes diverting non-violent 911 calls to alternative response teams and \u201ccivilianizing\u201d traffic enforcement by having trained, unarmed civilian personnel handle routine infractions like broken tail lights or rolling stops \u2013 a change that she says could reduce the risks of armed confrontations. Wu finished ahead of Essaibi George in September\u2019s preliminary municipal election, but both women dispatched other candidates including Acting Mayor Kim Janey, who replaced Marty Walsh when he became President Joe Biden\u2019s Labor Secretary in March. Essaibi George\u2019s decision to stake out a position in the center of the electorate helped her stay in the game in the first round by winning over more conservative and moderate White voters, said Tufts University political science professor Jeffrey Berry. But that positioning has presented challenges in her one-on-one race with Wu in a city where most of the electorate is to the left of center. \u201cIt\u2019s not a city divided between the haves and have-nots, but it is a city where there\u2019s a lot of people who have a whole lot, along with a lot of people who are working class and are really just making it because of the high cost of living in Boston,\u201d Berry said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about poverty, but it is about working-class people and whether or not they can be taken up a level on the economic ladder.\u201d Fourteen candidates are vying to replace Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who\u2019s not running for reelection. The contest is happening amid alarm about the spike in violent crime, as well as controversy over an effort by the residents of the wealthy community of Buckhead to break off from the capital and create their own city. Bottoms announced in May that she would not seek another term after a trying year dealing with vandalism that followed demonstrations over George Floyd\u2019s death, the GOP-controlled legislature restricting voting rights and the rise in violent crime, which she framed \u2013 to criticism \u2013 as a \u201cCovid crime wave.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s election will be the first since the changes to the state\u2019s election laws, which may offer a window into how those restrictions could impact turnout in 2022 and 2024. Polls suggest that a large swath of the electorate is still undecided, but the leading candidates \u2013 including former Mayor Kasim Reed, City Council President Felicia Moore and Councilman Andre Dickens \u2013 have put Atlanta\u2019s crime rate at the forefront of their campaigns. Shooting incidents have increased dramatically from 406 at this point in 2019 to 629 this year, according to Atlanta Police Department\u2019s October 23 report. Crime is motivating some of the Buckhead leaders who are championing the split from Atlanta. Foes say the proposal to break off the wealthy, 25-square-mile area in northern Atlanta would be a devastating blow to the city\u2019s revenues, while proponents say crime has simply become unmanageable and that they are not seeing a high enough return for their tax dollars. There are also concerns about low morale at the Atlanta Police Department and the number of officers who have departed the force. Tensions were high after Bottoms called for the firing of the officer who shot Rayshard Brooks in the parking lot of a Wendy\u2019s in June of 2020. (The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Brooks scuffled with officers and ran away with one of their stun guns). In June, CNN reported that more than 200 officers had resigned or left the force over the previous year, and only about 60 were hired during that period, according to the department. Dickens\u2019 public safety plan calls for increasing the police force by 250 officers during his first year in office while requiring new training for every police department employee on de-escalation techniques and racial sensitivity. Moore has proposed police reform measures like requiring the release of body camera footage within 72 hours of every police shooting and requiring officers to intervene when they see excessive force. But she has also spoken at length about the need to address low morale in the department \u2013 by promising incentives for retired police officers if they return to their jobs for one to two years, for example. Reed, who served two terms as mayor from 2010 to 2018, has pointed to the lower crime rates during his tenure. His public safety plan includes hiring and training 750 new police officers, ramping up implicit bias and de-escalation training and tripling the city\u2019s network of traffic cameras and license plate readers. Moore and some community activists have raised concerns about the federal corruption investigation that led to indictments of some of Reed\u2019s former aides, which has been exhaustively chronicled by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. In a statement provided to CNN by Reed\u2019s campaign, his attorneys said that during an August 2021 call, two assistant US Attorneys informed the candidate\u2019s lawyers that the federal inquiry was completed and had been closed. The US Attorney\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s request to confirm those details. The controversy drew fresh scrutiny recently when Richard Rose, president of the NAACP\u2019s Atlanta branch, issued a public rebuke of Reed on the group\u2019s letterhead \u2013 stating that voters deserved better. Reed responded by posting a statement on Instagram that said his campaign was \u201cbeing attacked because we sought and received the support of the women and men of the Atlanta Police Department at a time when crime and violence is devastating our city.\u201d The general counsel of the NAACP subsequently sent a cease-and-desist letter to Rose noting that the bylaws for units of the NAACP prohibit officers from endorsing candidates for office. If no candidate receives at least 50% plus one, Atlanta will hold a run-off election on November 30 to decide the winner. Democratic Socialist India Walton defeated four-term Mayor Byron Brown in Buffalo\u2019s Democratic primary in June, notching a stunning victory for the progressive left as she charted a course to become the first socialist mayor of a major American city in more than 60 years. But on Tuesday night, the first-time candidate, who is a nurse and activist, will have to defeat Brown again after he mounted an aggressive write-in campaign to keep his job. The race has attracted national attention as a proxy battle between progressives and moderates over the direction of the party in New York. While some state Democratic leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul \u2013 a Buffalo native \u2013 have stayed neutral, many big-name state Democrats have endorsed Walton, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In his endorsement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted that Walton candidate \u201cwon the Democratic primary fair and square.\u201d Brown has acknowledged that he miscalculated in the primary by largely refusing to engage with Walton or debate her in what was ultimately a low-turnout election. But the mayor, who was first elected in 2005, has attacked what he views as Walton\u2019s radical agenda, warning that it will slow the city\u2019s recovery from the pandemic. He has maintained that he\u2019ll perform better on Tuesday when a broader cross-section of voters, including Republicans, will weigh in. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg, Brown attacked what he views as Walton\u2019s inexperience and said her policies would compromise public safety and \u201ccreate a nightmare for every person in our community.\u201d Brown has attacked her for saying $7.5 million could be cut from the police budget, but Walton said the Partnership for the Public Good determined those savings could come from eliminating police department positions through attrition, by reducing overtime and by \u201cproperly staffing the police department.\u201d She has dismissed Brown\u2019s attacks as misleading and an effort to make people feel afraid of her, arguing in a recent debate that she \u201chasn\u2019t campaigned on defund the police.\u201d She said that funding can be reallocated to free police officers up to spend more time solving crime and conducting investigations while moving professionals into the roles that sworn officers are sometimes asked to fill as homelessness outreach workers and mental health counselors. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is all but certain to become New York City\u2019s next mayor, replacing Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio after vanquishing more progressive rivals in the primary. He\u2019s poised to be the city\u2019s second Black mayor, following the late David Dinkins who lost reelection in 1993. Adams has largely shrugged off attacks from Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a founder of the volunteer neighborhood safety group known as the Guardian Angels and a media personality, who\u2019s tried to cast him as a career politician. They have disagreed over issues like the vaccine mandate for city workers, which Adams mostly supports and Sliwa does not. Adams, a retired captain in the New York Police Department, often returns to the message that helped him win the June primary \u2013 that he is uniquely positioned to address the rise in crime in the city and lure back New Yorkers who left during the pandemic, as well as the tourists who are so critical to the city\u2019s economic success. Adams won that primary by promising to step up policing throughout the city, but he also struck a careful balance: vowing to deal with police misconduct and highlighting his efforts to call out racism within the NYPD, as well as his testimony in the court case that ended the unlawful use of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies. (Adams says the tactic should be used, but under lawful guidelines.) He has argued that the current debate over policing has presented a false choice \u2013 a with-them or against-them mentality that he says undermines the community\u2019s need for police. Adams built his primary victory in part on the strength of his base in the city\u2019s working-class outer boroughs, including places like the predominantly Black neighborhoods of Southeast Queens, rather than the most liberal enclaves of Manhattan and Brooklyn. But he has hustled since the primary to try to unify the city\u2019s voters behind him in the hopes of entering office with a strong mandate. CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Last December, when Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen joined a virtual legislative hearing revisiting the 2020 election, she had done her homework. Nguyen spent the days before examining the lists of voters who the Trump campaign alleged may have committed election fraud in Georgia. She studied the public records, called several voters and, in one case, jumped in her car to visit a constituent who the campaign claimed had voted in both Georgia and Virginia. The voter and her husband have \u201clived in Georgia their entire lives\u201d and \u201chave lived in that same house since 1985,\u201d Nguyen said during a roughly 12-minute Q&A with an analyst whose research had been cited in lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies. \u201cThey\u2019ve never even been to the state in which they are alleged to have double-voted.\u201d Nguyen\u2019s methodical and public takedown of multiple voter fraud claims drew immediate attention and threats, she said. Someone posted her home address on a right-wing website as soon as she stopped speaking, and she was called a traitor and threatened with execution. But \u201cthere was no way I was going to stay silent,\u201d Nguyen told CNN recently. \u201cI was at the center of the storm as there were attempts to overturn the results in Georgia. I recognize that this is the single most pressing issue: the protection of democracy.\u201d Now, the Democratic lawmaker hopes to parlay her work and visibility on voting rights into a new position, as she runs for Georgia secretary of state. If she succeeds in 2022, Nguyen \u2013 the daughter of Vietnamese refugees \u2013 would become the first Asian American elected to a statewide political post in Georgia. Nguyen (pronounced WIN) is among a cluster of politicians who have stepped into high-profile roles in the last year to defend the integrity of the 2020 election against baseless fraud claims advanced by former President Donald Trump and his allies. And this group is making voting rights central to their campaigns for higher office in states that could determine who wins the presidency in 2024. In the perennial battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro entered the race for governor earlier this month with a pledge \u201cto continue to stand up to the attacks on our democracy.\u201d Shapiro\u2019s office has defended the state against a string of 25 legal challenges brought by Trump or his allies over the 2020 election. Biden won the Keystone State by more than 80,000 votes. And in Arizona, Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is running for governor after rising to national prominence with her defense of the state\u2019s election results and repeated denunciations of a partisan ballot review in Maricopa County. Arizona has been Ground Zero for conspiracy theories about election fraud, following Biden\u2019s 10,457-vote win last year in a state that had not backed a Democrat for the presidency in more than two decades. And Hobbs has been on the frontlines as the state\u2019s election chief, issuing scathing critiques of a Republican-led review of ballots in Maricopa County and appearing frequently on national television to defend the state\u2019s election system. Her campaign announcement video opened with news clips about the threats of violence she\u2019s endured because of her stand on the election. In an interview with CNN, Hobbs said state officials need to focus other pressing issues \u2013 such as investing in schools and grappling with water restrictions after the federal government declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River \u2013 rather than relitigating the 2020 election. Hobbs said the suspicion that has fueled conspiracy theories about the election results is bleeding into other parts of life in the state and threatens to hobble policymaking. \u201cThese are the same folks who have questioned the validity of science about Covid and vaccines and masks,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThey are at school board meetings, screaming about curriculum that we\u2019re not teaching in schools.\u201d \u201cYou can have government by conspiracy theory,\u201d Hobbs said, \u201cor you can have government that actually works. They\u2019re not really compatible.\u201d Republican Gov. Doug Ducey is term limited and cannot seek office again in 2022. Trump already has made his choice among the crowded field of Republicans seeking the governor\u2019s seat, backing former news anchor Kari Lake. Lake has called the 2020 election \u201cshady, shoddy\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d and has pushed for its decertification, although there is no mechanism in the state to do so. In addition to the high-profile Maricopa County ballot review, Arizona has enacted three new laws that restrict voting \u2013 one of 19 states to pass voting limits this year, according to the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. Four of those states \u2013 Texas, Georgia, Iowa and Florida \u2013 have bundled together their new restrictions in sweeping omnibus laws. In Pennsylvania, GOP lawmakers who hold the majority in the General Assembly also have pushed their version of wide-ranging legislation to expand voter ID requirements and tighten election deadlines \u2013 only to have it vetoed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf \u2013 something Shapiro highlights as he campaigns to replace the term-limited Wolf. \u201cCome 2023 and \u201924, Pennsylvanians are either going to have a governor that vetoes the attacks on voting rights or someone who signs them and turns our state into Texas or Georgia,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. And he notes that the next governor of Pennsylvania also will have the power to appoint the secretary of state, who has the day-to-day authority over the state\u2019s electoral process. Right now, Shapiro and Republican legislators are battling in court over an effort by a Senate committee to subpoena the Pennsylvania Secretary of State for a raft of voter data \u2013 including names, addresses, driver\u2019s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers \u2013 for the roughly 9 million registered votes in the state. State Sen. Cris Dush, the Republican in charge of the election investigation, has said the personal information is needed to verify voters\u2019 identities, following allegations that some people who voted don\u2019t actually exist. Shapiro argues the subpoenas violate Pennsylvanians\u2019 privacy rights, serve no legitimate legislative purpose and represent little more than an effort to placate Trump, who has baselessly claimed fraud led to his loss in the state. In Georgia \u2013 one of 26 states with elected secretaries of state positions on the ballot next year \u2013 the normally low-key contest for the office already has emerged as one of the hot-ticket, down-ballot races of 2022. Trump has waded into the Republican primary to target the current officeholder, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, for defeat after the election chief rebuffed Trump\u2019s entreaty to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn the former President\u2019s loss in the state. The former President backs Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, one of 147 Republican lawmakers in Congress who objected to certifying Biden\u2019s presidential victory. That is in stark contrast to Nguyen, who is the highest-profile Democrat in the race and has made voting rights a priority during her tenure in the Georgia Assembly. She was elected in a 2017 special election to fill the Atlanta-area seat previously held by Stacey Abrams, the Democrats\u2019 2018 gubernatorial nominee. The nonprofit executive was the first Vietnamese American elected to the legislature in Georgia. For Nguyen, a proud moment came when she helped repeal the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d voter registration law. The law, which had frozen some 53,000 voter registrations ahead of the 2018 election, required the information on voter registration applications to exactly match information on driver\u2019s license, Social Security records and state ID cards. Registrations could be stalled over missing hyphens or misspellings in government records, and a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups at the time said that 80% of the stalled applications belonged to people of color. Nguyen said her name has been misspelled at legislative meetings and on the Georgia Assembly\u2019s website. \u201cPeople with non-Anglo names were going to get caught up in the system,\u201d she said. She was among more than two dozen activists arrested last week outside the White House as they demanded action on federal voting legislation to blunt the impact new voting restrictions in states like Georgia.   Nguyen views herself as part of the New South, a diverse coalition that has helped turn the traditionally red state into a political battleground that sent two Democrats to the US Senate in runoff elections this year. \u201cOur diversity is our strength,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about Black Georgians and Latinos and Asians, young people, white progressives \u2013 people who have chosen to call Georgia our home. We\u2019re going to fight for it.\u201d Nguyen said that while she expected the threats and racial taunts that followed the legislative hearing last December, the experience also reinforced for her that many Americans don\u2019t subscribe to the election falsehoods. \u201cThere were Georgians from all over the state, and people from all over the country who reached out and thanked me and said they needed to hear the truth,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cPeople sent me notes in the mail, flowers, books, muffins. I didn\u2019t expect that part of it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The US is working on contingency plans if Iran continues to make nuclear advances and fails to return to international talks, a senior State Department official said Thursday, adding that as the US and allies wait for Tehran to return to nuclear talks, their patience won\u2019t last forever. \u201cAny government would do this,\u201d the official said, speaking Thursday on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly about making contingency plans if the nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action falls through. \u201cWe obviously have to look at what we will do if we conclude that Iran is either not interested in coming back to the JCPOA, or its nuclear advantage is such that it doesn\u2019t make sense for JCPOA to have been hollowed out.\u201d The official said that the US and other participants in the talks prefer \u201cto come back to the table,\u201d and added that if there is any concern about a Plan B, it\u2019s \u201cthe one that Iran, where they want to continue to build that and not be seriously engaged to return to the JCPOA.\u201d The US official\u2019s comments came two days after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi used his address before the United Nations General Assembly to deliver his own message. He insisted Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons, that the US is at fault for leaving the nuclear deal and emphasized that the US has to meet its obligations under the deal first, by lifting sanctions. Raisi\u2019s defiant stance is one reason European diplomats say they are concerned that Iran may be less flexible about negotiations, thinking it can take advantage of the Biden administration\u2019s diminished standing on the world stage after the foreign policy crises of Afghanistan, a diplomatic spat with France and condemnation of its treatment of Haitian refugees. While the Iranian president reiterated his promise to return to talks and Iran moved to avert a crisis over nuclear inspections this month, analysts point to a slew of indicators that suggest progress isn\u2019t likely soon, including domestic political concerns and the appointment of hardliners who oppose the deal. Meanwhile, the US continues to emphasize its willingness to restart talks \u2013 but also that its patience is in danger of wearing thin. \u201cThe window of opportunity is open and won\u2019t be open forever if Iran takes a different course,\u201d the official said. \u201cAt some point, we may have to conclude that the JCPOA no longer fulfills the non-proliferation benefits that we bargained for,\u201d the official told reporters. If Iran continues to delay a return to talks or takes positions inconsistent with a US-Iran mutual return to the JCPOA, \u201cwe may conclude that Iran simply has a different course of action in mind, and we\u2019ll have to act accordingly.\u201d At UN, Biden distinguished himself from Trump, but sketched agenda that will be hard to carry out The official said that the US and other parties still wanted to go back to the negotiating table but noted that it has been three months since the last round of talks \u201cand since that time, Iran has continued to grow its nuclear program.\u201d Since that time, the US and other countries involved in the nuclear talks also have not been able to get clarity on Iran\u2019s position on the nuclear talks after Raisi\u2019s election in early August, the official said. Iran has not given other parties to the talks a date for when they would be ready to resume negotiations, the official said. The last round of meetings in Vienna took place about three months ago. European diplomats are increasingly concerned that the Iranians may see the Biden administration\u2019s diminished standing on the world stage \u2013 given a number of crises \u2013 as an opportunity to be less flexible at the negotiating table. \u201cThey may try to get more out of the Americans now,\u201d warned one European diplomat. Biden administration officials do not expect that to be the case particularly because Iran has been hard to pin down throughout the entirety of the last few months, a second administration official told CNN. Iran has not given an indication of whether they\u2019re willing to continue the work of the previous administration either, the senior State Department official said, or whether it will want a different framework for the talks. Finally, Raisi\u2019s government has not given other countries any sense of whether it will send the same negotiating team or whether they will appoint a new slate of officials. Henry Rome, the deputy head of research and a director covering global macro politics and the Middle East at the Eurasia Group, said that some Iranian hardliners see the delay as an advantage. \u201cMore time affords Iran greater opportunities to make nuclear advances, and delays make the West sweat\u2014both of which, in the eyes of some Iranian hardliners, give Iran greater leverage for when it returns to talks,\u201d Rome says. The structural incentives for Iran to return to the nuclear deal continue to be overwhelming, Rome says. Being able to export more oil would mean more revenue, regaining access to some of the $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves frozen abroad and engage with the international financial system would be other advantages. But Rome says Iranian hawks argue that the economic benefits of the deal are overstated and that Iran has already survived former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign. These officials believe \u201cthe best way to relieve sanctions pressure is not to negotiate them away but to \u2018nullify\u2019 them altogether using Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s concept of a \u2018resistance economy\u2019,\u201d Rome says. Raisi, speaking Tuesday to the General Assembly, said, \u201cthe United States mistakenly believed it would render us desperate and devastated, but our perseverance has yielded results and will always do.\u201d Despite the impasse, the senior State Department official said there is wide agreement on two points among the other parties to the nuclear talks \u2013 China, Russia, the US, the UK, France, Germany and the European Union. First, that talks in Vienna need to resume as soon as possible and secondly, that they need to resume where they left off. The official said the US and other countries were willing to be patient, but that there are limits and so far, they are seeing \u201ccertainly no indication, positive indication of interest\u201d from Iran yet about continuing talks. The US has not had any official meetings with Iran at the UN General Assembly.",

            "article_content": "When President Joe Biden mounts the iconic green marble rostrum inside the hall of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, he will face an audience skeptical he really is as different from his predecessor as he likes to claim. For world leaders who were alternately addled and amused by former President Donald Trump \u2013 who once encountered mocking laughter from the UN crowd in the middle of his big speech \u2013 Biden represented hope for a different era in American foreign relations. He spent his first foreign trip in June declaring across Europe that \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d He continued that message in his first appearance in New York when he met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. \u201cThe strong partnership between the United States and the U.N. is based on common values and principals, and at this moment, those bonds are more important than ever. America\u2019s back and we believe in the United Nations and its values,\u201d Biden said. Biden set to address world leaders at the UN General Assembly Yet this week he finds himself under intense scrutiny from allies who have been disappointed his election has not done away entirely with the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies Trump espoused during the former President\u2019s annual speeches to the UN. They have complained bitterly about being left out of key decisions. In increasingly public fashion, foreign officials have begun unfavorably comparing Biden to Trump \u2013 an insult to a President who ran as the capable and experienced alternative to Trump\u2019s global tumult. In his first address as President to the General Assembly, Biden will seek to allay those fears, making the case for a collective approach to simmering world problems like the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. He will argue for a wholesale recalibration of priorities away from the wars of the past two decades and toward threats emerging today. The President is expected to make the case for \u201crallying allies and partners and institutions to deal with the major challenges of our time,\u201d a senior administration official said. Like in almost every aspect of his foreign policy, China will loom large, and Biden will warn in his speech against the world devolving into a new Cold War that divides the globe into spheres of influence. Still, the growing wariness of once-enthusiastic allies isn\u2019t lost on the President or his aides. \u201cI think the President\u2019s view, having been on the world scene for 50 years, is that you always have to work on your relationships. That includes with global leaders,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said. \u201cHe believes our relationships are sustaining over the course of many decades, and every step he has taken since the moment he took office was with the intention of rebuilding alliances and rebuilding those partnerships that were frayed over the last four years.\u201d Psaki said that didn\u2019t mean countries would always agree with each other, but argued over the long run, global relationships would be made stronger by Biden\u2019s approach. The key question Joe Biden must answer in his debut UN General Assembly speech The annual appearance at the UN is one of the highest-profile opportunities for any president to spell out his foreign agenda, though this year\u2019s gathering has been scaled down due to the pandemic. Biden will not engage in the usual flurry of pull-aside sessions in the corridors of UN headquarters on Manhattan\u2019s East Side and he will return to the White House by Tuesday afternoon. Officials view Biden\u2019s speech and the other events surrounding it \u2013 including a Covid summit on Wednesday and a meeting of Pacific leaders on Friday \u2013 as a critical moment for the President to articulate his foreign policy vision and lay out what he believes should be the world\u2019s priorities. He arrived in New York reeling from setbacks in his quest to restore American leadership. France is fuming over a deal to equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, which deprived Paris of a lucrative contract for conventional subs and, in the telling of French officials, came as a total surprise to America\u2019s oldest ally. Biden has asked to speak soon with French President Emmanuel Macron to lower the temperature. Uncertainty surrounding Biden\u2019s domestic agenda will have ramifications for his designs on harassing the global initiative to combat climate change. Democrats remain divided on the massive spending bill that amounts to the bulk of Biden\u2019s plan to cut carbon emissions. And his decision to end the war in Afghanistan, which resulted in a messy evacuation, created waves of refugees in Europe and the United States and left some allies frustrated at how the exit was planned. Biden\u2019s vows of continued effective counterterrorism efforts were undercut by the revelation last week an American drone strike in the war\u2019s final days killed 10 civilians instead of ISIS-K targets. Still, Biden will not shy away from his decision to end America\u2019s longest war during his speech, according to senior administration officials. Instead, he will place the war\u2019s end at the center of his message, arguing it was a necessary decision to propel the world into a new, more cooperative era of confronting the challenges of today. \u201cThe President will essentially drive home the message that ending the war in Afghanistan closed the chapter focused on war and opened a chapter focused on purposeful, effective, intensive American diplomacy,\u201d a senior administration official said in previewing the speech. Downplaying rifts that are emerging with foreign allies, the White House said Biden\u2019s multiple summits this week \u2013 on Covid-19, climate change and partnership in the Indo-Pacific \u2013 were evidence of a multilateral approach that contrasts directly with the approach of the previous administration. And the announcement Monday that the United States would ease travel restrictions on all fully vaccinated foreign visitors, replacing a patchwork of bans that had begun to cause fury in Europe, was cheered in foreign capitals. The travel ban had been expected to be a major point of contention in a meeting later Tuesday afternoon with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will make his first visit to Biden\u2019s White House. Biden also plans to convene a virtual Covid-19 summit on Wednesday, calling on leaders of developed nations to step up vaccine sharing commitments and boost the global supply of oxygen. And he\u2019ll end the week hosting his first in-person summit of the QUAD nations \u2013 Japan, Australia and India \u2013 to discuss the pandemic and security in Asia. That summit underscores Biden\u2019s broader goal of shifting focus away from places like Afghanistan and toward the threat from China, whose military and economic moves have caused a deterioration in ties with the West. Biden\u2019s decision to partner with the United Kingdom and Australia on the nuclear-powered submarines was a sign of his willingness to look beyond traditional alliances \u2013 like with France \u2013 to better address security challenges in Asia. That approach hasn\u2019t been welcomed in Paris, where officials accused the Biden administration of operating in secret to deprive France of important defense contracts. France\u2019s outsized reaction has been surprising to some in the White House, and one official said France\u2019s behavior, including recalling their ambassador for consultations, was an overly dramatic response to the rift. For now, there is a general belief that the dust-up will not permanently damage relations with France, but officials acknowledge the spat remains in its early days. Biden has asked to get Macron on the phone to \u201cdirectly\u201d address the matter, an official said. \u201cWe understand the French position,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe don\u2019t share their view in terms of how this all developed.\u201d The submarine spat underscores larger differences between Biden\u2019s approach to China and the views of certain European leaders, who have sought a more conciliatory approach to a major trading partner. Those rifts were on display at this summer\u2019s G7 summit, though eventually the grouping emerged with a collective statement admonishing China for its human rights abuses. In his speech on Tuesday, Biden will seek to underscore the US isn\u2019t seeking conflict with China or its leader Xi Jinping, with whom he spoke by phone earlier this month. \u201cPresident Biden will communicate tomorrow that he does not believe in the notion of a new cold war with the world divided into blocks. He believes in vigorous, intensive, principled competition that does not tip over into conflict,\u201d the official said.",

            "article_content": "The man who was president during the attacks of September 11, 2001, used a speech commemorating the 20th anniversary of that terrible day to call out the \u201cmalign force\u201d coursing through the country thanks to the presidency (and post-presidency) of Donald Trump and offered an alternative vision for his party and the country. George W. Bush gave the speech at the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, site where Flight 93 was brought down \u2013 thanks to the heroics of the passengers who revolted against their hijackers.  Here\u2019s the key bit (bolding is mine): \u201cIn the weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks, I was proud to lead an amazing, resilient, united people. When it comes to the unity of America, those days seem distant from our own. A malign force seems at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment. That leaves us worried about our nation and our future together.\u201d Bush didn\u2019t say Trump\u2019s name there. He didn\u2019t have to. If you have been alive and living on Planet Earth for the last 5 or so years, you know exactly who Bush is talking about with those words. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Since emerging as a candidate in the summer of 2015, Trump has spent his time and energy desperately trying to weaponize that which divides us. And he has done so for a simple and selfish reason: Pure political self-interest. Trump understood from the jump that there was (and is) power in stoking resentments and anger. He aimed his message of victimhood directly at a White Americans barely clinging on to their dreams of being the middle class and said a) I understand you b) it\u2019s not your fault and c) it\u2019s the \u201celites\u201d fault. (Sidebar: The greatest trick Trump ever played on the American electorate was that he, a child of privilege who spent his entire adult life in New York City and who made his reputation on high-end luxury, was somehow the voice of the shrinking of the White working man.) Trump, proving he never learns anything, released a statement bashing Bush on Monday. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be lecturing us about anything,\u201d Trump said in a statement released via his Save America PAC. \u201cThe World Trade Center came down during his watch.\u201d Trump\u2019s entire 2016 (and 2020) campaign was built on the notion that elites were out to screw the average (White) guy.  Here\u2019s one particularly telling riff on that front from 2018: \u201cI hate it. I meet these people \u2013 they call them \u2018the elite.\u2019 These people. I look at them, I say, \u2018That\u2019s elite?\u2019 We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we\u2019re smarter than they are, and they say they\u2019re elite? We\u2019re the elite. You\u2019re the elite. We\u2019re the elite.\u201d What lies down the road of, to borrow Bush\u2019s phrase, \u201canger, fear and resentment\u201d? Unfortunately we already know the answer to that question. January 6 is what happens. An armed insurrection of Trump supporters fed lies about the 2020 election and convinced that they needed to, uh, take their country back. What Bush is trying to do is offer a different path for his party. A path in which what we have in common with each other take precedence over what differentiates us.  Again, Bush (this is long but important): \u201cOn America\u2019s day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor\u2019s hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know. \u201cAt a time when religious bigotry might have flowed freely, I saw Americans reject prejudice and embrace people of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know. Trump is showing just how divisive a new White House run would be \u201cAt a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and violence against people perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaffirm their welcome to immigrants and refugees. That is the nation I know. \u201cAt a time when some viewed the rising generation as individualistic and decadent, I saw young people embrace an ethic of service and rise to selfless action. That is the nation I know. \u201cThis is not mere nostalgia; it is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we have been \u2013 and what we can be again.\u201d (By the way, am I the only one who heard echoes in that speech of James Earl Jones\u2019 famous \u201cpeople will come\u201d speech in \u201cField of Dreams\u201d? Especially this line from Jones: \u201cThis field, this game \u2013 it\u2019s a part of our past, Ray. It reminds us of all that once was good, and it could be again.\u201d) Bush\u2019s argument goes like this: In our worst moment, when hate and division could have overwhelmed all of us, the opposite happened: We came together. Which means that at this moment of polarization, division and, yes, hatred, that could happen again. Bush\u2019s speech then is rightly understood as not only a denunciation of Trumpism but also an appeal to our better angels. Whether that appeal will fall on deaf ears remains to be seen.",

            "article_content": "Former President George W. Bush called on Americans Saturday to confront domestic violent extremists, comparing them to violent extremists abroad and warning that they are \u201cchildren of the same foul spirit.\u201d In a speech marking the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Bush said the US has seen \u201cgrowing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within.\u201d \u201cThere is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit.\u201d \u201cAnd it is our continuing duty to confront them,\u201d he added. Bush\u2019s speech at the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, came eight months after violent insurrectionists breached the US Capitol on January 6 in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election for President Joe Biden. Read former President George W. Bush's speech at the Flight 93 memorial service The former Republican President has been outspoken about condemning the violent mob of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day. \u201cThis is how election results are disputed in a banana republic \u2013 not our democratic republic,\u201d he said in a statement at the time, adding that he was \u201cappalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election.\u201d Law enforcement officials are bracing for potential clashes and unrest during a right-wing rally in Washington, DC, scheduled for September 18, which is meant to support insurrectionists charged in the Capitol riots, according to an internal Capitol Police memo reviewed by CNN. Bush on Saturday lamented the division in the United States, contrasting the current political climate to the spirit of unity that he said he observed in the wake of the September 11 attacks. \u201cA malign force seems at work in our common life that turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear, and resentment,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThat leaves us worried about our nation and our future together.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t have \u201cexplanations or solutions,\u201d but went on to recount what he said was the America he saw in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks. \u201cAt a time when religious bigotry might have flowed freely, I saw Americans reject prejudice and embrace people of Muslim faith. That is the nation I know,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAt a time when nativism could have stirred hatred and violence against people perceived as outsiders, I saw Americans reaffirm their welcome to immigrants and refugees. That is the nation I know,\u201d Bush added. His comments come as some in his own party have raised concerns about Afghan refugees being resettled in the United States after the US withdrew from Afghanistan last month. Biden later Saturday offered praise for the former president\u2019s remarks, telling reporters during a visit to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Department that he thought Bush \u201cmade a really good speech today, a genuinely good speech, about who we are.\u201d In addition to Biden and Bush, former President Barack Obama participated in memorial events Saturday, bringing together all the US leaders of the post-9/11 era except former President Donald Trump, who visited the New York City Police Department\u2019s 17th precinct in Manhattan\u2019s Midtown East neighborhood later Saturday. Trump, who is providing commentary on a boxing match Saturday, commemorated the 20th anniversary in a short video in which he praised first responders, and also lambasted Biden for the handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u201cMany things were displayed that day, including most importantly the bravery of our police, fire and first responders of every kind. The job they did was truly unbelievable,\u201d Trump said of September 11 in the video. \u201cIt is also a sad time for the way our war on those that did such harm to our country ended last week.\u201d It was the Trump administration that signed the February 2020 agreement with the Taliban for the US to remove troops in Afghanistan. CNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration has told 11 officials appointed to military service academy advisory boards by former President Donald Trump to resign or be dismissed, a source familiar with the situation tells CNN\u2019s KFile. The officials asked to resign include prominent former Trump officials like former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, former senior counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster. They were appointed to the advisory boards of the Naval Academy, Air Force Academy and West Point respectively. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday afternoon confirmed the request had been made. \u201cThe President\u2019s objective is what any president\u2019s objective is \u2013 to ensure you have nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with your values. And so yes, that was an ask that was made,\u201d Psaki told reporters at a White House briefing. Psaki added: \u201cI will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards, but the President\u2019s qualification requirements are not your party registration, they are whether you\u2019re qualified to serve and whether you\u2019re aligned with the values of this administration.\u201d Other more prominent names include \u200b\u200bHeidi Stirrup, the former White House liaison to the Justice Department who was banned from entering the building after she attempted to access sensitive information about possible election fraud in December 2020, and retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, a former ambassador pick and Pentagon official with a history of controversial comments. The duo were appointed to the boards of the Air Force Academy and West Point. Other appointees who have been asked to resign are Michael Wynne, who was appointed to the board of the Air Force Academy; retired Gen. John Keane, Meaghan Mobbs, and David Urban appointed to the board of West Point; and John Coale and Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, appointed to the Naval Academy\u2019s board. The dismissal of Trump officials from the military advisory boards comes after the Pentagon has recently restarted its other advisory boards after removing hundreds of appointees from other boards in February. In November, just months ahead of when he was set to leave office, Trump dismissed several longstanding members of the Defense Policy Board ahead of their terms being up. The military academy advisory boards, according to the Air Force Academy website, were established to oversee the \u201cmorale, discipline, social climate, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and other matters\u201d relating to the nation\u2019s military academies. The board for each academy meets several times a year and its members provide independent advice and recommendations to the President. The members typically serve out three-year terms. At least one Trump appointee, Vought, has signaled he will not resign. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a three year term,\u201d Vought tweeted, attaching an image of the letter requesting his resignation. Spicer said Wednesday on his Newsmax show, \u201cSpicer & Co.\u201d: \u201cAll Trump appointees, including myself, have been kicked off the boards of the United States Naval Academy, Air Force Academy and West Point in an unprecedented move by the Biden administration. I\u2019m announcing tonight for the first time that I will not be submitting my resignation and I will be joining a lawsuit to fight this.\u201d He later added: \u201cRemember back during the inauguration when President Biden said. \u2018I\u2019m going to be the President for all people, Trump voters and everyone else?\u2019 Yeah, where\u2019d that go?\u201d Wynne told CNN \u201cit was an honor to be on the board,\u201d and said he was disappointed he wasn\u2019t asked to remain on the board. \u201cVery disappointed to see the Biden administration not honor a previous president\u2019s appointment to the board of visitors, which has been the tradition for years,\u201d Keane told CNN. In a statement, Mobbs said she would not be resigning. \u201cFrankly, I find this whole act unconscionable and not all in the spirit by which this Administration promised to govern. President Biden ran on a supposed platform of unity but his actions speak directly to the contrary.  Apparently, unity is only for those who conform,\u201d Mobbs said. \u201cWhen I joined the Board under the Trump Administration, there were holdovers from the Obama Administration. They were not terminated but instead served alongside Trump appointees. This mix of perspective, experience, and belief systems ensured there was diversity - a value the Democratic party purports to hold above all else.\u201d In response to CNN, Urban said Mobbs\u2019 statement reflected his views. Conway posted a statement on Twitter addressed to Biden, calling the news \u201cpetty and political\u201d and saying she would not resign. \u201cYour decision is disappointing but understandable given the need to distract from a news cycle that has you mired in multiple self-inflicted crises and plummeting poll numbers,\u201d Conway wrote. CNN has also reached out to Macgregor, Stirrup, Coale and McMaster for comment. CNN\u2019s KFile has previously reported that Macgregor, who served in the Trump administration as a senior Pentagon adviser and was nominated to the West Point board late last year, disparaged immigrants, refugees and minorities and spread conspiracy theories that the Biden administration was replacing White people of European ancestry.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden tried twice last month to get to his beach house on the Delaware coast. He never made it. Far from relaxing, the 31 days of August were the longest and most wrenching of Biden\u2019s presidency. A month his aides once viewed as a launching pad for an ambitious autumn was instead consumed by mayhem in Afghanistan, a worsening pandemic and, as it concluded, a massive hurricane plowing into the Gulf Coast. A domestic agenda the President once hoped to spend August discussing still inched forward. But Biden\u2019s handling of chaotic and unplanned-for events dominated his time and the nation\u2019s attention. After a frantic two-and-a-half week airlift, the last US troops left Afghanistan on Monday, fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to end America\u2019s longest war. Yet the process of getting there, including the administration\u2019s admission it had been caught off-guard by the speed with which the Taliban overtook the country, undercut Biden\u2019s vow to restore competence to government. A simultaneous surge in Covid-19 cases, fueled by continued vaccine hesitancy and the highly contagious Delta variant, has nudged the country back toward mask mandates and limits on gatherings \u2013 a distant cry from the \u201cfreedom from the virus\u201d Biden sought to project on July Fourth. Will political fallout of Afghan define Biden Presidency? It\u2019s far too soon to know whether the last four weeks will be the most consequential of Biden\u2019s presidency. They will eventually amount to only a little more than 2% of his entire first term. Yet the lingering challenges facing the White House in September, October and beyond already loom large, with the administration trying to keep its domestic agenda on track even as it grapples with the fallout from Afghanistan. The forceful tone of Biden\u2019s national address Tuesday was intentional, officials said, as was the lengthy nature of the speech. The President\u2019s remarks served as an effort to punctuate the end of two decades of war and they underscore a decision Biden never wavered from. But it was also a clear, if implicit, signal that the White House would publicly move its focus to the domestic challenges at hand in the days ahead, according to multiple administration officials. The speech was, as described by one official, \u201ca clear reminder to the public of the bigger picture\u201d \u2013 one Biden intensely believes carries a wide swath of support inside the country. Still, officials acknowledge there are still significant challenges ahead. Congressional inquiries into how the administration was caught flat-footed for the fall of Kabul are set to begin soon, and even some Democrats are poised to press top officials for answers in public hearings. And the administration\u2019s own \u201chot wash\u201d review of what happened is designed for immediate answers on whether signals were missed in the lead-up to the Taliban\u2019s takeover. Tests also still await Biden in extracting the 100 to 200 Americans who remain in Afghanistan, not to mention the thousands of Afghan allies who assisted the US\u2019 war effort but were unable to leave during the frantic airlift. Of the Americans who remain in the country, sources say they represent the most complex cases US officials were seeking to manage in the final days. Most were dual citizens, often long-time residents of Afghanistan, who wavered on whether to leave until the final moments out of concern for leaving extended family. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work ahead, no question about it,\u201d one US official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten positive signals, but things are just very fluid at this stage.\u201d The punishing days of August, above all, underscored the brutal reality of how all presidents are ultimately judged by events thrust upon them, rather than the scripted moments on meticulously planned political calendars. At the center of it all are fresh questions about how the administration\u2019s overall competence will ultimately be viewed by the American public. \u201cThere is less room for error on future crises,\u201d one top ally, who speaks frequently to Biden, told CNN. \u201cThe best way to show competence is to execute and manage all of this with confidence and demonstrate results.\u201d Now, publicly at least, the expectation is for a clear shift in focus in the days ahead. Shortly after Biden\u2019s remarks, the White House released his schedule for\u00a0Wednesday. For the first time in more than a week, there would be no Situation Room meeting with his national security team set for the morning. In meetings in July, Biden\u2019s senior advisers plotted the best ways to harness their momentum heading into the fall. Chief of staff Ron Klain impressed upon the West Wing team the critical importance of the weeks leading up to Labor Day, as two of Biden\u2019s chief priorities \u2013 a bipartisan infrastructure plan and a more ambitious social policy bill \u2013 made their way through Congress. Officials said in mid-July that Biden himself planned to tighten his focus on popular elements of a sweeping legislative agenda that were hanging in the balance, hoping to sway Americans in red-leaning areas. He had made clear his desire to avoid what he saw as a mistake during his tenure as vice president, when, Biden said, then-President Barack Obama didn\u2019t take his advice to hit the road and explain their administration\u2019s agenda to the American people. The White House started August with a triumphant head of steam, eager to take an early victory lap on Senate passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. A bus tour featuring a marquee roster of top Democrats was set to travel the country, drawing attention to the party\u2019s agenda. A \u201cwar room\u201d was stood up by White House aides, meant to coordinate messaging on the President\u2019s economic agenda. The Senate did approve the infrastructure package \u2013 four days before the Taliban arrived in Kabul. The administration\u2019s efforts to tout the package out in the country ultimately received little attention, despite early assertions from officials that the economic proposals would remain the priority of the West Wing. Now top Cabinet officials and the President\u2019s senior advisers are working to keep the agenda from being set back by criticism of how the Afghanistan withdrawal was executed. Biden himself has sought to help in those efforts. When he emerged after meeting with other Group of 7 leaders to discuss Afghanistan last week, he spent more than five minutes at the start of his remarks discussing his legislative agenda before getting to his decision to stick with an August 31 deadline to withdraw troops. Perhaps the most lasting impact from the month of August is how it heaped significant new challenges on the administration\u2019s plate, from a humanitarian crisis among Afghan refugees to a still-developing crisis along the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Ida and the stubborn fight with Covid-19 and the dangerous Delta variant. Plans are being made for the President to travel to Louisiana \u2013 a trip that could take place in the early days of September, aides say, depending on conditions on the ground \u2013 in the first of many ways the administration can showcase its ability to manage a crisis. The President also plans to play a prominent role in commemorating the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, though officials concede the milestone is now fraught with fresh grief and new questions about how America\u2019s longest war ended. And Biden is expected to visit California for the first time in the coming week to campaign for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election. The crisis in Afghanistan already scrambled the White House\u2019s efforts to assist Newsom ahead of the September 14 recall vote when Vice President Kamala Harris was forced to scrap a planned campaign stop after 13 US service members were killed in a terror attack last week, along with at least 170 others. The broader political consequences of Biden\u2019s actions throughout the days of August remain an open question. Some House and Senate Democrats watched the President\u2019s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan with growing alarm, distancing themselves from the White House as some Americans were left behind. Even some of Biden\u2019s legislative allies are faulting the administration\u2019s handling of the situation and saying they need answers about the deadly end to the US\u2019 longest war. \u201cLeaving any American citizen behind is unacceptable, and I will keep pushing this administration to do everything in its power to get our people out,\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat who \u2013 like Kelly \u2013 faces a difficult reelection, told WMUR last week that there have been \u201creal miscalculations\u201d by Biden\u2019s foreign policy team, saying there shouldn\u2019t be \u201cartificial timelines\u201d set for the withdrawal. The President has been eager to take credit for the airlift of more than 120,000 people from Afghanistan, even as he faces sharp criticism for how the administration was so blindsided by the rapid fall of the democratic Afghan government. On Tuesday, delivering a vehement defense of his decision to withdraw from the country, Biden appeared eager to assume the mantle of the president who was finally able to end the war, an achievement his two predecessors promised but couldn\u2019t deliver. \u201cI refuse to send another generation of America\u2019s sons and daughters to fight a war that should have ended long ago,\u201d Biden said. Ultimately, the President and his advisers believe Americans\u2019 disapproval of the chaos that surrounded the end of the war will eventually fade into acceptance that it was time to leave Afghanistan. Americans continue to support the US withdrawal while expressing serious concerns about the way it was handled, recent polls have found. A Pew Research Study conducted August 23-29 found 54% of US adults said withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan was the right decision, and 69% said the US mostly failed in achieving its goals in Afghanistan. Just 26% said the Biden administration did a good or excellent job handling the situation there. White House officials still believe the President will ultimately be judged by the handling of the economy and the pandemic. Advisers to Biden are eager to steer the conversation back to both of those topics, which underscores just how uncertain the political perils of Afghanistan are for the commander in chief. \u201cAddressing crises is what government is supposed to do. It\u2019s what any president is supposed to do, what any vice president is supposed to do and what the senior members of a president\u2019s team are supposed to do,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. \u201cWhen you have moments like this where you are facing, as you said, multiple crises \u2013 I would add, of course, that we\u2019re continuing to fight a pandemic that continues to take the lives of thousands of people every week \u2013 you have to rely on strong and capable team members, you have to be nimble enough to adapt quickly.\u201d \u201cI think we would argue this is actually government working to do our best to function as best as we can,\u201d Psaki added. \u201cIs it tough? Yes. Are the days long? Yes. Is it always going to be perfect? No. But this is exactly what government is supposed to be doing.\u201d Augusts are historically perilous terrain for presidents, particularly in their first years in office as a post-inauguration honeymoon period fades.   It was in August 2009 when angry conservatives formed the tea party movement in opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed health care law, forcing his White House to rethink its approach to getting the Affordable Care Act passed. At the same time, Obama was weighing a surge of troops to Afghanistan, despite having promised voters a year before that he would end the war. Eight years later, in August 2017, President Donald Trump engaged in a standoff with North Korea from his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, from which he promised to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on Kim Jong Un. At the end of the month, he ignited outrage by claiming there had been good people \u201con both sides\u201d of deadly White nationalist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia. The month also comes as the yearly hurricane season is reaching its peak, when storms pounding the East or Gulf coasts can quickly turn into tests of presidential leadership \u2013 as Hurricane Katrina did in August 2005. And the month\u2019s congressional recess can often prompt a shift in the political winds as lawmakers face constituents back home. Biden and his team remained mindful of the historic pitfalls, according to one official, who said the message to staff at the start of the month was to allow for flexibility when planning summer vacations. That wound up being prescient advice not only for senior aides, some of whom were forced to scrap family getaways, but also for Biden himself. After going back-and-forth between the White House and Camp David as Kabul fell into Taliban hands, Biden canceled his remaining plans to visit his Delaware homes in Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington. Instead, he remained in Washington for two weekends straight \u2013 the longest stretch he\u2019s remained at the executive mansion since taking office.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans see the fallout over the US exit from Afghanistan as their new Benghazi \u2013 a foreign policy blunder ripe for investigation that could provide just the political ammunition they need to dent a popular Democratic President. Amid scenes of a chaotic and rushed evacuation from Afghanistan, multiple House Republicans are vowing to launch congressional investigations into the Biden administration\u2019s botched withdrawal if they win back the chamber next year, with some specifically calling for an \u201cAfghanistan Select Committee.\u201d \u201cThis makes Benghazi look like a much smaller issue,\u201d Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a member of GOP leadership who sits on the Armed Services Committee, told CNN. \u201cThis may be one of the worst and most consequential foreign policy and national security disasters in our history. There will be a lot of answers to seek and questions to be answered, and I think it will be a top priority.\u201d Many of Biden\u2019s harshest GOP critics had scant criticism for former President Donald Trump\u2019s deal with the Taliban, which would have seen an even more rapid timeline for withdrawal. Nevertheless, some have started reviving attacks on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental capacity and questioning his fitness to serve as the commander in chief, with some even calling for Biden to be impeached or to resign over the Afghanistan debacle. \u201cAfter the disastrous events in Afghanistan, we must confront a serious question: Is Joe Biden capable of discharging the duties of his office or has time come to exercise the provisions of the 25th Amendment?\u201d tweeted Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the campaign arm for the Senate GOP. While Republicans had so far struggled to dent Biden\u2019s popularity, privately many of them see the last week as a turning point and one that has the ability to rally and animate their base \u2013 not unlike when they used a congressional probe into the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to hammer 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack. \u201cI think this is way worse than Benghazi. Without a doubt,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican facing reelection next year, told CNN. The Biden administration has defended its decision to pull out of Afghanistan and pointed out that Trump would have done it even more quickly. And the White House is calculating that ultimately the majority of the public is on its side when it comes to bringing the troops home and ending the war. But given how it was executed, the GOP is betting otherwise \u2013 and thinks Biden\u2019s approval ratings, and support for the withdrawal, will ultimately dip. GOP lawmakers, however, insist it\u2019s not about politics. They say it\u2019s about getting to the bottom of Biden\u2019s decision making, which they warn could have long-lasting reverberations for the homeland and all around the world. \u201cWe need to get to the bottom of what happened and how it happened,\u201d said Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Green Beret who sits on the Armed Services Committee. In the Senate, there is a slightly different tone coming from some key Republicans, with flickers of bipartisanship so far. Calls for action are coming from both sides of the aisle, with a group of more than 50 lawmakers sending a letter to the Biden administration Thursday urging expedited processing of Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans even as some on the far right have begun waging nativist attacks against refugees and questioning the merits of extracting vulnerable Afghans from the country. Republicans in the Senate have vowed rigorous oversight and haven\u2019t been afraid to criticize Biden\u2019s administration for the fallout in Afghanistan, but GOP lawmakers have also been focused and resolute on the issue at hand. Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa and combat veteran, told CNN in an interview Thursday night that while she has serious concerns about whether there were intelligence or information sharing failures that contributed to the rapid fall of Kabul, there would be plenty of time to figure out \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d in the near future. \u201cWhat we need to focus on right now is the SIV effort and how we get Americans safely out of the country,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cI have members of the military and former members of the military texting me directly asking for assistance with their interpreters. We need to have a process.\u201d Behind the scenes, aides and members tell CNN that the frustration and heartbreak at what is playing out in Afghanistan have been bipartisan, fostering an environment that \u2013 while it may be short-lived \u2013 is at least bringing members together to craft the best strategy to get answers from an administration that has been less than forthcoming at times about its exit plans. \u201cI do think there is a bipartisan desire to make sure that human rights are being respected in Afghanistan. Now, of course, I cannot imagine my Democratic colleagues will be overly critical about the administration, but I can tell you they are very upset by what they see,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cI do think there is potentially a shelf life here, especially as we roll into an election.\u201d One Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, agreed that investigations into the intelligence and security failures would likely need to come later. \u201cWe need to put the fire out before we ask the firefighters why it took them so long to respond,\u201d Meijer told CNN in an interview Thursday. \u201cThey should brief us. That I am unequivocally in support of, but the time to start up the commission is after we have gotten our American citizens out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d In the House, though, tensions between the two parties reached an all-time high in the wake of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, and that could trickle into the debate over Afghanistan. After Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s picks for a select committee to investigate the deadly riot, the California Republican yanked all his selections from the panel and accused Democrats of trying to use the probe to damage Trump\u2019s political prospects. Now, if the GOP seizes back power in 2022, it looks like House Republicans might create a select committee of their own: Multiple Republican lawmakers and aides said it\u2019s almost certain that the GOP will launch probes into Biden\u2019s Afghanistan withdrawal. And with control of the House comes subpoena power, meaning Republicans could force Biden officials to testify in hearings and to hand over documents \u2013 all in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIs it too soon for us to start discussing an Afghanistan Select Committee to investigate exactly what happened and when?\u201d tweeted Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican who represents a swing district in New York. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear from the Americans that were on the ground about their experiences and get the questions answered about how this went so wrong, so fast.\u201d Republicans \u2013 who have only been able to fire off letters to the White House \u2013 want to know whether intelligence failures or poor policy decisions led to the botched withdrawal, how the administration plans to ensure Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorism, whether the White House ignored warnings about how dire the situation was on the ground and what happened to the United States\u2019 military aircraft and weapons left in the Taliban\u2019s possession, among other things. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2013 who was one of the GOP members on the House\u2019s Benghazi select committee as a representative from Kansas \u2013 addressed the House Republican conference on Thursday morning. Pompeo, a potential 2024 contender, explained how the Trump administration would have approached the withdrawal from Afghanistan, arguing that its evacuation would not have seen the same chaos that is unfolding on Biden\u2019s watch and would have made getting Americans out of the country a top priority, according to sources on the call. While Republicans did not raise the idea of an Afghanistan select committee during the call, several have publicly floated the idea \u2013 including Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, who chairs the largest conservative caucus in the House. \u201cMore than a few are wondering about his competency. Republicans will be looking to investigate every aspect of how this withdrawal was botched and who is ultimately responsible,\u201d said Banks, who serves on the Armed Services Committee. Some Republicans on the far right have gone even further and called for Biden\u2019s impeachment \u2013 which the GOP would have the power to do if it controlled the House, though top Republicans have stopped short of endorsing the idea. \u201cWhat did Joe Biden know and when did he know it?\u201d tweeted controversial Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. \u201c#ImpeachBiden.\u201d Even Republicans who haven\u2019t gone that far think Biden has dinged his political capital. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make it very, very difficult for any domestic or certainly foreign policy agenda that he may have to be successful. And of course, from our perspective, I think that\u2019s a good thing for America,\u201d said Johnson, the Louisiana Republican. \u201cBut certainly I think it has been a significant moment in his presidency, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll recover from it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN will hold a town hall with President Joe Biden at 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday in Cincinnati, Ohio, that will air live on CNN, CNN International and CNN Espa\u00f1ol, stream on CNN.com and CNNgo and be available on demand to subscribers via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps. President Joe Biden said Tuesday the nation\u2019s vaccine push feels like a \u201cconstant uphill climb.\u201d He could have said the same of his entire crisis-tossed presidency as it grinds past the six-month mark. After taking office at a moment of darkness, with more than 3,000 Americans dying of Covid-19 every day and the country reeling from his predecessor\u2019s assault on democracy, Biden faced the toughest initiation of any modern president. It\u2019s not going to get any easier. A reinvigorated pandemic, a politically fractured nation and uncertainty over the fate of his agenda at home and abroad has left senior officials well aware that the Biden administration faces defining days ahead and a racing political clock, CNN reported on Tuesday. As crises have cascaded one-after-the-other, it has often felt like Biden faces a tipping point every week or month \u2013 only for the storms battering his White House to intensify. With one-eighth of his term gone, Biden laid claim at a Cabinet meeting to vital progress against the virus, toward reviving the economy and restoring US global leadership, and said the majority of Americans were behind him. He has some cause for such an argument as his approval ratings have stayed steady at around 50% \u2013 higher than former President Donald Trump ever managed \u2013 and are even better on his handling of the health emergency his predecessor often denied. \u201cI just think that we\u2019re showing there is nothing that America is unable to do when we do it together,\u201d Biden said, in a typically optimistic tone that nevertheless represented a misleading analysis of a divided nation\u2019s politics. Biden, who will headline a CNN town hall on Wednesday, passed a bold Covid-19 rescue bill worth nearly $2 trillion, and has made important strides against child poverty and reshaping the economy to benefit poorer citizens. His vaccine rollout has 160 million people fully protected. Millions of people have emerged from isolation, taken to the skies and the highways and experienced joyful family reunions. And although vaccine hesitancy \u2013 mostly in Republican-run states \u2013 and the raging Delta variant of Covid-19 have given the virus yet another opening, the country is unquestionably far better off than when he took office. The President has also reestablished democracy as the centerpiece of the presidency at home and in US foreign policy. And he ended the tsunami of self-regard, corruption and demagoguery that poured out of the Oval Office every day and kept the nation on edge for four grueling years under Trump. That these last two achievements are even worth noting is a commentary on the corruption and extremism of the 45th President\u2019s administration and continuing efforts to tear the fundamental political bedrock of the country apart. But the fact that Biden apparently felt the need to set the narrative of his first six months on Tuesday, in a way that came across as a little defensive, speaks to the extraordinary obstacles that lie in his path this summer and beyond. He may be about to hit a brick wall in Congress that could put to the sword predictions of liberal commentators that he was the next Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson. The bipartisan infrastructure plan that is a pillar of his presidency\u2019s core message \u2013 that Americans need to unite \u2013 is at this moment in deep peril. Biden\u2019s chances of passing a $3 trillion companion \u201chuman infrastructure\u201d bill is hostage to a 50-50 Senate and centrist Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Republicans across the nation are meanwhile enshrining new state laws that make it harder for Democrats to win future elections and easier for GOP office holders to manipulate the results. Abroad, intransigence \u2013 not to mention cyberspace hacking \u2013 from Russia and China shows that it\u2019s one thing to declare \u201cAmerica is back\u201d but another to change the world. And the prospect of Afghanistan falling to the Taliban after Biden ordered a full US pullout could blot his foreign policy record \u2013 though millions of Americans agree with the need to end the country\u2019s longest war. There are credible cases for Republicans to make on foreign policy \u2013 on the threat from inflation, on Biden\u2019s failure to stem migrant flows at the border and the stop/start nature of jobs growth as the Covid economy reopens. Already those arguments are fueling a nascent midterm election campaign that history \u2013 and redistricting of congressional seats \u2013 suggests should favor the GOP. In many ways, Biden\u2019s first six months in office are a lesson in the limitations of the modern presidency. His clear victory in last year\u2019s election doesn\u2019t give him the power to alter the suffocating 50-50 dynamic in the Senate and a slim Democratic majority in the House. He can\u2019t just change the epidemiological reality of a pernicious and adaptable virus, or magically reverse months of politicization of the pandemic by Republicans that is helping to feed vaccine skepticism. Biden also has little capacity to drown out the anti-democratic rantings of Trump, or the continuing propaganda of conservative media that has falsely convinced millions of voters that the last election was stolen. And political factors make it impossible for him to reverse a national gun culture that has seen the scourge of random gun violence and mass killings rise once again as the pandemic eased. In many ways, the story of the Biden presidency so far can be told in the demeanor and behavior of the 78-year-old commander in chief. Biden comes across as both moderate in tone and political preference \u2013 but, in an intriguing political trick, also more radical and more progressive than his recent Democratic predecessors. That duality has made him a difficult target for Republicans, who have instead turned their fire on his possible successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has endured a difficult first half-year that has raised questions about her political dexterity. She is tackling two issues with no clear wins \u2013 stemming the exodus of migrants and refugees from Central America and countering the wave of restrictive voting laws that are protected from remedial counter-measures by Republicans wielding the Senate filibuster. Biden has explained that he believes he was elected not just to end the pandemic but to act as a fixer for America\u2019s problems. He has chosen not to constantly insert himself into every national conversation. Where his predecessor tried to destroy the decorum of the presidency, Biden has restored it. The President\u2019s approach represents a bet that most Americans are paying little attention to Trump\u2019s cacophony even as the media works through the scandalous aftermath of the ex-President\u2019s January 6 insurrection and refusal to peacefully transfer power. But his contention that there is space for Democrats and Republicans to work together in some areas \u2013 despite the fact that much of the latter party has given up on democracy \u2013 will be put to its stiffest test in the coming days as the fate of his infrastructure plan hangs in the balance. Following their boss\u2019 lead, and apart from some whispers to the media from Harris\u2019 staff, Biden\u2019s team has become the most on-message and unified West Wing for some time \u2013 making even President Barack Obama\u2019s buttoned up crowd seem ill-disciplined by comparison. But there is a downside to such narrowed focus that sometimes comes across as arrogance. Biden\u2019s vows to always be transparent with Americans were challenged Tuesday by belated news of past breakthrough infections on vaccinated members of the President\u2019s staff. For weeks, the White House also insisted that there was no \u201ccrisis\u201d on the southern border \u2013 not wanting to give Republican attacks political oxygen, despite the fact that it was in fact a serious situation: US border authorities arrested or turned away the highest monthly number of migrants at the US-Mexico border in a decade in June, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. And Biden\u2019s unwillingness to more forcibly confront the problem has not defused its potency for Republicans \u2013 it is fueling an even more intense midterm election year assault that Harris\u2019 struggles on the issue have only exacerbated. Few of Biden\u2019s predecessors could have understood the presidency\u2019s limitations and constant tests as well as he did, given his decades of experience in Washington. But even he might blanch at the relentless, exhausting trudge that his administration has become. Even the euphoria of Independence Day fireworks at the White House \u2013 once seen as representing freedom from the pandemic \u2013 was followed by dismaying advances by the virus and a deepening political quagmire. At times, the signs of pressure, which have been masked by Biden\u2019s constant encouragement for Americans to stick together and target better days, have shown. Last week, he accused Facebook of \u201ckilling\u201d people with vaccine misinformation. Biden almost torpedoed his own infrastructure compromise with Republicans hours after he announced it by apparently threatening to veto the measure if it was not passed in tandem with a massive, multi-trillion dollar budget bill demanded by the most liberal members of his own party. And Biden also snapped at CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins at the end of a news conference after his tough showdown in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Each time, however, the White House press operation swung into action and Biden swiftly walked back his remarks \u2013 preserving the stripped down demeanor that is now his trademark \u2013 and that contrasts with his foot-in-mouth verbosity earlier in his political career. In his inaugural address on January 20, the President told Americans \u201cfew periods in our nation\u2019s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u2019re in now.\u201d His words may be even more apt six months on.",

            "article_content": "Nearly a year after the police killing of George Floyd, pressure is mounting on President Joe Biden and members of Congress to show they are committed to holding police officers accountable for misconduct, excessive force and negligence after yet another agonizing week that has demonstrated how Americans of color are continuing to lose their lives during routine encounters with law enforcement. At this pivotal moment when the nation is once again focused on the need to end these all-too-common occurrences, Biden seems uniquely positioned to take a leading role in brokering a compromise with Congress after his lifetime of work on crime and justice legislation. But instead, Biden exhibited caution this week when addressing the death of another Black man and backed away from his campaign promise to create a police reform commission, convinced by advocates \u2013 according to White House officials \u2013 that a commission would be counterproductive to the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Biden\u2019s decision to stand down was a puzzling development given that there is no indication whatsoever that the Democratic legislation \u2013 which would create a national registry of police misconduct, ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and overhaul qualified immunity protections for police officers \u2013 has any chance in the 50-50 Senate after it passed the House in March without GOP support. Talks over bill to overhaul policing intensify amid new urgency after Daunte Wright shooting The bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat, told CNN this week that she is engaged in informal talks with lawmakers from both parties, including Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, as well as White House officials, trying to find a path forward. But nearly a year\u2019s worth of talks on Capitol Hill have yielded little in the way of results. In the meantime, Black and Brown men are still dying senseless deaths at the hands of police. The deep fissures in the Democratic Party over what to do on the issue of policing have put Democrats in a difficult spot. During the 2020 elections, Republican hammered their Democratic opponents over radical calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d \u2013 attempting to portray all Democrats as sympathetic to a view that is held by a small minority. The attack, even on Democrats who have repeatedly spoken out against \u201cdefund the police\u201d \u2013 is already resurfacing as a potent theme for the 2022 midterms as Republicans look to take control of Congress. It\u2019s a major reason why congressional leaders like House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the chamber, were quick to refute Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib\u2019s argument that there should be \u201cno more policing,\u201d because, in her view, it cannot be reformed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have police,\u201d Clyburn said in an interview this week with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. On Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department is rescinding a Trump-era memo that limited the use of consent decrees that hold accountable police departments accused of misconduct. The last consent decree issued was to the Baltimore City Police Department in 2017, following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, according to the Justice Department. Within a nation on edge, the latest incidents of police violence have drawn public outrage because they have unfolded in the midst of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the White former Minneapolis police officer who is being tried for Floyd\u2019s murder. Protests erupted this week after the death of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man who was shot by veteran Minnesota police officer Kimberly Potter in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center after he was initially pulled over for an expired tag and police learned that he had an outstanding warrant for a gross misdemeanor weapons charge. Potter fired her Glock 9mm handgun after shouting \u201cTaser, Taser, Taser\u201d when Wright attempted to get back into the driver\u2019s seat of the car while being detained by police, according to a summary of the criminal complaint. Brooklyn Center\u2019s former police chief suggested that the shooting was accidental, and Potter made her first court appearance Thursday after being charged with second degree manslaughter. \u201cThere\u2019s never gonna be justice for us,\u201d Wright\u2019s mother, Katie Wright, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cJustice would bring our son home, knocking on the door with a big smile, coming in the house, sitting down eating dinner with us, going out to lunch, playing with his one-year-old \u2013 almost two-year-old-son, giving him a kiss before he walks out the door.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still going to bury our son,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when people say justice, I just shake my head.\u201d While the nation was receiving an education on police use of force during the Chauvin trial, footage also emerged earlier this month of the shocking treatment of a Black and Latino US Army officer who was pepper-sprayed, knocked to the ground and threatened by Windsor, Virginia, police officers last December during a stop related to what police believed was a missing license plate (which was actually taped to his back window). With guns drawn, one of the officers, who has since been fired, told 2nd Lt. Caron Nazario he was \u201cfixin\u2019 to ride the lightning,\u201d which Nazario\u2019s lawsuit seeking compensatory damages describes as a \u201ccolloquial expression for an execution,\u201d particularly in reference to the electric chair. And in another difficult case, the Chicago Civilian Office of Police Accountability released body-worn camera footage Thursday that shows a police officer shooting 13-year-old Adam Toledo last month. Police say the boy was shot after the officer saw a gun in his right hand during a pursuit down a dark alley as police responded to a call of shots fired. An attorney for Toledo\u2019s family, Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, disputed the police account, stating the boy did not have a gun in his hand at the time he was shot. Weiss-Ortiz acknowledged that he could have had a gun in his hand during the encounter, but said he let go of whatever was in his hand when he turned to face the officer. \u201cThe officer screamed at him, \u2018Show me your hands,\u2019 Adam complied, turned around, his hands were empty when he was shot in the chest at the hands of the officer,\u201d Weiss-Ortiz told reporters Thursday. \u201cIf you\u2019re shooting an unarmed child with his hands in the air, it is an assassination.\u201d Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she did not see any evidence in body camera video that Toledo tried to shoot at officers before he was killed and she called on the Chicago police superintendent to change foot pursuit policies to better protect officers, suspects and bystanders. \u201cAs a mom, this is not something you want children to see,\u201d Lightfoot said during a news conference Thursday where she said her city has been \u201ctraumatized by a long history of police violence and misconduct.\u201d \u201cWe have to do better,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose more lives.\u201d Biden\u2019s cautious posture on policing issues since he has become President reflects the arms-length distance that he has maintained from the progressive left on a number of politically-fraught issues, including calls from some Democrats to expand the size of the Supreme Court, the suggestion that he should be doing more on gun control following a recent spate of mass shootings, and pressure to fulfill his own promise to raise the cap set on refugee admissions. In the wake of the mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility that killed at least eight people, Biden on Friday called gun violence an epidemic, saying, \u201cWe must act.\u201d But the executive actions Biden recently announced on guns \u2013 which the White House said are initial steps \u2013 are limited in scope, and the prospects for action in Congress appear slim in the face of GOP opposition. On refugees, Biden is signing a declaration Friday to speed refugee admissions to the US but not to raise the refugee cap, as he has committed to doing \u2013 a significant reversal from his administration\u2019s proposal earlier this year to lift the cap to 62,500. Biden seemed to be aiming for a middle ground on the recent police violence before meeting with members of Congress about the American Jobs Plan in the Oval Office earlier this week. He called Wright\u2019s shooting a \u201creally tragic thing,\u201d but added that everyone should \u201cwait and see what the investigation shows \u2013 the entire investigation.\u201d Clearly looking to deter the violence that marred some of the Floyd protests last year, he centered his remarks around a call for \u201cpeace and calm.\u201d \u201cI want to make it clear again: There is absolutely no justification \u2013 none \u2013 for looting, no justification for violence. Peaceful protest, understandable,\u201d Biden said Monday. \u201cWe do know that the anger, pain, and trauma that exists in the Black community in that environment is real \u2013 it\u2019s serious, and it\u2019s consequential. But it will not justify violence and/or looting.\u201d   Later this week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to say whether Biden believed Potter should face charges in Wright\u2019s death. Biden\u2019s reticence reflects not only the deadlock in the deeply divided Congress, but also the fact that Democrats are still struggling to refine their message on police reform \u2013 knowing the issue will be a vulnerability at the ballot box in 2022 and 2024. Last year, former President Donald Trump and Republicans tried to portray Democrats as weak on crime by inaccurately suggesting that Biden \u2013 and the party as a whole \u2013 agreed with the calls by some of the most liberal Democratic activists to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Though Biden rejected those calls, a Trump campaign ad misrepresented his position with a fictional portrayal of an older woman reaching an automated message while calling 911 as her home was being broken into. In an interview with CBS News after the November 2020 election, when Democrats fell short of expectations in congressional contests, Clyburn bluntly said the \u201cdefund the police\u201d slogan was \u201ckilling our party and we\u2019ve got to stop it.\u201d Democrats\u2019 sensitivity to those attacks was magnified this week by the swift response to Tlaib, a liberal Democrat, when she tweeted Monday that Wright\u2019s death was not accident and \u201cpolicing in our country is inherently & intentionally racist.\u201d \u201cDaunte Wright was met with aggression & violence,\u201d Tlaib tweeted. \u201cI am done with those who condone government funded murder. No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can\u2019t be reformed.\u201d Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who helped Biden clinch the Democratic nomination last year, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as a progressive to Biden\u2019s left when he sought the White House in 2020, quickly brushed aside her argument. \u201cThis is not about policing. This is not about training. This is about recruiting. Who are we recruiting to be police officers? That to me is where the focus has got to go. We\u2019ve got to have police officers,\u201d Clyburn told Lemon on \u201cCNN Tonight.\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he also did not agree with Tlaib\u2019s calls to end policing: \u201cWhat we need to do is to understand that there needs to be major, major police reform all across this country,\u201d the Vermont independent said this week on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cWe are tired of seeing the same thing, week after week and year after year, we do not want to see innocent African Americans, shot in cold blood. So, I think that is an area that needs significant amount of work.\u201d As the White House looked to Congress to take the lead on police reform legislation, Psaki was vague this week about what executive actions Biden might be willing to take on the issue. She suggested the White House is continuing to pin its hopes on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act: \u201cI know that does not solve all the issues. We\u2019re not suggesting that. I would say this is an issue that will be a cause of President Biden\u2019s time in office, and we are less than 100 days in. There is more to come.\u201d But as incomprehensible police shootings multiply with devastating consequences for the families, there is a fierce urgency in this moment, particularly as the nation waits for the verdict in the Chauvin trial. Justice in policing might be \u201ca cause\u201d that is more convenient for Biden to tackle later in his presidency. But by standing down and waiting for others to act, he may well miss this moment.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump returned to the public stage on Sunday with a familiar kind of Trump speech \u2013 a speech filled with debunked lies. Most notably, Trump\u2019s first post-presidency address, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, included his usual lies about the 2020 election. He continued to falsely insist he was the legitimate winner and continued to falsely insist the election was \u201crigged.\u201d Trump repeated a bunch of other false claims we regularly heard from him as president, on subjects ranging from trade with China to his stance on the war in Iraq. He also offered up some new false claims about President Joe Biden\u2019s early days in office. We are still going through the transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks, but here is an initial breakdown of some of the things he said. Who\u00a0won the election Trump repeated various versions of his usual lie that he won the 2020 election. He said that Democrats \u201cjust lost the White House,\u201d said that \u201cit\u2019s not possible\u201d that he lost, said \u201cno\u201d after asking the rhetorical question \u201cdid Biden win?\u201d and said another election win in the future would be his \u201cthird.\u201d Facts First: This is all false. Trump lost the 2020 election, fair and square. Democrat Joe Biden won a 306-232 victory in the Electoral College \u2013 earning over seven million more votes than Trump, good for a margin of 51.3% to 46.8%. Mail-in ballots and dead voters Trump repeated his attack on mail-in voting and claimed that dead people voted in the election. \u201c(T)ens of millions of ballots. Where are they coming from? They\u2019re coming from all over the place.\u201d He then claimed that \u201cdead people are voting.\u201d Facts First: Both of these claims are wrong. As we have fact checked many times before, mail-in voting is not rife with fraud and there were not tens of millions of ballots that came from unknown origins. CNN looked into several claims of dead people\u2019s ballots being cast in the election and found no evidence of widespread fraud. Early morning vote batches Trump repeated the claim that some nefarious vote-dumping occurred in the earlier hours of the morning after the election. \u201cWhat happened at 3:02 in the morning?\u201d Trump asked the CPAC audience. Facts First: There\u2019s nothing inherently suspicious or mysterious about large batches of votes being reported late at night or even after Election Day. Votes from mail-in ballots were often reported later on Election Day and afterwards because they couldn\u2019t be counted ahead of time in many states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania. And in several lawsuits over the election, judges determined the witness affidavits claiming they saw literal late night dumps of ballots were baseless and not evidence of fraud. More votes than people Trump repeated another of his arguments about voter fraud, claiming that in multiple cities there were more votes than people. He specifically called out Detroit, Michigan, which came under scrutiny shortly after the election when Republican county election officials tried to block the certification of election results. \u201cWe have a little problem adjusting in Detroit, we seem to have more votes than we have people. A lot more votes. An election changing number,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: It\u2019s false that there were more votes than people in Detroit. The city saw 250,138 votes cast this election, less than half the number of registered voters (504,714) and far fewer than the 670,031 people in the city as of 2019, according to the US Census Bureau. Trump\u2019s insistence that there are \u201cmore votes than people\u201d likely refers to precincts that are out of balance, which means the number of voters recorded didn\u2019t match the number of ballots cast in certain places. However, former and current Michigan state officials told CNN these imbalances are often clerical errors which are addressed as part of the canvassing process and not indicative of widespread fraud. Votes in Pennsylvania Trump also claimed that \u201cin Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting.\u201d Facts First: This is false. State officials and fact checkers have repeatedly explained that the claim that Pennsylvania had more votes than registered voters is just not true; Trump may have been relying on an incorrect figure from a Republican state legislator, who had relied on incomplete data. Biden and the Keystone Pipeline Trump claimed that Biden had not said during his campaign that he was planning to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline. \u201cIn one of his first official acts \u2013 which was incredible, because again, he talked about energy, he never said he was going to do this \u2013 he canceled the Keystone pipeline,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: This is misleading. Biden\u2019s campaign announced in May 2020 that he would cancel the Keystone XL pipeline if elected, and reiterated that position later in the campaign. An initial search of newspaper and television archives did not turn up any examples of Biden personally speaking about his plan to kill Keystone, so there may be a narrow basis for Trump\u2019s claim that Biden himself \u201cnever said\u201d he would do so. But given that the Biden campaign\u2019s announcement was widely reported, the facts don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s broader suggestion that the cancellation was a surprise move. Gas prices Trump said, \u201cUnder the radical Democrat policies, the price of gasoline has already surged 30% since the election.\u201d Facts First: This is misleading. First, Trump was ignoring the impact of factors unrelated to either party\u2019s policies, particularly the severe winter storm in February that caused prices to spike in February. Second, by comparing gas prices today to gas prices at the time of the election, Trump appeared to be assigning blame to President Joe Biden for the portion of the increase that occurred during the Trump presidency; there has been a much smaller increase, about 13%, if you compare current prices to prices on Biden\u2019s first full day in office. The increase in the national average at the pumps is indeed in the ballpark of 30% if you compare prices the weekend Trump spoke at CPAC ($2.71 per unleaded gallon, according to data provided to CNN by AAA) to prices on Election Day in early November ($2.12) \u2013 that\u2019s about a 28% spike. But it\u2019s unfair for Trump to hold Democrats responsible for increases in November, December and the first 19 days of January, when Trump himself was in office. The national average on Biden\u2019s first full day as president, January 21, was $2.39; the $2.71 price this past weekend was about 13% higher than that. Asked about Trump\u2019s claim, AAA spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano said in an email that prices have steadily increased since the end of November because of higher crude oil prices driven by optimism about coronavirus vaccines, while \u201cthe recent spikes (the last 2 weeks) are a direct result of the winter storm that hit Texas and took 26 refineries offline.\u201d Biden and fracking Trump claimed Biden reversed his stance on fracking between the primary and the general election, stating, \u201cDuring the primary, \u2018no fracking.\u2019 As soon as he got through that, he said \u2018no, of course, everybody can frack.\u2019\u201d Facts First: While Trump\u2019s characterization of Biden\u2019s stance on fracking is inaccurate, there is some basis for the Trump campaign\u2019s continued criticism that Biden flipflopped on the issue. Biden\u2019s written plan never included a complete ban on fracking but his comments over the course of the campaign did create confusion about his position on the issue. During the July 2019 Democratic primary debate, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked whether there would be \u201cany place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d to which Biden responded, \u201cNo, we would \u2013 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either \u2013 any fossil fuel.\u201d After the primary, Trump referenced these past remarks from Biden in the final presidential debate, prompting the former vice president to falsely insist he never said he opposed fracking. Biden then tried to clarify his position and claimed his past opposition was specifically about fracking on federal land only. But Biden did not go so far as to express the unbridled support for fracking Trump implied and his comments should not be construed as such. Biden\u2019s plan during the general election proposed \u201cbanning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,\u201d not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters. A week after taking office, Biden signed an executive order ordering a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water areas. Refugees Trump said: \u201cYour family still can\u2019t go out to eat at local restaurants, but Joe Biden is bringing in thousands upon thousands of refugees from all over the world. People that nobody knows anything about. We don\u2019t have crime records. We don\u2019t have health records.\u201d Facts First: While it is true that Biden is planning to significantly increase the number of refugees the US accepts, it\u2019s wrong to suggest that the US doesn\u2019t know \u201canything about\u201d the refugees it brings in. Refugees are rigorously vetted; the admissions process includes an interview assessment by US government personnel, medical screening, and various types of background checks, including fingerprint checks against\u00a0databases maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense. Trump reduced the maximum number to a historic low of 15,000 for the 2021 fiscal year; Biden plans to raise the cap to 62,500 for 2021 and then to 125,000 in his first full fiscal year, 2022. President Barack Obama set a cap of 85,000 in his last full fiscal year in office, 2016. Obama raised the cap to 110,000 for his final partial fiscal year, 2017. Biden and schools Trump called for children to return to school \u201cimmediately,\u201d then said, \u201cThe only reason most parents do not have that choice is because Joe Biden sold out America\u2019s children to the teachers unions.\u201d He said Biden is \u201ccruelly keeping our children locked in their homes.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Biden, who has called for the reopening of most schools by his 100th day in office, is personally keeping children locked out of school or that Biden\u2019s position on the issue is \u201cthe only reason\u201d some schools continue to offer only virtual instruction. While the federal government can issue guidelines for the reopening of schools, it is up to state and especially local officials to make the actual decisions on when to reopen. Also, the current guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not tell schools that they cannot reopen. It says: \u201cAt any level of community transmission, all schools have options to provide in-person instruction (either full or hybrid), through strict adherence to mitigation strategies.\u201d Biden\u2019s administration can be fairly criticized for shifting from its original position on what would count as meeting his goal of having a majority of schools open within 100 days. (You can read more here on its shifting explanations. But it\u2019s not fair to say Biden is the one person keeping children out of classrooms. Recent polling shows a majority of adults support waiting until any teacher who wants a vaccine can get it. And it\u2019s worth noting that Trump himself could not open schools as president even when he wanted to; Trump suggested in 2020 that he might cut off federal funding to schools that did not reopen, but experts said he could not unilaterally carry out that threat, and he did not end up trying. Sanctions on Iran Trump said Biden\u2019s administration \u201cunilaterally withdrew our crippling sanctions on Iran, foolishly giving away all of America\u2019s leverage before negotiations have even begun.\u201d He continued moments later, \u201cThey took off the sanctions. They took off the sanctions. They said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to not have any sanctions. Let\u2019s negotiate a deal.\u2019 \u201c Facts First: Trump\u2019s characterization of the actions taken by the Biden team on Iran is wrong. It\u2019s false to suggest the Biden administration has removed any sanctions against Iran imposed by the Trump administration. It\u2019s likely Trump was referring to the Biden administration\u2019s decisions to lift travel restrictions placed on Iranian diplomats to the United Nations by the Trump administration and halt the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to snap back UN sanctions on Iran. However, these recent efforts from the Biden administration to reverse Trump administration actions regarding Iran cannot accurately be characterized as a removal of existing sanctions. Despite former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s claim, UN sanctions on Iran were never reimposed, as no other member of the UN Security Council agreed with the US-led effort. In order for the sanctions to have snapped back on Iran, the complaint must be filed by a nation that\u2019s participating in the Iran nuclear deal, which the US was not under the Trump administration. Throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, his administration did impose a tremendous number of sanctions on Iranian companies, entities and individuals \u2013 through their maximum pressure campaign \u2013 which remain in place. Florida, Ohio and Iowa Trump claimed that \u201cno president has ever lost an election after carrying Florida, Ohio and Iowa.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. Richard Nixon won Florida, Ohio and Iowa in 1960 but lost the election to John F. Kennedy. Unlike a previous version of this claim, in which Trump declared that nobody at all ever lost the election after winning those three states, this \u201cno president\u201d version is not flat false because Nixon was not an incumbent president at the time. Still, Trump omitted the fact that somebody has won these three states and been defeated. Also, of course, this historical tidbit does not tell us anything about the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s defeat. Deportations to\u00a0Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador Trump repeated an old false claim about Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, saying that before he took office, those countries were \u201crefusing to take back illegal alien gang members, including MS-13.\u201d He added soon after: \u201cWe\u2019d fly \u2018em in, they wouldn\u2019t let the plane land. We\u2019d bus \u2018em in, they wouldn\u2019t let the buses get anywhere near the border.\u201d Facts First: This remains false. In 2016, just prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant\u201d (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US. Randy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted to CNN in 2019 that in the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before Trump took office, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year, which encompassed the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and the beginning of Trump\u2019s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries. ICE officials said there were some exceptions to the three countries\u2019 general cooperativeness, but Trump\u2019s general declaration that the countries were uncooperative was never true. Trump\u2019s stance on the war in Iraq Trump repeated his usual false claim about his pre-war stance on the war in Iraq. \u201cIraq: remember I used to say don\u2019t go in, but if you\u2019re gonna go in, keep the oil. Well, we went in and we didn\u2019t keep the oil,\u201d he said. Facts First: Contrary to his repeated claims, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the invasion of Iraq before it occurred. He began criticizing the war in 2003, after the invasion, but he also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq. He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004. We could not find any examples of Trump saying anything before the war about keeping Iraq\u2019s oil. (We asked the Trump-era White House communications staff if it could provide any evidence; we never got a response.) Trump appeared to be describing comments he made during the war, in which he did talk about taking Iraq\u2019s oil, as if he made them during the run-up to the war. You can read a longer fact check here. Past tariffs on China Trump repeated a familiar claim about how, before he took office, China \u201cnever gave us 10 cents,\u201d but then, under him, the US took in \u201chundreds of billions\u201d from China because of his tariffs. Facts First: This was wrong in two ways. First, studies repeatedly showed that it\u2019s not true that China paid Trump\u2019s tariffs; Americans bore the majority of the cost. Second, Trump\u2019s claim that the government had not previously received \u201c10 cents\u201d from tariffs on China is also false. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; President Barack Obama imposed new tariffs on China; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d China also made tens of billions of annual purchases of US exports under Obama \u2013 more than $100 billion in goods purchases every year from 2011 through 2016.\u201d The trade deficit with China Trump repeated one of the most frequent false claims of his presidency \u2013 his lie that, in the past, the US used to have a trade deficit of about $500 billion with China. \u201cWe used to lose $504 billion trade deficit with China\u2026not million; $504 million is a lot\u2026now take $504 million, make it $504 billion; we had deficits with China,\u201d he said. Facts First: Trump was wrong again. The US had never had a $504 billion (or $500 billion) trade deficit with China before Trump took office. The record was set in the Trump era: a $380 billion deficit in goods and services trade with China in 2018. The goods and services deficit with China declined to $308 billion in 2019. (We don\u2019t have final figures for 2020.) US deaths in Afghanistan Trump said, \u201cNot one American soldier has been killed in Afghanistan in over a year.\u201d Facts First: This is true if you are talking specifically about combat deaths but not true if you count all deaths. There have been at least three US soldiers killed in Afghanistan since February 28, 2020, one in a non-combat vehicle rollover and two in other non-combat incidents. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Canadian Michael Bociurkiw (@WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst, author of the book Digital Pandemic and host of the podcast \u201cGlobal Impact.\u201d He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. In an election few wanted and which ended up as the most expensive in Canadian history, Justin Trudeau, on Monday managed to return his party to the government benches in the House of Commons for the third consecutive time. He failed to obtain a majority of seats \u2013 forcing him once again to reach across the aisle to opposition parties in order to pass key legislation, and the costly exercise should raise questions about Trudeau\u2019s credibility, especially when the Covid-19 crisis remains far from over. The Liberal Party leader never said he was gunning for a majority, but his opponents \u2013 including his main opponent, Erin O\u2019Toole of the Conservatives \u2013 insisted a wasteful power grab was the objective. As of Wednesday with mail-in ballots still being counted, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party remained 12 seats short of the target to form a majority government \u2013 bringing back a Parliament strikingly similar to the last one. As he did during his first election win in 2015, Trudeau invoked the phrase of brighter days ahead: \u201cYou are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get Canada through this pandemic and to the brighter days ahead. My friends, that\u2019s exactly what we are ready to do,\u201d Trudeau told supporters early Tuesday. Worldwide, the Covid-19 virus seems to have developed a knack for outsmarting elected leaders at almost every turn \u2013 including in Canada, which is in the midst of a fourth wave \u2013 and throughout the 36-day campaign thorny issues such as vaccine passports and mandates featured prominently. And in what resembled scenes south of the border, anti-vaxxer campaigners and heckling protesters caused significant disruption, especially at Trudeau campaign events. What happened to trusting experts? \u201cI can say without a doubt that this election had much more vitriol than others. People are hurting. Businesses have not recovered from the losses they incurred due to the pandemic,\u201d Krystina Waler of the Conservatives told me. Trudeau called the election August 15 with the reasoning that the existing arrangement in Parliament was unworkable and that his party required a fresh imprimatur to wrestle the pandemic to the ground and reboot a struggling Canadian economy. Unsaid was that calling an election a full two years before the end of his mandate was a bid to regain a majority and liberate the government from having to rely on the left-leaning New Democratic Party for support in the House of Commons. In the last election, well before Covid-19 became a main preoccupation of voters, the Liberals appeared to be punished for a series of scandals that had made their campaign promises of clean and ethical government almost laughable. With those lapses now in the rearview mirror, Trudeau\u2019s best hope was that voters would opt for a familiar face rather than entrust the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic to an untested newcomer such as O\u2019Toole \u2013 or any of the other four federal party leaders for that matter. Facebook's alarming plan for news feeds Fortunately for Trudeau, his ministers managed to catch up after a bungled initial vaccine rollout, and the government can now point to almost 70% of Canadians having been fully vaccinated. While it is hard to say with any certainty, millions of voters, especially younger ones, likely went to the ballot box with a positive view of the Trudeau Liberals for the billions of dollars doled out during waves of punishing lockdowns. The spending spree, which provided even high school graduates with up to C$1750-a-month, helped nudge the federal deficit close to the C$1 trillion mark for the first time. That priority will need to be tackled immediately as the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant continues to wreak havoc in the western provinces. Just days before Canadians headed to the polls, a public health emergency was declared in Alberta \u2013 the province that lifted restrictions more than any other \u2013 as the public health system reached a breaking point. The deteriorating situation there may have indirectly helped Trudeau gain votes after O\u2019Toole praised Premier Jason Kenney for his handling of the pandemic. As Canadians woke up Tuesday, they might have been wondering about the future direction of a country that not only faces uncertainty from the pandemic and a diminished presence on the international stage \u2013 but also political divisions that made this election one of the most toxic in recent memory. Aside from the pandemic spending, the other main issues on the campaign trail were climate, housing affordability and gun control. Foreign affairs issues rarely intrude into a Canadian election campaign, but the first few days on the hustings were dominated by biting questions about Canada\u2019s response to the United States\u2019 abrupt pullout from Afghanistan. Left behind, in part by bureaucratic bungling, were thousands of Afghans whom Trudeau had promised to accept as refugees. That threw Liberal messaging off course in the first crucial days of the campaign with persistent questions as to why Canada, which paid a disproportionately high price in Afghanistan, was not better prepared. And dogging Trudeau throughout the campaign were questions on why he decided to send millions to polling stations just as Canada is in the midst of a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 especially for a government which professed to prioritize science over politics. Two Lego blocks gave me hope in my country's crisis With the Delta variant circulating in many parts of the country, Trudeau, projecting a \u201crules for thee but not for me\u201d attitude, came under fire for holding large election rallies and a media event indoors during the pandemic. Having put Canadians through a power-grab exercise that landed taxpayers with a $470 (US) million tab, Trudeau\u2019s political future could be anything but bright. Could this election even spell the beginning of the end of the once-powerful Trudeau brand and open the door to a leadership challenge down the road? At 49 years old, Trudeau is now the eldest of the three main party leaders. While his youthful vigour was evident throughout the campaign, especially during a punishing schedule in the last days designed to close tight races across the country, Trudeau appears to have succumbed to a delivery style that comes across as haughty and laced with stump speech bullet points. With his previous ethics violations providing ample ammunition to opponents, Trudeau may need to make way for a fresh face to lead his party into uncertain times. (As a third ethics inquiry was launched last year over the WE Charity scandal, Trudeau admitted he had made a mistake). As in the last campaign, benefitting Trudeau, who is the son of a former prime minister, was the lack of a formidable challenger. Despite a last-minute attempt to rebrand O\u2019Toole as an equally charismatic leader, the Conservatives\u2019 leader clearly failed to ignite the hearts and minds of Canadians in large enough numbers to grab power.  Even a late shift to the left by O\u2019Toole and a hardened pro-vaccine stance failed to make a dent in the Liberal campaign juggernaut. O\u2019Toole\u2019s poor showing on the campaign trail may send him to political purgatory. As the House of Commons reconvenes this fall, Trudeau\u2019s caucus may be tempted to ask why an election was called, given that it has hardly changed the political landscape in Ottawa. It is a fair question to ask.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the book \u201cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\u201d and co-author, with Peter Eisner, of the book \u201cHigh Crimes: The Corruption, Impunity, and Impeachment of Donald Trump.\u201d James Cohen, PhD, is assistant professor of media studies at City College of New York and co-author with Thomas Kenny of \u201cProducing New and Digital Media.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. A man, armed with a machete and a knife and expressing White supremacist views, was arrested near the Democratic National Committee\u2019s headquarters on Monday as Washington awaits a rally of diehard Trump supporters set for Saturday. The adornments on his truck flashed old-fashioned signs of hate, including a swastika \u2013 an old-fashioned symbol in an era when right-wing extremists are more likely to rally behind internet memes. Whether old or new, these symbols have one thing in common: They are meant to terrorize. Mindful of the bloody attack on January 6, police have erected fencing and are preparing just in case violence erupts among the demonstrators gathering to show their solidarity with those charged with crimes related to the attacks. Capitol Hill residents are expressing anxiety and dread, which means that the demonstrators have already had an impact \u2013 intimidating locals and forcing the government to mobilize defenses. The rally itself is not an act of terrorism, but fear instilled by an attack, or even the mere threat of one, accomplishes the same goal. In the case of Trump extremists, including those who belong to the so-called Proud Boys and various self-described militias, the terror campaign is already years long. While it\u2019s legal to bear arms in Michigan, this terror campaign was evident when armed men crowded into the state\u2019s Capitol to support Trump\u2019s view on the pandemic, and in Arizona when they paraded to support his claims of election fraud. Seen any where else in the world, we would decry the threats against election officials as undemocratic. Here, however, we have been slow to recognize them as such. Two factors have made it difficult for the press to report on the radicalization of far-right extremists and for the public to understand what has happened. The first is the fact that the process mostly takes place online, out of the view of outsiders and powered by seemingly innocuous social media memes. With startling or humorous images and phrases, the memes invite viewers to believe, for example, that White people are victims of oppression and the West is under threat from outsiders. Borrowing from the film \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d those who are persuaded use the term \u201cred pilling\u201d to indicate they had accepted the challenge of learning truths that others feared. As the Anti-Defamation League and others would eventually explain, \u201cred pilling\u201d could lead to developments as \u201cradical as someone coming to believe that Jews control the world or that feminism is destroying the West.\u201d Milley's reasonable actions raise a serious question Of special concern has been the canny use of memes by right wing extremists around the world who develop clickbait to engage viewers with messages about the supposed oppression of White people and the dangers of Islam. In the US, Donald Trump was the subject of many of these memes. When he was elected, one online poster declared, \u201cWe actually elected a meme as president.\u201d The second difficulty we encounter as we look at right wing extremists is an overall reticence to recognize that their activities are sometimes terroristic. This problem was identified in 2017 in the Fordham Law Review by University of Miami law professor Caroline Mala Corbin. She writes that false narratives about Muslims and White Americans shape assumptions. Sometimes, as in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, this way of thinking leads to the initial belief that an attack carried out by a White perpetrator must have been executed by Muslims. In the fall of 2020 the Department of Homeland Security declared White supremacists the greatest terror threat facing the country. However, the government did not connect this movement to the Trump cause. Any doubt that the two intersect should have been erased on January 6 when Trump flags and Confederate battle flags were waved together by the rioters who attacked the Capitol. Members of the mob also displayed images and phrases taken from the most popular memes in extremist online communities. For example, flags for the make-believe country of Kekistan and placards honoring the god \u201cKek,\u201d which takes the form of a cartoon frog, signaled the presence of red-pilled Trump supporters who play with memes about how Kek grants Trump magical powers. In memes popular with extremist Trump supporters, hateful messages are combined with American flags and shareable quips. These are often decorated with Christian crosses, Confederate battle flags, and show Trump as a superhero or godlike emperor. The murderous Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and his black helicopters are also popular in this memestream, as is Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character whose \u201cFeels Good Man\u201d message ironically confirms that your emotions are what really matter. A big win for Gavin Newsom, but a bigger defeat for the GOP As they share the memes online, these citizens of MAGA World wind each other up emotionally with a torrent of messages about a nation in crisis that must be saved from its enemies. While this may all be fantasy, it is powerful and motivating for true believers. There\u2019s a tendency among many to focus on the acts of MAGA extremists, but that misses the full picture of the parallels with other kinds of radicalism, as well as the roots of aggressive actions. Whether it\u2019s an armed \u201cmilitia\u201d at Michigan\u2019s state Capitol or the Proud Boys committing street violence, much of the organizing and motivation comes from deep online spaces where the uninitiated would struggle to understand the coded messages that are promoted repeatedly. If we are to confront the domestic threat identified by Homeland Security, we must expose this process and how it leads some people from laughing at memes to extremist views and terroristic actions. Just last month, Trump supporter Floyd Ray Roseberry parked his truck outside the Library of Congress, turned on his cellphone camera and posted on Facebook that the vehicle was loaded with enough explosives to level \u201ctwo and a half blocks.\u201d During his five-hour livestream standoff with police he told viewers that Trump had been deprived of re-election by a massive fraud and announced that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s on.\u201d \u201cWhen this bomb goes off there\u2019s gonna be four more right behind it,\u201d said Roseberry, \u201cand the patriots are gonna come.\u201d After hours of negotiations with police, Roseberry surrendered. A search of the truck turned up bomb-making materials but not a working device, police said. Roseberry was charged with threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to use an explosive device.  As he spoke, Roseberry was visibly in real distress, suggesting that mental health issues may have been a factor in the incident at the Library of Congress. But it would be wrong to ignore the influence of the digital toxic energy that was obviously part of his online environment. His claims, phrases and even his live streaming are all staples of the online MAGAverse. He claimed to be a patriot and deplored the idea of America sheltering refugees from Afghanistan. Outrage stirred online became real life action on January 6. Many of the attackers decorated themselves with symbols made popular in memes, which they showed as they ransacked the Capitol. These images are certain to appear at future extremist events, including the demonstration planned for September 18. Designed to threaten outsiders and incite those waiting for their time to act, they are, when used this way, emblems of terrorists. By their memes we should know them.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jonathan A. Greenblatt is CEO and National Director of ADL (the Anti-Defamation League). The views expressed here are his. Read more opinion on CNN. Around the world Jews are celebrating the High Holy Days. During this time, Jews focus on the need for Teshuvah, or self-examination and repentance. But self-examination need not be limited to individuals. Institutions, especially century-old institutions like ADL,  also can commit to the practice of self-examination and Teshuvah. And it is in this spirit that I have been reflecting on a stance ADL took 11 years ago when we opposed the location of the then-proposed Park51 Islamic Community Center & Mosque near Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan. Originally known as Cordoba House, and modeled after institutions such as the JCC in Manhattan, now known as the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan, and the 92nd Street Y, the project planned to include community and cultural spaces with the goal of fostering interfaith dialogue and promoting peace and understanding. I believe the stance we took is one for which we owe the Muslim community an apology. Further, amidst ADL\u2019s reflection, and approaching the 20th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, our nation\u2019s sudden and disastrously planned withdrawal from Afghanistan is heartbreaking. For me personally, and ADL as a whole, this catastrophe made our Teshuvah all the more urgent. Today one can see how the Cordoba House could have helped to heal our country as we nursed the wounds from the horror of 9/11. As we near the 20th anniversary of that tragic day, the need for healing remains. Arguably, it has attained an increased urgency after the tumult of recent years and especially now as we prepare to welcome refugees from Afghanistan, including many who supported our troops and our ideals, and now flee the onslaught of the Taliban. Sadly, rather than heal, we have seen Islamophobia persist in ugly ways. As the leading anti-hate organization in the US, with experts tracking extremism of all sorts, ADL is committed to help our Muslim allies counter Islamophobia. Indeed, we have been doing so for many decades. And this is exactly why, as a dear Muslim friend told me recently, ADL\u2019s stance on the Cordoba House project was \u201ca punch in the gut to the Muslim community.\u201d I hope that by righting this wrong, we can be better allies in the fight against the rise in anti-Muslim hate that is coming \u2013 and it is coming. We must keep our promises for the little girl huddled in a refugee camp. That girl was me I say this, because as most Americans were praying for the Afghan people, generously donating funds and preparing to welcome some number of Afghan civilians into our great nation, some so-called \u201cexperts\u201d began spreading alarmist and Islamophobic disinformation in shameless attempts to block these brutalized civilians from coming to the United States. Adding to the alarm, these insidious conspiracy theories are coming during a time that the FBI is reporting the highest level of hate crimes in over a decade. And that is likely just the opening chorus of anti-Muslim sentiment that I fear will swell in the weeks, months and years ahead. We\u2019ve seen it before. We saw it in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The FBI tracked a massive spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2001, compared to 2000:  a jump from 28 incidents to 481. Muslims were profiled, attacked and killed, mosques were desecrated, slander flowed in the media and even members of the Sikh community were attacked simply because they wore turbans. And we saw it again in 2010, when a media storm rose up around Cordoba House. While the country was in many ways less polarized in 2010 than in our present moment, it was still a fraught time. A time when you could almost see the lines that divide us today being drawn. When Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf and Daisy Khan envisioned the creation of Cordoba House, they intended to foster better relations between the Islamic world and America, and to serve as a public rejection of extremism. Trump adviser Stephen Miller warned of 'Iraqs and 'Stans' in the US while slow-walking the entry of Afghan allies Sadly, it was portrayed very differently. Some polemicists immediately pounced. The media dubbed it the \u201cGround Zero Mosque,\u201d an unfair name that instantly cast the project in a negative light. Mayor Michael Bloomberg argued for it. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich railed against it. The impassioned families of victims could be heard on both sides of the debate. Other public figures piled on, virtually climbing over each other to be heard. The tension reached a boiling point as local community boards repeatedly voted in favor of the project amidst continued protests and counter protests. Then ADL weighed in. Although before my tenure, I know that ADL struggled with the decision, trying to balance a genuine desire to support a noble endeavor but also to support the victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attack who voiced opposition. And so, ADL decided not to oppose the project outright,  but instead tried to take a nuanced position, advocating for a location change that the organization felt would help lead to the type of reconciliation the project itself was meant to represent. There are likely other ways ADL\u2019s voice could have improved rather than impaired the conversation.  For instance, as some of the organizers later reflected, more engagement early on with victims\u2019 families could have gone a long way in achieving the ultimate goal of fostering reconciliation and peace. Daisy Kahn once explained how the goal of Cordoba House was to \u201crepair the breach and be at the front and center to start the healing.\u201d Perhaps ADL should have helped facilitate such a discussion. And yet, we chose to weigh in differently. And through deep reflection and conversation with many friends within the Muslim community, the real lesson is a simple one: we were wrong, plain and simple. Ultimately, the project as envisioned never came to be \u2013 with the development primarily becoming another familiar condominium tower. We can\u2019t change the past. But we accept responsibility for our unwise stance on Cordoba House, apologize without caveat and commit to doing our utmost going forward to use our expertise to fight anti-Muslim bias as allies. The leader of the anti-Taliban resistance speaks out As we see the signs of another surge in anti-Muslim hate, it is imperative that the collective we \u2013 civil society, the business community, elected officials and the American citizenry writ large \u2013 embrace the idea and intent of Cordoba House and work together to foster peace. We have seen Muslims demonized in recent years in ways that make the heart ache \u2013 from the early talk of a \u201cMuslim registry\u201d in days after the 2016 election to the travel ban imposed the following year on Muslim-majority countries to the unfounded conspiratorial claims of Muslims invading the US that still show up in the rantings of some prime-time cable news personalities. This is in addition to the all-too frequent use of slander and stereotypes of Islam on social media platforms. ADL\u2019s most recent survey of online hate and harassment found that Muslim respondents regularly experience identity-based harassment. This kind of ugliness seems to be on a permanent loop. It\u2019s clear that some of the wild charges lodged against Cordoba House \u2013 that it was organized by \u201cradical Islamists\u201d and \u201cterrorist sympathizers\u201d  \u2013 were part of this pattern. And we must not allow this pattern to continue, especially as Afghans seek refuge in the promise of America. This must start with the Biden administration stepping up to ensure Afghan refugees do not face burdensome roadblocks or are unjustly denied entry to our nation. This is why over 300 organizations, including ADL, signed a recent letter to President Joe Biden expressing \u201cour support for a robust humanitarian response from the United States and our commitment to assist Afghans in danger\u201d while also imploring the administration to \u201cexpand opportunities for Afghans to seek refuge.\u201d  But the work doesn\u2019t stop there. It is on all of us to fight back against the Islamophobic attempts to prevent refugees from gaining asylum. Again, we already see the disturbing \u201cinvasion\u201d claim being thrown around again in direct reference to Afghan refugees. Some have tried to rationalize their hate by invoking the White supremacist \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d theory. All of it is wrong. We are better than this. We actively can choose not only to reject hate, but to embrace those in need. ADL\u2019s stance on Cordoba House was an error that pales alongside the abrupt abandonment of our Afghan allies, but all of us should draw upon our better angels and welcome those poor and huddled masses who today seek our support. Note: An earlier version of this article incompletely described the models for Cordoba House.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The pioneering 19th century German physician Rudolf Virchow saw medicine \u201cas the science of human beings\u201d with \u201cthe obligation to point out problems\u201d and seek their \u201ctheoretical solution.\u201d But it is up to politicians, he added, to \u201cfind the means for their actual solution.\u201d By that measure, many of today\u2019s public officials are failing in the worsening Covid crisis. Virchow is known for many things: His discoveries about the role of cells in giving rise to disease, his work in developing the science of anthropology, his advocacy of social reform \u2013 and the duel that never happened with Otto von Bismarck, later to be chancellor, one that might or might not have involved the use of a poisoned sausage. But Virchow also popularized the term \u201ckulturkampf\u201d \u2013 or culture struggle \u2013 an ancestor to today\u2019s \u201cculture wars,\u201d which dominate American politics. The latest example: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 refusal to allow school districts to mandate masks to protect children and teachers from the coronavirus. \u201cEven as the Covid-19 rates are flaring in his state within the unvaccinated population, DeSantis is doubling down in resisting\u201d policies recommended by scientists and backed by President Joe Biden, wrote Julian Zelizer. DeSantis, a potential candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, \u201clabeled New York City a \u2018bio-medical security state\u2019 for requiring proof of vaccination in many indoor facilities.\u201d Biden is \u201cdealing with large pockets of public health denialism that are deploying this issue \u2013 packaged in the rhetoric of individual freedom \u2013 to undercut efforts to protect the population, the economy, and our health care system from the ravages of this ongoing pandemic.\u201d As David Axelrod observed of DeSantis, \u201csince the pandemic first emerged, the uber-ambitious Trump wannabe has clawed his way to the top of the potential Republican presidential field with his showy defiance of public health experts and directives \u2026 After the Centers for Disease Control offered new guidance last week recommending that school children be required to mask up this fall, DeSantis stood up again for the sacred right of Americans to expose themselves, their children and others to the deadly virus.\u201d This fight \u201cmay profit his ambitions while jeopardizing public health,\u201d Axelrod warned. \u201cFreedom in America is grounded in self-determination, a fiercely held belief that is at the core of the Covid vaccine- and mask-refusal movement,\u201d wrote Dr. Comilla Sasson, an emergency medicine physician, and Robin Cogan, a school nurse. \u201cUnfortunately, your secondhand SARS-CoV-2 is impacting others, including our most vulnerable populations \u2013 resulting in even more Covid deaths. Yes, it is your inalienable right to go unvaccinated, or not wear a mask. But it is not your right to kill others.\u201d  Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert, wrote that he\u2019s worried about the health of children under 12, who aren\u2019t yet eligible for the vaccines. \u201cThe next real area for debate is not whether the current vaccines are good enough against the Delta variant (they are, overwhelmingly) or whether we should mask up and spread out (yes, obviously), but rather what should we do about the children who are not yet eligible for vaccination under a US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) but will be heading back to school in a month, or sooner \u2013 during an outbreak of a viral variant that could get much more severe?\u201d Jade Wu said she keeps getting the same question from friends and family \u2013 why are you still wearing a mask? \u201cI have been called overreactive, too covered up and way too scared,\u201d wrote Wu, who is vaccinated. \u201cAt least two of my acquaintances tell me they have experienced similar chiding about masking in public; one of them has become so self-conscious that she is uncomfortable stepping out of her house unless she has to.\u201d \u201cWhy must we mask wearers justify ourselves during a pandemic \u2013 especially since, while breakthrough infections are incredibly rare (less than 1% of fully vaccinated people have become infected, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of official state data), the vaccine does not provide 100% protection. What\u2019s more, anyone can carry or transmit the virus. Don\u2019t we have the right \u2013 and the responsibility \u2013 to wear a mask?\u201d New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday that starting September 13, proof of at least one dose of vaccination will be required for entry into indoor restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues, noted Jill Filipovic. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary and overdue step. But why aren\u2019t more cities and states taking it? And more importantly: Why isn\u2019t President Joe Biden?\u201d Vaccinated people are expressing anger at those who resist getting the shot, wrote Peter Bregman and Howard Jacobson. \u201cYou may be furious at what you see as the selfishness and ignorance and lack of civic responsibility in the people in your life who refuse to get the jab,\u201d they noted. But if you lash out at the vaccine-hesitant, \u201care they thanking you for setting them straight and rushing to make appointments?\u201d Not likely. There\u2019s a better way: \u201cBut when you don\u2019t have actual power over someone, it\u2019s only through a caring and respectful relationship that you can influence them to change. If you want a loved one to get vaccinated, approach them with empathy and curiosity, to communicate your caring and respect.\u201d For more: David R. Holtgrave: How to prevent Covid hot spots Peggy Drexler: Can you do something about stubborn unvaccinated people? Yes, you can On Tuesday, New York State Attorney General Letitia James revealed the result of her office\u2019s months-long investigation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2013 a 165-page report finding that he sexually harassed state employees and presided over a \u201cculture of fear and intimidation.\u201d \u201cI believe these 11 women,\u201d James said. Legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers called the report \u201cdevastating\u201d and wrote, \u201cCuomo tried on Tuesday to dampen the report\u2019s impact in the way he has since many of these allegations surfaced: by disparaging the investigation as politically motivated, denying the allegations, and claiming \u2013 this time with a cringeworthy slideshow of photos of him kissing a lot of people \u2013 that being physically affectionate is simply the way he is, and, therefore, no big deal.\u201d Rodgers concluded that \u201cmany of the report\u2019s findings seem to clearly fall within the categories of conduct that should support impeachment, particularly the failure to follow internal office procedures in handling the complaints against Cuomo.\u201d The MeToo movement \u201cshook up the worlds of politics, entertainment, media, corporate America and everywhere in between,\u201d noted SE Cupp. But \u201cwhat progress has been made for the accusers? Well, barely any if you\u2019ve been following the Cuomo saga. In many cases, it is still just as difficult for women to tell, to bring to light their stories of sexual harassment at work.

Jeffrey Clark, then the attorney general for the civil division \u2013 who reportedly previously had secretly expressed his support for the bogus \u2018stolen election\u2019 theory directly to Trump himself \u2013 made this straightforward proposition, in essence: choose me and I\u2019ll deploy the Department to help you steal this election.\u201d Trump eventually chose to stick with acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, who warned of mass resignations if he were ousted.

But the milestone birthday remains a moment to reflect on Obama\u2019s lasting impact, wrote historian Peniel E. Joseph. \u201cObama\u2019s hair has turned grayer, he looks even thinner now than he did as commander in chief and one can see the impact of time \u2013 and being president \u2013 in the wrinkles and creases that appear visible on a once unlined face,\u201d Joseph wrote. \u201cYet time out of office has radicalized the preternaturally cautious Obama into calling for an end to the filibuster, if that\u2019s what\u2019s required to preserve democracy. His characterization of the filibuster as \u2018another Jim Crow relic\u2019 offered further proof that Obama 2.0 displays a willingness to confront America\u2019s long history of structural racism with the kind of bracing candor he rarely embraced as president.\u201d Looking over his entire career, Joseph observed, \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s enduring power is his ability to allow us to imagine ourselves as a better country, society and people.\u201d Rep. Cori Bush is no stranger to evictions. \u201cI\u2019ve lived out of my car for months with my two babies,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my belongings in trash bags along my backseat. I know what that notice on the door means.\u201d So it was unacceptable to the Democrat from St. Louis that the House would leave town without finding a way to extend the pandemic-era moratorium on evictions in the US. She and some of her colleagues camped out on the steps of the Capitol for days \u2013 until President Joe Biden got the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a new order against evictions in areas where transmission of Covid-19 is high or substantial. \u201cNow that we have again demonstrated what grassroots movements are capable of, there is no limit to what we can do,\u201d she said. A month from now, the US will mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, orchestrated by al Qaeda\u2019s leader, Osama bin Laden.

Her boss saw Bennett\u2019s promise and promoted her after a couple of months, wrote Peter Bergen, author of a new book, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.\u201d What made Bennett particularly noteworthy was the fact that she issued the first warning about the danger posed by Bin Laden on August 21, 1993, eight years before hijackers in four planes struck the US, killing 2,977 people. \u201cBennett\u2019s report was the first time that the US government had produced a warning about the dangers of a global jihadist movement led by the mysterious multimillionaire, Osama bin Laden,\u201d Bergen wrote. \u201cAnd the warning was not issued by the CIA or the FBI, but by a junior intelligence analyst at the State Department.\u201d Bennett would eventually join the CIA, where she is a senior counterterrorism adviser. \u201cNo one in the US government has tracked al Qaeda and all its many branches and offshoots for as long and with as much distinction as Bennett has.\u201d Simone Biles ended her Olympics by winning a bronze medal, to go along with the invaluable support she gave her fellow American gymnasts, wrote Amy Bass. \u201cWith her seventh career Olympic medal around her neck, Biles has further emblazoned her name in the history books\u2026. it is conceivable that Tuesday\u2019s beam final was, indeed, her farewell to the Olympic Games.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Bociurkiw (@WorldAffairsPro) is a global affairs analyst and host of the podcast \u201cGlobal Impact.\u201d He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion and has traveled to Myanmar twice, once as a journalist in 1989 and again as part of the United Nations\u2019 humanitarian response to the 2008 Cyclone Nargis emergency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. With live fire being deployed on a widespread basis in Myanmar since a military coup on February 1, the generals who seized power have lived up to fears that they would resort to lethal force against their own citizens. Early restraint in the face of peaceful protesters has been replaced with bullets, and security forces have killed more than 50 people to date. Several victims were killed by shots to the head \u2013 a sign that the troops were shooting to kill as part of their intensifying crackdown that also has included curfews and nightly internet shutdowns, armored vehicles and armed troops on the streets and draconian laws limiting freedom of speech and assembly. Predictably, the coup and the violence against unarmed civilians triggered international condemnation, new sanctions by the US, the UK and Canada and threats of sanctions from the European Union. But statements like these have done little more than highlight just how limited the world\u2019s diplomatic arsenal is against crises of this nature \u2013 especially when most governments are battling the Covid-19 pandemic or trying to revive their sagging economies and Myanmar\u2019s military leaders seem not to care about returning their country to pariahdom. \u201cThe army in Myanmar has a long track record of not listening to the outside world, not caring what people think, simply living off, in a vicarious way, the isolation that is then imposed,\u201d Southeast Asia expert Michael Vatikiotis told me. Indeed, it is hard to see how international opprobrium or even sanctions \u2013 a blunt and controversial tool with a limited record of success \u2013 are likely to convince the generals to release the government leaders they\u2019re detaining and accept that the military lost last November\u2019s election. Nor are measures against the military likely to get backing from China and Russia, which have taken a softer line to responding to the coup. What Biden should do about China's atrocities against the Uyghurs So is there anything that could persuade the generals to back down? Myanmar is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the political bloc that probably has the most influence over the generals. So far the bloc has failed to unite behind a strong call of action, but it\u2019s high time it did. If member countries such as Thailand begin to see a flood of refugees, transforming the unrest into a regional crisis, that could force ASEAN to relax its policy of non-interference in the affairs of member states and take a strong stance against the junta \u2013 something it should do nonetheless for the sake of ASEAN\u2019s own credibility. Regional businesses perhaps could also play a role in setting a path for their cautious governments. Japanese drinks giant Kirin Holdings, for example, has already said it was cutting links with a military-owned conglomerate in Myanmar. Others could follow suit. It\u2019s not going to be easy. Myanmar\u2019s military has a well-deserved reputation for ruthlessness, something I saw at firsthand during my first visit to Myanmar in 1989. A year earlier, the government\u2019s brutal crackdown on a student-led pro-democracy movement killed thousands. I interviewed many student activists who could hardly hold themselves together when describing the mass murders. Sleep, food deprivation and physical torture were described to me as all part of the measures used to extract confessions. Shortly after I was detained for taking photographs of a marketplace, a Burmese army lieutenant colonel lectured to me: \u201cPeople need to learn discipline before they can have democracy.\u201d The military\u2019s condescending attitude toward Western institutions remains deeply entrenched. During the 2008 Cyclone Nargis emergency \u2013 which claimed nearly 140,000 lives and impacted some 2.4 million people \u2013 the then-government had the audacity to insist on vetting the list of humanitarian aid workers nominated by the UN Secretary General\u2019s office. Reports of aid being diverted by the military were widespread, and those reporting the scale of the disaster were arrested. The world's largest protests you've probably never heard of Nonetheless, there are some differences this time around.  The latest coup may well have been inspired by the success of the Thai military seizing power over their shared border in 2014, but the generals seem to have underestimated the level of resistance, especially a civil disobedience movement that has paralyzed huge swaths of the public and private sectors. What is markedly different about those resisting this military crackdown is that the overall population is much younger, has lived through many years of unprecedented political freedom and is hyper-connected via social media. An indication of their savviness is a deliberate effort to appeal to the international community with multilingual signs and protest slogans, such as the enormous \u201cF**k the Coup\u201d slogan painted onto a main urban thoroughfare. An endless stream of powerful images of protesters dressed as beauty queens and as shirtless bodybuilders and even captivating music videos have been shared with global television and social media audiences. Through hashtags such as #milkteaalliance and #whatshappeninginmyanmar protesters have maintained solidarity and shared outrage with other youth-led movements in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand. These actions should at least keep the issue high on global social media feeds and make it hard for regional governments to ignore. In the end, Myanmar\u2019s fate could all come down to who can dig in longer. The generals may already be desperate for cash \u2013 the US blocked their attempt to try to remove about $1 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shortly after the coup \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear how long they can endure a prolonged stalling of the economy, especially if it starts to impact the many foreign joint ventures that are linked to the military.  But with the economy already faltering before the coup it also remains to be seen how long the people can survive at the barricades in the face of increasing military brutality and without a steady income. If the generals get their way, the number of people living under military rule, together with those in Thailand, in that corner of Southeast Asia will almost double to about 124 million people. That is a prospect ASEAN, and the broader international community, must prevent at all costs.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jared Genser is an international human rights lawyer who previously served as pro bono counsel to Aung San Suu Kyi between 2006-2010. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. In a precision operation early Monday, Myanmar\u2019s armed forces chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing summarily deposed the country\u2019s government, arresting state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and dozens of other key officials. The military blocked roads in the capital Naypyidaw and Rangoon, disrupted television, telephone and internet service and imposed a curfew. Later, it declared a one-year state of emergency, claiming it would then hold new elections and hand over power to the winner. The coup was staged hours before the country\u2019s Parliament was set to meet for its first session since Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won a landslide 83% of the seats in elections last November. The Parliament was expected to approve the election results and install the next government. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. In late 2010, Myanmar\u2019s military junta began opening to the outside world by releasing then democracy icon Suu Kyi, who had spent some 15 years under house arrest. Five years later, the country held its first democratic elections in 25 years and her party won a historic majority. Despite the military controlling all matters of defense and security, it permitted the transfer to civilian rule, and the world cheered the transition from autocracy to democracy for this southeast Asian nation of some 57 million. Yet it was never that simple. In reality, the country\u2019s Constitution had been written by the junta to maintain its grip on power. The military clearly never had any intention of allowing Myanmar, also known as Burma, to evolve from a country dominated by the 65% of the population who are Bamar \u2013 the vast majority of whom are Buddhists \u2013  to one that is multiethnic and multireligious and protects minority rights. Myanmar's military has detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a coup. Here's what you need to know Nowhere was this clearer than in western Rakhine State, where the army led a brutal campaign against the ethnic Rohingya, murdering more than 10,000, and forcing more than million to flee in what the United Nations later described as a genocide.  For her part, Suu Kyi was complicit in the commission of these atrocity crimes by her unconditional support of Myanmar\u2019s military, culminating in her stunning defense of Myanmar\u2019s generals from charges of genocide at the World Court. But looking more closely, Suu Kyi also sought other ways to avoid conflict with the military. Despite her wide parliamentary majority, laws that restricted free speech and assembly were never abolished. She defended the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists who reported on the military\u2019s persecution of the Rohingya. She took no action to help three ethnic Kachin activists found guilty and sentenced to prison for defaming the military. And she did nothing to disrupt the incredibly profitable business activities of the military owned conglomerates. It had been the conventional wisdom, until now, that Suu Kyi\u2019s support meant the military had no need to conduct a coup. What observers seriously miscalculated, however, was the raw personal ambition of Min Aung Hlaing. Facing mandatory retirement in a few months, with no route to a civilian leadership role, and amid global calls for him to face criminal charges in The Hague, he was cornered. Biden administration debating whether to call military takeover in Myanmar a 'coup' After getting only 7% of the available seats \u2013 33 of 476 \u2013 in the November parliamentary election, the military alleged widespread fraud. Last week, Min Aung Hlaing argued to senior officers in a speech that the Constitution could be revoked if the country\u2019s election laws weren\u2019t being enforced. On January 28, Myanmar\u2019s election commission formally rejected the allegations of fraud and The New York Times reported that representatives of Min Aung Hlaing sent Suu Kyi a letter \u201cordering a recount and delay in the Parliament or else.\u201d Over the weekend, the military vowed to \u201ctake action,\u201d which then led to the coup. To his credit, US President Joe Biden just designated the military takeover to be a coup d\u2019etat, requiring most military and foreign assistance to be cut. But much more needs to be done. First, the US should work multilaterally to build support for advancing a global arms embargo and the referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. If the US can build wide support for these actions, it will be much more difficult politically for China or Russia to veto these proposals at the UN Security Council. Second, the US should also immediately sanction Myanmar Economic Corporation and Myanmar Economic Holdings, the two massive military controlled conglomerates that usually through international joint ventures own and run well over 100 companies that work in construction, manufacturing, telecommunications, insurance, banking, gem extraction and tourism sectors. Such a targeted approach would immediately start to limit the military\u2019s ability to generate its own financial support.  And third, the international community should redirect funds that were being spent on helping the government with political and economic reforms to provide support for nongovernmental organizations that can offer humanitarian assistance across the border to the estimated 200,000 internally displaced persons who have fled the human rights abuses of the military as well as to the some 1 million Myanmar refugees in neighboring countries. That said, there should be no illusions about the challenges ahead. Min Aung Hlaing is firmly in control of the Burmese military. He can be expected to pivot Myanmar rapidly to China, which has $21.5 billion in foreign capital and more than a third of all Myanmar\u2019s trade. But the real unpredictable variable is how the Burmese people, who will overwhelmingly oppose the coup, will respond. If they go to the streets together as they have before, they could force the military back to the barracks. Whatever happens, we, in turn, must stand with them.",

View more opinion on CNN. Dear Donald, When we first met in 2014, I was a year into research for the biography I was writing about you. I knew about your stern father, your exile to military school at a tender age and your tendency to spin dramatic fantasies. I knew that you considered life a battle for survival and humans to be \u201cvicious\u201d by nature. In your Trump Tower stronghold, you were attended by aides who looked like soap opera stars and surrounded by ego-boosting emblems: a wall of framed magazine covers, each featuring your face; a boxer\u2019s championship belt given to settle a debt; a stack of clippings delivered with a note that read, \u201cDad, FYI \u2013 All great press. Ivanka.\u201d These totems of greatness, which I haven\u2019t seen in the quarters of other super-rich Americans, made me think of you as desperately, and perhaps dangerously, insecure. In five interviews that lasted about 10 hours total, you would heighten my fear that despite a life spent in unending luxury and privilege, no amount of wealth and power would move you off the life-is-warfare view. Even worse, you told me that you might run for president because Twitter fans said you should (I wasn\u2019t surprised by your ambition and, given your celebrity, I thought you might win). Then, as we stood to inspect a framed letter you had received from the disgraced Richard Nixon, you said his only problem was that he had left office for the good of the country. In your view, he should have stayed and fought. What motivated the Capitol rioters You ran for president and you won. And as you visited upon the country more pain than Nixon ever did, you fought on. Unrelenting in your aggression, lies and cruelty, you presided over four years of chaos and conflict provoked by your words and deeds. Though impeached, you escaped conviction and stayed in office to redouble your commitment to ego-driven chaos. As you refused to mount a serious federal response, the Covid-19 death toll surpassed 400,000. Defeated in your bid for reelection, you spun lies that created an alternative reality so powerful that  hundreds of your followers formed a mob that carried out a bloody attack on the United States Capitol. Many there intended to overturn the election, which you had repeatedly claimed was invalid due to fraud that in fact had not occurred. In the attack, which was televised by news networks and livestreamed on social media, five people \u2013 including one Capitol police officer \u2013 would die.  A DC Metro Police officer, who had been Tasered several times, heard one of your followers say, \u201cKill him with his own gun.\u201d Although Congress reconvened after the mob was driven out, you stand disgraced as the only president in US history to be impeached twice, and all I can think is that you had finally made your narcissistic nightmare of a constant battle against vicious enemies come true for us all. Your dangerous narcissism was not widely noted when I interviewed you, but it seemed, to me, to be the hallmark of your personality. I consulted experts and learned that this grandiosity was likely a defense mechanism against a fear of shame and rejection. I came to believe this fear was installed by your father, who, when you were a child, demanded you be a \u201ckiller\u201d and a \u201cking.\u201d When you failed to meet his expectations and became a troublemaker, he exiled you to military school, at age 13. Talk about a scarring experience. The title of my book, \u201cNever Enough,\u201d pointed to your endless drive to prove your superiority, which, ironically, led to bankruptcies, divorces and legal defeats. It\u2019s likely these failures provoked the same sense of shame and humiliation that you must have felt as a rejected child. You once told me you hated to reflect on the past, but in refusing to do this, you were bound to repeat your mistakes. No matter how much you achieved, it was never enough. And so, you went too far. (For more on this see what your psychologist niece, Mary Trump, wrote in her 2020 book, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man.\u201d) As President, your weaknesses posed terrible threats to the country. Your many failures at running businesses such as casinos or the airline Trump Shuttle showed that you were not a nimble thinker capable of leading complex operations. The Covid-19 pandemic has only made this glaring incompetence crystal clear \u2013 and despite your efforts to deflect the blame, the country\u2019s death toll speaks for itself. More than 400,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States \u2013 more than any other country in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. Having seen your inability to recognize others as human beings, I have not been shocked by your indifference to the deaths of your fellow citizens. Nor have I been surprised by your encouragement of violence. Violence was what I always expected from your presidency. I just didn\u2019t know what form it would take. The power of your methods was obvious during your 2016 campaign, when you lied in a way that separated your most ardent followers from reality itself.  You promoted many of your old conspiracy theories about 9/11 and climate change and added new ones on the fly. (When an attendee asked \u2013 after first stating as fact that Obama was Muslim and not American \u2013 about the wildly untrue idea that Muslims were running secret training camps in the United States to kill people, you refused to shoot down his claims, promising instead to \u201clook at that.\u201d You also whipped people into a frenzy of hatred by describing opponents, critics and the free press as enemies. I recalled reading how your first wife, Ivana, had said you kept a book of Hitler\u2019s speeches near your bed. You once corrected a reporter, telling her it was \u201cMein Kampf\u201d instead (though Marty Davis, who gave Trump the book, told Vanity Fair it was a book of speeches). For four years in office, you functioned as a kind of anti-President, inflaming rather than calming passions and attacking rather than negotiating, all while demanding adoration from your Cabinet and constant attention from the media. Having ordered aides to think of each day as an episode in a TV show before you even took office, you tried to gin up as much drama as possible. As President, you used the authority of your office to spread baseless claims about voter fraud, former President Barack Obama and even of a friendship between former President Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sexual predator who was your Palm Beach neighbor and friend, to name a few. Many of your followers abandoned reason and dove headfirst into the QAnon conspiracy theory movement, which reveres you as a savior and regards the government and much of the news media as evil. Many of those who attacked the Capitol brandished Q symbols along with Trump flags, Jesus banners and the Confederate stars and bars \u2013 a mix of powerful symbols that shows the breadth of your influence. Before the attack, you were among many who called for a big crowd of protesters to stop the Congress from affirming your election defeat. After your lawyer Rudy Giuliani, your namesake son ginned up the crowd, and they heard you call for them to march on the Capitol. \u201cYou have to show strength,\u201d you said, \u201cand you have to be strong.\u201d  You promised to go with them but chose instead to view the destruction on TV. I wondered if you understood that the violence that unfolded was real, and not something made for television. Did you order Cokes as you watched? Did you eat popcorn? I can imagine you snacking because you have played with violence, both real and imagined, for so long that you must be inured you to it. It all started back in the 1970s when you began employing armed guards-chauffeurs, for no apparent reason. I think it was because you enjoyed the sense of menace they added to your presence. During your 2016 campaign one of your security guards roughed-up a picketer outside Trump Tower in New York, while another physically forced reporter Jorge Ramos out of a news conference in 2015. At one rally you told followers, \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them.\u201d  When a loud protester disrupted one of your other campaign rallies, you said, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d Your tough guy image was embraced by followers who traded memes in which you were drawn to look like a superhero or shown brandishing weapons Rambo-style. Your avatar punched out a figure labeled with the CNN logo. Add this to the bigotry you expressed in words and images, which you shared with millions of people on Twitter, and a combustible mix was created. (Remember posting an image of Hillary Clinton, along with a Star of David set against dollar bills, brandishing her the \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever?\u201d). The atmosphere of bigotry you helped create exploded in Charlottesville in 2017 as men chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d before a White supremacist murdered a counterprotester by running her down with his car. Why America still can't face up to Trump's racism Heather Heyer was one of the first civilians to die in this charged political context during your presidency. It did not change your behavior. Instead, you declared there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d By delaying your condemnation of her attackers and resisting efforts to remove monuments to those who fought against the United States to preserve slavery, you sent clear signals about your views on race and violence. With Charlottesville, questions about your bigotry grew louder. You made your stance clear when you reportedly said Haitian immigrants \u201call have AIDS\u201d (though the White House denied it), and that people were entering the US from \u201cshithole\u201d countries. Add your vicious comments about Black athletes calling out police brutality, your penchant for slamming individual Black women, and your fearmongering about low-income housing, and everyone understood your perspective. Three years into your presidency, 65% of Black Americans said it\u2019s \u201ca bad time to be a Black person\u201d in the United States, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll. It would have been bad enough if your bigotry had been confined to words, but you enshrined it in policy by restricting refugees from entering this country. This led to a sharp decline, from about 85,000 refugees admitted to the United States in 2016 to about 12,000 in 2020. If the \u201chuddled masses yearning to breathe free\u201d didn\u2019t get the message, then they could consider the way you cozied up to strongmen, the likes of which many of them were fleeing. From Kim Jong Un of North Korea to Russian President Vladimir Putin, you showed a consistent admiration for dictators who jail and kill their critics. Along our border with Mexico, you began separating children from parents who arrived seeking asylum. By May 2019, six children had died in federal custody. In June of that year, Americans were shocked by the photo of a father and child who had drowned attempting to cross the Rio Grande. In December, a surveillance video obtained by ProPublica showed a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy was left alone in his Border Patrol cell in Texas for hours before he died on the floor, of complications from the flu. 'Be careful what you wish for:' Trump to Biden over 25th Amendment How many minors died in Border Patrol custody during the four years prior to your administration? Zero, per FactCheck.org. The deaths were just one measure of the suffering your harsh policies inflicted on asylum-seeking families. New data from June 2019 reveals there were around 5,500 known cases of children, from infants to teens, being separated from their parents and placed in facilities ranging from foster family homes to cells made out of chain link fencing. Amid all this pain, it seemed you still weren\u2019t satisfied. You asked about building anti-immigrant moats to be stocked with alligators. You wondered whether soldiers could shoot immigrants who threw rocks. Those ideas were nixed, but the crisis continues. Because of inept recording-keeping, your administration has not been able locate the parents of at least 545 children, according to court documents from last October. Refugee families, stuck in limbo while waiting for asylum in the United States, are still filling squalid camps on the Mexican side of the border, many of them fearing for their lives \u2013 particularly in the midst of a global pandemic. You got away with cruelty in part because you conditioned many Americans to believe that brown-skinned, undocumented immigrants constituted a criminal horde that required a draconian response. You promised to build a \u201cbeautiful\u201d concrete border wall along 1,000 miles of the frontier and force Mexico to pay for it. Only about 452 miles of tall steel fence has been completed as of January 5, 2021, according to a Customs and Border Patrol Report, and instead of the $8 billion you estimated for 1,000 miles, $18 billion dollars have already been devoted to the work because \u2013 surprise! \u2013 Mexico is not paying for it. Hyping the wall was just one example of the exaggerations, false claims and lies that came out of your mouth in such a torrent it was nearly impossible for anyone to react properly. You combined this strategy with denigrating the media as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d with such consistency that facts seemed to lose their power. You added an Orwellian flourish when you said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d What has been the effect on journalists? Threats became a part of our daily lives and the lives of our family members. (One of your followers found my wife\u2019s business phone number and called to say that he had located our address and to suggest we be careful.) A \u201cpress freedom tracker\u201d run by the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Freedom of the Press Foundation has counted 421 attacks on journalists during your time in office. Far worse than the impact on journalists is your effect on Americans\u2019 ability to agree upon an established set of facts as they consider critical issues. You are not solely to blame for this problem. However, you have both contributed to it and exploited it. You have made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims, according to The Washington Post, which have landed with the authority that comes with the presidential seal. Trump critics take risk for good reason The easy way out for someone mired in disinformation is to pick a person to believe and go all in. Many of those who doubled down on their support for you found a sense of belonging amid the slogans, regalia and fervent rallies. They felt they were right. Those who disagreed were not fellow citizens but enemies who, some concluded, should be defeated by violent means. The loyalty of your followers meant that ordinary politicians feared provoking the ire of your base. When it came to light that you were trying to coerce Ukraine\u2019s President into helping your reelection effort, you were impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But this fear helped keep the Republican-controlled Senate in line, and you were acquitted. Afterward, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine defended her vote to acquit you, saying you had learned \u201ca big lesson.\u201d What you learned, it seemed, was that you could get away with anything. Even before you were elected, you claimed you could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,\u201d and not lose voters. Shortly after the impeachment trial wrapped up, you proceeded to mislead the American people about the novel coronavirus. You downplayed the dangers of the virus so that the vibrant economy, the main bragging point of your presidency, would continue to hum. In late February, at a White House coronavirus task force briefing, you said \u201cIt\u2019s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for.\u201d But you told journalist Bob Woodward weeks before that the coronavirus was \u201cmore deadly than your \u2013 you know, your, even your strenuous flus.\u201d Nevertheless, you declined to organize a true national response and undermined public health officials who urged everyone to wear face masks. You also held mass rallies where people were infected. On May 8, when the death toll was more than 77,000, you continued this charade, insisting, \u201cThis is going to go away without a vaccine.\u201d To say that people died as a result of your posture is not mere speculation. Families have told stories of those who followed your lead, got sick and died. Harvard epidemiologists estimate that thousands have died as a result of your example. Today the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage the country. The death toll is now roughly equivalent to a 9/11 each day \u2013 but many of your acolytes, even in Congress, still refuse to protect themselves and others with facemasks. Meanwhile, millions are turning to food banks. Mass evictions loom. When I consider the hungry, the infected, the traumatized and the deceased and hold in my mind the images of the deadly mob at the Capitol, I hear your voice summoning the worst in my fellow citizens. With those words you truly established yourself as the anti-President, a distinction that cancels any claim you might make to the respect normally accorded the office. When we met you told me to call you \u201cDon,\u201d as if we were friends. You also invited me to examine your hair. I didn\u2019t do either because I sensed that you wanted to establish a bond that you would eventually try to corrupt. This was confirmed when you hinted that my book could make me rich if I abandoned my professional duty and wrote it to your liking.  Thankfully, enough Americans recognized your immorality and incompetence and lack of human feeling so profound that the suffering and death so much a part of your presidency didn\u2019t appear to affect you at all. They chose Joe Biden in November, making you truly accountable for perhaps the first time in your life. After four years of your chaos, what\u2019s left is a wounded country grieving for its dead and for its innocence. But we will recover, and you now face criminal and legal threats in state courts, along with the harsh judgment of history. As you desperately summon the remains of your following for comfort and fundraising, your disgrace is growing with the mounting evidence that your words motivated the mob that attacked the United States Capitol. This incitement may be the single worst thing a president has ever done, and it will define you for centuries to come.",

            "article_content": "On January 6, the world watched as the US Capitol was attacked by pro-Trump rioters. Since then, each day has been filled with revelations about how it was plotted and carried out. Many are still trying to process the initial shock. While seeing Confederate and Trump 2020 flags draped all over the Capitol was a shocking sight for some, others were not surprised. \u201cIt was simply the culmination of the past four years under Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d said librarian Djaz Zulida. Zulida is a job information resource librarian for the Brooklyn Public Library system. Soon after the riot, the library set out to compile books that would help put this insurrection into perspective. \u201cWhile a book list is not the end all, be all as far as resources, this felt like a place where we could begin, a place where we could encourage a conversation, and to filter out some of the noise and give people a little bit of a framework, focusing on a number of different issues,\u201d Zulida said. Zulida combed through the library\u2019s resources and learned that the library could use more books that discuss the 25th Amendment, which lays out a process for orderly transition of power in the case of death, disability, or resignation of the President. They included \u201cBirch Bayh: Making a Difference,\u201d a book about the man that authored the amendment. \u201cI assumed, of course, that the amendments are written by politicians,\u201d Zulida said. \u201cBut I had no idea that there was one person so specifically, wrapped up in the details of putting together the language and the idea and turning that into a constitutional amendment.\u201d This is the list of more 30 books they compiled and a description of the book\u2019s relevance to the subject. \u201cStupid Wars: A Citizen\u2019s Guide to Botched Putsches, Failed Coups, Inane Invasions, and Ridiculous Revolutions\u201d by Ed Strosser and Michael Prince A humorous look at epic fails in historical upheavals, putsches, and coups.

            "article_content": "What happened to the alt-right after Charlottesville could be a guide for what happens to QAnon and the mob that stormed the US Capitol last week. The alt-right was a version of white supremacy that attracted a much younger crowd through the internet, and it aimed to work within mainstream politics to advance racism. And for a moment, it seemed like it was working \u2013 that the movement was moving from the internet to real life. But after the Unite the Right rally in 2017, their efforts were slowly crushed. By mid-2018, its leaders told me they could no longer hold public rallies that were announced in advance. Many groups disbanded because of infighting, or because their internal communications were infiltrated by anti-fascists, or because their leader was humiliated in scandal. A longtime troll told me last month that talking about current events in that world was considered \u201ccringe,\u201d meaning embarrassing. White nationalism still exists. The Department of Homeland Security says it is the greatest terror threat in the United States. But it is not spreading through the movement that called itself the alt-right. This happened because the alt-right was hammered on three fronts \u2013 social, financial and legal. It\u2019s important to understand how these three elements worked together, because there are early signs the same pattern is happening with the Trump movement and the QAnon conspiracy theory. It\u2019s hard to remember now, but before Charlottesville, the term \u201calt-right\u201d was in flux, claimed by both neo-Nazis and not-explicitly-racist conservatives. To take one prominent example, in 2016, when he was running the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon infamously said his Breitbart News website was \u201cthe platform for the alt-right.\u201d After Charlottesville, the term \u201calt-right\u201d was poison. Only days later, Bannon said, \u201cEthno-nationalism \u2013 it\u2019s losers,\u201d and, \u201cWe gotta help crush it.\u201d The blowback came in three parts. First, the social. Many attendees who showed their faces in Charlottesville were doxxed, meaning that identifying information such as the protesters\u2019 names, locations and employers were posted online. They were shamed in local media and many were fired from their jobs. Twitter users are outing Charlottesville demonstrators Those in the alt-right who weren\u2019t doxxed lived in paralyzing fear of it, they\u2019ve told me. Life became very difficult for the movement\u2019s footsoldiers. As their faces circulated on social media, they lost their own accounts. White power advocates were kicked of Twitter, Facebook, etc. Alternative social media sites like Gab popped up. But some complained to me that using Gab was pointless. Elliot Kline, then head of the now-defunct group Identity Evropa, told me there were no journalists on Gab. They couldn\u2019t use it to spread their message outside the echo chamber. This was the aftereffect of Charlottesville that most Americans could see best, but it wasn\u2019t the most important. The second part was the money. They lost the power to raise it. Fundraising sites such as Patreon and GoFundMe kicked them off. White power programmers tried to make their own versions \u2013 Hatreon, GoyFundMe \u2013 but that didn\u2019t work, because then payment processors dropped them. The civil rights advocacy group Color of Change had been pressuring financial services companies to stop processing the payments of White nationalists well before Charlottesville. Color of Change president Rashad Robinson told CNN that at the time, he thought it was absurd that it was so easy to give White nationalists money. \u201cWe started going to the credit card companies and processors, and they\u2019d say you have to go to the banks. The banks would say you have to go to the credit card companies,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cA lot of enabling happens because people in powerful positions are not seeing this as a threat against them and their families,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey could make intellectual arguments about slippery slopes, but what they were doing was creating an out so they didn\u2019t have to make hard decisions \u2013 decisions that should not have been hard in the first place.\u201d PayPal was the only company that worked well with Color of Change to cut off White power groups, Robinson said. \u201cAnd then Charlottesville happened.\u201d \u201cMagically they could do something they couldn\u2019t do before \u2013 and no law had changed.\u201d In the fall of 2018, Chris Cantwell, who I\u2019d interviewed in the Vice documentary about Charlottesville, told me he\u2019d been dropped by nearly every payment processor. He complained he could still get money through Bitcoin \u2013 but few people used it, and it had no mechanism for recurring payments. At one point, alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer told me he could get money only through paper checks. Matthew Heimbach, who ran the now-disbanded Traditionalist Worker Party, has quit the White power movement. But this summer he told me that non-profit groups that transition people out of extremism didn\u2019t have much to offer him. He said they told him they could pay for his extremist tattoo to be removed, and get him on cable TV. He didn\u2019t need that, he said. What he needed was a good job \u2013 to support his family, and to pay for a lawyer. His past limited his options. The social and the financial repercussions combined to worsen the effects of the third piece of the backlash: the legal. Those who committed crimes on camera were often prosecuted. James Alex Fields Jr., who drove his car into a crowd in Charlottesville, killing Heather Heyer, was sentenced to life in prison. Cantwell was prosecuted for macing people in a confrontation with anti-fascists at the end of a torch march. He pleaded guilty to two assault charges involving pepper spray and was required to leave the state of Virginia. (In a sign of how the pressure has caused the White power movement to eat itself, in September, Cantwell was found guilty of extortion. Cantwell had threatened a White supremacist that he\u2019d rape his wife unless the man gave Cantwell the personal information of a third White supremacist whom Cantwell was angry with.) Perhaps most devastating, many of Charlottesville\u2019s major White power figures were named in a federal civil lawsuit, Sines v. Kessler, filed in October 2017. The plaintiffs\u2019 legal team is headed by Roberta Kaplan, who successfully argued at the Supreme Court to end the ban on gay marriage. The alt-right defendants have not been able to find legal representation with a comparable resume. In fact, they\u2019ve struggled to find lawyers at all. Six of the remaining 18 defendants, including Richard Spencer, are now representing themselves in court. In a hearing this spring, Spencer\u2019s lawyer asked to withdraw from the case because Spencer hadn\u2019t paid him. Spencer told the judge the case had been \u201cfinancially crippling.\u201d The judge allowed the lawyer to quit. The trial is scheduled for April, but it may be pushed to October because of the coronavirus pandemic. CNN's Elle Reeve: 'Donald Trump plus the internet brings extremism to the masses' Will QAnon and the pro-Trump mob face something similar? There are early signs the answer is yes. Activists and law enforcement are working together to find the identities of people pictured inside the Capitol. As photos of their faces circulate on social media, rioters are facing consequences at home. A Maryland man seen entering the Capitol wearing his work ID on a lanyard has been fired. Many of his comrades have also lost their jobs. The FBI has posted photos of rioters, seeking information. One of them is a man who described fighting with police in an interview with CNN in which he shouted, \u201cWhat are we supposed to do?\u201d Thousands of QAnon accounts have been removed from social media. They\u2019ve tried migrating to Parler, but Amazon stopped providing services to Parler, effectively kicking it off the public internet. Apple and Google removed it from their app stores. On eBay, sellers are trying to take advantage of less tech-savvy Trump fans, offering mobile phones with Parler already installed for more than $1,000. President Donald Trump has been kicked off Twitter and Facebook. Sunday night, the payment processor Stripe booted the Trump campaign. Monday, Signature Bank said it would close Trump\u2019s personal accounts. Deutsche Bank, which has been a major source of loans to Trump\u2019s businesses, announced it will no longer do business with him. A wave of other businesses are dropping the President. Major companies are suspending political donations to Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election results. Trump is certainly in a stronger position, in terms of power and money, than even the most affluent marchers in Charlottesville. But that also means he has more to lose. Especially legally.",

            "article_content": "A Washington, DC, church unveiled a massive Black Lives Matter banner Wednesday morning to take a stand against violence just hours before a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol. The National City Christian Church erected the 16-foot banner ahead of protests over Congress certifying the election for President-elect Joe Biden. \u201cAs followers of Jesus Christ, we reject the president\u2019s call to violence and continue to proclaim that Black Lives Matter,\u201d the church\u2019s interim senior minister, Rev. Dr. Amy Butler, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe oppose the ideals of white supremacy and white Christian nationalism, and declare that our church will continue to be a place of peace and healing.\u201d The church staff left the church and the city following the direction of Mayor Muriel Bowser, who asked people to avoid the downtown area, Rev. Butler said in a video Wednesday. \u201cThe National Guard and D.C. police are here and are watching National City very closely and are very serious about protecting the church so we\u2019re grateful for that and grateful for the witness that this church is making this moment,\u201d Butler said in the video. Previous pro-Trump protests in the city resulted in some places of worship being vandalized and their Black Lives Matter signs stolen and even burned. Two historic Black churches, Asbury United Methodist Church and Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, were  affected. Protesters ripped and set fire to BLM signs at two DC churches The leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \u201cEnrique\u201d Tarrio, was arrested Monday in Washington, DC, for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally. The sign burning came during a protest in Washington that saw at least four people stabbed and at least 33 arrested. Large groups of protesters and counter-protesters had gathered earlier in the day outside the Supreme Court building and at Freedom Plaza to protest the presidential election results. National City Christian Church\u2019s Black Lives Matter banner was ripped from the fence of its outdoor chapel during a previous protest, the church said. \u201cWith thousands of President Donald J. Trump supporters and self-proclaimed white nationalists descending on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital, National City Christian Church will once again, as has been its long-storied history, stand boldly for the civil rights and freedoms of black and brown American people,\u201d the church said in the statement. The banners replaced ones showing a poem from South Carolina Poet Laureate Marjory Wentworth. \u201cOne Hundred Thousand Names\u201d was written to express the grief of the people lost due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The church is the national church for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Tuesday was a big day for elections. For many people, the day was also tense, unsettling. All across the country \u2013 from Seattle to New York City to Minneapolis to Boston to Atlanta, from Virginia to New Jersey \u2013 voters flocked to the polls to cast ballots. The outcomes of some of these contests will likely have important consequences for the way the US grapples with racial discrimination. A variety of big-ticket issues took center stage in the elections: policing, the coronavirus, affordable housing, the climate crisis, spikes in violent crime. In Minneapolis, voters rejected a policing overhaul measure created following the police murder of George Floyd. Minneapolis City Councilmember Phillipe Cunningham, who championed a similar ballot initiative, referred to the result as \u201creally unfortunate\u201d and \u201ca clear backlash to progress in our city.\u201d Meanwhile, Republican Glenn Youngkin narrowly won Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election. He centered his campaign on education policy, specifically the right-wing racial panic over critical race theory \u2013 or at least, what conservatives call critical race theory, since what they\u2019re actually railing against is a deliberately vague and incoherent assortment of things they don\u2019t like: Black Lives Matter, diversity, reparations. The success of this strategy showed the enduring power of White identity politics. Here\u2019s a closer look at the stakes of four of Tuesday\u2019s races: Winner: Glenn Youngkin, a Republican Why you should care: The race for Virginia\u2019s highest office was the most closely watched election on Tuesday. For Democrats \u2013 and, really, for anyone concerned about the racial panic that\u2019s swept the Republican Party \u2013 the night was a disaster. Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin prevailed over his rival, former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Youngkin animated his campaign around one issue above all else: education policy. In particular: critical race theory, a decades-old legal movement that the Republican agitprop apparatus has turned into a bogeyman to scare voters and censor discussions about race and racism, including in the state that was the home of \u201cmassive resistance.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no place for critical race theory in our school system, and why, on day one, I\u2019m going to ban it,\u201d Youngkin promised last weekend, leaving unmentioned that CRT isn\u2019t part of the state\u2019s classroom teaching. What to make of Youngkin\u2019s performance? It\u2019s crucial not to over-interpret the election, or to draw too many conclusions about what it might mean for the rest of the country. After all, the White House\u2019s party has lost every Virginia gubernatorial race since the 1970s except for one: the 2013 race that McAuliffe won. Still, the contest suggested not only that the Democratic Party might be in a bad place right now but also that the tactic of embracing White identity politics can work. \u201cThe Long Southern Strategy on full display in #VirginiaElection,\u201d the University of Arkansas professor Angie Maxwell noted on Twitter. \u201cWeaponized colorblindness via anti-CRT infused w/ Christian nationalism, anti-feminism, & using old methods of positive polarization, co-opted lang., white victimization, grievance politics, w/ manufactured urgency.\u201d Republican candidates seem to have a convincing template for how to run in 2022. Likely winner: Incumbent Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey Why you should care: Maybe more than anything else, the Minneapolis mayoral race was a referendum on policing and public safety in the city. And with good reason: Minneapolis was the site of the 2020 police murder of George Floyd. Minneapolis officials have said that Jacob Frey won the contest based on unofficial results. But a number of more progressive voters and activists worry about what his reelection might mean for the city\u2019s handling of policing. Frey twice tried to keep off the ballot a question allowing voters to decide whether to remove the Police Department from the city\u2019s charter and create a Department of Public Safety, under which officers would be organized. On Tuesday, voters rejected the move for police reform, a result that Minneapolis City Councilmember Phillipe Cunningham called \u201creally unfortunate\u201d and \u201ca clear backlash to progress in our city.\u201d And last year when the Minneapolis City Council unanimously approved a plan to dismantle the Police Department, Frey opposed the effort. This isn\u2019t to suggest that nothing has happened on the policing front since Frey entered office in 2018. During his first term, Minneapolis increased the use of police body cameras; following Floyd\u2019s killing, the city banned police chokeholds and neck restraints, which officers disproportionately use against Black Americans. Even so, the deeper source of unease is that Frey, who enjoys executive oversight over the Police Department, hasn\u2019t done enough to reform policing, and it\u2019s uncertain whether he\u2019ll do anything meaningfully different during his second term. Frey is aware of this concern, and that calming it won\u2019t be easy. \u201cThere is not a mayor in this country that is happy with the pace of change, including me,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cThere\u2019s so much incentive to spout off a magic wand fix that doesn\u2019t exist. These are issues that are systemic and can\u2019t be solved with a hashtag or a catchphrase or even a single policy because the causes are so deeply rooted. \u2026 It takes work and time.\u201d Winner: Michelle Wu, a Democrat Why you should care: Until Michelle Wu, the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, won Boston\u2019s mayoral race, the city had for two centuries elected only White men to the position. Compared with her moderate rival Annissa Essaibi George, Wu is a dyed-in-the-wool progressive. Her promises are many, and noble: shrink the power of the police union, redirect nonviolent 911 calls to alternative response teams, make public transportation more accessible (\u201cFree the T\u201d), bring back a form of rent control (not an uncontroversial goal), help families traverse the byzantine Boston Public Schools system. It\u2019s no surprise that Wu is decidedly on the political left. After all, she\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who taught Wu at Harvard Law School and was one of the most progressive candidates in the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field. Yet it\u2019s this lefty vision that makes some critics think that Wu is chasing will-o\u2019-the-wisps. \u201cMichelle talks, day in and day out, about things that are not real,\u201d Essaibi George told The New York Times in the run-up to the election. \u201cMy style is to be accurate in the things I say out loud, and to make promises I can truly keep.\u201d Still, there are a number of goals that Wu can reasonably achieve. One of them: injecting transparency into police union contracts, a move that could go a long way toward repairing the frayed relationship between the police and the marginalized communities they serve. \u201cSince the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, citizens have become far more aware of how seemingly arcane details in union contracts can protect abusive officers and hinder accountability,\u201d The Boston Globe noted in its endorsement of Wu. If there\u2019s anyone who can make good on the promise of police reform and address the many other issues beleaguering Boston, it may very well be Wu. Winner: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a Democrat Why you should care: Eric Adams, a retired former captain in the New York Police Department, will be New York City\u2019s second Black mayor (following the late David Dinkins, who was in office from 1990 to 1993). Among other things, Adams has vowed to address rising violent crime and reform the police department \u2013 two aims that appear to be at odds with each other. But Adams has long embraced his status as an inscrutable figure. \u201cPeople want to classify me, but because I\u2019m complicated, it\u2019s difficult to put me in a box,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg earlier this year. \u201cI support closing Rikers (Island jail) but also support closing the pipeline that feeds Rikers.\u201d Adams insists that he\u2019s uniquely capable of pulling off this balancing act. He often points out that he\u2019s challenged racism in the NYPD for decades, including when he was an officer. What\u2019s more, Adams believes that his career as a cop has given him insight into how the police undermine civilian leaders. \u201cThe police department would run rings around (the other candidates). They are masters. If you\u2019re a good mayor, you\u2019re only here for eight years. I\u2019ve been here for 30-something years in the department. Police departments will wait you out,\u201d Adams told Krieg. \u201cAnd they know that whatever you hand down, they have to implement. But if you know the system, if you know the crevices, you know how to go and ensure you\u2019re getting what you want.\u201d Even so, many people question whether Adams will be able to achieve some of his loftier ambitions. For one, this isn\u2019t the first time that someone has promised to reform the NYPD and introduce a new approach to policing, an approach that isn\u2019t a menace to Black Americans and other people of color. For another, Adams was, well, a cop. \u201cPeople assume that Black mayors are super progressive, even if they\u2019re not,\u201d Andrea Benjamin, an associate professor of African American studies at the University of Oklahoma, recently told Governing. \u201cThey elected a Black cop. There\u2019s not going to be police reform.\u201d New Yorkers will have to wait and see if that prophecy comes to pass.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Friday admitted that his administration was \u201cclumsy\u201d in its handling of the deal that deprived France of billions in defense contracts. The comment came during a closely watched meeting with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in Rome, meant to repair fractured ties after a rift over an agreement to provide Australia with submarines, \u201cI was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through, honest to God,\u201d Biden said on Friday, sitting alongside Macron in the French Embassy to the Holy See. Last month, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia announced a new partnership that includes providing assistance to help Australia develop nuclear-powered submarines \u2013 a deal France says was made without its knowledge, jeopardizing an existing contract worth billions to provide Australia with diesel-powered submarines. The rift escalated to the rare point that France temporarily recalled its US ambassador, and even Biden was caught off-guard by how furious French officials became over the matter. \u201cI think what happened \u2013 to use an English phrase \u2013 what we did was clumsy,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cIt was not done with a lot of grace. I was under the impression that certain things had happened that had not happened.\u201d It was a striking admission of a foreign policy misstep for a President with decades of experience in that arena. Biden called France \u201can extremely valued partner and a power in and of itself.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s too much we have done together, suffered together, celebrated together and value together for anything to be able to break this up. We\u2019re at one of those inflection points in world history. Things are changing. Pieces of the board are moving,\u201d he added. When Macron was asked if he was satisfied that the relations with the United States had been repaired, he told reporters, \u201cWe clarified together what we had to clarify.\u201d \u201cNow what\u2019s important is to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future,\u201d he added. Macron emphasized that \u201cwhat really matters now is what we will do together in the coming weeks, the coming months, the coming years.\u201d A senior administration official who briefed reporters after the meeting said Macron did not make any additional requests of the President during the meeting. \u201cPresident Macron didn\u2019t really make any asks in this session, because we had worked through, over the course of the last few weeks, a common agenda, a blueprint, a roadmap for the work that US and France will do together going forward,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The two leaders appeared in good spirits ahead of the meeting, waving to the press and smiling before clapping each other on the shoulder as they walked inside the embassy. A statement afterward was similarly congenial. \u201c(Biden and Macron) underscore the strength of the longstanding and historic relationship between the United States and France, underpinned by our shared democratic values, economic ties, and defense and security cooperation,\u201d a joint statement from the US and France released after the meeting read. \u201c(The leaders) also reiterate a shared commitment to adapt and modernize our transatlantic alliance and partnership in light of global trends and in line with the depth of our bonds, common values, and shared interests.\u201d The highly anticipated bilateral meeting between the long-standing allies took place ahead of the Group of 20 meeting in Rome and the United Nations\u2019 subsequent climate summit in Glasgow. The bilateral follows Biden\u2019s earlier meetings on Friday with the Pope at the Vatican and with the Italian president and prime minister. The location for the meeting \u2013 on French territory in Rome \u2013 is intentional, a diplomatic source told CNN. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan had told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Rome that he expected the meeting to be \u201cconstructive and deeply substantive,\u201d and that Biden and Macron would cover a gamut of issues facing their alliance, from \u201ccounterterrorism in the Middle East to great power competition to economic, trade and technology issues.\u201d French Ambassador to the US Philippe \u00c9tienne told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer later Friday that the meeting had been \u201cforward-looking.\u201d \u201cSo the past is the past,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we have \u2013 the two countries have defined a road map, a very substantial road map to work based on this principle of close consultation and even closer consultations than we did before.\u201d Biden and Macron are expected to be in the same room for other meetings throughout the summits. In mid-September, the two leaders spoke over the phone, appearing to ease some of tensions over the submarine deal. During the 30-minute call, Biden appeared to acknowledge missteps in how his administration had approached the talks. And, importantly, a joint statement about the call noted that \u201cthe two leaders have decided to open a process of in-depth consultations, aimed at creating the conditions for ensuring confidence and proposing concrete measures toward common objectives.\u201d Friday\u2019s bilateral meeting marks an opportunity for those consultations to lead to concrete announcements, C\u00e9lia Belin, a visiting fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at The Brookings Institution, told CNN. \u201cThe meeting between the two leaders will be the occasion to make some announcements and to see whether or not \u2026 this crisis was the occasion to define \u2026 a new common agenda, or if there are sort of long, lingering issues that cannot be addressed,\u201d Belin told CNN. Sullivan told reporters on Thursday that the Biden administration feels \u201cvery good about the intensive engagement that we\u2019ve had with France over the course of the past few weeks,\u201d noting his own recent visit to Paris, the President\u2019s two calls with Macron since the submarines spat and Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s Paris trip. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to have the conversation tomorrow because the agenda really is overflowing,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThere are so many issues in which we and France come from common values, common perspectives, common interests, and need to be aligned in terms of our policy approaches.\u201d The outrage in Paris over the subs agreement was dismissed by some in Washington, and Belin wasn\u2019t convinced that the US and France see the stakes of Friday\u2019s meeting the same way. \u201cI can tell you it\u2019s highly anticipated on the French side. I wonder if it\u2019s highly anticipated on the other side,\u201d Belin said, calling the dynamic \u201ca reflection of the imbalance in a relationship.\u201d \u201cOne is the superpower. The other one is this strong middle power. But you have an imbalance. And for France, having a good relationship, or having a clear relationship, with the US \u2013 it\u2019s also a condition, for instance, for influence in Europe,\u201d she added. There have been other rifts, too, such as the surprise over the deadly and chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which involved NATO allies, such as France. Macron used the withdrawal to make the case for his larger vision for European global leadership \u2013 particularly its independence from US national security policy. During a speech from Baghdad this summer, Macron remarked: \u201cWhatever the American choice, we will maintain our presence to fight terrorism in Iraq as long as the terrorist groups continue to operate and as long as the Iraqi government asks us for this support.\u201d The meeting between the two leaders, which is clearly seeking to repair relations, comes just four months after their last summit with other world leaders in Europe, where Macron heaped praise on Biden and called him \u201cpart of the club.\u201d \u201cI think that what you demonstrate is that leadership is partnership, and we do appreciate,\u201d Macron said. And asked at the time if allies think America is back, Biden looked at Macron and said, \u201cAsk him,\u201d to which Macron replied: \u201cDefinitely.\u201d The Macron meeting is a smaller part of a larger theme playing out as Biden returns to Europe for the summits. Biden, who stepped into his presidency declaring that American diplomacy had returned following a period of Trump-led nationalism, has returned to Europe for the second time since coming into office among a more skeptical group of world leaders. Leaders attending the global summits in Europe in the coming days, such as Macron, have their own stakes. France\u2019s presidential election is in April. Macron, who is seeking reelection, is on a charm offensive with voters. In June, his party performed poorly in regional elections, which were being closely watched ahead of the presidential vote next spring. However, given the low voter turnout, political experts said it was hard to draw conclusions. France is also assuming its six-month presidency of the European Union in January \u2013 marking a test for Macron\u2019s larger vision. And with German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s imminent departure from office, Macron, if reelected, could stand to become the de facto dean of Europe. This story has been updated with additional details Friday. CNN\u2019s Shawna Mizelle, Allie Malloy, Kevin Liptak, Kaitlan Collins, Simone Bouvier and Tara John contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden must define the politics of this fall before they define him, as he seeks to re-establish the authority of an administration that often appeared overtaken by a relentless summer of challenges. The weeks following Labor Day will reveal answers that will set the stage for next year\u2019s congressional elections. They will also help decide whether Biden has the potential for a historically significant presidency or gets swamped by the crises he was elected to conquer. A crush of challenges and political battles are dominated by a pandemic Biden hoped would now be history. But the crisis is beginning to feel endless, and, as it batters national morale, is denting his political standing. The fallout from a chaotic exit from Afghanistan that encapsulated the ignominy of a US defeat is meanwhile raising questions about Biden\u2019s core promise of competency. The internal Democratic Party tussle between progressives and moderates is highlighting the huge bet of the Biden presidency: That, at a time of national crisis, voters want a multi-trillion-dollar assault on climate change and the remaking of the social safety net. Reverberations still ring from the conservative Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to block the effective eradication of a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion in Texas, which promises multiple political consequences. The House Republican Party\u2019s radical turn to pro-Donald Trump authoritarianism also underscores the deep peril still facing American democracy. Biden\u2019s critical few months will unfold with his presidency tested as never before. His approval rating dipped over a brutal August, and he often seemed obstinate and impatient at criticism of his performance. But he has the tools of a political rebound at hand. He\u2019s been underestimated almost his entire career \u2013 including during a campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination that only his close family and most loyal aides believed he could win. While all presidents endure rough patches, only the most successful pull themselves out of political slumps. History sizes up presidents based on the transformative bills they passed. So, Biden\u2019s legacy is on the line as soon as this week, as the battle resumes over a bipartisan infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion companion spending blueprint that would transform climate, social care and health care policy. Success on both will allow Biden to claim one of the most significant legacies of any Democratic president for half a century. Each bill is core to his entire political belief system in prioritizing working and middle-class Americans. They are meant to show government can still work for regular citizens and to answer contempt for Washington democracy felt by many blue-collar Americans who were wooed by Trump\u2019s populist nationalism and his skill at corralling the resentment of millions of Americans against distant elites. Biden is stoking his own populist sentiment as he calls on the most well-off to bankroll the bills with higher taxes. \u201cFor those big corporations that don\u2019t want things to change, my message is this: It\u2019s time for working families \u2013 the folks who built this country \u2013 to have their taxes cut,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201cAnd those corporate interests doing everything they can to find allies in Congress to keep that from happening, let me be \u2013 as the old expression goes \u2013 perfectly clear: I\u2019m going to take them on.\u201d Biden\u2019s ambitious social spending plan is the price progressives in the House demand for voting for the infrastructure bill to repair roads, bridges, and railroads that would honor another Biden promise \u2014 to promote political unity in bitterly divided Washington. But West Virginia moderate Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 a critical Democrat vote in the 50-50 Senate \u2013 wants to pump the brakes on the spending bill. His position could unravel the entire choreography of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda, and it highlights the knife edge between progressives and moderates on which his presidency stands. The confrontation also underscores the huge gamble Biden is taking with some of the most ambitious social engineering in decades. If he fails to lock in fundamental reforms, he could demoralize Democratic voters and decrease their turn out next year. But voters last year did not hand Democrats the clear congressional mandate that would make this a risk-free endeavor and Republicans relish the thought of a midterm election campaign targeting liberal profligacy. There are two possibilities: it\u2019s quite possible Democrats lose the House and Senate next year if they fail to pass these bills. But if Republicans are right, they might also lose control of Congress because they did so. Biden\u2019s foreign policy, as well as his domestic plans, is meant to appeal to working Americans. As critics of his mismanaged Afghan withdrawal highlighted chaos, Biden repeatedly said he was right to end a costly foreign war. He seemed to be speaking to hard-working voters whose kids bore the brunt of casualties in the wars abroad triggered by the September 11 attacks \u2013 the 20th anniversary of which the President will mark Saturday. Yet the messy withdrawal highlighted some sides of Biden\u2019s character not previously apparent during his presidency. He often lacked candor, along with empathy for Afghans. And the deaths of 13 US service personnel along and dozens of civilians in a Kabul airport suicide attack raised questions about his self-described foreign policy expertise. Republicans are vowing not to let Biden pivot to his domestic agenda, with around 100 Americans still awaiting rescue in Afghanistan and with potentially tens of thousands of Afghans who aided US troops and officials over 20 years left behind after the massive US evacuation. \u201cPresident Biden desperately wants to talk about anything but Afghanistan,\u201d Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said in a statement. \u201cBut Americans who are hiding from the Taliban, ISIS, and the Haqqani network don\u2019t give a damn about news cycles, long weekends, and polling \u2014 they want out.\u201d The White House appears to be convinced Americans are now ready to focus on their own problems. But if Biden\u2019s brittle demeanor and missteps highlighted in the Afghan chaos spill over into other policy areas, there will be fresh questions about his performance. Another stunning political development at the end of a turbulent summer was contained in the conservative-majority Supreme Court\u2019s failure to block a Texas state law outlawing abortion after about six weeks. The law does not only undercut the constitutional protection to an abortion \u2013 it is also written in a way that makes it hard to challenge in court. The episode is likely to supercharge Republican base enthusiasm since it is the culmination of a decades-long bid by conservatives to remake the federal judiciary. But it could also offer an opening to Democrats since it may mobilize female and suburban women voters \u2013 who have been crucial in recent elections \u2013 to their cause. Still, the power of the conservative Justices could also renew frustration among progressives at Biden\u2019s refusal to back abolishing the Senate filibuster that prevents Supreme Court and voting rights reform. Channeling liberal fury, Biden has promised a full government response to the Lone Star\u2019s state\u2019s hardcore conservatism. And Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday pledged to use federal law to protect Texas abortion clinics. The magnitude of the Texas controversy is only fueling a sense that the coming weeks are not just critical for Biden but could define the character of America for years to come. The worst reality of the pandemic for Biden is that his options for suppressing it have already been used. He pleaded for months with vaccine skeptics \u2013 many of them Republicans \u2013 to save themselves. Now, around 150,000 Americans are getting infected every day and 1,500 are dying, and the political blowback is hurting him. A challenging fall looms as kids under 12 not yet eligible for shots resume in-person classes. The sense of national exhaustion is palpable and could brew wider perceptions that the country is heading in the wrong direction \u2013 a damaging sentiments for incumbents. Biden\u2019s White House has not been blameless either. Recent pushback by medical officials over a White House announcement that Covid-19 booster shots would be ready by September 20 called Biden\u2019s vow to always put science before politics into question. When he took office, after Trump\u2019s disastrous handling of the virus, it was often said that Biden\u2019s presidency would be judged on whether he restored normality. That is still the case. In a revealing aside last week, Biden mused: \u201cImagine if the other guy was here.\u201d He was speaking, of course, of Trump and the former President\u2019s misleading penchant for cheering stock market records as proof of an equitable economy. His comment also reflected the way in which in his first seven months in power, Biden\u2019s presidency has often been judged as a contrast to Trump\u2019s tempestuous term. But the time has come when he will be evaluated not against the malfeasance of his predecessor but on his own promises and decisions.",

            "article_content": "The \u201cYes We Can!\u201d bumper sticker that seemed to be plastered on every passing car. The \u201cfired up, ready to go!\u201d chant that once rocked arenas. And, of course, those iconic photos of Black, White, and brown people shedding tears of joy at a victory celebration in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park that November evening in 2008. These are glimpses of \u201cthe unadulterated political joy\u201d that millions of Americans felt 13 years ago when Barack Obama was elected the nation\u2019s first Black president. They also feel like quaint snapshots of what seems now like another country. It\u2019s hard not to feel nostalgic about those moments because Obama has been back in the news. A new documentary series, \u201cObama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union,\u201d is airing on HBO this month. Obama recently celebrated his 60th birthday at his vacation home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Tributes to the former President have poured in from pundits who argue why Obama still \u201cmatters.\u201d   But left unsaid in all of these accolades is an inconvenient question that\u2019s grown even more urgent after a tumultuous year marked by persistent racial divisions, an insurrection at the US Capitol and a partisan divide over wearing masks during a pandemic that\u2019s killed at least 618,000 Americans: Will we ever believe a political leader who talks about hope and change again? It\u2019s an inconvenient question, because it\u2019s far easier to celebrate Obama\u2019s legacy than to consider that many of us abandoned the vision of America he embodied. The nation\u2019s first Black president was living proof that the nation could transcend its original sin of racism, that its citizens could find common ground. It was Obama who said in arguably his greatest speech that \u201cAmerica is not some fragile thing\u201d that can\u2019t tolerate citizens demanding change. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical?\u201d Obama asked in his 2015 address in Selma, Alabama, on the 50th anniversary of a historic civil rights campaign. But what happens when a large segment of White America stops pretending it even cares about democracy? What happens when these Americans refuse to accept the results of a presidential election, praise foreign dictators and pass a new wave of voter restriction laws? These are the nagging questions that lurk in the background of all the recent nostalgia surrounding Obama. It\u2019s common for pundits invoking Obama\u2019s \u201ctattered idealism\u201d to say the former President has changed since 2008. But American voters may have changed as well. Obama may be the political version of the Last of the Mohicans \u2013 a charismatic leader whose soaring rhetoric about transcending our differences now seems as outdated as a Blockbuster video store. The multiracial elation we saw in Grant Park may be the last time in many of our lifetimes we witness such unified joy. That\u2019s a brutal thought to contemplate. But consider some of the events of this past year \u2013 even this past month. The country still hasn\u2019t come to terms with a violent insurrection that saw a member of a mob brandish a Confederate flag during an attack on the Capitol while others hung a noose and scaffold outside on the grounds. A major political party is passing a wave of laws across the country that may restrict voting by racial minorities and other groups that don\u2019t tend to vote for them. Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, a hero of the right, traveled to Hungary the same week of Obama\u2019s 60th birthday to conduct a fawning interview with the country\u2019s leader, Viktor Orban, who once said: \u201c\u2026We must defend Hungary as it is now. We must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed. We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.\u201d And new census data are raising fresh questions about the future of our democracy. For the first time in the country\u2019s history, the number of White people in the US is declining \u2013 a benchmark that\u2019s come about eight years earlier than projected. The news should make anyone who knows this country\u2019s history shudder. It\u2019s been well documented that a segment of White America will abandon any commitment to democracy if they no longer consider themselves the dominant group. One can envision a future where White politicians and partisan judges double down on voter restriction laws and appeals to racism in a desperate bid to hold onto power. That\u2019s why one commentator warned the shifting US demographics are about to \u201cset our politics on fire.\u201d \u201cIf recent history tells us anything, though, it\u2019s that the census news will create a fresh wave of right-wing anger, and that much of it will be directed against America\u2019s minority populations,\u201d Joel Mathis wrote in a recent column in The Week. \u201cOur ugly politics are probably going to get uglier.\u201d In such a future, there may be no leaders who talk about seeking common ground. There will be no stirring oratory about how America doesn\u2019t have red or blue states. It\u2019ll be a war of attrition where both sides seek only to turn out their bases for elections. I foresee this future as a distinct possibility.  Leaders will keep speaking to people\u2019s fears instead of their hopes. There won\u2019t be any poetry in politics, just trench warfare. Even Obama, who embodies the idea that the US is a work in progress toward a more perfect union, sounded a note of skepticism in his recent memoir, \u201cA Promised Land.\u201d \u201cExcept now I found myself asking whether those impulses\u2014of violence, greed, corruption, nationalism, racism, and religious intolerance, the all-too-human desire to beat back our own uncertainty and mortality and sense of insignificance by subordinating others\u2014were too strong for any democracy to permanently contain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor they seemed to lie in wait everywhere, ready to resurface whenever growth rates stalled or demographics changed or a charismatic leader chose to ride the wave of people\u2019s fears and resentments.\u201d Some say there will always be an audience in America for idealistic leaders who offer visions of hope and change. \u201cThis is a cycle that America always goes through,\u201d says Melanye Price, a political scientist who specializes in contemporary Black politics and political rhetoric. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t believe that I might as well resign from my job, live off the grid somewhere and prepare for the coming race war.\u201d She says the US has repeatedly shown the ability to \u201ccourse correct.\u201d The Obama era was a glimpse of a country whose arc, to paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr., bends towards justice. \u201cI rely heavily,\u201d she says, \u201con the Winston Churchill quote: \u2018You can always count on Americans to do the right thing \u2013 after they\u2019ve tried everything else.\u2019\u201d Eric Liu, the author and activist, is one of the most eloquent spokesmen about what makes the US so resilient. In one of my favorite books, \u201cBecome America,\u201d Liu writes: \u201cAmerican history is a record of small groups of people who keep remaking this country over and over, and who reveal to us all that the perpetual remaking is the greatest statement of fidelity to our creed and our national purpose, which is not to be like Russia, white and stagnant and oligarchic, or like China, monoethnic and authoritarian and centralized, but to be more like America, hybrid and dynamic and democratic and free to be remade.\u201d Liu says it may be good if Americans don\u2019t swoon over a leader the way they once did over Obama \u2013 and for those on the right, former President Trump. He says change comes from the bottom up. It\u2019s part of the message he preaches around the country to encourage civic knowledge and engagement. \u201cMy emphasis is on trying to fortify people so they don\u2019t need a savior leader to come and put in all their hopes in,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m always quoting the great organizer Ella Baker, who said, \u2018Strong people don\u2019t need strong leaders.\u2019 \u201c The massive protests that followed the murder of George Floyd seemed to vindicate Liu\u2019s emphasize on citizen power, not charismatic leadership. It was driven by ordinary people hitting the streets. But if a large segment of White America abandons any pretense of believing in democracy, I\u2019m not sure we will ever see another leader like Obama gain such wide appeal. Ours will be a future Obama warned about in his memoir, when the impulses of violence, racism and intolerance will be too strong for any democracy to contain. If that becomes our future, some may look back and regard the images of Black, White and Brown people sharing tears of joy in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park as quaint and na\u00efve. And when another charismatic politician says, \u201cThere are no red states or blue states, just the United States,\u201d people won\u2019t cheer and rush out to vote. Most won\u2019t even listen to such lofty rhetoric anymore. Is this our future? Or will enough people still believe that \u201cAmerica is not yet finished\u201d and commit to becoming the vibrant, forward-looking multiracial democracy that Obama embodied? It\u2019s a question that Obama can\u2019t address. He\u2019s done his part. Only we can answer.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s first foreign trip as President comes at a unique moment. No US President has ever left the nation\u2019s shores with democratic values under attack as broadly and systemically at home as they are abroad. This extraordinary reality will complicate his mission to purge the trauma of the Donald Trump era and convince both foes and friends that the US is reclaiming its global leadership role for good. Biden meets British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday before the G7 summit, makes a hop to NATO in Brussels, then has a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva that will evoke the most tense days of the Cold War. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges,\u201d Biden told US troops at an air base in eastern England on Wednesday. For Biden, democracy is not just some abstract concept from civics class that Americans experience only when they enter the voting booth every few years. It is a system, a way of life and a set of rules and norms that made the United States the strongest and richest country in history. The free, prosperous nations the US rebuilt and protected after World War II faced down communist tyranny in the form of the Soviet Union and underwrote 70 years of peace. This web of open, like-minded countries is also the key to America\u2019s global power. If democracy ebbs abroad, so does US influence. But now it is all under threat. Biden warns he'll tell Putin 'what I want him to know' as he defines goals of foreign tour The rise of a new superpower, China, determined to overhaul US riches and power is becoming a grave threat to democracy, and offers potential autocrats an alternative power template of one-party rule. Russia \u2013 the adversary that Biden will confront at the end of his Europe trip \u2013 meddled in the last two US elections to help Trump, who often seemed to advance its foreign interests over America\u2019s. But the most extraordinary feature of Biden\u2019s trip is that he\u2019s not an American President going out to confront tyranny abroad \u2013 that\u2019s happened before. He\u2019s huddling with US allies at a moment when the greatest threat to democracy comes from within the United States. The world looked on, horrified, at the insurrection against the US Capitol orchestrated by Trump in January. Since then, the ex-President has poisoned millions of Americans against democracy with his false electoral-fraud claims. Republican state lawmakers are quickly passing bills that make it harder for all but their own supporters to vote and make it easier to steal elections. The principle that voters have the right to pick their own leaders is under threat. Trump\u2019s method of undermining elections, weaponizing propagandistic news coverage, creating false realities, promoting cronyism and stigmatizing immigrants was painfully familiar to Europeans because of their own history and as autocracy again takes root in the former Eastern bloc.   Biden, who was born during World War II, when Nazi tyranny ruled Europe, and came of age in the Cold War, has identified a fateful moment. Often he doesn\u2019t sound that convinced that the slumbering West can prevail against the threats to freedoms and global dominance of its values that it has taken for granted \u2013 especially when he is talking about China. And not even President Franklin Roosevelt had to worry about the state of democracy back home when he crossed the Atlantic for summits during World War II. In homage to Roosevelt, Biden will unveil an updated Atlantic Charter with Johnson on Monday \u2013 the document that FDR signed with wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill created the bedrock of the West. Biden is seeking to reinvigorate US alliances that for decades have looked backward to the glories of that era. The oldest President in US history is looking to the future. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at an inflection point in world history,\u201d Biden told American troops. He cited a \u201cmoment where it falls to us to prove that democracies will not just endure, but they will excel, as we rise to seize the enormous opportunities of the new age.\u201d And he offered his fellow leaders a warning before this weekend\u2019s G7 summit on the rocky Cornish coastline. \u201cWe have to discredit those who believe that the age of democracy is over, as some of our fellow nations believe,\u201d Biden said. Biden and Johnson expected to commit to lifting US-UK Covid-19 travel restrictions The new US President is assured of a warm welcome. After all, he\u2019s not his predecessor, who berated allies like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, preferred the company of autocrats to allies and didn\u2019t really believe in the West. But the Trump presidency and the former President\u2019s horrifying exit from power traumatized many of America\u2019s friends abroad. It made some doubt that democracy can survive in the United States. Privately, diplomats from allied nations will concede that they are not completely convinced that Biden ended the populist nationalism of \u201cAmerica First.\u201d Some fear he could be simply an interregnum and that Trump or a new president in his image could return in January 2025. Part of the rationale of Biden\u2019s trip is to begin to calm some of those nerves that raise concerns about US staying power. European nations do not need to agree with the United States on every policy issue. But after the upsets of the Trump era, which turned America from a force of global stability to one of disruption, they crave strategic certainty from Washington. \u201cWhat President Biden needs to do is show consistency, credibility, in US promises, and to really see this as stabilizing our alliance network both in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d said Heather Conley, senior vice president for Europe, Eurasia and the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a briefing. \u201cOur allies will not believe this will hold, until they see in several election cycles that regardless of administration, US policy does see the benefit of alliances,\u201d Conley said.   Still, political leaders are pragmatists. They understand that Biden, despite doubts about his capacity to pass the fullness of his agenda against Republican obstruction, has more than three more years in power. His goals on combating global warming and conquering the pandemic mirror theirs. There is every chance for a first successful foray overseas for the President. Biden\u2019s trip opened Wednesday with the news that the US had bought 500 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and would send them to nations unable to buy bulk supplies themselves. He has already rejoined the Paris climate accord, from which Trump withdrew, and the United States will be a crucial player in the next global climate conference, in Scotland in November. While the President initially appeared to want to recruit European Union nations for a global compact against China, his team has cooled the rhetoric on the issue somewhat, recognizing that while it stands close to the US on democratic values, the EU doesn\u2019t want to pick sides in a new cold war. Biden takes the lead role he's always craved in his high-stakes first trip abroad as president The deliberate choreography of the visit situates Biden with US allies for almost a week in the United Kingdom and at NATO headquarters in Brussels before he sits down with Putin. If Biden is making himself the personification of global democracy, the Russian leader is the opposite. On Wednesday, a Russian court designated organizations affiliated with opposition leader Alexey Navalny as \u201cextremist.\u201d Putin is a supporter of Belarus and its strongman leader, Alexander Lukashenko, which recently forced an airliner to land in order to effect the arrest of a prominent journalist and dissident. With his annexation of Crimea and incursions in Ukraine, he has returned the horror of contested borders to mainland Europe. More important from a domestic point of view, the US blames Russia for failing to crack down on ransomware cyber hackers who have targeted US food, water, transport and gasoline infrastructure in recent weeks. And then there\u2019s Russian election meddling. CNN has reported that Biden\u2019s interest in a summit with the Russian leader was the subject of debate within his administration over the potential risks at a time when Washington-Moscow relations are at their lowest point in decades. While the encounter is likely to feature tough talking \u2013 given that the core of Putin\u2019s political project is to diminish US power, prestige and influence however he can \u2013 Biden was keen to go ahead. US officials hope to forge some common ground \u2013 on Iran nuclear talks and atomic weapons talks, for instance \u2013 despite the broader atmosphere of hostility. Biden told the troops in England on Wednesday that he wanted to come face-to-face with Putin to \u201clet him know what I want him to know.\u201d After waiting a lifetime to fulfill his dream of being President, Biden \u2013 who has traveled the globe as a senator and vice president carrying the messages of others \u2013 now has that duty with everyone he meets at a perilous moment for America\u2019s power and the world it made.",

            "article_content": "So much attention has been focused on the rift in the GOP over former President Donald Trump\u2019s antidemocratic lies about the 2020 election. But Democrats have their own brewing disagreement over how the US should react to violence between Israelis and Palestinians, leading Democrats to question President Joe Biden\u2019s commitment to human rights and demanding he do more to pressure Israel. It\u2019s an awkward public fight for a party that has made its commitment to social and racial justice a main part of its platform. As the US comes to grips with its own history of racism in new ways and adopts the Black Lives Matter movement in a mainstream way, liberals want to apply similar notions of justice to foreign policy, where an increasing number see apartheid in Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians. Vocal liberals have criticized the White House for placating Israel and ignoring human rights as violence mounts, as well as loudly criticizing Biden for not openly opposing Israel\u2019s planned evictions of Palestinian families from a neighborhood in east Jerusalem. Multiple crises at home and abroad provide a reality check for Biden's White House Biden spent much of Saturday preparing for and placing telephone calls to leaders in the region \u2013 including his second call in a week to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his first phone call as president to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \u2013 suggesting deep engagement on the issue by Biden. He raised concerns about the safety of journalists after an Israeli airstrike razed a building in Gaza that housed the offices of the Associated Press. But liberals want more than engagement, they want him to call out Israel. Subtle shifts in language in readouts of the calls underscored the White House\u2019s new worries, but Biden has, in his public remarks at least, stayed deferential. \u201cOne of the things that I have seen thus far is that there has not been a significant overreaction,\u201d the President said at the White House last week. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Benny Gantz Saturday. \u201cI reaffirmed Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and condemned Hamas\u2019 deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians,\u201d Austin said on Twitter. The intensifying violence in Israel has assumed new urgency at the White House, according to officials, as Biden and his aides are growing increasingly worried about the rising civilian death toll. Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 130 people and injured at least 1,000 others in Gaza alone, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said. Rioting and mob violence between Arabs and Jews marred cities and towns throughout Israel. Biden has spoken and been briefed by senior level aides, but, ultimately, officials acknowledge the President\u2019s ability to broker a ceasefire on his own is limited. Officials say as the violence between Israelis and Palestinians stretches into another week, he is keeping very close tabs on developing efforts by regional partners \u2013 including Egypt and Qatar \u2013 to broker a ceasefire. Officials said what happens over the next 72 hours will prove critical in terms of how and whether to ramp up pressure to end the hostilities. After Biden on Wednesday uttered the often-repeated mantra that Israel has a right to defend itself, liberals lashed out on the floor of the US House of Representatives. \u201cDo Palestinians have a right to survive?\u201d asked New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a fiery speech on Thursday. The progressive Democrat continued to speak out on Twitter this weekend, writing, \u201cIf the Biden admin can\u2019t stand up to an ally, who can it stand up to? How can they credibly claim to stand for human rights?\u201d Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib responded on Saturday to the attack on the building housing international media. \u201cIsrael targeting media sources is so the world can\u2019t see Israel\u2019s war crimes led by the apartheid-in-chief Netanyahu,\u201d she tweeted, referring to Netanyahu. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, has said the planned evictions violate international laws and all but questioned the administration\u2019s commitment to human rights.   \u201cIf the Biden Administration puts the rule of law and human rights at the heart of its foreign policy, this is not a moment for tepid statements,\u201d he tweeted earlier this month, linking to comments from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Biden, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times on Friday entitled, \u201cThe U.S. Must Stop Being an Apologist for the Netanyahu Government.\u201d The nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, joined a boycott of a virtual White House Eid celebration scheduled to take place Sunday. \u201cWe cannot in good conscience celebrate Eid with the Biden Administration while it literally aids, abets and justifies the Israeli apartheid government\u2019s indiscriminate bombing of innocent men, women and children in Gaza,\u201d CAIR said in a statement that warned Biden he risks damaging his relationship with American Muslims. Muslim rights groups had hailed Biden in the first days of his presidency for ending the Trump administration\u2019s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. In a statement Friday casting forward to the White House\u2019s celebration of Eid, the Muslim religious festival, Biden tempered his comments from earlier in the week. \u201cPalestinians \u2013 including in Gaza \u2013 and Israelis equally deserve to live in dignity, safety and security,\u201d he said, recognizing Palestinians without criticizing Israel. Liberal Democrats have long opposed US policy toward Israel and progressives have become more vocal calling for new tactics, like demanding policy changes in exchange for the large amounts of military aid the US provides. \u201cBy continuing to provide military aid without restriction, we provide no incentive for Israel to adjust course,\u201d Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in April, in remarks to the liberal pro-Israel group J Street. Sanders went further in the New York Times on Friday. \u201cIn the Middle East, where we provide nearly $4 billion a year in aid to Israel, we can no longer be apologists for the right-wing Netanyahu government and its undemocratic and racist behavior. We must change course and adopt an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing U.S. law holding that the provision of U.S. military aid must not enable human rights abuses.\u201d Biden\u2019s approach, while it leaves much for fellow Democrats to criticize, is a far cry from Trump\u2019s all-in for Israel approach, which he used to his political advantage with Christian voters. Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, a controversial move that angered Palestinians. Biden chose not to move the embassy back. Netanyahu, who at the same time as this flareup has also been unable to form a new government and may see yet another general election as his best chance of staying in power, was a booster of Trump\u2019s Middle East policy and a chief international critic of the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump ended and Biden is trying to resurrect. Simply not being Trump represents a policy change in itself. \u201cWe need to end this conflict,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, told CNN Saturday, talking about the current violence. \u201cThank God we have a responsible president now in the United States, who I think can press upon the Israeli leader the need to do that.\u201d Sanders used the same language he might use to describe Trump to describe Netanyahu. \u201cOver more than a decade of his right-wing rule in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu has cultivated an increasingly intolerant and authoritarian type of racist nationalism,\u201d Sanders wrote, although he also criticized the Palestinian Authority as \u201ccorrupt and ineffective.\u201d \u201cWith a new president, the United States now has the opportunity to develop a new approach to the world \u2014 one based on justice and democracy,\u201d Sanders wrote.

            "article_content": "A North Carolina county official and longtime LGBTQ advocate announced Wednesday that she\u2019s challenging Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn in next year\u2019s midterm elections. The Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, who currently serves as a Democratic commissioner in Buncombe County and has long worked to advance LGBTQ rights in the South, made the announcement in a campaign video in which she attacked Cawthorn, pointing to his January 6 speech to supporters of former President Donald Trump, some of whom later participated in the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol. \u201cSome people will say a gay woman who\u2019s a Christian minister just can\u2019t get elected in the South,\u201d Beach-Ferrara said in the video. \u201cNot to mention, she\u2019s a Democrat. But I say an insurrectionist who flirts with Nazis and fires up a violent crowd to attack our democracy \u2013 well, he shouldn\u2019t get reelected anywhere.\u201d Though Cawthorn handily won North Carolina\u2019s 11th Congressional District last year, Beach-Ferrara\u2019s announcement could mean a rising star of the conservative right will have to fight a costly reelection bid, as Democratic challengers like Beach-Ferrara have raised hefty sums of money in the past when they have taken on Republicans such as Cawthorn who have drawn the ire of national Democrats. The congressman has been at the center of several controversies since his election last November, including one caused by a speech he gave at a pro-Trump rally on January 6. Beach-Ferrara\u2019s announcement comes as Cawthorn is facing allegations from former college classmates of sexual misconduct, which he has previously denied. Women allege sexual misconduct against North Carolina GOP lawmaker as his biography is under new scrutiny Cawthorn also faced backlash during his campaign for photos on his Instagram page showing him visiting Adolf Hitler\u2019s vacation house in Germany in 2017 and referring to the dictator as \u201cthe F\u00fchrer.\u201d After Cawthorn\u2019s opponent seized on the images, the then-candidate told WLOS News 13 that he denounces \u201cwhite nationalism, any kind of Nazism.\u201d CNN has reached out to Cawthorn\u2019s office for comment on Beach-Ferrara\u2019s announcement. Already, the Democrat is working to raise funds, having shared a link in a tweet on Wednesday in which she wrote: \u201cChip in to flip this seat blue and unseat Cawthorn.\u201d After the Capitol riot, Beach-Ferrara called on Cawthorn to resign in a column in the Asheville Citizen Times, writing that he should be removed from office if he refused to resign because \u201che has violated his oath of office\u201d by helping to incite the attack. On her campaign website, Beach-Ferrara says she will focus on childhood education, combating the opioid crisis and expanding opportunities for small businesses. In 2011, Beach-Ferrara founded the Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ rights group that has worked to advance marriage equality and increase health access and resources for the LGBTQ community in southern states. Her work with the organization has at times seen her participate in national debates on the issue, including in 2015, when the group filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark same sex marriage case. The group argued that gay and lesbian people in the South do not possess political power to achieve equality through the legislative process and urged the justices to \u201cact quickly to ensure the freedom to marry across the nation.\u201d \u201cI felt a calling, so I got ordained,\u201d Beach-Ferrara, who is a minister in the United Church of Christ, said in the campaign video. \u201cWe took the campaign for marriage equality to small towns all across the South because I believe love wins everywhere and every time.\u201d The Democrat also serves as a chaplain for Echoing Green, a fellowship program that works to engage in various social issues through funding operations for social innovation. Beach-Ferrara graduated from Brown University in 1998 with a degree in English before earning an MFA from Warren Wilson College in 2001 and a Master of Divinity from Harvard University in 2010, a biography that contrasts sharply with Cawthorn, who left college before completing a degree, and who at age 25 is the youngest member of Congress.",

            "article_content": "Arkansas state Sen. Jim Hendren will appear on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Friday. The show airs at 7 p.m. ET. An Arkansas state lawmaker, who is the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and was expected to run for governor next year, said he is leaving the Republican Party. State Sen. Jim Hendren, in a nine-minute video, cited former President Donald Trump\u2019s incitement of the riot at the Capitol on January 6 as the \u201clast straw.\u201d \u201cI asked myself, what in the world would I tell my grandchildren when they asked one day what happened, and what did I do about it?\u201d Hendren said in the video he posted to YouTube on Thursday. His move highlights the perils of the Republican Party\u2019s continuing loyalty to Trump: While he is supported by the vast majority of the party\u2019s base, he has also alienated some conservatives and ignited a ferocious opposition that smashed fundraising and voter turnout records in the 2018 midterms and 2020 election. \u201cThere\u2019s a real danger that the Republican Party is going to be one that you can\u2019t win a primary without being a Trump supporter, and you can\u2019t win a general by being a Trump supporter,\u201d Hendren said in an interview Friday. \u201cWhat would have happened, then, is we\u2019ve taken a party that was about principle and about conservative government to one that is about one man and a personality. And that is a race that doesn\u2019t end well for the GOP.\u201d Hendren, 57, is an Arkansas native and former Air Force fighter pilot. He\u2019s been a state lawmaker since 1995 \u2013 first in the House, and since 2013 in the Senate, where he served four years as majority leader. His father was also an Arkansas state legislator, and his uncle, Hutchinson, is in his second term as governor. In the video, Hendren \u2013 who said he is now an independent \u2013 said his departure from the GOP was years in the making. He highlighted Trump\u2019s characterization during the 2016 campaign of Mexican immigrants as rapists, his ridiculing of a Gold Star family, his mockery of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain and his \u201cencouragement of the worst voices of racism, nationalism and violence.\u201d \u201cI watched the former President actively fan the flame of racist rhetoric, make fun of those with disabilities, bully his enemies, and talk about women in ways that would never be tolerated in my home or business,\u201d he said, faulting Republican leaders for failing to intervene. Hendren tweeted Thursday night, about 12 hours after he\u2019d posted his video leaving the GOP: \u201cI\u2019ve heard from dozens of my former military brothers and sisters. Turns out, like me, insurrections don\u2019t go down well with them either.\u201d Democrats said Hendren\u2019s decision underscored the GOP\u2019s drift toward radicalism. \u201cHe said what most of us already knew, that today\u2019s Republican Party of Arkansas doesn\u2019t focus on the needs of Arkansans but rather on the divisive rhetoric and issues that divide our country,\u201d Arkansas Democratic Party chairman Michael John Gray said in a statement. Hendren had already faced backlash from conservatives in Arkansas over his sponsorship of hate crimes legislation. He would have been a long-shot in a Republican gubernatorial primary in which former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, is the overwhelming favorite. Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin dropped out of the governor\u2019s race earlier this month, saying he will instead run for attorney general. Current Attorney General Leslie Rutledge is also running for governor. Hendren said Friday he has not decided whether to run for governor as an independent. He said he is launching a new organization called Common Ground Arkansas, which he said is \u201cabout me building a place for people who are politically homeless.\u201d \u201cI have not ruled that out,\u201d Hendren told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d Friday evening of a run for governor. \u201cBut this is about something far greater and far broader than one governor\u2019s race in Arkansas \u2013 if I wanted to be governor, I probably wouldn\u2019t be leaving the dominant party in Arkansas. This is about building a home for people who don\u2019t have one now.\u201d When asked if the Republican Party should split and a new-center right party should emerge, Hendren replied, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a decision that the party has to make for itself.\u201d This story has been updated with Hendren\u2019s comments on CNN Friday evening.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Wednesday is Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is more important than ever. Fewer people who can actually remember the Holocaust are still with us. Denialism and disinformation about the Holocaust presaged the false information now spread online. The rise of a virulent White nationalism plagues democracies like the United States and was on display at the US Capitol during an insurrection that\u2019s been compared to the burning of the Reichstag in 1933. Witness to the Holocaust. Irene Butter is a survivor who watched the rise of the Nazis as a girl in Germany. She writes a warning for Americans that their democracy is at stake and sees \u201cechoes of the Nazis and their regime\u201d in the insurrection at the US Capitol, which featured rioters in Holocaust-denying T-shirts and other anti-Semitic symbols. \u201cThe disinformation, distortion and denial of human rights and democracy that resulted in the Holocaust must not happen again. We must speak truth to fascism.\u201d And\u2026 \u201cFour years ago, we could not have guessed that rioters with Nazi symbols would break into the Capitol to subvert a fairly elected president. None of us can afford to be a bystander to history. We all must confront racism and hatred when we see it. We must establish a record, encourage witnesses and others to speak out, and teach truth. Each of us can and must make a difference.\u201d It\u2019s a compelling story from a woman who barely survived concentration camps and, once freed, was forced to live for a time alone as a refugee, separated from her mother and brother after her father\u2019s death. Butter\u2019s warning is in line with the message Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria after the war, posted on social media after the Capitol insurrection. President Joe Biden acknowledged the Holocaust and said in a statement that bigotry and hate were what pushed him to run for office in 2020. \u201cThe horrors we saw and heard in Charlottesville in 2017, with White nationalists and neo-Nazis spewing the same anti-Semitic bile we heard in the 1930s in Europe, are the reason I ran for president,\u201d he said \u2013 although he did not mention the events just three weeks ago on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, in a different reality. The Oregon Republican Party is drawing the exact opposite conclusion from the January 6 riot and making false claims about who was responsible. The party \u2013 a legitimate, statewide arm of the GOP \u2013 issued a formal condemnation Monday of the 10 Republican members of Congress who voted in favor of impeaching now-former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the insurrection. In their warped view, it\u2019s not the people who invaded the seat of American power who were trying to overthrow democracy. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they claim the insurrection was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation and, in a bizarre reversal of facts, it was Democrats who were trying to take over the government, like Nazis who burned the Reichstag in 1933. Let\u2019s not doom ourselves to repeat history. Read a refresher on the Reichstag fire from Smithsonian Magazine here. A Communist was blamed for the damage and Hitler used the event to consolidate his power and purge Communists from the government, despite recent evidence the Nazis may have had a hand in the fire themselves. This actual quote from the Oregon GOP is the type of disinformation and distortion Butter is talking about: \u201cWhereas there is growing evidence that the violence at the Capitol was a \u2018false flag\u2019 operation designed to discredit President Trump, his supporters, and all conservative Republicans; this provided the sham motivation to impeach President Trump in order to advance the Democrat goal of seizing total power, in a frightening parallel to the February 1933 burning of the German Reichstag.\u201d It might be the most deranged non-ironic argument you\u2019ll ever hear. A state party backing a President whose followers wore symbols of the Nazis and physically stormed the Capitol to stop the counting of votes are officially arguing the other party \u2013 the one elected by voters \u2013 is more like the Nazis. There\u2019s a pattern for this type of total distortion. Trump twisted accusations of fake news online helping his 2016 campaign into his \u201cFake News\u201d mantra about legitimate media before his 2020 campaign. As president, he cried about a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him as he purged people he didn\u2019t feel were loyal in the federal government. The Capitol riot was not a false flag operation. Many, many, many people who were on video storming the Capitol and are avowed right-wing activists are among those who have been arrested. They often admitted on tape or on Twitter to being there and marching for Trump. It wasn\u2019t false flag. It was flag-waving. Historians have tried to tamp down on comparisons between Trumpists and Nazis. The author and professor Thomas Weber, who wrote a book about Hitler\u2019s rise, warns against a false equivalence, and argues anyone making the point today should look closely at Germany of the 1930s, when Jews were being rounded up and sent to camps. \u201cHitler and Trump, along with fascism and Trumpism, are all destructive to liberal democracy but in fundamentally different ways,\u201d Weber wrote after Schwarzenegger posted his video. \u201cTaking these distinctions seriously allows us better to understand the specific threat Trump posed and be better equipped to spot the warning signs of someone who might follow in his footsteps.\u201d Still, it is alarming and sad, today, that parts of the GOP have completely bought into the conspiracy theory mindset and false narratives that thrive online, like the \u201cfalse flag\u201d silliness about the Capitol insurrection. Even if they\u2019re not themselves storming the Capitol, the energy in the GOP isn\u2019t looking for any accountability from Trump, who helped incite it. Backlash to accountability. Those few Republicans that expressed anger at Trump or, even fewer, voted to impeach him, have been vilified rather than celebrated for their courage. Politico\u2019s David Siders wrote that, \u201cfor a moment, it looked like Donald Trump might be losing his iron grip on the GOP\u201d after those 10 Republicans joined Democrats in that impeachment vote in the House. But the effort is being quickly snuffed out as Republicans in Washington who used to talk about censuring the former President are falling in line. Siders talked to a Nelson County, Kentucky, official, Don Thrasher, who is mobilizing there against Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. Thrasher said the power of Trump remains strong at the local level and the former President could sway any local party election in the country: \u201cIf he interjected himself in any of the state party elections, it would go in his favor \u2026 I know in Kentucky, if he called for the removal of the whole apparatus, we\u2019d vote them out.\u201d Maybe McConnell, who had earlier spoken out against Trump on the Senate floor, heard the same thing. He did not follow his public condemnation of Trump up with a vote that the impeachment trial was constitutional. He did the opposite and joined the party.",

            "article_content": "If there was any doubt about the urgency of President Joe Biden\u2019s mission to tackle racial inequality, it was erased in the searing moment an insurrectionist rioter brazenly paraded the Confederate flag through the US Capitol. Just 20 days on from one of the most shocking moments in modern US history, Biden on Tuesday made his most detailed policy moves yet on the issue with a series of executive orders on the one crisis haunting his presidency sure to endure once Covid-19 and its economic pain are just a horrible memory. He said that the death of Minnesota man George Floyd, in a notorious instance of police brutality against Black Americans last year, had unleashed a common realization among citizens that they could no longer ignore systemic racism. \u201cThose eight minutes and 46 seconds that took George Floyd\u2019s life opened the eyes of millions of Americans and millions of people around all over the world,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt was the knee on the neck of justice, and it wouldn\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d Biden pressed ahead in the looming shadow of his predecessor Donald Trump after House Democrats on Monday delivered an article of impeachment relating to his role inciting the Capitol riot. The uprising, incited by an ex-President who fueled white nationalism, underscored how America\u2019s oldest fault line is also one of its freshest following last summer\u2019s national racial reckoning. Yet subsequent events have also left a sense that while the country has rarely been more divided since a Civil War that was fought over slavery, progress is possible and as necessary as ever.   In another striking image, on Monday, for example, the first Black, South Asian and female Vice President Kamala Harris swore in the first Black Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two juxtaposed episodes less than three weeks apart encapsulated the nation\u2019s deep divides that Biden must confront but also a democracy\u2019s potential for change. The President has picked the most diverse Cabinet in US history. He has instructed his nominees at the Justice Department to prioritize civil rights and to root out racism and prejudice to apply equality under the law for all Americans. This is no doubt heartfelt. But it is also smart political positioning since he owes his victory in the Democratic nominating race, his triumph over Trump and his party\u2019s capture of the Senate to Black voters especially. \u201cThe President has committed the whole of our government to advance racial justice and equity for all,\u201d Susan Rice, the head of Biden\u2019s Domestic Policy Council said Tuesday, previewing a major address on race by the President later in the day. \u201cThese aren\u2019t feel good policies, the evidence is clear \u2013 investing in equity is good for economic growth and it creates jobs for all Americans,\u201d Rice said, previewing an agenda that is far broader than the most familiar racial issues, including policing and discrimination. Biden tackled four areas on Tuesday, including fair housing, reforming the penal system to crack down on private prisons, recommitting the government to lifting up Native American communities and tribes and combating xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Why inclusive policy is a critical next step for diverse Biden administration Biden has worked hard to meet the moment, after several clumsy or discordant remarks related to race earlier in his long political career. During a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin, during the election campaign, Biden argued that the nationwide tide of emotion that followed yet another shooting of a Black man by police, that paralyzed Jacob Blake, was the catalyst for a new effort to tackle all forms of racism and inequality of opportunity. He also signaled understanding of the spirit of the resurgent racial justice movement by acknowledging that White Americans could never fully appreciate the historic pain felt by their Black compatriots, an experience shared by many other citizens. \u201cI can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to walk out the door or send my son out the door or my daughter and worry about just because they\u2019re Black they may not come back,\u201d Biden said. Soaring words and symbolism are important \u2013 they are part of a President\u2019s armory in mobilizing the public and affecting political change. But alone, they cannot transform a country or the lived reality of African Americans. The limited social mobility of millions and the busted promises of many previous \u201cconversations about race\u201d sometimes seem little changed from the reality noted by Martin Luther King Jr. in his book \u201cWhere do we go from here: Chaos or Community\u201d that was first published in 1967. \u201cLoose and easy language about equality, resonant resolutions about brotherhood fall pleasantly on the ear, but for the Negro there is a credibility gap he cannot overlook,\u201d King wrote. In a more recent lesson, the presidency of the first black commander in chief Barack Obama shows that the very act of breaking down barriers that at the time can seem epochal and irreversible can incite new prejudice and breed extremism. Biden\u2019s effort will require action from the Justice Department to tackle civil rights abuses and to guarantee fairness in the judicial system for all. Former national security adviser Rice\u2019s new White House job includes a sweeping mandate across all government agencies. Biden is also soon expected to seek reforms on policing, partly in response to the death of Minnesota man George Floyd with a policeman\u2019s knee on his neck last year. Last week, in the first hours of his presidency, Biden signed an executive order requiring all government departments to put racial and other forms of equality at the center of everything that they do during his term. One established that \u201cadvancing equity for all \u2013 including people of color and others who have been historically underserved and marginalized \u2013 is the responsibility of the whole of our government.\u201d Biden also countermanded an earlier executive order signed by Trump. Like much of Biden\u2019s presidency, his capacity for action, and to secure the massive funding that serious reform requires, will be constrained by narrow majorities in Congress and Washington\u2019s fractured political scene in the post-Trump era. But he does have the moral authority of having won office against a President who tore at the nation\u2019s racial chasm with a hard line \u201claw and order\u201d campaign based on false claims that the Democratic nominee wanted to dismantle policing as it is currently known. The debate over what Biden has said is \u201csystemic\u201d racism in the criminal justice system puts the President between two absolutist positions. He finds himself confronted on his right by conservatives keen to demagogue him as anti-police and an enemy of White heartland values. Conservative media has already accused Biden of wrongly equating every Trump voter with White nationalists and racists. And many Republicans are now seeking to draw false equivalence between the Trump-inspired violence on January 6 in Washington and clashes that broke out during Black Lives Matter protests last year. Biden has condemned violence in all cases. And violence that erupted in the summer in many cities was not the true expression of the attitude of millions of people who marched to protest racial injustice. The attack on the Capitol represented an unprecedented assault on another branch of government by a US President trying to steal an election. To his left, Biden is confronted by progressives who want sweeping reform \u2013 some of whom defined the term \u201cdefund the police\u201d that many party leaders say helped cost Democrats victories in some key swing state races in the House. This particular issue also pulls Biden between two versions of his own political persona. He was severely criticized for his role in 1990s criminal justice legislation that ushered in mandatory minimum sentences that sent many young Black men to jail for years. But he has also always had a strong relationship with the police and their unions during his long political career. But the shocking events of last summer and the long litany of videotaped examples of police brutality against African Americans have irrevocably shifted the potency of race and policing in the Democratic Party. And Biden\u2019s positioning, though obviously sincere, is also enforced by political reality. Still, some of Biden\u2019s longtime contacts in policing have told CNN that his experience and familiarity with both sides of this most difficult issue may uniquely equip him to oversee a policy response that goes some way to reconciling the extraordinary, and multi-racial national protests after Floyd\u2019s death.

            "article_content": "Three Wednesdays that changed America. A deadly insurrection, a historic impeachment and the inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the 46th President of the United States. The chaotic first 20 days of the year started with mobs supporting President Donald Trump storming the US Capitol on January 6 after he urged them to fight against the ceremonial counting of electoral votes ratifying Biden\u2019s victory. A week later, on January 13, the House of Representatives made Trump the first President to be impeached twice after his desperate bid to cling to power. On Wednesday, Trump flew to Florida hours before Biden took the oath of office \u2013  along with Kamala Harris as the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president \u2013 in the same area outside the Capitol that had been overrun weeks earlier by the pro-Trump mobs. Here is a brief timeline of three historic Wednesdays: \u201cLet\u2019s have trial by combat!\u201d Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd before the President arrived at the Ellipse to warm up participants of the \u201cSave America March\u201d on the morning of January 6. Trump repeated weeks of false claims that the presidential election was rigged and fraudulent. He looked out on throngs of flag-waving, MAGA-hat wearing supporters he had invited to descend on Washington for the congressional certification of the election. Trump worked up the crowd with claims that \u201cthe states got defrauded\u201d and railed against \u201cpathetic Republicans\u201d who failed to challenge Biden\u2019s win. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we\u2019re gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\u201d Shortly after 1 p.m., hundreds of protesters pushed through barriers erected along the perimeter of the Capitol. They tussled with officers in riot gear. By 2:30 p.m., the rioters had broken into the Capitol building, with some chanting, \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d The vice president was whisked to safety with his wife and daughter though some reports said the insurrectionists came within minutes of reaching Pence. After the doors were secured, some Trump supporters smashed windows and let themselves in. The insurrectionists kicked and beat police with their own batons. They sprayed them with chemical irritants and threatened to kill them. One police officer and four other people \u2013 including a female protester who was shot by police \u2013 died in the aftermath of the riot. Lawmakers and staff were on lockdown. Capitol Police drew their guns to protect the House chamber. One rioter was photographed carrying a pole flying the Confederate flag. The man trotted across the tiled floors of the Capitol, past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and slaveholder John Calhoun. After police cleared the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that Congress intended to reconvene that night to finish affirming Biden\u2019s election. Shortly before 4 a.m. on January 7, Congress finalized Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. \u201cWe deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol Building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life, and the quagmire of dysfunction that threaten our democracy,\u201d Senate Chaplain Barry Black said in a prayer moments after the congressional ratification. \u201cThese tragedies have reminded us that words matter and that the power of life and death is in the tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been warned that eternal vigilance continues to be freedom\u2019s price.\u201d On January 13, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for a second time in the same chamber that lawmakers had fled a week earlier in fear of their lives from the invading mob seeking to stop the transfer of power to Biden. The House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump in the fourth presidential impeachment in US history. It was the first time a President had been impeached twice. Ten Republicans, including the House\u2019s No. 3 Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, joined all Democrats to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d \u201cDonald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law,\u201d the impeachment article read. Thousands of National Guard troops surrounded and guarded the Capitol complex as the vote took place. After the vote, Trump released a video statement calling for calm as the threat of new riots cast a pall over Washington. He did not mention the impeachment. The timing of Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial is still unsettled, with some Republicans urging Democrats to abandon the effort. On the third Wednesday of the new year, the Trump presidential era came to end. An unprecedented number of National Guard members, federal law enforcement officers, police officers and protective infrastructure were moved to the heart of the capital for an inauguration like no other. Security on Biden\u2019s ultimately quiet and calm Inauguration Day included more than 20,000 National Guard members. Trump left the White House as President for the last time shortly after 8 a.m. ET. He did not attend Biden\u2019s swearing-in ceremony \u2013 the first President in 150 years to boycott his successor\u2019s inauguration. With the soon-to-be former first lady at his side, Trump told reporters outside the White House that it was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d to serve as 45th President of the United States. He said goodbye before boarding Marine One. Trump\u2019s family and some supporters later gathered for a brief farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews before the Trumps boarded the presidential plane for a flight to Florida just before 9 a.m. \u201cWe will be back in some form,\u201d Trump told a modest crowd of supporters. \u201cSo have a good life. We will see you soon.\u201d Trump thanked his family and chief of staff. He promised to \u201calways fight\u201d and said he wished the incoming administration \u201cgreat luck\u201d \u2013 without mentioning Biden by name. Biden\u2019s first public appearance Wednesday morning was at a church service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in DC with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Pelosi. Biden arrived at the US Capitol shortly after 11 a.m. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, up the steps of the building. The nation\u2019s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president took the oath of office first \u2013 at 11:42 a.m. Harris used two Bibles during the oath, which was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Biden completed his oath at 11:48 a.m., his hand over a treasured family Bible that dates to the 19th century and was held by Jill Biden. His oath was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. In his inaugural speech, Biden spoke of the rise of White nationalism, racism and deep political division across the country. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,\u201d the newly minted President said, calling on Americans to come together. \u201cWe have to be different than this. America has to be better than this.\u201d Addressing those who did not support him in the election, Biden added, \u201cI will be a President for all Americans. I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as those who did.\u201d He said the swearing-in of his vice president was a remarkable achievement for a country still struggling to live up to an ideal of equality for all. \u201cHere we stand looking out on the great Mall, where Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.) spoke of his dream. Here we stand where 108 years ago, at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris,\u201d Biden said. After his speech, Amanda Gorman, the nation\u2019s first-ever youth poet laureate, challenged Americans to come together and \u201cleave behind a country better than the one we were left.\u201d She recited a poem about bridging differences that she said she was halfway through writing and completed the day she saw Trump supporters storm the Capitol. \u201cSomehow we\u2019ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn\u2019t broken, but simply unfinished,\u201d Gorman said in the poem. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.\u201d Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and their spouses attended the inauguration. They later issued a joint message emphasizing  the new President\u2019s call for national unity. Shortly before 4 p.m., Biden entered the White House for the first time as the 46th President. \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d played as he and the first lady paused for a moment on the North Portico. The President and the first lady embraced. They then waved to the cameras and walked with their extended family into the Grand Foyer.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden ended his first day in office with a note of hope and optimism, closing his inaugural activities with an appearance at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday night, where he asked the nation to answer his call for unity, saying it will require \u201cus to come together in common love that defines us as Americans.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve learned again that democracy is precious. Because of you, democracy has prevailed,\u201d Biden said, alluding to the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, which was incited by former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election but which did not stop a peaceful transfer of power on Wednesday. Live Updates: The inauguration of Joe Biden But Biden noted that the nation is facing myriad challenges, including the pandemic, the recession, last year\u2019s calls for racial justice and equality after the police killing of George Floyd, the climate crisis and the attack on the country\u2019s system of government two weeks ago. \u201cThe question is: Are we up to it?\u201d the President asked. \u201cWill we meet the moment like our forbearers have? I believe we must and I believe we will. You the American people are the reason why. I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day. There isn\u2019t anything we can\u2019t do if we do it together.\u201d After Trump had refused to formally concede or host Biden at the White House in the morning, Biden and his family walked onto the White House grounds for the first time since he won the election Wednesday afternoon, as did Kamala Harris \u2013 who made history Wednesday when she was sworn in as the first female, the first Black and first South Asian vice president of the United States. Just hours after he was inaugurated as the 46th President, Biden signed 17 executive actions to begin overhauling the nation\u2019s approach to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 including instituting a mask mandate for federal buildings and inter-state travel \u2013 and undoing some of the Trump administration\u2019s most controversial policies, like rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. Biden told reporters he was starting his term \u201ckeeping the promises\u201d he\u2019d made, as he sat at the Resolute Desk Wednesday evening. But he noted that the nation has \u201ca long way to go\u201d and that Congress would need to pass legislation to follow through on his priorities, which include a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill. Later that evening, the US Senate confirmed Biden\u2019s first nominee, Avril Haines as director of national intelligence, in bipartisan fashion \u2013 approving the nominee 84-10. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, during her first press briefing, gingerly sidestepped questions about Trump\u2019s looming impeachment trial in the Senate, which could complicate efforts to quickly confirm Biden\u2019s nominees and take up his legislative priorities. When asked whether Democratic leaders in the Senate should drop the trial, Psaki said that Biden is focused on the \u201cimportance of unity and bringing the country together,\u201d adding that the President would defer to Senate leaders on questions of timing. Harris \u2013 who is now the tie-breaking vote in a Senate that is divided evenly between Democrats and Republicans \u2013  swore in three incoming senators as one of her first acts in her new role. She administered the oath of office to Alex Padilla, who will replace Harris as the junior senator from California. She also swore in Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who won hard-fought runoff races that flipped control of the Senate, giving Democrats control of Congress and the White House. Trump had left Washington Wednesday morning, becoming the first president in 150 years to boycott his successor\u2019s inauguration. But he left a letter for Biden, which, during the new President\u2019s brief exchange with reporters Wednesday, he described as \u201cgenerous\u201d but whose contents he said he would not reveal until he spoke with Trump. Biden took his oath of office at the US Capitol just two weeks after a mob of insurrectionists invaded that building seeking to overturn the presidential election. The new President set out on the daunting task of uniting the nation by urging Americans to come together as they confront the deadly pandemic, an economic collapse that has left millions unemployed and deep divisions over issues of racial justice and police brutality. \u201cToday on this January day, my whole soul is in this \u2014 bringing American people together, uniting our nation, and I ask every American to join me in this cause,\u201d Biden said in his inaugural speech. The new President set that tone of unity, calm and comity from the top down on a carefully choreographed day that was striking after the chaos and tumult of the past four years under Trump. The former President poisoned already strained relations between the two political parties in Washington, as he lashed out at his political opponents and anyone who dared to criticize him.   But that cloud over Washington had notably lifted, at least for the day, Wednesday as members from both parties mingled at the Capitol during the ceremonies. Outgoing Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the inauguration and skipped Trump\u2019s farewell ceremony, and his wife Karen even shared a laugh with Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, on the steps of the Capitol before they departed to begin their private lives. Biden also made it clear that he would not accept infighting, even within his own ranks when he swore in his new staff Wednesday evening. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever working with me and I hear you treating another colleague with disrespect, talking down to someone, I will fire you on the spot,\u201d Biden told his new employees in a virtual address. He said he believes everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and decency, which he said had been \u201cmissing in a big way the past four years.\u201d During his inaugural speech, Biden, who decided to run for the White House after Trump\u2019s shocking reaction to the White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, noted that the nation is struggling through a rise of White nationalism, racism and deep political divisions. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path,\u201d Biden said, calling on Americans to come together. \u201cWe have to be different than this. America has to be better than this.\u201d \u201cI will be a president for all Americans,\u201d Biden said speaking directly to those who did not support him in the November election. \u201cI will fight as hard for those who did not support me as those who did.\u201d Biden reflected on the siege in the Capitol several times during his speech, noting that the world is watching after its entire system of government come under attack. READ: Joe Biden's inaugural address \u201cHere is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we\u2019ve come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday\u2019s challenges, but today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s challenges,\u201d Biden said. The new President also said the nation\u2019s success in getting through this moment will hinge on whether Americans can come together and set aside their differences to defeat the pandemic that has ravaged the nation, costing more than 400,000 lives. He highlighted some of the previous challenges the nation has confronted, including the Great Depression, two world wars and the September 11 attacks. \u201cI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days; I know the forces that divide us are deep and are real, but I also know they are not new,\u201d Biden said in his speech, calling on Americans to forge a new way forward. \u201cWe can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors \u2014speaking to each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. Without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury; no progress, only exhausting outrage; no nation, only a state of chaos.\u201d He asked his audience to unite to meet the moment as one nation: \u201cIf we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.\u201d \u201cAt this time, in this place, let\u2019s start afresh,\u201d Biden said. After a tumultuous year that began a new chapter of the civil rights movement as Americans took to the streets to protest against racial injustice and police brutality after the death of George Floyd, Biden noted that the swearing in of his vice president was a remarkable achievement for a country that has often struggled to live up to its ideal of equality for all. \u201cHere we stand looking out on the great Mall, where Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.) spoke of his dream. Here we stand where 108 years ago, at another inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. Today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris,\u201d Biden said. In another ceremony highlight, the nation\u2019s first youth poet laureate, Amanda Gorman, recited a poem about bridging divides that she finished on the night that Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the Capitol. \u201cSomehow we\u2019ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn\u2019t broken, but simply unfinished,\u201d Gorman said in the poem she read after Biden\u2019s speech. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.\u201d Biden\u2019s tone at his inaugural speech could not have been more different than the bitter, divisive one adopted by Trump throughout his presidency in his speeches and tweets, which were threaded with lies and threats that whipped up his crowds and ultimately led to the insurrection at the Capitol earlier this month. The former president left the White House as president for the last time Wednesday morning, flying to Florida with first lady Melania Trump. On his way out of the Washington area, Trump \u2013 who was not wearing a mask \u2013 again used the racist term \u201cChina virus\u201d to describe the coronavirus, describing it in the past tense, and touted his administration\u2019s work on developing a vaccine. Trump's lonely exit He thanked his staff and family and wished the next administration \u201cgreat success\u201d but did not mention his successor by name. \u201cWe love you, this has been an incredible four years,\u201d Trump said in unscripted remarks at Joint Base Andrews shortly before leaving for Florida. \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished so much.\u201d \u201cI will always fight for you. I will be watching. I will be listening.\u201d Biden\u2019s task has been complicated by the fact that Trump impeded the transition between administrations. But Trump left the White House as a disgraced and diminished figure. CNN\u2019s White House team has reported that although dozens of current and former officials had been invited to the Wednesday morning farewell ceremony, many declined to attend. Pence said his final goodbyes to Trump on Tuesday. In a show of unity and Biden\u2019s intent to work with leaders from both parties, his first public appearance Wednesday was at a church service at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in DC ahead of the inaugural ceremonies with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After Biden was sworn in, he went to Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joined by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses. The three former presidents recorded a free-flowing conversation at Arlington reflecting on the day\u2019s events and how to restore unity in a deeply fractured country. Obama reflected on the graciousness that Bush and his wife, Laura, showed him and Michelle Obama during their inauguration in 2008, and said it was a reminder that \u201cwe can have fierce disagreements, and yet recognize each other\u2019s common humanity.\u201d Clinton noted that the nation is struggling through a most unusual time, \u201ctrying to come back to normalcy, deal with totally abnormal challenges, and do what we do best \u2013 which is try to make a more perfect union.\u201d \u201cI think the fact that three of us are standing here, talking about a peaceful transfer of power, speaks to the institutional integrity of our country,\u201d Bush said. The former President notably missing from the conversation was Trump, and yet it was his absence that allowed the restoration of civility after so much rancor. \u201cI think if Americans would love their neighbor like they would like to be loved themselves, a lot of the division in our society would end,\u201d Bush said.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump may be leaving the White House in a few days, but the umbrella of conspiracy theories he inspired is only just arriving in Washington. The chief theory known as QAnon \u2013 that the US government is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles only Trump can expose \u2013 began nearly four years ago as a fringe movement in the dark corners of the internet. Now QAnon has adherents in positions of power within the Republican Party and in the halls of Congress. The January 6 domestic terror attack on the US Capitol was the violent manifestation of that movement and its attendant theories \u2013 including that the 2020 election was stolen. Thousands of its adherents, steeped in years of conspiracy theories espoused by Trump, stormed the Capitol ready for violence \u2013 seemingly certain they were the ones liberating the country. Many displayed clothing and paraphernalia associated with the movement. One of the more conspicuous rioters, wearing a horned helmet and carrying a six-foot spear, is known online as the \u201cQAnon Shaman.\u201d \u201cThere is a violent anarchy to QAnon that is baked into it,\u201d said Mike Rothschild, the author of a book examining and debunking some of the most prominent conspiracy theories. How deep into the GOP\u2019s infrastructure QAnon has penetrated is an open question. So too is how Trump\u2019s departure from the presidency and banishment from most social media will affect the reach of conspiracy within the Republican Party. \u201cThis stuff has always been part of the stew,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist in Washington. \u201cTrump just turned up the heat and brought it to the surface.\u201d The value of courting QAnon, to the extent Republican leaders like Trump considered it, was in delivering votes from a disaffected, passionate base of support. The risk of doing so was that they\u2019d get a seat at the table. The House Republican conference now includes two QAnon adherents, freshman Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. While Greene has walked back her support and said the QAnon candidate label \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent me,\u201d she has praised \u201cQ\u201d as a patriot and spread baseless conspiracy theories linked to the movement. And though Boebert has claimed she\u2019s not a follower and worked to distance herself from the conspiracy theorists, she has said of QAnon, \u201cI hope that this is real.\u201d Now that they\u2019re there, it\u2019s going to be much harder to dislodge them. \u201cYou can\u2019t just push QAnon followers away,\u201d said Rothschild. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, certainly in the Georgia runoff, where these margins are thin, you can\u2019t piss off 1 or 2% of your constituents.\u201d QAnon devotion will linger within the GOP long after Trump leaves office. For one thing, it\u2019s already in the party\u2019s farm system. In the 2020 election, dozens of Republican candidates for local races all over the country flirted with the conspiracy theory. Dozens more held adjacent views and carried on other Trump-inspired conspiracy theories, from railing against the alleged fraud of mail-in ballots to wearing masks. Many of these candidates lost races in Democratic-leaning districts, but others, such as the Q-curious Dave Armstrong of the Wisconsin state assembly, won comfortably. And now, some of these conspiracy-minded politicians have moved up to the major leagues in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s like Trump looked for the most gullible members, found the Freedom Caucus, and decided even they weren\u2019t up for the job so he cooked up this mutated QAnon caucus,\u201d said one GOP operative. So far, there\u2019s been close to zero pushback against QAnon candidates from national party leaders \u2013 no denial of campaign funding or threats to revoke committee assignments. There\u2019s recent precedent for doing so, when House Republicans in 2019 stripped Iowa Rep. Steve King of his committee assignments over his defense of white nationalism. King lost the GOP primary in 2020 in large part because of his banishment by the GOP conference. No such fate yet awaits Greene and Boebert. In fact, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, defended both of his new members after their elections in November. \u201cGive them an opportunity before you claim what you believe they have done, and what they will do,\u201d McCarthy, the top-ranking House Republican, said to reporters. (The GOP operative described McCarthy as \u201cplaying footsie\u201d with the QAnon-supporting politicians.) Others, including Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, have voted against official condemnations of the conspiracy theory. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona has dabbled in conspiracy theories that have been interpreted by QAnon supporters as signals of his allegiance, which he has denied. A staff member for newly-elected Rep. Bob Good of Virginia was among those in Washington on January 6 \u2013 along with her husband, a local Republican Party chairman. There are plenty of Republicans in the conference disturbed by the prominence of \u201cfellow travelers\u201d of these conspiracy theorists and the long-term impact this will have on the party. \u201cIf leadership doesn\u2019t hold certain members accountable, there\u2019s going to be a real problem,\u201d one Republican House member told CNN this week. Mia Love, a former Republican representative from Utah and a CNN contributor, said failure to deal decisively with toxic members puts the unity of the GOP conference at risk. \u201cKevin, who I adore, who I have a lot of respect for, the only advice I can give him, if he wants to preserve the conference, he needs to deal with this,\u201d Love said. While the actual members of Congress who are aligned with QAnon is relatively small, the influence of the broader conspiratorial mindset is not. In the end, 147 Republican members in both the House and the Senate, including McCarthy, voted to object and overturn the election results following the assault on the Capitol. That\u2019s 56% of all Republicans in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that there are some voters that get into this theory and so politicians don\u2019t push back. People who are in power embrace it,\u201d said Seth Masket, a professor of political science at the University of Denver. \u201cIt seems to be a path to success in the Republican Party.\u201d The centrality of Trump to the QAnon theory cannot be overstated, which is why it\u2019s an open question as to the movement\u2019s staying power. As long as he was the President, however, party leaders have essentially welcomed conspiracy theorists into the coalition. Across the GOP, the emergence of QAnon candidates was either gently condemned or tolerated. While Republican House leaders opposed Greene in the competitive GOP primary in Georgia and condemned offensive comments she made about Black people and Jewish donors to the Democratic Party, the National Republican Campaign Committee ended up spending thousands of dollars to support her election. The NRCC also backed Boebert\u2019s general election campaign, and both were supported by Trump. Whether the conspiracy survives in the next few years as a force in the party depends in part on how much Trump remains on the scene. For years, the President has been a crucial actor in the narrative of QAnon, and experts say it\u2019s not certain how believers will factor him in once he\u2019s no longer President. Emerging in far-right online forums in mid-2017, QAnon presented itself as an outlet for Trump supporters seeking a unifying explanation for setbacks or disappointments in the administration. By the time the coronavirus pandemic was in full swing, QAnon had absorbed much of the far-right conspiracy theories and concerns, says Rothschild. \u201cWith the pandemic, everything became about everything,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt turns into Bill Gates, it turns into China, it turns into 5G. This all sort of mushes together and it becomes impossible to separate.\u201d Once Trump began ramping up in his own false conspiracy theorizing about a \u201cstolen election,\u201d there was a ready and willing community of people online ready to subsume those lies and act on them. Republican and conservative allies of the President amplifying his false election claims gave more legitimacy to a movement of people who did not just believe in a conspiracy \u2013 they were preparing to fight against it. But the January 6 assault on the Capitol showed Republicans and the country the consequences of tolerating conspiracy theories without fully understanding them or justifying the threat of danger from them. For some, it was a wake-up call that the contagion had spread and could not be contained. But enough of a wake-up call? The slipperiness of \u201csupport\u201d for QAnon means politicians \u2013 even Greene and Boebert \u2013 maintain the plausible deniability that they aren\u2019t aligned with the violent end of QAnon. \u201cTo the extent it shows up in Congress, it\u2019s mostly in the form of \u2018just asking questions\u2019 or \u2018providing a voice\u2019 on behalf of constituents,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cFor those where this is a vocal constituency there\u2019s little incentive to confront the people who are voting for you. So I suspect it will be laissez-faire in most cases until another instance where it rears its head and can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A pro-Trump mob in thrall to White supremacy and incited by President Donald Trump laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6. With their Confederate flags and zip ties in hand, rioters sought to overturn the legitimate election that President-elect Joe Biden won two months ago. Trump faces his second impeachment vote on Wednesday as a result of his role in the insurrection. On top of so much else, the election in November made clear the political might of Black voters, who saw the ballot box as a means of protesting against Trump and the racial animus that he and his acolytes embody. White backlash to racial equality \u2013 including an empowered Black electorate \u2013 isn\u2019t unusual. In fact, what makes the dynamic disturbing is how common it\u2019s been throughout US history. And the issue isn\u2019t just the backlash itself. It\u2019s also the fear (real or alleged) of backlash \u2013 fear that might hold back progress. And while the attack on the Capitol was horrifying, it wasn\u2019t the first manifestation of White backlash. In important ways, this episode echoed the past. The years immediately following the end of the Civil War in 1865 saw the ratification of the three Reconstruction amendments. The 13th Amendment ended slavery; the 14th Amendment made it such that all people could be US citizens, regardless of race; and the 15th Amendment prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Finding the women of the White nationalist movement By the mid-1870s, though, the country had essentially abandoned its equal rights efforts, as Supreme Court decisions as well as Jim Crow laws and revanchist campaigns in the South eroded the civil, economic and political progress that Black Americans had gained. White backlash was also apparent during the struggle for Black freedom in the mid-20th century. As Black Americans fought to dismantle their country\u2019s abiding system of racial caste \u2013 a battle that secured, among other things, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \u2013 many of their White counterparts assailed such actions as excessive. \u201cFor many White backlashers in the 1960s, the era of what the historian C. Vann Woodward called the \u2018second Reconstruction,\u2019 the first Reconstruction remained a negative model,\u201d the Cornell University professor Lawrence Glickman wrote for The Atlantic last year. \u201cThey viewed its reform as overly fast-paced, and felt that it foregrounded Black civil rights at the cost of White people\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d The rioters who violently took over the Capitol last week had a lot in common with their forebears, particularly in their expressions of White grievance and entitlement and in their zero-sum belief that sharing rights and resources isn\u2019t a gain for everyone but, instead, a loss that White Americans shouldn\u2019t have to endure. It was no coincidence that \u201cStop the Steal\u201d was one of the mob\u2019s rallying cries. It referred to cities with high Black populations that broke for Biden and was said in support of Trump, whom the journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates in 2017 called the country\u2019s \u201cfirst White president.\u201d Crucially, while Trump\u2019s loss in November \u2013 and more precisely, the outgoing President\u2019s false claims that a free and fair election was fraudulent \u2013 was the most immediate catalyst of last week\u2019s iteration of White backlash, Trump didn\u2019t create the underlying racial resentment. \u201cIt was White backlash, but the seeds were already there,\u201d Seyward Darby, the editor in chief of The Atavist Magazine and the author of the 2020 book \u201cSisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism,\u201d told CNN. Last July, Darby warned of possible backlash to the reenergized Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cOnce Trump is no longer President, I worry that people are going to attempt to move past this faster than they should, that they\u2019re going to say: Now back to some semblance of normalcy. But the unrest had been growing even before Trump,\u201d she added in a recent interview.   The deadly assault on the Capitol has fit into the history of White backlash in another way, too: in how it has influenced \u2013 or really, circumscribed \u2013 conversations on what an \u201cacceptable\u201d path forward looks like. Consider that while some Republican lawmakers have called on Trump to resign over inciting the mob, others have asked Democrats not to pursue impeachment, fretting that such a move would be divisive and cause havoc. It\u2019s the sort of thinking that prizes reconciliation over justice. \u201cFor some in power, the reason not to impeach isn\u2019t an argument based on politics or on justice but on the notion that if you want to stay out of trouble, then you shouldn\u2019t impeach. This sentiment is common,\u201d Glickman told CNN. \u201cIn other words, White backlash can obstruct progress, but it\u2019s not always the backlash itself but the threat of backlash that impedes progress in US history.\u201d That said, Glickman detected something of a silver lining to the events of the past week. While the seizure of the Capitol demonstrated anew that White backlash can lead to a brutal end, Georgia\u2019s runoff elections on January 5 illustrated that it\u2019s possible to thwart weaponized racial grievance. In those races, voters elected Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff \u2013 a Black man and a Jewish man \u2013 to the US Senate. Their victories, propelled by Black organizers\u2019 efforts, evoked the poignant history of the civil rights movement. \u201c(Republican opponents) Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue tried very hard to make traditional backlash arguments the centerpieces of their campaigns, but it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Glickman said, referring to Republican attacks on Warnock, especially, as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cradical.\u201d In this wider context, Democrats\u2019 recent political triumphs feel all the more significant. \u201cI think that it\u2019s important not to predict that we\u2019re fated to be controlled by White backlash,\u201d Glickman said. \u201cBecause that doesn\u2019t give Americans enough credit for their own agency in determining our future.\u201d",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. Last month, a man drove to Washington, DC , police said, with explosive-making materials and threatened detonations near the US Capitol, although no functioning weapons were found in his vehicle. You\u2019d think this would have been a big story, but after what seemed like just a few hours, it was swamped by the news of the Taliban taking over Afghanistan. This is understandable, as what was unfolding a world away was both dramatic and tragic. However, it was also a mistake to so quickly look away from the DC standoff. From the violent Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 to the January 6 US Capitol riot this year, and the planned right-wing rally at the Capitol this Saturday drawing concerns of yet more violence, right-wing domestic extremism has become a serious problem in America. We can\u2019t be distracted from the problem of radicalization in the US. The motivations of 49-year-old Floyd Ray Roseberry, the alleged would-be bomber in DC, aren\u2019t exactly clear, but the videos he posted on social media were filled with typical right-wing talking points, including that the election had been stolen, that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president, and that illegal immigrants get health insurance. He also talked a lot about starting a revolution. A federal magistrate judge agreed to a 30-day delay last month after a court-appointed psychologist said Roseberry was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and needed further medical treatment. Roseberry could face up to life in prison. Pay attention to the far right's use of memes to stir extremism There is not much new here, unfortunately, as far as stories of radicalization go. What struck me, though, were Roseberry\u2019s references to the South. For example, during a 30-minute livestream on his now-removed Facebook page on August 19, he said \u201cYou thought the South wasn\u2019t coming, well, Joe Biden, the South\u2019s come.\u201d This resonated for me. Back in June, I drove to Gettysburg from my home in Philadelphia and when touring the famed Civil War battlefield, I had several arresting experiences. I noticed in front of the North Carolina memorial at the site, somebody had placed a small Confederate flag. And when I went to inspect more closely, a man nearby, who seemed to be standing reverently at attention, blurted out, \u201cGood, gotta take a picture before the woke people take it down.\u201d I politely ignored him and then drove to the Virginia memorial where I saw another small Confederate flag. I overheard a father tell his young daughters, \u201cThey\u2019re tearing down statues all over the country.\u201d I had gone to Gettysburg that day to reflect on our country during a particularly dark period. I also went to gain some measure of inspiration from the sacrifices Union soldiers had made in 1863 to preserve our country. But what I realized was that some of the people at Gettysburg that day had gone for another purpose. Their cause wasn\u2019t the American experiment. It wasn\u2019t pluralism. It wasn\u2019t democracy. If you asked them, they likely wouldn\u2019t have said it was white nationalism or the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, either. At least, not exactly. In fact, we can\u2019t know what was in Roseberry\u2019s mind, exactly, but I doubt that even his cause was actual \u201cRevolution,\u201d and all that would really entail. What vaccine advocates need to understand about religious exemptions America today appears to be filled with people who are ready to believe in something. Anything. Sometimes it seems that it doesn\u2019t matter so much what. As long as the thing gives them a sense of power over their lives. And a small fraction of these folks isn\u2019t just ready to believe, they\u2019re ready to commit violent acts like Roseberry allegedly seemed geared up to do. This longing for something to believe in exists on the left too, of course, but it manifests itself in violence to a much lesser extent. A Washington Post analysis of data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found since 2015, attacks from right-wing extremists have resulted in 91 deaths, as opposed to 19 from those on the far-left. Obviously, both are unacceptable. I lived in Cairo for 16 months after graduating from college in 2005, and aside from learning Arabic, I learned a lot about Egyptian society. One thing I found was many people who were underworked or out of work, politically aggrieved, bored and alienated. Decades of authoritarianism, corruption and a dysfunctional economy had left the Egyptian people without sufficient jobs or educational opportunities, housing, access to social services, and, of course, a legitimate form of government. These factors caused many Egyptians to be vulnerable to outlandish conspiracy theories, such as \u201cthe Mossad or the CIA were involved in planning 9/11,\u201d as well as fundamentalist forms of Islam that oppressed others\u2014particularly women. It was these theories and extreme forms of Islam that supplied many with identity. Obviously, there are differences between America today and Egypt in 2005. But I see similarities, too. Our own increasingly dysfunctional society has left too many Americans, particularly on the right, vulnerable to radicalization. Of course, only a tiny percentage of right-wing extremists in the United States become terrorists, or even would-be terrorists. But like in Egypt, many derive meaning and purpose from such a belief system, as psychologists have pointed out. This isn\u2019t to say some Americans on the right aren\u2019t bigoted or don\u2019t hold white supremacist beliefs. It\u2019s just to say what\u2019s leaving so many people susceptible to radicalization isn\u2019t merely ideology, but other important issues, such as lack of community, joblessness, mental health problems and deficient health care, among others. A Rand study examining former extremists in the US, including those characterized as white supremacists, found out of 32 cases of radicalization, 22 noted financial instability, 17 noted mental health challenges, and 16 noted victimization, stigmatization, or marginalization. These vulnerabilities are exploited by the right-wing media and political establishment, including on social media, who play to people\u2019s worst fears and instincts. (This dynamic isn\u2019t so different from the poisonous one between radical clerics and their followers throughout the Arab world). Milley's reasonable actions raise a serious question Indeed, from his videos, it seems Roseberry wasn\u2019t just upset immigrants were getting free health care; he was upset, he said, he and his wife (who has cancer) had been denied coverage for essential treatments. Given the complex nature of the problem of radicalization in America, the question becomes what can we do to counter it? To address economic grievance, we need a robust economy that provides investment to communities across the country and meaningful work to millions more Americans. Perhaps the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed last month is one part of this solution. To address the epidemic of isolation, we need to rebuild communities across America and consider outside-the-box ideas similar to a Minister of Loneliness like they have in Great Britain since 2018. The position was created after a report found that more than 9 million people in the country\u2014an estimated 14% of the population\u2014often or always felt lonely, which reportedly cost UK employers up to $3.5 billion annually. Encouraging young people to participate in a national year of service could reduce prejudice, promote empathy, and decrease hyper polarization in the country. We could also focus significant resources online to counter misinformation and radicalization. And last, it is essential for politicians across the political spectrum to denounce radicals, whether on the January 6 US Capitol riot or from this Saturday\u2019s rally at the same site. On this front, however, as long as the right-wing media and political establishment fuels and validates the polarization and conspiracy theories that drive radicalization, as well as benefits from it, we\u2019re in for a rough road ahead. When Roseberry referenced the South rising again, maybe he was channeling old fashioned, southern racism and white supremacy\u2014that is often the meaning of such a pronouncement. The same goes for the two people at Gettysburg.  Or maybe something else is going on here. These people are singing the same lyrics we\u2019ve heard throughout American history. But it\u2019s a different time\u2014a different song. This isn\u2019t just about white nationalism. It\u2019s about a society that doesn\u2019t provide enough positive outlets for meaning and purpose and leaves too many of us behind. And ultimately, it\u2019s about a political, right-wing cable TV and social media environment, filled with America\u2019s own brand of radical clerics, that breeds radicalization. We must not look away.",

View more opinion on CNN. Summer\u2019s over and Donald Trump\u2019s dark 2024 campaign has begun. No one can know what is in the man\u2019s heart as he rails against removing symbols of the racist Confederate rebellion or urges folks to tune-in for his boxing analysis on the somber day when America remembers the terrorist attacks of 9/11 where almost 3,000 people were killed. But as a performance, these moves communicate Trump\u2019s commitment to those in his base who may not only agree with him on specific issues but, more significantly, love the tone he strikes. Their loyalty became clear when he told the 2016 Republican National Convention,  \u201cI am your voice,\u201d thrilling the crowd. Trump\u2019s boorishness is the point. As it provokes outrage from the political mainstream, it aligns him with those who may feel alienated in a world that has been upended by economic and social change. New assumptions about everything from same-sex marriage to the unseen currents of racism in our institutions are sweeping away an old order while the tech and service industries supplant manufacturing. According to Harvard professor of psychology Joshua Greene, the methods Trump uses to connect with his followers resemble the ways in which the leader of a gang of outcasts might rally his group against polite society. Greene says that in choosing to make himself unacceptable to liberals and even moderates, Trump is essentially tattooing himself with scary symbols, which proves to his followers that he\u2019s the real deal. \u201cThis is why, I think, the Republican base trusts Trump like no other,\u201d Greene said. The former (and perhaps future) president\u2019s first salvos in his post-Labor Day campaign have included fulsome praise for Confederate general (and traitor to the United States) Robert E. Lee, a new false claim that millions of ballots were not counted in the last election, and the bizarre announcement that on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 he will serve as guest commentator for a novelty boxing match. Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Ann Coulter seen in a revealing new light If you sense that Trump is raising a middle finger at mainstream America, I\u2019d say you should go with that feeling. This is a man who gained office with childish insults and unseemly boasts like, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d  As president, he was disgraced by two separate impeachments and trials in which he was acquitted only because of his party\u2019s control of the Senate. His record of false and misleading statements exceeded 30,000, and yet he collected 75 million votes in his failed attempt at winning a second term. The connection between Trump and his most avid supporters, including those who attacked the US Capitol on January 6 to stop the validation of the election, is energized by the jolts of emotion \u2013 outrage, anger, and disdain for others \u2013 that he provides with his outlandish statements and behavior. His ability to exploit emotion was noted when he first began to run for president and, since it worked, he kept on doing it. He does this by making himself into a symbol of things many reasonable Americans abhor \u2013 things like coded racism, misogyny, white nationalism \u2013 defying those who might criticize him. The Trump base is so loyal that when he falsely declared that he lost the 2020 election due to fraud, they not only believed him, they demanded that other Republican leaders join the chorus of complaints. In the month since, dozens of legal efforts, ballot reviews, and state-level investigations have turned up no evidence that fraud determined the outcome of the election. Nevertheless, thousands who believed the Big Lie mounted an attack on the US Capitol on January 6 which left one of their own, Ashli Babbitt, and four others dead, 140 police officers injured, and the nation traumatized.  A responsible political leader would consider the January 6 tragedy and do what\u2019s necessary to prevent a recurrence. With his new false claim of voter fraud, Trump proves himself to be the opposite kind of leader, one who revs up the anger in his base with no apparent regard for the consequences. For him, what surely awaits is a greater sense of power over the GOP and a fundraising bonanza. The country should prepare for the potential of more chaos and tragedy as some of his followers, who plan to return to the Capitol on September 18, are inspired by his reckless defiance.",

Barack Obama\u2019s 60th birthday offers America a chance to reflect on its past, contemplate its present and look toward a future indelibly shaped by the nation\u2019s first Black President. The occasion of Obama\u2019s milestone birthday on August 4 touches a personal chord in those of us who witnessed, participated in, or did a mixture of both during the historic 2008 presidential campaign. The former President is celebrating on Friday with an outdoor party in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where he has long vacationed. Citing a source, CNN reported that rather than bring gifts, guests are being asked to consider supporting non-profits that aid both boys and young men of color and adolescent girls around the world, along with those that help train upcoming community leaders. I remember watching the 43-year-old Illinois state senator deliver the 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote at Boston\u2019s FleetCenter on July 27. Obama, who looked so much younger than his age, spoke for 17 minutes about the virtues of American democracy. That speech, which made him a political superstar, deftly introduced autobiographical themes that would become familiar beats in Obama\u2019s public narrative. Obama presented his biracial background \u2013 as the son of an immigrant Kenyan economist and a White anthropologist with Kansas roots who met as students in Hawaii at a time when interracial marriage was illegal in parts of America \u2013 as a lens through which to view the dynamic racial progress the nation had not yet fully achieved but remained committed to. In retrospect, parts of the speech that pushed back against dividing America into red states and blue states appear now na\u00efve or hopelessly romantic, cynical even, considering the deadly and racially charged partisanship of our times. But the power of Obama\u2019s keynote speech \u2013 and his presidential campaign four years later \u2013 was the way in which it tapped into democratic aspirations best reflected in the Black freedom struggle he took pains to both celebrate and, at times, distance himself from. Obama delivered a speech from America\u2019s cradle of liberty that could only be given by a Black politician able to acknowledge historic divisions of race, class, gender, religion and sexuality, while crafting a vision of an American citizenship capable of transcending these divides. Obama offered his personal biography and political ambitions as a bridge between past and contemporary civil rights activists. More than that, he positioned himself as a political leader whose rhetoric and vision framed the nation as a patchwork quilt of diverse communities that grew stronger as they recognized the common ground of citizenship and dignity that united them. 'Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union' looks back on his life and legacy As he approaches 60, Obama\u2019s hair has turned grayer, he looks even thinner now than he did as commander in chief and one can see the impact of time \u2013 and being President \u2013 in the wrinkles and creases that appear visible on a once unlined face. Last summer, Obama said that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d but decried efforts to \u201cDefund the Police\u201d as bad politics that alienated potential allies. Yet, time out of office has radicalized the preternaturally cautious Obama into calling for an end to the filibuster, if that\u2019s what\u2019s required to preserve democracy. His characterization of the filibuster as \u201canother Jim Crow relic\u201d offered further proof that Obama 2.0 displays a willingness to confront America\u2019s long history of structural racism with the kind of bracing candor he rarely embraced as President. Obama continues to serve as a Rorschach test for the American political imagination. He likely always will. The first Black president didn\u2019t so much as flip the script of American politics as write himself into it. Obama proved to be a fervent believer in American exceptionalism. Boston launched Obama\u2019s national political career, setting the stage for his successful campaign for the US Senate that he would win that November and for his presidential campaign, which he announced from the Illinois State House in February 2007. Obama to host Covid-compliant 60th birthday party amid rising virus concerns, source says Obama\u2019s keynote speech turned his memoir \u201cDreams of My Father,\u201d first published in 1995, into an instant bestseller. He followed this up with \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d a more conventional but still insightful book about the sources of civic nationalism that united Americans far more than they divided us. He took the title of his second book from a phrase used by his then pastor, Jeremiah Wright, the fiery Black Liberation theologian who headed Trinity United Church in Chicago. Wright came from a tradition that criticized White supremacy with the kind of candor that \u2013 although very much mainstream in 2021 \u2013 proved scandalous when clips were played by conservative news outlets during the presidential campaign. Obama\u2019s pastor problem took the lid off the most explosive issue of the 2008 Democratic primary contest and the subsequent general election: a Black man was running for president and had a good chance to win. Barack Obama Fast Facts His candidacy blew the lid off far-flung conspiracy theories that would move from the margin to the center of American political discourse over the last 15 years. Fabricated rumors that Obama was a secret Muslim, had been born in Kenya and educated at an Islamic madrassa as a young boy in Indonesia abounded. Clips of Wright excoriating America\u2019s imperial domestic policy seemed to confirm that Obama \u2013 handsome, telegenic, and brilliant \u2013 was a Trojan horse (his middle name was Hussein after all) sent by America\u2019s enemies to destroy us from within. Obama pushed back against this characterization by delivering a bravura March 18, 2008 \u201crace speech\u201d in Philadelphia\u2019s Constitution Hall surrounded by a backdrop of American flags that unsubtly signaled his fealty to the American dream. In that speech, Obama portrayed both Black anger over racial slavery and Jim Crow and White resentment against affirmative action as morally equivalent. He refused to dissociate himself from Pastor Wright (but did several days later) and he recounted that his own White grandmother (Toot, short for Tutu, in the affectionate Hawaiian parlance) expressed fears of Black men that made him cringe. The speech was an enormous success, touted in some quarters as the most significant speech on America\u2019s racial divide since Lincoln. Obama went on to be elected in what still represents the equivalent of a modern-day landslide, with 43% of White voters forming part of a new political coalition: he was also backed by 95% of Black voters and two-thirds of LatinX voters. Obama\u2019s victory ushered in America\u2019s Third Reconstruction, a period that continues to this day and has been marked by stunning and unprecedented instances of racial progress. But it has also touched off a fierce backlash symbolically represented by Donald Trump and his MAGA followers. Black people in America experience voter suppression, racially disparate impacts of the Covid-19 health pandemic, police violence against their communities, mass incarceration and the stubborn persistence of racial segregation and economic impoverishment. By 2020, even Obama seemed to come around and understand the existential dangers posed by the resurgence of White nationalism in American politics. Sixteen years after the fresh-faced young state senator delivered a soaring, optimistic keynote speech in Boston, the now-former President delivered a virtual address that warned that racism might produce the end of the republic. America\u2019s long, rough and tortured road toward a renaissance that might achieve Black dignity and full citizenship has produced thunderclap historical moments. The ratification of the 13th amendment on December 6, 1865, that abolished racial slavery was one. The Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision announced by the Supreme Court on May 17, 1954, was another. Barack Obama\u2019s November 4, 2008, presidential election victory proved to be the third of these hinge points in our nation\u2019s history. Each of these moments ushered in periods of reconstruction; political, legislative, legal, and personal soul searching that had far-reaching consequences, not only for their eras but most especially our own. Obama\u2019s victory, against the backdrop of economic recession, a mortgage crisis that disproportionately impacted Black Americans, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq inspired domestic and global celebrations and outsized political expectations. The Obamas' 'We the People' animated shorts Obama proved to be the last American President to lead under the hard-fought national civil rights consensus on Black citizenship that had been rhetorically supported by commanders in chief since John F. Kennedy. This bipartisan era compelled Democrats and Republicans to offer support for the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday and acknowledge the importance of Black History Month, and it led to the creation of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the first-ever built with federal funds. Beneath such public displays of unity around race matters lay policy divisions over affirmative action, racial integration in public schools and neighborhoods, racial disparities in health, wealth, and employment and culture wars over the very meaning of American identity, democracy and citizenship that roiled Obama\u2019s presidency before exploding during the Trump Era. The trauma of the past four years, most notably the partisan response to a health pandemic and rioting at the US Capitol, makes many nostalgic for the era that the young Barack Obama thrived in. Such longing yearns for a period before the Birther movement, QAnon, White riots and GOP-led voter suppression and anti-Critical Race Theory legislation. Before Trump conjured the Big Lie of a stolen presidential election, there appeared an alternative course for the nation to embark on. Barack Obama\u2019s enduring power is his ability to allow us to imagine ourselves as a better country, society and people. As a young state senator, presidential candidate, and commander in chief, Obama called America to be its aspirational best. The Obama campaign\u2019s signature innovation was not the use of social media nor the trappings of celebrity that eventually consumed aspects of the American presidency. Obama\u2019s ability to tell Americans a fresh interpretation of their own national story helped to make history. Obama\u2019s narrative explained that \u201cwhat began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored \u2013 that will not be deterred, that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation \u2013 repair this world and make this time different than all the rest.\u201d The poetry of these words continues to resonate, now more than ever, within Americans who recognize that, however flawed and imperfect a political vessel Obama turned out to be, the freedom dreams he expressed at his best are bigger than any one political leader and can thus never be betrayed. Obama called us to be our best selves in a manner that allowed supporters to criticize, empathize with and celebrate his successes and shortcoming as our own. He imagined America as a large national family where even political opponents could find kinship in their love of civic ideals rooted in a generous reading of the founding documents as expansive enough to include all those who had been left out at the time of its writing.  Keenly aware of the historic divisions, conflicts and disagreements that perpetually threatened to undermine the republic, for a brief period Obama allowed the world to see America as a place of endless possibilities. His 60th birthday calls us to reflect on the seemingly vast distance between that time and our own, as well as the steps necessary to renew the nation\u2019s democratic faith and confidence in the ability to achieve the country we have always imagined ourselves to be.",

View more opinion at CNN. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, is betting his political future on a nationwide Covid health pass. Approaching the launch of his campaign for re-election to a second five-year term next April, Macron went on nationwide television on the eve of France\u2019s national holiday of Bastille Day with a series of some of the world\u2019s most stringent anti-pandemic edicts \u2013 an effort to stifle the surging Delta variant, he said, and fend off a fourth Covid wave. Seemingly prepared to take hard and politically polarizing choices, Macron announced Monday that all health care workers \u2014 in hospitals, nursing and retirement homes, even home-care nurses \u2014 must be fully inoculated against Covid or, quite simply, they won\u2019t be paid after September 15. And beginning August 1, nobody will be allowed in any French bar, restaurant, shopping mall, concert hall, or any long-distance train or airplane without a \u201csanitary pass\u201d attesting to full vaccination or a recent negative Covid test. Violators could face fines up to 45,000 euros ($53,000) and a year in jail. The blunt truth about vaccination Macron further incentivized this push toward vaccination by announcing that government reimbursement for most Covid tests are ending, making it increasingly expensive to keep current the now all but mandatory health pass. The measures already seem to be working \u2013 and to an extent that ought to give President Joe Biden or any number of other world leaders something to consider as a model. French Prime Minister Jean Castex reported that in the 18 hours after Macron\u2019s speech, some 792,339 injections were administered nationwide, while Doctolib, the website that registers appointments, reported another 1.7 million bookings for shots, both all-time records in France. The US, by contrast, administered around 341,000 vaccines on Tuesday in a population that is five times the size of France\u2019s. Politically, though, it could be risky for Macron. His principal challenger for re-election, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) party, immediately blasted the mandates as \u201ca serious decline in individual freedoms,\u201d and another libertarian opposition presidential candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, branded it as \u201cabuse of power and social discrimination.\u201d But others on the right and on the left, including leaders of both the socialists and communists, applauded it. Socialist Party spokesman Bernard Vallaud observed \u201ceverything must be done to prevent the fourth wave.\u201d France\u2019s struggles with Covid and fears over an imminent fourth wave have also impacted relations with the United States, which refuses to admit nearly all French passport-holders, though Americans are welcome now in France. While not mentioned in any of the public toasts, the issue was an undercurrent at the Bastille Day celebrations at the French ambassador\u2019s residence in Washington, DC on Wednesday. The best way to beat the Delta variant Macron is also hoping the financial benefits of improved Covid control will pay off for him at the polls. In his speech announcing the new vaccination push, he maintained that his plan\u2019s success would assure the nation\u2019s economic expansion over the next year. The French national statistics office is projecting growth by at least 6%, faster than earlier forecasts of 5%. Moreover, Macron, the youngest president in French history, is anxious to frame a path for his country as far ahead as 2030, three years after he would leave office if he wins a second term next April. \u201cThe summer of mobilization for vaccines will also be the summer of recovery\u201d of the economy, Macron assured his 22 million viewers. Beyond France, Macron\u2019s words and actions seem likely to resonate widely, especially since it is becoming increasingly clear that he is anxious to assume the European leadership mantle long held by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel leaves office in September after more than 15 years in power. His ambitions will only be reinforced when France takes charge of the European Union as part of a routine rotation on January 1. But in the case of Covid, Macron already does seem to have seized a leadership that will be hard to deny him. Greece and Italy have also mandated the universal vaccination of health workers, while Germany and Cyprus are requiring those eating in restaurants to prove they\u2019ve been vaccinated. Still, no national plan is as immediately sweeping as that of France.  Macron, with an approval rating hovering around 41%, is undoubtedly facing a challenging re-election bid as his rivals prepare for campaigning to begin formally in September when France returns from its summer break. Still, despite all his battles with the yellow vest movement and other protests, barely 8,000 people mobilized across France on Wednesday according to police estimates, protesting \u201cagainst dictatorship\u201d and the obligatory health pass. Macron already seems to be carving out a political future based on an anti-Covid campaign that the leading French daily Le Monde characterized as more nationalist than five years ago. But it is still a nationalism rooted in membership in a united Europe and a rejuvenated NATO. The last thing Europe, or America, needs is a fourth Covid wave sweeping through France. If the new French measures work, France could become a model of how to deal with a deadly pandemic and those who deny its impact. And that might be enough for Macron to retain his hold on the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace next April.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \u201cOK Boomer, Let\u2019s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\u201d Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Republicans sure do have a bizarre definition of \u201cpatriotism.\u201d Prominent members of the GOP are outraged that hammer thrower Gwen Berry silently turned her body away from facing the American flag while the National Anthem played at the Olympic trials in Oregon Saturday. Berry, who placed third and qualified for the Olympic team, was holding a bouquet of congratulatory flowers in one hand as she then held above her head a black t-shirt that said \u201cACTIVIST ATHLETE.\u201d In response to this peaceful protest, a vocal cadre of Republicans are livid. Rep. Dan Crenshaw said she should be kicked off the Olympic team. Fellow Texas lawmaker Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted, over an article about Berry, \u201cWhy does the left hate America?\u201d Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tweeted, \u201cWhat is wrong with people?\u201d and added that when he was growing up, \u201ceveryone stood for the American flag.\u201d Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted, \u201cIf Gwen Berry is so embarrassed by America, then there\u2019s no reason she needs to compete for our country at the Olympics.\u201d Then, somehow, this became an issue laid at the feet of the White House: On Monday, a Fox News reporter asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki about it. She said that while she hadn\u2019t discussed it with President Joe Biden, \u201cHe is incredibly proud to be an American and has great respect for the anthem and all that it represents, especially for our men and women serving in uniform all around the world.\u201d She continued, \u201cHe would also say, of course, that part of that pride in our country means recognizing there are moments where we, as a country, haven\u2019t lived up to our highest ideals. And it means respecting the rights of people granted to them in the Constitution to peacefully protest.\u201d For her part, Berry says she was \u201cset up\u201d \u2013 that she wasn\u2019t told the anthem would play while she was on the podium. \u201cI never said that I hated the country, never said that. All I said was I respect my people enough to not stand or acknowledge something that disrespects them. I love my people point blank, period.\u201d The plain fact is, her actions are protected under the very constitution that conservative \u201cpatriots\u201d claim to revere, and it would be wildly inappropriate and frankly un-American to remove her from the Olympic team for exercising her rights to free expression and peaceful protest. Why the raised fist is so powerful It\u2019s particularly rich that many of the same conservatives who are criticizing Berry are also some of the chief whiners about so-called \u201ccancel culture,\u201d and that they have had much less to say about the very real acts of insurrection and attacks on America that have come from members and supporters of their own party. Supporters of election-loser Donald Trump stormed the Capitol complex on January 6,  threatened to hang then Vice President Pence, and sent lawmakers \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 frantically scrambling for their lives in a shocking assault on the seat of our democracy. Nearly six months later, a majority of Republicans continued to believe the election was rigged and stolen, a lie stoked by the former president and the Republican Party itself. It\u2019s telling that Cruz is quick to suggest that Berry hates America for peacefully turning away from  the flag, while he doesn\u2019t suggest that supporters of his own party might hate America because they used that same flag to beat a cop as they violently attempted a coup. It\u2019s telling that Cruz thinks that silently protesting America\u2019s centuries-long mistreatment of African-Americans is \u201chatred,\u201d but monuments to an army of racist, traitorous losers can be acceptable in the public square. Berry\u2019s other critics aren\u2019t any better. Cotton infamously wrote an op-ed in the New York Times during protests after the killing of George Floyd urging then-president Trump to use the Insurrection Act to turn American troops against American citizens in \u201can overwhelming show of force\u201d\u2013 an act that that would have more closely resembled China\u2019s brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square than  the an affirmation of American freedom. Dan Crenshaw rightly criticized those who attacked the Capitol on January 6th, but his words came cheap: when it was time to actually hold anyone accountable, he voted against establishing a bipartisan commission to investigate the violence and what led up to it \u2013 declining to join the 35 House Republicans who defied Trump and the leadership and voted for the commission. (The measure passed, but, of course, was killed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate.) And while Crenshaw proclaims that he wants to \u201ccancel Cancel Culture\u201d and complains about a \u201cviolent purge of all things\u2026 that don\u2019t conform to the radical progressive religion,\u201d he has no problem demanding Berry be canceled \u2013 kicked off the Olympic team \u2013 for exercising her constitutional right, including the right to reject American nationalism. As for Scott Walker, he should probably learn the basic history of the country he claims to love. It\u2019s far from the case that \u201ceveryone\u201d used to stand for the anthem and the pledge of allegiance: civil liberties groups, on behalf of religious minorities and ideological objectors, have challenged the requirement to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and salute the flag (and often won) since the 1940s. Retired general: Sen. Tom Cotton couldn't be more wrong And note that while Berry is the locus of this week\u2019s right-wing outrage, the Republican Party is also keeping busy ramping up its efforts to pass vote-suppressing legislation across the nation \u2013 using the dangerous lie that the 2020 election was stolen as cover. Meanwhile, across state legislatures, conservative politicians are pushing laws that seek to limit the degree to which educators can discuss racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination and well-documented historical oppression. They are violating basic principles of free speech. The hypocrisy grates. But it also reveals a profound left-right divide in how so many Americans  think about loving our country. For liberals like myself, part of our patriotic duty is the campsite rule: Leave a place better than you found it. The America I am most proud of is the America that strives to be better; the Americans I most admire are those who fought to make it better, often in the face of conservative rage and often under the heavy hand of unjust laws. I believe that the American constitution wisely protects free speech and expression, and wisely prohibits the establishment of religion; that our founding document extends these liberties and protections to American citizens isn\u2019t just a point of pride, but a crucial set of values that must be protected. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I agree with Berry or not in her decision to turn away from the flag during the National Anthem. What matters is that she\u2019s protected in having the full freedom to do so. That\u2019s American. That\u2019s where I feel proudest of my country. Demanding she\u2019s penalized for legal, constitutionally protected behavior is about as un-American and unpatriotic as it gets.  For many conservatives, love of country seems to be something shallower and more performative. It\u2019s waving a flag. It\u2019s reciting a pledge. It\u2019s standing up for a song. That stuff is easy \u2013 there\u2019s no real work or sacrifice in blindly and reflexively proclaiming loyalty to your country. Protecting the very values enshrined in our constitution when it\u2019s hard, though \u2013 that\u2019s devotion. That\u2019s the work of loving a country beyond performing patriotism. And that\u2019s where so many Republicans are showing that their patriotism is less about a deep belief in American freedom than a desire to demand conformity, orthodoxy and line-toeing. That\u2019s not freedom at all.",

Every year on Presidents Day, the country celebrates our past leaders. In recent years, however, many Americans have begun to question whether we have crossed the line between remembering and worshipping. If the past four years have taught us anything, we\u2019ve learned that presidents are far from perfect, but they are central to American life. Presidents Day is an opportunity to reflect on the oversized impact of commanders-in-chief on our culture, safety and welfare, and democratic institutions \u2013 as well as a moment to think about what we might expect of future leaders. The president\u2019s bully pulpit is one of the most powerful tools at their disposal. Through their public actions, speeches and interviews, presidents can promote a certain type of American culture and values. More than any other president, Theodore Roosevelt embraced and exemplified the power of the bully pulpit. He adopted many progressive causes, including nature conservation, food quality controls, labor protections and trust busting. While these critical reforms were the result of decades of hard work and organizing by thousands of activists, they gained additional momentum when Roosevelt spoke out in favor of their causes and supported legislation to address these ills. We\u2019ve witnessed the contemporary power of the bully pulpit during the transition from Donald Trump\u2019s administration to the Joe Biden presidency. Former President Trump encouraged nationalism and xenophobia, demonized medical professionals and expertise, and proposed cutting $180 billion from food stamp programs during the pandemic when millions of families struggled to put food on the table. In his first few weeks in office, Biden has presented a different set of American values that have welcomed diversity, prioritized science and education, and welcomed the opportunity to assist our neighbors in need. In the age of social media, there are more outlets and opportunities for information than ever, but if anything, the evolution of technology has highlighted the president\u2019s unique platform. No one else can so effectively rise above the noise to reach most Americans and the international community. Every presidential address is covered by most major news outlets. No other person garners that level of media attention. This impeachment trial could surprise us In addition to shaping American culture, the president is uniquely situated to lead during a crisis. The president and the vice president are the only officials elected to represent all Americans, at home and abroad, and thus the only officials who can manage a national crisis. Presidents direct the flow of information to citizens, provide guidance to states, and form a national response. The 1860 election and the tension surrounding Abraham Lincoln\u2019s inauguration offer a natural parallel for the 2021 Inauguration. But the beginning of Lincoln\u2019s presidency provides another, less-discussed lesson for our current moment: the states in the Union couldn\u2019t fight secession individually. Instead, the war effort required the cooperation of the states under the president\u2019s centralized leadership. One war department, one financial system to pay for the troops and supplies, and one state department to keep foreign powers at bay. Watch a sneak peek of CNN's new series 'Lincoln' When a president fails to provide unified direction during a crisis, the costs can be catastrophic. On April 13, 2020, Bob Woodward interviewed then-President Trump, who admitted that he knew about the dangers of the Covid-19 virus a month earlier, but downplayed the threat. Once the pandemic had reached the US, Trump refused to establish a national policy, forced each state government to purchase their own supplies, and when asked at a press conference about his role in the lag in testing, stated, \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d Without concentrated federal action, states were literally bidding against each other to purchase protective gear for their medical workers and other essential goods. Just a few weeks into his administration, Biden is only beginning to implement his strategy to contain the pandemic, but he has invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up the supply of vaccines, provided regular press briefings to keep citizens and local officials informed, and offered guidelines to the states on how to distribute vaccines \u2013 central tenets of a unified federal response to the ongoing crisis. Our democracy and government institutions are delicate and require constant vigilance. Lincoln and the Union Army defeated the Confederacy and saved the Union, but Ulysses S. Grant knew that victory was fragile. When Grant took office in 1869, the Ku Klux Klan and other White supremacist groups were ramping up their efforts to undermine the civil rights of recently-emancipated African Americans and take back control of local governments. After the creation of the Department of Justice, then-President Grant appointed Amos Akerman as his attorney general and instructed him to prosecute cases against the KKK and defend civil rights for Black Americans.  The health of our governing institutions has improved and declined since Grant\u2019s presidency, but our democracy hasn\u2019t faced such historic threats in 160 years. Free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power are the bedrock of American democracy. Trump\u2019s lies about the November 2020 election (and their repetition and amplification by his Republican allies) undermined public faith in our electoral process. Then, Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge his loss represented the end of a 230-year tradition. No president has ever refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. These threats to our democracy culminated in the January 6 violent attack on the US Capitol, intended to prevent the certification of then President-elect Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. Presidents are deeply flawed, just like the rest of us. On Presidents Day, we shouldn\u2019t obscure their failings, but acknowledge the incredible power we entrust to their imperfect hands, consider how they\u2019ve shaped our history, and how we might want to reform the institution going forward.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. is Executive Chair of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He completed his fourth term as the governor of California in 2019. Robert Rosner, a former director of Argonne National Laboratory, is the William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Astronomy & Astrophysics and Physics and the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. He chairs the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\u2019 Science and Security Board. The opinions expressed here are their own. Read more opinion at CNN. For a year now, the world has been ravaged by the horrors of Covid-19. It has caused millions to lose their jobs, overwhelmed health care systems and dramatically changed how we live. The disease has killed more than 2 million people and infected 100 million around the globe. Even so, we face fundamentally greater threats to humanity than this pandemic. We refer to the catastrophic dangers which nuclear weapons and climate change pose \u2013 dangers that preceded this pandemic and will persist long after it ends. Unfortunately, and unlike the priority given to developing a vaccine against the virus, little progress was made to reduce the danger of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal or to effectively slow the carbon emissions warming our planet in 2020. The sudden appearance and confused response to the virus makes all too clear how ill-prepared the world can be when it has to deal with an unprecedented threat of global magnitude. This is why the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced Wednesday that the hands of the iconic Doomsday Clock remain at 100 seconds to midnight \u2013 as close to the end of humanity as the clock has ever been. The temptation, of course, in a dark hour is to cling to even the faintest signs of light and hope. And the truth is that there are some encouraging signs now emerging. However, we continue to teeter at the brink and moving the Clock away from midnight would provide false hope at a time when urgent action is what is needed. Why do we still have The Bomb? In 2020, the nuclear powers continued their blind and bellicose march toward catastrophe \u2013 with the recklessness of spending to \u201cmodernize\u201d weapons systems matched only by recklessness of world leaders\u2019 rhetoric. As we see it, the potential for the world to stumble into nuclear war increased last year. Despite this looming danger, there is little dialogue, but lots of accusation and blame shifting. Governments also failed to sufficiently address climate change in 2020. While the pandemic-related economic slowdown temporarily reduced carbon emissions in 2020, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record high \u2013 and it was one of the two warmest years on record. At a time when fossil fuel use needs to decline rapidly to avoid the worst effects of climate change, oil and gas demand instead are projected to recover to pre-pandemic levels. As we noted in the 2020 Doomsday Clock statement, the existential threats of nuclear weapons and climate change have intensified in recent years because of a threat multiplier: the continuing corruption of the information ecosphere on which democracy and public decision-making depend. This \u201cinfodemic\u201d came into even greater focus as governments struggled to contain and confront the pandemic. An expert's advice on talking to the climate skeptic in your life The now widespread and wanton disregard for science and the large-scale embrace of conspiratorial nonsense \u2013 often driven by political figures and partisan media \u2013 undermined the ability of responsible national and global leaders to protect the security of their constituents in 2020. Nonetheless, we do see some positive developments that could turn back the hands of the Doomsday Clock next year. The election of a US President who respects science, acknowledges climate change as a profound threat and supports international cooperation puts the world on a better footing to address global problems. And the new administration has already taken two meaningful steps: The US is rejoining the Paris climate accord and agreed to extend the New START arms control agreement with Russia for another five years. In the context of a post-pandemic return to relative stability, more action rooted in science and multilateral cooperation could create the basis for a safer and saner world. We will be watching these developments closely in the year ahead, but this is no time for celebration. We remain perilously close to catastrophe. The pandemic laid bare our shared vulnerability. Now, the question is whether we choose to recognize that vulnerability with respect to the climate and nuclear threats. The imperative must be to rise above narrow nationalism and embrace planetary realism, recognizing that nations, no matter how different, share profoundly common interests.  It remains 100 seconds to midnight, the most dangerous situation that humanity has ever faced. It is time for all to take the actions needed to \u2013 quite literally \u2013 save the world.",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) President Joe Biden sought to reassure vaccinated Americans yesterday that they can proceed with their holiday plans without fear of getting seriously ill from Covid-19. He also announced new efforts to combat a surge of US cases during a speech at the White House. Steps include preparing 1,000 military service members to deploy to overburdened hospitals across the country in January and February and the purchase of 500 million at-home rapid Covid-19 tests that Americans who sign up will get by mail \u2013 although there is concern about the availability of tests amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Biden\u2019s remarks came as the CDC released new data showing Covid-19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020, claiming more than 350,000 lives in the US and lowering life expectancy by nearly two years. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Biden insisted yesterday that he and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin will \u201cget something done\u201d on the Build Back Better plan after Manchin defied his party by torpedoing the key piece of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda. Manchin announced Sunday that he could not support the sweeping economic and climate bill that requires his support to pass in the Senate. Separately, Manchin is facing calls from a powerful group close to his heart to reconsider his opposition to the plan: coal miners. America\u2019s largest coal mining union put out a statement this week lauding the legislation\u2019s provisions and pushing Manchin to take a do-over. The union pointed to several items in the plan that it believes are crucial to its members and communities, including tax incentives to encourage manufacturers to build facilities in coalfields, employing thousands of coal miners who are out of work. Michael Flynn, the embattled former national security adviser to former President Donald Trump, is suing to block a House subpoena for his phone records. His lawsuit, filed yesterday, marks the eighth court challenge against the ability of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol to gather evidence on Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Separately, Republican Rep. Scott Perry yesterday declined the panel\u2019s request to speak with him, a move that could set up a showdown between a staunch Trump supporter and the committee. Perry is the first known lawmaker the panel had reached out to for its investigation. His response raises the question of whether the committee will now move to subpoena a fellow House member, a step that could dramatically escalate political tensions between the panel and Republicans. Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country has \u201cevery right\u201d to \u201creact harshly to unfriendly steps\u201d as the US and NATO continue to pressure Moscow over its aggression towards Ukraine. The US and its allies have warned Russia about the consequences of further hostilities amid its continued military buildup near the Ukraine border \u2013 a move that US intelligence has assessed as preparation for a full-scale invasion early next year. NATO\u2019s Secretary General said yesterday that while the alliance is ready to engage in \u201cmeaningful dialogue\u201d with Russia, it will continue to support Ukraine \u201cpolitically and practically.\u201d Russia has amassed thousands more troops along its border with Ukraine in recent days. The world\u2019s biggest commercial aircraft makers are asking the Biden administration to delay the rollout of 5G cell service next month. The CEOs of Boeing and Airbus Americas sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg that says the planned January 5 rollout could cause interference that could \u201cadversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate.\u201d At issue are instruments known as radar altimeters that pilots need to make safe landings in low-visibility conditions. An industry analysis says 5G interference could affect hundreds of thousands of flights each year, delaying planes or causing them to divert. The CEOs are asking the Biden administration to work with the FCC to limit the power of 5G transmissions near airports.

More than 100 people are feared dead after a series of tornadoes\u00a0ripped through several states in the Midwest and South and transformed homes and businesses into piles of rubble late Friday into Saturday. In Kentucky alone, the death toll is at least 80 and will exceed 100, Gov. Andy Beshear told CNN yesterday, making it the deadliest tornado event in the state\u2019s history. Destruction was also reported in Illinois, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee. At least six people died at a collapsed Amazon warehouse in the Illinois city of Edwardsville. Powerful storms like the ones responsible for the weekend\u2019s widespread damage are the \u201cnew normal\u201d in an era of climate change, said FEMA chief Deanne Criswell.

Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent an email saying the National Guard would be present to \u201cprotect pro Trump people\u201d in the lead-up to the US Capitol insurrection, according to a contempt report released late yesterday by the January 6 committee. The report includes several new details about Meadows\u2019 actions before and on January 6, as well as his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. The panel informed Meadows last week it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to advance criminal contempt proceedings against him following his decision to stop cooperating with the committee. A new mandate that requires people in New York state to wear a mask in all indoor public spaces unless businesses implement a vaccine requirement goes into effect today. The new rule was announced late last week by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said she is trying to get ahead of what she calls a \u201cwinter surge\u201d for three main reasons: increased cases, reduced hospital capacity and insufficient vaccination rates in certain areas. The mandate will be in effect until January 15. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa is getting treatment for mild Covid-19 symptoms after testing positive.

The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has expressed \u201coutrage\u201d at the Supreme Court\u2019s decision Friday to allow Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban to stay in effect and said he would use similar legal tactics to tackle gun control in his state. The Supreme Court ruling allowed Texas\u2019 abortion law, which bars the procedure after the first six weeks of pregnancy, to remain in place but said abortion providers have the right to challenge the law in federal court. However, the ruling limits which state officials can be sued by the abortion providers, which could make it difficult for them to resume providing abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy.\u00a0In light of the decision, Newsom said he directed his staff to draft a bill that would allow private citizens to seek injunctive relief \u201cagainst anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells an assault weapon or ghost gun kit or parts in the State of California.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin told President Joe Biden he would \u201creally like\u201d to meet for more talks, according to a video clip released yesterday by Russian state TV. In the short clip from the leaders\u2019 virtual call last week, Putin told Biden, \u201cWe will definitely meet, I would really like that.\u201d The top US State Department official for Europe will travel to Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss Russia\u2019s military buildup near the border of Ukraine, less than a week after Biden told Putin in a call that the US is prepared to impose strong economic measures should Russia invade Ukraine, the State Department announced over the weekend. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system.

            "article_content": "After two and a half weeks of jury selection, the state trial for three men accused of killing Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia begins Friday. Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory McMichael, along with William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, did not face charges in the February 2020 incident until months later, when video surfaced that appeared to show the McMichaels chasing Arbery in their truck as he was jogging. The video, recorded by Bryan, sparked outrage across the nation, becoming yet another example of the perils Black people face while engaged in ordinary activities. The three men are charged with malice and felony murder and have pleaded not guilty. They also face charges of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony. Here\u2019s a look at the people who have played a key role in this case: Arbery, 25, was killed February 23, 2020, while running through a neighborhood outside of Brunswick, Georgia, less than 40 miles north of the Florida-Georgia border. Because his death took place just weeks before the pandemic closed down the country, there wasn\u2019t heavy media coverage of the incident until May 2020, when a 36-second video surfaced that showed two men chasing Arbery. The video begins with Arbery jogging down the middle of a two-lane road toward a pickup truck stopped in the road. Gregory McMichael is in the bed of the truck while his son is standing near the driver\u2019s side door with a shotgun. A timeline of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and the case against 3 men accused of his murder Arbery approaches, and a physical confrontation occurs between him and Travis McMichael. Three shots go off as the two men struggle, which is seen in and out of the frame. After the third shot, blood appears on Arbery\u2019s T-shirt before he stumbles and falls onto the road. The men said they were conducting a citizen\u2019s arrest of Arbery. Georgia overhauled its citizen\u2019s arrest statute in February of this year. Arbery did have run-ins with the law. In 2013, he brought a gun to a high school basketball game, Rod Ellis, the police chief of Glynn County Schools, testified in May. Arbery was also arrested in 2017 after attempting to shoplift a TV, another officer testified. Defense attorneys for the three men wanted to be allowed to tell the jury about these previous incidents and Arbery\u2019s convictions, but state prosecutors argued Arbery\u2019s criminal record was not relevant to the actions the three men took that day, chasing him through the subdivision armed with guns and using pickup trucks. Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley issued an order denying the defense\u2019s motion to use his criminal history during the trial. Arbery was a former high school football player who was known to go running. Jason Vaughn, Arbery\u2019s football coach at Brunswick High School told CNN last year that Arbery loved to run. His death inspired runners around the world to jog 2.23 miles and document their runs using the hashtag #IRunWithMaud to honor him on what would have been his 26th birthday. Gregory McMichael is a former investigator for the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney\u2019s Office. His son, Travis McMichael, was a machinery technician for the US Coast Guard, according to a legal motion filed by his attorney last year. Travis McMichael has one son and a younger sister. He has lived in the Brunswick area his entire life aside from the nine years he spent in the Coast Guard, according to the motion. The McMichaels said they were conducting a citizen\u2019s arrest of Arbery in February because they suspected he was responsible for a string of recent purported burglaries in the neighborhood, even though a Glynn County Police spokesperson later said there had only been one burglary reported more than seven weeks prior to the shooting. According to Georgia\u2019s former law, private citizens could arrest someone if they had immediate knowledge or reasonable suspicion the person had committed a crime. The law now says a detained offender must be released if law enforcement does not arrive within an hour of a call by the person conducting the citizen\u2019s arrest. Suspect in Ahmaud Arbery killing called DA from the crime scene seeking advice, prosecutor says After the shooting, Gregory McMichael left a voicemail with his former boss Jackie Johnson, who was then the Brunswick Judicial Circuit district attorney. \u201cJackie, this is Greg,\u201d the elder McMichael is heard saying in the voicemail. \u201cCould you call me as soon as you possibly can? My (inaudible) and I been involved in a shooting and I need some advice right away. Could you please call me, as soon as you possibly can? Thanks. Bye.\u201d Prosecutors said McMichael was trying to \u201cinfluence and obstruct the investigation.\u201d The father and son were arrested about two months after Arbery died on charges of murder and aggravated assault, and they were indicted in June 2020. The indictment charged the McMichaels with malice and felony murder charges in Arbery\u2019s death, according to the Cobb County district attorney. The McMichaels face several other charges, including aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, per the indictment. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges. In April, the McMichaels were indicted on federal hate crime charges. Each was charged with one count of interference with rights and one count of attempted kidnapping, a news release by the Department of Justice said. William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan is the man who filmed Arbery\u2019s last moments. His attorney, Kevin Gough, has said a polygraph confirmed Bryan was not involved in the incident. Gough told CNN that Bryan was working in his yard when he saw a person he did not know being chased by a vehicle he recognized from the neighborhood. Bryan began filming the incident, at one point getting in his vehicle and following Arbery, who was being chased. Once the video was released, Gough said his client and his family were targeted by protesters. Gough said Bryan and his fianc\u00e9e had to go into hiding. However, Gregory McMichael told police Bryan tried to help the McMichaels stop Arbery earlier, according to an incident report. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation arrested Bryan on charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, according to a news release from the GBI. He was later indicted on federal hate crime charges including interference with rights and with one count of attempted kidnapping. Travis McMichael is being represented by Robert Rubin and Jason Sheffield, who are part of the Decatur, Georgia-based law firm Peters, Rubin, Sheffield and Hodges. Gregory McMichael\u2019s attorneys include Frank and Laura D. Hogue, members of the Macon-based criminal defense law firm Hogue Hogue Fitzgerald & Griffin LLP. Both sets of attorneys said the public rushed to judgment of their clients after they were charged. \u201cWhile the death of Ahmaud Arbery is a tragedy, causing deep grief to his family \u2013 a tragedy that at first appears to many to fit into a terrible pattern in American life \u2013 this case does not fit that pattern,\u201d attorney Frank Hogue said in a statement in May 2020. \u201cThe full story, to be revealed in in time, will tell the truth about this case.\u201d Bryan is represented by Brunswick attorney Kevin Gough. \u201cRoddie Bryan has committed no crime. We look forward to a fair and speedy trial, and to the day when Mr. Bryan is released and reunited with his family,\u201d Gough said in a statement. The attorneys asked a judge to consider allowing them to tell a jury about Arbery\u2019s past run-ins with the law during the state trial. The judge later denied the motion. Cobb County Senior Assistant District Attorney Linda Dunikoski is the lead prosecutor for the Arbery trial. Dunikoski is a career prosecutor with nearly 20 years of courtroom experience, according to her Cobb County biography. She was a prosecutor in the 2015 Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal, where she worked with a team of four other prosecutors in \u201cthe longest criminal trial in the State of Georgia,\u201d according to her biography. The prosecution team for the trial will also include Cobb County Assistant District Attorney Larissa Ollivierre and Senior Assistant District Attorney Paul Camarillo. Dunikoski is the sixth prosecutor to be appointed to the case after a string of recusals in 2020, a local election and one attorney resigning. Jackie Johnson, Brunswick Judicial Circuit district attorney, was the first prosecutor. She recused herself from the case, citing Gregory McMichael\u2019s position as a former investigator in her office. Former district attorney arrested after indictment in connection with Ahmaud Arbery investigation Johnson was indicted and arrested in August 2021 on charges of violating her oath as a public officer and obstructing a police officer. George Barnhill, district attorney of the Waycross Judicial Circuit, then took over the case, but he recused himself because he discovered his son worked in Johnson\u2019s office and had worked with Gregory McMichael on a previous prosecution of Arbery, creating a conflict of interest, according to a news release from the Georgia attorney general\u2019s office. Tom Durden, Atlantic Judicial Circuit district attorney, became the third prosecutor when Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr\u2019s office transferred the case to him. Durden later asked to step down because of a lack of sufficient resources. Carr then requested an investigation by the US Department of Justice, announcing in May 2020 that Joyette M. Holmes, the district attorney in Cobb County, Georgia, was leading the case. Holmes lost her reelection bid for Cobb district attorney in November 2020 to Flynn Broady Jr. Jesse Evans, who worked in the district attorney\u2019s office, then became the lead prosecutor for the case, but he resigned in April, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Timothy R. Walmsley has served as the superior court judge for Georgia\u2019s Eastern Judicial Circuit since 2012, when he was appointed by former Gov. Nathan Deal, according to his official court biography. Prior to becoming a judge, he was magistrate in Chatham County, Georgia, and was a partner at a Savannah law firm, where he specialized in commercial and real estate litigation, according to his bio. One of Travis McMichael\u2019s attorneys said he was concerned the activists, signs and demonstrations outside Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick were \u201can unconscious attempt to influence any jurors.\u201d Walmsley responded by saying the courthouse grounds are public space. He then asked the objecting defense attorneys to draft a legal motion \u201cwalking me through the First Amendment rights you seek to infringe upon and how you intend to do this.\u201d Members of Arbery\u2019s immediate family \u2013 his mother, father and sister \u2013 have spoken with CNN about their thoughts on the case and how it is affecting the family and community. Jasmine Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s sister, told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo in May 2020 the family had been in a \u201cnumbing state\u201d in the months following her brother\u2019s death. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to grieve. We\u2019re in a constant fight mode because we\u2019re trying to seek justice for my brother,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it was a hate crime. \u2026 It was one Black guy and three White guys.\u201d Marcus Arbery Sr., Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s father, told CNN that following the legal process has been \u201crough\u201d for the family. \u201cIt\u2019s still emotional for my family because it\u2019s a raw trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, to watch my son get lynched like that by three White men, ran him down and lynched him like that. It\u2019s really raw.\u201d Mother of Ahmaud Arbery says Trump's police reform executive order doesn't go far enough Wanda Cooper-Jones, the outspoken mother of Ahmaud Arbery, says there won\u2019t be justice until the McMichaels and Bryan are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. When the three men were federally indicted in April, Cooper-Jones said it was \u201cone step closer to justice.\u201d She said the federal hate crime charges were \u201chuge\u201d for her. \u201cThey did the investigation properly and they came out with those indictments. So, my family and I were pleased,\u201d Cooper-Jones said. Cooper-Jones has criticized activists for exploiting her son\u2019s death. Since Arbery\u2019s shooting, a registered trademark, a foundation, a GoFundMe account and a Facebook page memorializing Arbery have been created. \u201cMoney cannot replace what I have lost and the fight for justice does not come without cost,\u201d she said in February. \u201cI was not begging for money and I was prepared to fight for my son either way. I have always worked for what I wanted.\u201d Cooper-Jones was also critical of former President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on policing. The order created a federal database of police officers with a history of using excessive force, enacts some reforms to train police and modestly reduces the use of excessive force. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that order addresses anything that concerns Ahmaud\u2019s case at all,\u201d Cooper-Jones told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection has issued six more subpoenas to top campaign associates of former President Trump, including ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn. The panel believes Flynn, along with a few other Trump campaign employees, attorneys and confidantes, were involved in promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen. However, if the committee wants to get valuable testimony out of this new round of subpoenas, it may need to put pressure on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who was recently handed a contempt of Congress citation for defying his subpoena. The citation is a rare rebuke but carries few inherent consequences. Attorney General Merrick Garland is in control of a lot of this process, and there are no obvious signs he intends to act quickly. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Investigators are working to determine the causes of death of the eight people killed Friday in a crowd surge at a Houston music festival. They are reportedly looking at all possibilities, including whether a batch of counterfeit pills possibly laced with fentanyl played a role. The deadly conditions at the event have prompted a growing number of lawsuits on behalf of concertgoers. Travis Scott, the rapper behind the Astroworld Festival who was also performing at the time of the crush, announced he will pay for the funeral costs of the victims and fund mental health support for survivors. Scott, along with concert promoter Live Nation and others involved in the event, are under intense scrutiny over how the tragedy played out. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The COP26 climate summit in Scotland has entered its second week. By the summit\u2019s end, participants are hoping to have a \u201cGlasgow Agreement\u201d to solidify international priorities like limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, sticking to net-zero emissions commitments and providing help to countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis. However, major fossil fuel providers like Saudi Arabia, China and Russia may resist adoption of a global warming cap. Meanwhile, former US President Obama spoke at the summit and criticized his successor, Trump, for pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement and setting off \u201cfour years of active hostility towards climate science.\u201d He also took aim at the Chinese and Russian Presidents for skipping the COP26 entirely. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Global Covid-19 cases have now surpassed 250 million, just a year and eight months after the World Health Organization put a name to the coronavirus pandemic. Together, the US, India and Brazil account for 40% of reported cases. Globally, about 4 billion people have gotten at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and about 3.1 billion people are fully vaccinated. In the US, Pfizer is\u00a0expected to seek FDA authorization as soon as this week for a booster shot for people 18 and older. Boosters at a certain point after initial inoculation are already FDA-authorized for several groups, including those 65 and older, immunocompromised people and those with certain living or working conditions. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. Tensions are escalating between Poland and Belarus as a weekslong migrant crisis there comes to a head. Polish officials have repeatedly accused the country\u2019s eastern neighbor of moving migrants toward the Polish border. More and more people have been illegally crossing Poland\u2019s border from Belarus in recent weeks \u2013 more than 30,000 since August, according to the Polish Border Guard. Additional military personnel have been deployed to deal with the situation, and another neighbor \u2013 Lithuania \u2013 has also sent troops to the border. European officials have accused Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of encouraging people to cross illegally into Poland and other European neighbors in retaliation for recent sanctions by the EU, the US and Britain over Lukashenko\u2019s crackdown on political opposition. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

Investigators are on the scene of the Florida condo collapse, trying to figure out how and why a portion of the building came down. A six-person team of scientists, structural engineers and a geotechnical engineer from the National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting a preliminary investigation of the collapsed building\u2019s materials, history and applicable building codes at the time it was built, the surrounding ground and other factors. Documents show condo owners were also facing assessments for about $15 million worth of repairs, with payments set to begin a week after the building\u2019s deadly fall. The tragedy has raised haunting questions about building integrity that reach far beyond South Florida. Meanwhile, families are still holding out hope for good news in the agonizing rescue process. So far, 11 people have died and 150 remain missing. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack.

The threat of the Delta variant has some health officials rethinking Covid-19 measures, even among vaccinated people. Experts have said vaccines like those from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech provide high amounts of protection against the variant, but some warn breakthroughs could become more likely if the virus becomes more prevalent. Already in Los Angeles County, officials have reinstated mask guidance for public indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status. Other parts of the world are getting even stricter. South Africa has entered at least two weeks of lockdown to combat a third wave of Covid-19 linked to the Delta variant. About 10 million Australians, including residents in four of the country\u2019s eight capital cities, are also under lockdown. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The Supreme Court left in place a decision that allowed a transgender student to use the bathroom that corresponded to his gender identity. It is a victory for the LGBTQ community, which worried the conservative-leaning high court would reverse the lower court\u2019s decision. The case originated in Virginia, and the ruling covers several states, which means students in those areas can use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity. The issue is unsettled in other states, and another appeal could conceivably make its way back to the Supreme Court. In related news, California announced it will ban state-funded travel to Arkansas, Florida, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia over what it deems anti-LGBTQ laws recently enacted there. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. The Myanmar military\u2019s vise-like grip on power is creating difficult and unexpected conundrums. Staffers at Myanmar\u2019s dozens of diplomatic posts around the world are faced with the choice of staying in their roles and being forced to represent the junta that has killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and locked up democratically elected leaders, or leave and risk placing themselves and their families in danger. A new report reveals the junta has such strong control over the country\u2019s jade trade that it would be \u201cnearly impossible\u201d to buy the gemstone without enriching the generals and their allies. Myanmar produces about 70% of the world\u2019s jade, worth billions of dollars and fueled in large part by demand in neighboring China. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The unprecedented heat wave in the US Northwest rages on, painting a harrowing picture of the kind of extreme temperatures the climate crisis will bring. Portland has set all-time high temperature records, topping out yesterday at 115 degrees. Seattle also reached a record high of 107 degrees. Outdoor venues and services have had to close, and at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, the US Olympic track and field trials were suspended Sunday due to extreme heat. Even more concerning, a lack of air conditioning in some major cities has exacerbated health concerns. Experts say the Pacific Northwest isn\u2019t prepared for heat of this caliber.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) President Joe Biden is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva today for a much-anticipated summit that caps off Biden\u2019s first trip abroad in office. The goal of the meeting is to, in the words of the White House, \u201crestore predictability and stability to the U.S.-Russia relationship.\u201d Biden and Putin will discuss future arms control arrangements, the recent ransomware attacks that the US believes have been carried out by criminal groups in Russia, climate change, and the Kremlin-imposed restrictions on the US diplomatic presence in Russia. Biden and his administration are still fully formulating a strategy on how to approach the US\u2019 tense relationship with Russia, and over the last few weeks, Biden has sought advice from Russia experts, political advisers, national security aides and even fellow world leaders on how to engage with Putin and reshape relations. A previously secret batch of emails was released by the House Oversight Committee yesterday, and the messages shed new light on how former President Donald Trump pressured the Justice Department during his quest to overturn the 2020 election results. The White House and the DOJ aren\u2019t supposed to mesh when it comes to investigations and prosecutions, in order to keep politics out of the justice system. But these latest emails show Trump was unrelenting in crossing that invisible line, and that he and his lawyers saw the DOJ as a way to legitimize their false election claims. Also of note: Jeffrey Rosen, acting attorney general in the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency, was prepared to resign rather than buy into Trump\u2019s claims. Under the Biden Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland, more and more documents concerning Trump\u2019s controversies are being released to relevant committees. The CDC has determined the Delta variant is now a \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d a designation given to strains of the virus that scientists believe are more transmissible or can cause more severe disease. Currently, the variant, which was first discovered in India, accounts for about 10% of infections in the US, but some experts are worried it could become the dominant strain. (Currently, the dominant strain in the US is a different variant, first discovered in the UK.) It\u2019s just another reason vaccinations are important, doctors say. In fact, some pediatricians in the US say they\u2019ve been vaccinating as many adults as children. It\u2019s fairly common and convenient practice, one pediatrician said, to offer vaccines to all family members who come into a pediatrician\u2019s office. The Israeli military struck targets in Gaza overnight, marking the first airstrikes there since a ceasefire went into effect nearly one month ago after a spate of historic violence. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the airstrikes were in response to incendiary balloons launched from Gaza earlier in the day. The IDF says the balloons were launched as a protest to a provocative far-right flag march in Jerusalem during which some extremists chanted \u201cDeath to Arabs\u201d and \u201cThis is our home.\u201d While there hasn\u2019t been a retaliation for the airstrikes yet, the situation along the Israel-Gaza border remains extremely tense, and the possibility of an imminent and serious escalation still looms. Members of the House Intelligence Committee will receive a classified briefing this morning on UFOs \u2013 or, rather, UAPS (Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon). UFOs have been a very controversial topic circling Washington, as military leaders have argued for years over whether to take the sightings seriously. Even as sightings of unexplainable objects rose into the hundreds, Pentagon officials have wrestled with how much time and resources to devote to investigating them. So far, it\u2019s been a hard road separating science fiction-level public fascination from real national security implications.

A CDC advisory panel is set to meet today to discuss whether to recommend use of Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. If it does, these vaccinations could begin swiftly (though some already have, after the FDA gave its authorization). A pediatrics group found nearly a quarter of new Covid-19 cases are in kids, so vaccinating them and getting vaccines approved for even younger groups, could be a big help. And remember that B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant first discovered in the UK that experts worried would take over in the US? It now accounts for 72% of coronavirus genetic sequences in the US. Meanwhile, the global pandemic death toll could be as high as 6.9 million, a study finds. That\u2019s more than double the reported total. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, is expected to be ousted from her position as chair of the House GOP conference when the body meets today to vote on her fate. Cheney has been a vocal critic of former President Trump and his supporters, and has called out fellow Republicans for supporting his false claim that the 2020 election was somehow stolen from him. Cheney gave a defiant speech last night on the House floor, shaming colleagues who will vote to strip her of her post and calling Trump\u2019s hold on the GOP \u201ca threat America has never seen before.\u201d Many House GOP members are eager to move on from talking about things like the Capitol riot and want to consolidate their party\u2019s message in order to try to take back the House in the midterm elections.

Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. At least 35 people are dead in Gaza after the latest exchange of airstrikes between Israeli and Palestinian forces last night. Palestinian militants in Gaza fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, which responded with ramped up airstrikes on the coastal enclave, as unrest has spread to cities and towns beyond Jerusalem. Israel declared a state of emergency in the central city of Lod and called up 5,000 reserve troops to active duty to enhance its operation in Gaza. The US and the European Union have both called for a de-escalation of violence, while several countries in the Middle East, including Turkey, have condemned the Israeli police response to tensions in Jerusalem. The UN denounced both the Israeli airstrikes and the Palestinian rocket shelling. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty.

States including Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida have declared emergencies as gas demand soars due to the ongoing Colonial Pipeline crisis. The company is still working to get its system fully operational again following a security hack, and the shutdown has caused serious shortages up and down the East Coast. Some gas stations are fully out of fuel, while others have been set upon by snaking lines of cars. Federal and state leaders have warned businesses against price gouging. Federal officials also say they are considering more ways to ease fuel delivery, like shipping fuel to nearby coastal ports. Even American Airlines has had to add stops on two long-range flights out of Charlotte because of the disruption. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. A sweeping Democratic-backed elections and campaign finance overhaul faced a clash in the Senate Rules Committee, making it clear that Republican opposition to the voting rights bill isn\u2019t flagging anytime soon. The panel was deadlocked on passing the bill, known as the For the People Act. Democrats are hoping to still move it forward as a way to mitigate Republican state-level efforts to restrict voting access. One such effort just passed in Arizona, where Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law a controversial bill that could remove tens of thousands of voters from the state\u2019s early mail-in voting list, which allows a voter to automatically get a ballot by mail for every election. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": "CNN Films\u2019 \u201cRace for the Vaccine,\u201d produced and narrated by Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, traces the world-changing discoveries of the vaccines against Covid-19. Watch Saturday, May 15 at 9 p.m. ET. About 46% of all Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 but the rates differ depending on where you look. At the top of the list is Vermont, where 62% of the population has had at least one vaccine dose. Every state in the Northeast has given at least one dose to over half of its population, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the bottom is Mississippi, where 32% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose. Similarly, every state on its border has vaccinated less than 40% of its residents. The contrast between states and regions largely fits along partisan political lines: States that voted Democratic in the most recent presidential election have higher vaccination rates than those that voted Republican. In fact, the 22 states with the highest percentage of vaccinated people all voted for President Joe Biden. Among the 17 states with the lowest vaccination rates, only Georgia went for Biden, according to the CDC. Pediatricians prepare to vaccinate youngest Covid-19 shot recipients yet Other demographic differences, including age, race and education, have similarly influenced vaccination rates. The five states with the highest percentage of people with at least one dose are Vermont, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Connecticut and New Hampshire. At the other end, the five states with the lowest percentage of people with one dose are Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming and Idaho. These partisan trends are particularly clear within states, too. For example, New York County, which covers heavily Democratic Manhattan, has fully vaccinated 47% of its population. Meanwhile, Orleans County, the rural northwest New York enclave where former President Donald Trump won 67% of the vote, has fully vaccinated 30%. There are slight differences in these state rankings depending on how exactly you measure, such as whether you look at those partially or fully vaccinated, or whether you compare total population, those older than 18 or those older than 65. Still, the overall demographic trends are clear, and they fit cleanly with America\u2019s politics and demographics. President Biden has set a target of having 70% of US adults receive at least one vaccine dose by July 4. As of Monday, four states have already reached that goal. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are only authorized for those 18 and older, but Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for those 12 and older. The differences are largely because young people and Republicans have shown the highest levels of vaccine hesitancy, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in late April. Further, those without a four-year college degree were more likely to say they will not seek out a vaccine, the CNN poll found. Racial demographics also play a role in the differences, as Black and Hispanic people have been vaccinated at rates lower than their percentage share of the population, according to CDC data. Health advocates and polling have indicated vaccine misinformation and a lack of access are the key reasons behind this difference. Combine those demographic trends and you can understand why Vermont, like many New England states, has been so successful at vaccinations \u2013 its population is older and more White, with more college graduates and more Democrats. Mississippi is at the opposite end: younger and less White, with fewer college graduates and more Republicans, according to Census data. US may be turning a corner on Covid-19. Here's when we could see cases and deaths plummet, expert says The Biden administration recently shifted its vaccination strategy to try to address these hesitancy and access issues. One change is to focus less on mass vaccination sites and more on local community clinics and pharmacies. The FDA also authorized the Pfizer vaccine this week for children aged 12 to 15, expanding the pool of those eligible. Still, the differences between and within states underscore the United States\u2019 unparalleled vaccination efforts over the past six months. China says it has administered more total vaccines, and Israel has vaccinated a higher percentage of people, but no country near the size of the US has vaccinated as high a percentage of its residents. Despite the focus on herd immunity estimates, health experts say the vaccinations have caused declines in new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN to watch for a day soon when 60% of the adult population has had at least one vaccination. \u201cI expect during the month of May we will see daily cases drop dramatically and deaths finally drop to quite low numbers,\u201d he said Sunday.

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The US is showing more signs of returning to normal. After a year, two Carnival Cruise ships returned to a Texas port, signaling a glimmer of hope for a cruise industry that has been all but frozen. Disneyland also has reopened for the first time in over a year. However, there\u2019s a new obstacle amid these optimistic signs: The CDC says almost 8% of the millions of people who have gotten a first Covid-19 vaccine shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines haven\u2019t gotten a second one, which is essential to proper protection from the virus. Meanwhile, President Biden has been seen wearing a mask outdoors despite updated CDC guidance that fully vaccinated people don\u2019t have to do so. The ensuing confusion seems to show that mask-wearing will continue to be a controversial topic for a long while. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. India is on the brink of recording 20 million coronavirus cases as it continues to buckle under its worst outbreak yet. Authorities also reported more than 400,000 daily cases for the first time on Saturday and a record-high number of deaths yesterday. Multiple states in the country are preparing to go into \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in the coming days. Many have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not properly preparing India for the crisis, and he has often painted a rosy view of the nation\u2019s pandemic response when numbers were saying otherwise. In an election in a key battleground state, Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party just suffered a defeat, with the results seen as a test of whether the second wave of Covid-19 has impacted support for Modi. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The US began turning over military bases to Afghan security forces this weekend, but Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, the top US general, warned of the potential for \u201cbad possible outcomes\u201d for the withdrawal. Taliban forces late last week briefly overran an Afghan base before Afghan forces recaptured it. Meanwhile, the US carried out a precision strike against rockets aimed at Kandahar Airfield after indirect fire was launched at the site. Milley says the first few days of this withdrawal phase don\u2019t indicate the whole project\u2019s success or failure, and a negotiated peace is still possible. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. North Korea warned the US it will face a \u201ccrisis beyond control in the near future\u201d and accused South Korea of carrying out an \u201cintolerable provocation\u201d against Pyongyang in statements that could set the stage for a showdown among the three countries. The comments come after Biden\u2019s press secretary said the administration had completed a monthslong policy review of North Korea. Biden and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, are also set to meet in Washington this month, and experts say North Korea may be trying to drive a wedge between the two leaders. The statements also seem focused on what North Korea sees as recent insults from the US and South Korea. Four people died and more than 20 others were hospitalized after a suspected smuggling vessel overturned yesterday off the coast of San Diego. A US Customs and Border Protection official said the agency has \u201cevery indication\u201d the vessel was being used to smuggle people into the country illegally. The boat was reportedly severely overcrowded when it hit a reef and capsized, and it\u2019s not clear how many passengers and crew were wearing safety gear. The person believed to have been operating the vessel is now in custody. The CBP said it has seen a stark increase in maritime smuggling attempts and is ramping up efforts to intercept such vessels. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them.

Don\u2019t give up. That\u2019s the message CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, President Joe Biden and other pandemic authorities are telling the American people to avoid a pandemic backslide. Walensky says she\u2019s scared about where the country\u2019s headed, as case numbers tick up and the country crosses the dark threshold of 550,000 coronavirus deaths. Biden says in the next three weeks, 90% of the adult US population will be eligible for the vaccine. In Canada, the country\u2019s health leaders have halted distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine among people under 55 after reports of rare but serious blood clots. The World Health Organization will release a report into the origins of Covid-19 today, and they\u2019ve concluded the virus did likely come from an animal after all \u2013 not a lab. President Joe Biden will lay out the first of a sweeping two-pronged infrastructure and jobs proposal on Wednesday. The proposal will likely cost between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, but will include things like badly needed repairs for the country\u2019s physical infrastructure. It won\u2019t, however, include a gas or mileage tax \u2013 a possibility that raised concerns for low-income Americans or those who travel a lot for work. Yesterday, Biden also announced a massive effort to bolster offshore wind energy projects to create more jobs and address the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the White House will host a bipartisan briefing for House members on Wednesday to discuss the worsening situation at the US-Mexico border. The administration is struggling to find space to house the record number of unaccompanied minors, and has even asked federal workers to volunteer at facilities to house and care for the children. Georgia\u2019s new controversial and restrictive voting law has faced swift backlash. Two federal lawsuits have been filed to challenge the law: one brought by a Democratic election attorney on behalf of racial justice groups, and another by a collective of several civil rights and voting rights groups. The lawsuits allege the new laws, which do things like limit ballot drop boxes and make it illegal to give water to those waiting in line to vote, are unconstitutional and violate the Voting Rights Act. Justice groups are urging sports organizations, like the PGA Tour and Major League Baseball, to reconsider holding upcoming major events in the state. China\u2019s government has passed a new law that will drastically restrict the right of Hong Kongers to stand for election, giving Beijing even more control over the supposedly semi-autonomous city. The new law reshapes Hong Kong\u2019s 70-seat legislature, adding 20 seats and changing its makeup so that most of the seats would be controlled by a government-appointed Election Committee or groups loyal to Beijing. This makes it impossible for any opposition party to gain a majority, especially since anyone hoping to gain a seat must also secure nomination from the committee. Chinese and Hong Kong officials say these changes are necessary to ensure \u201cpatriots governing Hong Kong\u201d prevail, but others fear it\u2019s just another tool of political suppression. Coronavirus is crippling Brazil, and the country\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro is making moves that appear designed to secure greater loyalty amid the crisis. Six ministers resigned yesterday, including the country\u2019s defense minister, secretary of state and Attorney General Andre Levi, who refused to sign Bolsonaro\u2019s lawsuit to lift three state governors\u2019 lockdown orders. Marcelo Queiroga, Brazil\u2019s fourth health minister since the beginning of the pandemic, was also sworn in quietly just last week. Yesterday\u2019s changes appear to put several army generals closer to Bolsonaro in more strategic positions.

Ten people, including a police officer, were killed yesterday afternoon after a gunman opened fire in a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. The attack unfolded just before 3 p.m. local time as customers in the King Soopers store waited in line for Covid-19 vaccines and shopped. Among those killed was 51-year-old Officer Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond. Police haven\u2019t released details about the rest of the victims yet. A suspect is in custody, but so far police have declined to comment on his identity, a motive or the specific weapon. A senior law enforcement source said the shooter used an AR-15-style rifle. The shooting comes just days after another mass murderer took the lives of eight people at spas around Atlanta. Together, these tragedies have renewed calls for stricter gun control legislation. The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is gaining steam after the company released new data on its efficacy. A US-based clinical trial showed the vaccine had 79% efficacy against symptomatic disease and 100% efficacy against severe disease and hospitalization, though an independent US board expressed concern over whether the data is complete. Still, the Biden administration will loan about 4 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Canada and Mexico as the shots await approval in the US. South Korea\u2019s President just got the AstraZeneca vaccine himself, and starting today, adults age 65 and older across his country can, too. While there\u2019s still concern that travel and mass gatherings could feed another surge in the US, experts estimate vaccine usage has already saved about 40,000 American lives. Israelis head to the polls today for the country\u2019s fourth general election in under two years. Political leaders have failed to form a decisive government after the last three elections, and there\u2019s no guarantee this one will be any different. Most likely, the vote will chiefly serve as a referendum on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Though he\u2019s won praise for recent diplomatic deals and his handling of the pandemic, the country\u2019s leader of 15 years is also on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. While Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party will likely come out on top this time, polls show as many as 13 parties could win spots in the 120-seat Knesset, which would make forming a cohesive government all the more difficult. White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to President Biden as soon as this week. The massive plan is part of the economic agenda Biden promised during his campaign and represents the second phase of his \u201crescue\u201d and \u201crecovery\u201d strategy (after the coronavirus relief bill). One part of the new plan focuses on infrastructure and clean energy, and the other on what\u2019s being termed the \u201ccare economy\u201d \u2013 things like early education and child care. No final decisions have been made on the plan, but Biden says he will work with congressional Democrats to find the best way forward. The US and several international allies\u00a0announced coordinated sanctions against two Chinese officials for \u201cserious human rights abuses\u201d against Uyghur Muslims. The announcement, in cooperation with the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom and others, is a collective motion of condemnation for Beijing\u2019s repression of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province. China hit right back, announcing sanctions against 10 EU politicians and four entities for \u201cmaliciously spreading lies and disinformation.\u201d This recent volley will likely be a big topic of conversation when Chinese and Russian officials meet in Beijing this week, since both countries are bitter over sanctions from the international community.

            "article_content": "Watch \u201cAFRAID: Fear in Communities of Color\u201d at 9 p.m. ET on Monday, March 22 \u2013 a CNN Special Report hosted by Amara Walker, Ana Cabrera, Victor Blackwell and Anderson Cooper. People laid flowers and prayed outside three spas in the Atlanta area while crowds across the country held signs declaring \u201cStop Asian Hate\u201d in the days after the deadly shootings. Once again, America mourned the killings of people of color. Last week, six Asian women and two others were killed when a gunman opened fire at the spas. The suspect, a 21-year-old White man, has since claimed responsibility for the shootings and is facing multiple murder and firearms charges. The calls for investigators to consider hate crime charges as well as the outrage, sadness and fear among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have only grown amid an uptick in reported incidents against Asian communities in the US since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. But lawmakers and community leaders say racism against Asian Americans is nothing new. The recent attacks shocked a deeply divided nation that has been continuously pushed to talk about the racism and inequity that plague its increasingly diverse demographic. For many, the attacks in Georgia were another example of how White supremacy continues shaping America. They came as Republicans try to roll back voting access or put new obstacles that could disproportionally impact voters of color in more than 40 states, and two months after insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol. \u201cAsian Americans are targets of this kind of hate and we need to realize that just because they may have an image of being, economically successful, well-educated or quiet, (it) does not mean that they are seen or accepted as \u2018full Americans\u2019,\u201d said Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American Studies at Amherst College who specializes in Asian American studies. What can people do to be an ally to communities of color in the fight against hate? Tweet us your suggestions with #CNNSpecial and we will feature some during a one-hour show Monday at 9 p.m. ET. In the last year, Asian Americans have been the targets of verbal and physical assaults because of misguided coronavirus fears and after former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as \u201cChina virus\u201d or \u201ckung flu.\u201d The violence ranged from a cardiologist at a grocery store almost having her mask ripped off to a 84-year-old man from Thailand who died after being shoved to the ground during his morning walk. Seeing the faces of the victims in the Atlanta-area spa shootings prompted fear beyond the Peach state in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to describe this feeling of just like grieving, even if it\u2019s people you never knew or never heard of or never had contact with,\u201d said Ian, a 24-year-old writer who lives in New York.  \u201cPsychologically, it does a lot to your head to just hear about people being shot and killed because of how they look, because they look like my grandma, because they look like my mom.\u201d How to help Asian Americans under attack Ian, who says he has often been the target of racial slurs, is among the more than 300 Asian Americans who shared their stories with CNN. CNN is only using first names for their safety and to help prevent them from facing retribution in their communities. Nearly a week after the Atlanta-area shootings, the movement against anti-Asian hate continues to grow with protests in several cities, including Denver, New York and San Francisco. For Cynthia Choi, one of the founders of Stop AAPI Hate, the country is seeing a \u201cperiod of awakening.\u201d \u201cThis is a moment that there is no denial that race and gender are factors in this tragedy,\u201d Choi said. In the past week, many lawmakers, experts and advocates have said there\u2019s a link between the anti-Asian sentiment, the Capitol riots and the ongoing voting right battle. \u201cIn many parts of the country, some people want to have a more narrow definition of who truly belongs, of who truly has rights,\u201d Dhingra said. When insurrectionists entered the Capitol in January, some were carrying Confederate flags and displayed signs and symbols of racist, White supremacist and extremist groups. A Black US Capitol Police officer said he and his fellow Black officers endured racist taunts. \u201cThe Black officer struggle was different as in, like I said, we fought against not just people that were, that hated what we represented, but they hate our skin color also,\u201d Harry Dunn told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on CNN Tonight last week.  \u201cThat\u2019s just a fact and they used those words to prove that, they showed that they hated us and they hated our skin color.\u201d The January 6 attack, which killed five people and injured more than 100 police officers, has left Black officers grappling with their experience. \u201cOnce I had time to sit down and put it all together, it was just so overwhelming: that here we are giving so much and putting our lives on the line to protect democracy and keep it and we\u2019re being called racial slurs, traitors, and any just weapon that these people could use because they were upset about something,\u201d he said. Several lawmakers described the rioters as White supremacists in the days and weeks after the mob. \u201cLet us be clear, this was a domestic terror attack perpetrated by riotist mobs of White supremacists, armed equipped and many skilled in police and military tactics who came to overturn an election in which their candidate Trump lost,\u201d Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a January hearing. A battle over voting rights has ensued across the country in recent weeks. Republicans are pushing for restrictions that Democrats and advocates argue would substantially impact people of color. Lawmakers in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some of those proposed bills are in Florida, Arizona and Georgia, which were all battleground states in 2020 and host US Senate races in 2022. Putting 'cologne on Jim Crow': Georgia GOP lawmakers drive toward new voting restrictions The proposed measures could limit Sunday voting and the number of ballot boxes, eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, ban automatic voter registration and prohibit volunteers from serving free food and drinks to people standing in line at the polls. Voting rights advocates have said the measures are a direct attack on Black voters who showed up in unprecedented numbers for the presidential election. In Georgia, lawmakers said in recent days that they plan to preserve Sunday early voting as part of the omnibus voting package that the House committee will take up this week. A previous bill sought to allow only one optional day of Sunday voting. For Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, the bill \u201ccontinues to be nothing but voter suppression.\u201d \u201cThe recent changes are nothing more than putting a little makeup and cologne on Jim Crow,\u201d Albright added. The county attorney for a largely Black community in Georgia was pushing to limit voting access in the state. Residents there protested -- and now he's out Voting rights activists had criticized that limit as attacking \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d \u2013 programs that help drive turnout among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency. And a CNN analysis of voting patterns in November\u2019s general election found the measure eliminated days when a disproportionate number of Black voters had cast their ballots. Stacey Abrams, the 2018 gubernatorial candidate cum voting activist, has slammed state voting bills across the country and also likened the Georgia efforts to \u201ca redux of Jim Crow, in a suit and tie.\u201d \u201cThe only connection that we can find is that more people of color voted, and it changed the outcome of elections in a direction that Republicans do not like,\u201d Abrams told CNN. Voter suppression efforts along with the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine distribution, the surge of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the US-Mexico border and the anti-Asian assaults highlight some of the challenges that people of color in America constantly face. The country may have become the epicenter of a racial reckoning last summer but the flurry of recent events reveals those discussions are far from over.

Eight people were killed at three metro Atlanta spas in the span of about an hour yesterday. We still don\u2019t know a lot about the victims, but four have been described as being of Korean ethnicity, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. Earlier, Atlanta\u2019s police chief had said at least four were female and appeared to be Asian. A 21-year-old suspect was taken into custody after a car chase, and police believe he was responsible for the three attacks. Authorities are still investigating the motive behind the shootings, among other questions. But already, the attacks have sparked fears among Asian Americans, who have seen incidents of violence and hate against them rise since the coronavirus pandemic began. Officials in some cities are increasing police presence in Asian communities as a precaution. The US is facing a tough race between Covid-19 vaccines and variants. Vaccinations are quickly ramping up, and they have a great shot of winning out. But contagious variants are spreading across the country and could threaten another surge. The CDC says two coronavirus strains first detected in California are officially \u201cvariants of concern.\u201d The variants may be about 20% more transmissible, and there are concerns that some treatments won\u2019t be as effective against them. But the CDC hasn\u2019t said vaccines would stop working against them. Also complicating the situation: Some states are easing restrictions before the virus\u2019 spread is fully contained. A US intelligence report has determined that Russia attempted to interfere in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump and hurt Joe Biden. The report also describes a smaller, covert influence campaign by Iran. One of the biggest bombshells of the report confirms what we had assumed last year: Trump and his closest allies publicly\u00a0embraced Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign\u00a0against Biden, met with Kremlin-linked figures who were part of the effort and promoted their conspiracy theories. CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson writes that the finding underscores a fundamental truth: \u201cThe gravest threat to US democracy comes from within.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing more and more scrutiny by the day. Over the weekend, investigators met with the first woman to publicly accuse the governor of sexual harassment. Other women have made similar allegations against him, and investigations into those claims continue to ramp up. Cuomo is also dealing with a separate problem involving an alleged cover-up of the number of Covid-19 deaths in the state\u2019s long-term care facilities. He now faces increasing pressure to resign, even from prominent members of his own party. President Biden recently said Cuomo should resign if an investigation confirms the sexual harassment allegations against him. Cuomo has denied \u201cinappropriately touching\u201d anyone and has said he never meant to make anyone feel uncomfortable. A Japanese court has ruled that the country\u2019s failure to recognize same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. It\u2019s a landmark ruling that could usher in a new era of marriage equality in Japan. Homosexuality has been legal in Japan since 1880, and the country is relatively liberal compared with some other Asian nations. But Japan does not recognize same-sex unions nationwide. This ruling alone won\u2019t legalize same-sex marriage in the country \u2013 that would need a Supreme Court ruling, which could take several years. Still, it\u2019s a significant step.

Former President Donald Trump may have been acquitted at his impeachment trial over the weekend, but his legal troubles are just beginning. Prosecutors in Georgia are conducting criminal investigations into his attempts to overturn the state\u2019s election results, while prosecutors in New York are looking into his business dealings.

Still, Senate Republicans\u2019 failure to hold the former President accountable for his behavior on January 6 raises a key question, CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein writes: Has the extremist wing of the GOP coalition grown too big for the party to confront? Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are declining sharply in the US, in what feels like an encouraging piece of news. But the nation isn\u2019t yet in the clear. Though more than 38 million Americans so far have received at least their first vaccine dose, vaccinations aren\u2019t actually what\u2019s driving case numbers down. Instead, one expert says, it\u2019s following tried-and-true safety measures that\u2019s behind the decline: wearing masks, physical distancing, not traveling and not congregating with others indoors. It\u2019s especially important those behaviors continue: Vaccinations won\u2019t be widely available to most Americans until late spring or summer. New coronavirus variants are popping up.

            "article_content": "Active military personnel and veterans are over-represented among the first 150 people to be arrested and have records released for federal offenses in the violence and insurrection at the US Capitol. Analysis by CNN of Pentagon records and court proceedings show 21 of the 150, or 14%, are current or former members of the US military. That is more than double the proportion of servicemen and women and veterans in the adult US population, calculated from Census Bureau and Department of Defense statistics. In 2018, there were 1.3 million active-duty members of the services and 18 million veterans. Together, they comprised just 5.9% of the overall 327 million US population at the end of 2018. Two of the people arrested are in the Army Reserve, and one is an Army National Guardsman. Of the 19 veterans, seven are former Army, eight are former Marines, two served in the Navy, one was in the Air Force, and one served in the Army National Guard. Their service records show at least one served in Vietnam; others were deployed in the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. At least one earned a Purple Heart. They were discharged with a variety of ranks and included officers \u2013 a captain and a lieutenant colonel. And on January 6, the active and former military personnel are accused of declaring a war at home \u2013 attacking the Constitution they once swore to defend, some even equipped with military gear and weapons. The world watched as hundreds of rioters stormed the US Capitol in what became a deadly insurrection. Five people died due to the events at the Capitol that day, including a police officer hit in the head with a fire extinguisher and a woman trampled to death. Analysis of the charges faced by some of the veterans show prosecutors say they led the violence and lawlessness that disrupted the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election win. There are also alleged links between some of the veterans and extremist groups. CNN tracked down nine of the accused veterans. The most well-known of those arrested so far is Joseph Randall Biggs. The 37-year-old is an Army combat veteran. He is also one of the leaders of the far-right Proud Boys group that is known for violent clashes with anti-fascists or Antifa during protests from Portland, Oregon, to Washington, DC. Biggs became an online personality of the far-right, spouting bombastic and sometimes violent rhetoric toward women and Antifa. As far back as 2012, there were a plethora of tweets mentioning sexual violence on his @RamboBiggs account, which has been archived by the Media Matters For America group. One said: \u201cEvery Kiss begins with \u2026 Roofies.\u201d \u2013 a reference to Rohypnol, the \u201cdate rape drug.\u201d Biggs tweeted a rallying cry of \u201cDEATH TO ANTIFA\u201d and called on others to get guns and ammunition to take to a rally in Portland. His account was suspended by Twitter in 2019 for repeatedly violating the terms of service. One of his self-titled online shows was still being featured on a right-wing subscription website a week after his arrest. It began with computer-generated explosions, and a tank firing out the letters B-I-G-G-S. On January 6, Biggs is accused of going far beyond rhetoric. In video CNN has reviewed from January 6, Biggs is seen commanding his Proud Boy troops and guiding them to the Capitol steps. Federal prosecutors say he\u202f\u201cdid aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure others to unlawfully enter the US Capitol by means of destruction of federal property.\u201d He is charged with unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds\u202fand obstructing an official proceeding of Congress. In the criminal complaint, federal agents say Biggs was among the first to enter the Capitol during the mob attack. One of Biggs\u2019 Proud Boys, Dominic Pezzola, who has been charged with several crimes including conspiracy, is shown on video smashing a window of the Capitol with a plastic shield, which several people climb through before a door was opened. Pezzola\u2019s lawyer said he was \u201cdenied contact\u201d with his jailed client, which, he said, undercut his ability to mount a \u201cmeaningful legal defense.\u201d \u201cHey Biggs, what do you gotta say,\u201d a voice off camera says in a video reviewed by the FBI. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d Biggs replies on camera before walking into the Capitol building within 20 seconds of the door opening, the FBI agent alleged in court documents. CNN visited Biggs\u2019 home in Ormond Beach, Florida, just north of the Daytona International Speedway, to hear what he had to say now that he is out on bail and on house arrest. He peeked through a curtain on his door when we identified ourselves, but stayed mostly hidden. When asked if he was an insurrectionist, Biggs replied, \u201cOh God no.\u201d But as we pressed for why he was inside the Capitol building, he threatened to call police. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get the f**k out of here, I\u2019m calling the police right now,\u201d he said, pushing his phone around the curtain to take video. A four-hour drive south from Biggs is the Miami home of Gabriel Garcia, a former Army captain, now an alleged Proud Boy extremist who is also accused of involvement in the insurrection. Last year he ran for the Florida House of Representatives as a Republican, though he told CNN affiliate WPLG at the time there were questions about the election system. \u201cThere\u2019s people starting to doubt this process,\u201d he said then. Garcia lost in the Republican primary. Now he is charged with \u201ccertain acts during civil disorder, aiding and abetting; knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\u201d According to the federal complaint, Garcia was inside the Capitol when he said on a video: \u201cWe just went ahead and stormed the Capitol. It\u2019s about to get ugly.\u201d The affidavit says he called police who were trying to stop the siege \u201cf**king traitors.\u201d Garcia\u2019s lawyer, Aubrey Webb, told CNN his client \u201cdoes not want anything to do with the Proud Boys or any extremist group.\u201d He also said his client did not commit any violence or destroy any property during the Capitol riot. \u201cBy the time he went in, the police were letting people in. And he did not go into any of the chambers, like others did. Any comments he made are protected speech, as he did not threaten anyone or intend to incite violence,\u201d Webb said in a statement. In the Texas city of Longview, between Dallas and the Louisiana border, Ryan Nichols lives in a gated community with large homes and big lawns. A neighbor called police to try to stop us from approaching Nichols\u2019 house. Down the street at  Nichols\u2019 wholesale business, a man refused to say if he was inside and threatened to call 911. Nichols, 30, says in an ad that he has made \u201cmillions of dollars here on the e-commerce platforms\u201d and claims he can help others do the same. A former Marine, Nichols was once featured on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in 2018 after video of his work rescuing dogs during Hurricane Florence was shared widely over the internet. On January 6, federal prosecutors say Nichols was at the Capitol with a Texas buddy called Alex Harkrider, who is also a former Marine. The FBI says Nichols can be seen on video yelling through a bullhorn towards the large crowd, \u201cIf you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!\u201d The complaint says another video shows Nichols shouting, \u201cThis is the second revolution right here folks! [\u2026] This is not a peaceful protest.\u201d A person who recognized the men told the FBI according to court documents: \u201cI have photo screen shots from their social media pages showing they were there and showing Alex stated they were planning a civil war.\u201d The complaint says Nichols had a canister of OC/pepper spray and a crowbar with him and sprayed what is believed to be pepper spray toward the Capitol entrance where federal agents were trying to stop the attack. Federal agents obtained a Snapchat photo they said was \u201capparently shared by Harkrider.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in. 2 people killed already. We need all the patriots of this country to rally the f**k up and fight for our freedom or it\u2019s gone forever. Give us liberty, or give us death,\u201d the caption read. He and Nichols are charged with conspiracy and unlawful entry with a dangerous weapon, violent entry or disorderly conduct, civil disorder, assaulting a federal officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon, and aiding and abetting, according to a federal complaint. They both remain in jail. Three hours south, in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, Army veteran Joshua Lollar is staying with his parents as part of his bond requirements. The home is part of a planned community with tree-lined streets and large brick homes at the ends of long driveways. It\u2019s a far cry from Iraq, where Lollar was deployed, and from Washington, DC, on January 6. A screen capture of Lollar\u2019s Facebook account shows a picture of people wearing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats entering the Capitol, with a caption saying \u201cbusting in.\u201d The complaint against him said he was livestreaming on Facebook while taking part in the siege. He is also captured on police body camera video admitting to violence against officers, the affidavit says. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just got gassed and fought with cops that I never thought would happen,\u201d Lollar posted on Facebook, the affidavit said. Lollar\u2019s father came out of his home, holding a small fluffy dog. After greeting CNN in a soft voice, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything.\u201d He did confirm his son was an Iraq war veteran, awarded a Purple Heart. Lollar told a federal court hearing he lives with his parents, is being treated for PTSD, and has been receiving disability since 2009, according to CNN affiliate KPRC, which attended the hearing. He has been charged with numerous offenses including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, obstructing or impeding law enforcement officer during civil disorder and obstructing federally protected functions. Lollar was released on bond.  The court ordered that guns, body armor and gas masks be secured by Lollar\u2019s father. \u201cHe will have no knowledge of where they are,\u201d Grover Lollar told the judge, according to KPRC. The first people to be charged by federal officials with conspiracy in connection with the insurrection are all veterans. Jessica Watkins, who served in the Army under another name, is also accused of being part of the far-right Oath Keepers. Army vet who tended bar accused by FBI of conspiring in Capitol insurrection The complaint against her says she conspired with former Marine Donovan Crowl and Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell. CNN has reached out to the arrested veterans mentioned in this story and any lawyers listed on their court documents. Most did not respond. Lollar\u2019s representative said his client had no comment at this time. CNN is continuing to keep count of the number of military members arrested in connection to the insurrection, as well as police officers and others who have been trained or prepared for combat in the name of the United States. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen too often is that\u202fthis kind of ideological militancy is allowed to exist in the military,\u201d said former FBI agent Michael German who spent years undercover in White supremacist and domestic extremist groups and is now a fellow at the Brennan Center For Justice. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t enough effort to root it out and to actually paint it as what it is: an anti-democratic movement that\u2019s a threat to our security within our security forces.\u201d But he added that the threat extended outside the armed forces and law agencies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the military veterans and the police officers who were involved in the violent and illegal activities, but the fact that these groups that have been engaged in militant violence across the country over the last four years and beyond have support among elected politicians.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of active military personnel arrested and understated the number of veterans arrested. At the time of publication, those arrested included two active military personnel and 19 veterans. Additionally, this story has been updated to reflect that those arrested were members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard CNN\u2019s Paul P.

Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The Rev. Raphael Warnock has defeated GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler in one of two critical Senate runoff races in Georgia, CNN projects. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff early today is leading Sen. David Perdue in the other race. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will claim control of the Senate with a 50/50 divide, plus a tiebreaking vote from Kamala Harris once she is sworn in as vice president. Warnock is the first Georgia Democrat elected to the Senate in 20 years and will be the state\u2019s first Black senator. In the intense run-up to yesterday\u2019s elections, Republicans framed the races as a check on Washington, hoping voters would keep the Senate in GOP control at the start of the Biden administration. However, some politicians expressed concern that President Trump\u2019s unwillingness to concede the presidential race and his continued claims of voter fraud may have tamped down GOP turnout. Perdue and Loeffler have both sided with the President in his calls to object to today\u2019s congressional count of Electoral College results. The House and the Senate will meet today to formally count the Electoral College votes from the 2020 presidential election. But what is usually a routine part of American democracy could turn ugly because of President Trump and his most ardent supporters\u2019 ongoing refusal to accept the results. Here\u2019s what will happen: Some Republicans in both chambers have pledged to object to some results, which are counted state-by-state, meaning there may be debate when certain states come up. All objections will be voted on \u2013 and are expected to fail. So in the end, GOP objections will most likely serve as a marker of loyalty to the President, rather than actually affect the results. They could also cast a shadow over future democratic processes and maintain the seed of doubt among Trump supporters who believe his false claims that the election was stolen from him. We could also see unrest, as Trump has encouraged supporters to come to the Capitol as the votes are counted. The US hit a new daily high coronavirus death toll yesterday, with 3,775 new deaths reported across the country. The fresh tragedy comes as US governors take new steps to get vaccines administered faster, including mobilizing National Guard members and training more volunteers to vaccinate people. Germany, Ireland, the Czech Republic and other countries are also seeing cases, hospitalizations and deaths spike. Meantime, the World Health Organization has issued a rare rebuke after a team of its scientists were prevented from entering China to study the origins of the novel coronavirus. The police officer who shot and seriously wounded Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August will not face charges, county District Attorney Michael Graveley announced yesterday. Rusten Sheskey, a White officer, shot Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times from behind while responding to a domestic incident. He said he used deadly force because he thought Blake was trying to kidnap a child in the back seat of a vehicle. Blake\u2019s family says they are disappointed in the decision but felt it was coming when they heard Wisconsin was bringing in the National Guard to respond to possible unrest following the announcement. Now, Blake\u2019s family and supporters are vowing to take their case to Washington DC. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have agreed to restore diplomatic relations with the tiny gas-rich nation of Qatar. The agreement ends a three-year boycott of the nation that has divided the Gulf states ever since. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and took issue with the country\u2019s friendly relations with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. Under the boycott, Qatar\u2019s only land border \u2013 with Saudi Arabia \u2013 was sealed shut, and boycotting nations closed their airspace to Qatar.

            "article_content": "In states like Texas and North Carolina, Republican lawmakers in charge of redrawing the political maps for the next decade say that the new plans are \u201crace blind.\u201d Their opponents in court say that the claim is implausible and one that, in some situations, is at odds with the Voting Rights Act. Several lawsuits, including from the Justice Department, allege that the maps drawn after the 2020 census discriminate against voters of color. Between a 2013 Supreme Court decision that scaled back the federal government\u2019s role in monitoring redistricting and a 2019 ruling that said partisan gerrymanders could not be challenged in federal court, voting rights advocates have been left with fewer tools to address what they say are unfair and illegal redistricting plans. California's new congressional maps produce a scrambled playing field for 2022 Meanwhile, lawmakers in the states where the redistricting legal fights have been most pitched have adopted an approach that claims that racial data played no role as they drew the maps for the next 10 years. Legislators say they\u2019re avoiding the use of race data after decades of litigation where they\u2019ve been accused of unconstitutionally relying on race to gerrymander. \u201cI don\u2019t view this as a serious legal defense, but more of a PR defense,\u201d said Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is suing Texas lawmakers over their new maps. Challengers to the maps say that such an assertion of \u201crace blind\u201d maps is dubious as well as a betrayal of states\u2019 obligations under the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in redistricting. The law requires that in some circumstances, map-makers must draw plans in a way that creates minority-majority districts where voters can elect the candidates of their choice. In lawsuits alleging a failure to comply with the law, states like Texas have been accused of drawing maps that instead dilute the votes of communities of color. Legislators may be trying to \u201cimmunize\u201d themselves from most of the claims that are used in court to strike down redistricting maps, according to Nate Persily, a Stanford Law School professor and redistricting expert. 'We have got a problem here': Low morale and redistricting hand Democrats a growing retirement issue \u201cBy saying race was not in the minds of the people who drew the lines, you potentially get out of those constitutional causes action that you are intentionally diluting the vote of racial minorities or that race was the predominant factor in the construction of a district,\u201d Persily told CNN, adding that such an approach doesn\u2019t shield map-drawers from cases alleging Voting Rights Act violations. Lawmakers\u2019 description of maps as \u201crace blind\u201d is both \u201cpolitical rhetoric\u201d and \u201ctest case rhetoric,\u201d said Ben Ginsberg, a former Republican redistricting lawyer who is not involved in the current lawsuits. \u201cBut still, the standard is you can\u2019t dilute minority voting power and minority opportunity to vote for their candidates of choice. And by not using race data they run the risk of being found to have diluted minority voting strength from what\u2019s in the current map.\u201d For decades, North Carolina has been on the frontlines on the legal battles over redistricting, and the fight after the 2020 census stands to be the same. Early next month, a state court will consider the new maps in a trial covering claims of partisan gerrymandering (which can still move forward in some state courts) and racial vote dilution in the new plans. Among the allegations in the case is that that the legislature \u2013 by excluding the use of race data when drawing the maps this year \u2013 violated North Carolina Constitution, as interpreted by state Supreme Court decisions. The legislators leading the redistricting process said in public hearings that they believed their approach is in line with law. The new map reduced the African American voting age population a congressional district held by Democratic Rep. G.K Butterfield, the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who is now retiring, citing the way his district was redrawn. How the percentage of Black voters was shrunk in several state Senate and House districts is being challenged in the state court case as well. In public hearings, the Republican legislators defended their redistricting process and said that they didn\u2019t read the law as requiring them to incorporate race into their approach. North Carolina Sen. Ralph Hise, a Republican and co-chair of the legislature\u2019s redistricting commission, said in a statement to CNN, that the state was sued for using race in the 2011 redistricting process. \u201cSo during this process, legislators did not use any racial data when drawing districts, and we\u2019re now being sued for not considering race,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only constant here is Democratic litigants selecting arguments, no matter how contradictory, to try to convince a court to order maps that favor Democratic candidates.\u201d Allison Riggs \u2013 an attorney for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which is involved in the state court case \u2013 described that attitude as \u201cpetulant,\u201d telling CNN that Republican lawmakers lost racial gerrymandering cases in the last cycle because they were using racial data to pack voters of color into fewer districts, rather than to help those voters. How both parties are killing competition in the race for the House \u201cNo one seriously believes that legislators can or are doing this race blind,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cA representative who represents Pitt County here in North Carolina is a representative, is an elected official, because he, she or they knows where voters live. They know where Black voters live in the county.\u201d Pat Ryan, spokesperson for North Carolina Senate Republicans, said that how the plaintiffs \u201chave resorted to claims of mind-reading shows just how ridiculous these lawsuits are.\u201d In tension with legislators\u2019 obligations under the Voting Rights Act are the limits the Constitution \u2013 under Supreme Court precedent \u2013 put on the use of race in redistricting. The Supreme Court has said, via the 1993 decision in Shaw v. Reno, that use of race as a sole factor in drawing districts unconstitutional in most circumstances. However, the Voting Rights Act presents the sort of compelling government interest that allows for race to be considered. Jason Torchinsky \u2013 a Republican election lawyer who has defended North Carolina legislators in redistricting cases in the past, but is not involved in the current cases in North Carolina or Texas\u2013 told CNN that map-drawers have to walk the line between their VRA obligations and not running afoul of the Constitution. \u201cLegislatures have to use very localized data to determine if they are required to draw [Voting Rights Act] Section 2 districts,\u201d Torchinsky said. \u201cIf they are, then they have to consider race in those parts of the states because they\u2019re required to under the Voting Rights Act.\u201d  But when states aren\u2019t required to draw VRA districts, Torchinsky said, the use of race could pose a potential Constitutional problem. Ryan, the spokesperson for the North Carolina Senate GOP, pointed to a 2016 federal court decision in which the legislature was faulted for drawing maps with race data lawmakers said they were using for VRA compliance, when, according to the court, the circumstances didn\u2019t require the use of race to comply with the VRA. \u201cWe have been presented with no evidence that anything has changed since that decision from just a few years ago,\u201d Ryan said in an email. \u201cAnd so, having been told recently by a court that we did not have evidence of the conditions that would justify the use of racial data in redistricting, we chose not to use racial data this time around.\u201d 'No one with power is listening:' Activists warn redistricting moves in the South threaten Black political power Texas state Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican who led the state\u2019s redistricting process, also claimed in public hearings that the state\u2019s maps were drawn in a race blind way. Her office did not respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry, but she told the Texas Tribune that legal advisers had vetted the maps \u2013 which now face several challenges under the Voting Rights Act \u2013 for VRA compliance. She declined to say, according to the Tribune, how those advisers made those assessments. In court filings, Texas has signaled plans to argue that the relevant Voting Rights Act provision should not apply to redistricting. DOJ sues Texas, saying GOP-approved redistricting maps discriminate against Latinos and Blacks The Justice Department, in its lawsuit alleging the maps violate the VRA, argues that that there is evidence that race drove the drawing of Texas\u2019 new maps and that it was used to dilute Latino voting power. Among the districts the DOJ is challenging is a congressional district at Texas\u2019 Southwest border that was assembled by breaking up individual precincts.  \u201cWhile accurate racial data is available below the precinct level, accurate political data is not, suggesting that many precinct splits have a racial basis,\u201d the DOJ said, while pointing out that the reworking of the district led to a removal of half of its Latino citizen voting age population. Saenz, of MALDEF, told CNN that the evidence suggested that \u201crace was the predominant factor.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making fine tunes, where really the only thing you can look at is race, there is no other way to explain why you cut a district that way,\u201d Saenz said. v",

            "article_content": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is engaging with stepped-up Republican efforts to recruit him into next year\u2019s Senate race, CNN has learned. The popular Republican governor\u2019s entry into the Senate race in a blue state would immediately put Democrats on defense in what would otherwise be a sleepy reelection for Sen. Chris Van Hollen \u2013 and potentially upend Democratic efforts to hold onto the Senate majority in next year\u2019s midterms. But running now would require Hogan to chart an anti-Donald Trump path through GOP politics, which so far no prominent Republican has been able to pull off. Senior Republicans have been citing Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s win in last month\u2019s Virginia governor\u2019s race, urging Hogan \u2013 who\u2019s term-limited as governor \u2013 to look at that campaign as a model for how to run while keeping the former President at a distance and focus on local issues instead of the national GOP agenda. Trying to appeal to the independent-minded Hogan, several prominent Republicans have also pitched him and his staff on the idea that if he won and helped Republicans achieve a narrow majority, he could be the GOP\u2019s version of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, according to four sources familiar with these efforts. As the most conservative Democrat in the evenly divided Senate, Manchin holds enormous power within his caucus as a frequent swing vote. (Hogan currently co-chairs No Labels, the bipartisan group that Manchin previously co-chaired.) But all of those calculations look different in Maryland \u2013 a far more blue state than Virginia, where President Joe Biden won by 33 percentage points and there hasn\u2019t been a competitive Senate race for decades. Asked for comment, a Hogan adviser pointed to previous interviews in which the governor has shot down the idea of running. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m really taking a serious look at,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d last month when asked if he would run for Senate. In July, he told CBS News, \u201cI have no interest whatsoever in running for the United States Senate,\u201d adding that with his business and executive background, \u201cbeing one guy in Washington and arguing with 99 other people and never getting anything done just doesn\u2019t have that much appeal to me.\u201d Hogan\u2019s biggest problem might be within his own party. Even if he didn\u2019t draw a strong primary challenger and secured the nomination, he would need heavy Republican support in November. Trump has already endorsed a primary opponent to Hogan\u2019s preferred successor in the governor\u2019s race, and the former President has made clear that he\u2019s looking to enforce a loyalty test in Republican politics. People who\u2019ve spoken to Hogan are saying that the worsening political environment for Democrats since the summer and the prospect of actually being able to win appear to be factoring into his thinking. He\u2019s not the only Maryland Republican contemplating a relatively late entry into a statewide race: former lieutenant governor and Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, another prominent anti-Trump member of the party, has been making another round of calls about jumping into the governor\u2019s race, sources tell CNN. Democrats are taking note. Speaking about Hogan at several recent Democratic events in the state, Van Hollen has told people privately, \u201cI\u2019m running as if he\u2019s in,\u201d according to several people who\u2019ve heard him. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, are among those who have reached out to Hogan in recent weeks. And though the governor has publicly disavowed interest, he continues to take the meetings and the calls. \u201cYou name the Republican, they\u2019ve called and asked him to run,\u201d said one GOP operative familiar with the recruitment efforts. Republicans haven\u2019t been making the case to Hogan just based on his own popularity. They\u2019ve also been pointing to Van Hollen\u2019s low name recognition, which people familiar with the data say has been evident in Republican and Democratic private polling. Cory McCray, a state senator from Baltimore who is also the first vice chair of the state Democratic Party, said he believed a Hogan-Van Hollen race \u201cwould be pretty competitive,\u201d citing the governor\u2019s popularity with Democrats as well as Republicans. \u201cA governor is probably more well-known than a senator \u2026 and I would assume Senator Van Hollen is aware of that as well,\u201d McCray said, adding, \u201cHogan is definitely a formidable opponent, but if there\u2019s anybody who can keep that seat, it\u2019s Chris Van Hollen.\u201d Van Hollen, who declined an interview request, is a political veteran. A former chair of both the Democrats\u2019 House and Senate campaign arms, he at home diligently climbed the ranks in Maryland politics from his home base just over the border from Washington, DC, starting with the house of delegates, then the state senate, then the US House, then winning his first Senate term in 2018. But there\u2019s no guarantee Hogan would even make it to the general election. A frequent Trump critic, he toyed with the idea of challenging the then-President in the 2020 Republican primary, before announcing in late 2019 that he would not. Hogan said shortly after the second impeachment trial ended that he would have been a vote to convict the former President in the Senate, among many other complaints over the years. In the Biden era, Hogan has positioned himself as a vocal leader of the winnowing list of anti-Trump Republican politicians. He supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and after Trump said he hoped for primary challenges to the 13 House Republicans who supported it, Hogan spoke out in their defense. \u201cThere\u2019s people very, very disgusted with our governor in our area,\u201d said Ric Metzgar, a Republican state representative from Baltimore County. \u201cIn my area, it\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s Trump territory. In some precincts down here, 98% of the people voted for him. \u2026 I really believe that conservative people are really upset that (Hogan) pulled away from Trump.\u201d Won't-run-if-Trump-runs question leads to waiting game for likely 2024 candidates But the allure of having the sole Republican candidate anyone thinks could be competitive in Maryland is enough to soothe some complaints. Minutes after complaining that Hogan \u201cloves the TV camera,\u201d Metzgar called back with a statement of support: \u201cGovernor Hogan has run statewide twice and won very strongly, and it would be great to have a Republican in the Senate from Maryland.\u201d Kathy Szeliga, the Republican state representative who lost to Van Hollen by 25 points in 2016, said she thought others would come to that conclusion as well. \u201cI think Republican primary voters in Maryland are sophisticated enough to know that President Trump did not do well in Maryland,\u201d she said. Trump-embracing national Republicans are ready to be forgiving as well. \u201cMore Republicans in the Senate would be a good thing,\u201d said American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp, while adding, \u201cI\u2019d like to know his takes on the [Build Back Better Act], nationalizing voting, [Supreme Court Justices Brett] Kavanaugh and [Amy Coney] Barrett.\u201d Hogan\u2019s relatively stringent Covid-19 response has gotten high marks from many, but not from Schlapp, who was frustrated that his own Conservative Political Action Conference had to move from its traditional spot in Maryland\u2019s National Harbor because of state health restrictions. In Florida, where CPAC has relocated, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis instituted far fewer Covid-related restrictions. \u201cI\u2019d like to know where he is on national issues,\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cWe have had to move two CPACs because he was not exactly Ron DeSantis on the virus.\u201d Hogan is once again toying with the idea of a presidential run, which a Senate bid could either boost or complicate. If he won in 2022, he could turn around and immediately launch a 2024 campaign \u2013 or it could give him a spot to wait out a potential Trump return until 2028. But by then, Hogan, who has survived non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, would be in his early 70s. And were he to lose to Van Hollen next year, he\u2019d have a much harder time following that up with a strong presidential run. National Republicans have been trying to keep their Hogan courtship quiet, blest he become the latest recruit scared out of running by the party\u2019s Trumpist turn and the attacks Democrats are preparing. The GOP governors of Arizona, Vermont and New Hampshire and the former governor of Nevada, all moderates, were all seen as potential strong Republican Senate candidates for 2022, but all passed on running \u2013 most embarrassingly for the party, when New Hampshire\u2019s Chris Sununu announced he was instead running for another term for governor last month. Though Van Hollen\u2019s campaign wouldn\u2019t detail how extensive its staff and operations are so far, campaign operative Keith Presley said, \u201cOur campaign is totally prepared for whoever runs. Senator Van Hollen is busy working to get results for the people of Maryland and to protect our democracy.\u201d And he does have a head start on fundraising: at the end of the last quarter, he had almost $4 million on hand. National Democrats, meanwhile, are warning that if Hogan got in, they\u2019d try to undermine his maverick brand and make him out to be just another McConnell pawn. \u201cIf he does run, all he\u2019ll do is join the 40-year long history of Republicans losing statewide federal elections in Maryland,\u201d said David Bergstein, the communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Sid Saab, a Republican state representative from Anne Arundel county, doubts Hogan will jump in, but he\u2019s holding out hope. \u201cIt would be easy for him to put up a campaign quickly,\u201d Saab said. \u201cHe can ramp up pretty quick, and I think he would obviously win the primary, even though there\u2019s some Republicans who are not happy with him.\u201d McCray, the Democratic state senator, summed up the feelings that many in the state \u2013 Democrat and Republican \u2013 have about a Hogan-Van Hollen race: \u201cI don\u2019t think Maryland\u2019s seen one like this before.\u201d And even Republicans loyal to the former President aren\u2019t rejecting a Hogan candidacy outright. Asked about the prospect of Hogan running, even as a Republican opposed to Trump, former Trump communications director Jason Miller said he was ready to be enthusiastic. \u201cEverything is in play for 2022,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEverything.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Scott Perry on Tuesday declined the House January 6 committee\u2019s request to speak with him, a move that could set up a showdown between a staunch Trump supporter and the committee. Perry, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, was the first known lawmaker to whom the panel had reached out to talk for its investigation. His response raises the question of whether the committee will now move to subpoena a fellow House member, a step that would dramatically escalate political tensions between the panel and Republicans who have warned that targeting GOP lawmakers is a bridge too far. \u201cI stand with immense respect for our Constitution, the Rule of Law, and the Americans I represent who know that this entity is illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the US House of Representatives,\u201d Perry wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. \u201cI decline this entity\u2019s request and will continue to fight the failures of the radical Left who desperately seek distraction from their abject failures of crushing inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, and the horrendous crisis they created at our border.\u201d In response, the committee condemned Perry but stopped short of saying if it would issue a subpoena to the Republican lawmaker. \u201cRepresentative Perry has information directly relevant to our investigation. While he says that he respects the Constitution and Rule of Law, he fails to note that multiple federal courts, acting pursuant to Article 3 of our Constitution, have already rejected the former President\u2019s claims that the committee lacks an appropriate legislative purpose,\u201d a Select Committee spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday, responding to Perry saying he would not agree to a meeting. \u201cThe Select Committee prefers to gather relevant evidence from members cooperatively, but if members with directly relevant information decline to cooperate and instead endeavor to cover up, the Select Committee will consider seeking such information using other tools,\u201d the spokesperson added. The statement does not explicitly mention whether a subpoena could be coming for Perry but also does not rule out that possibility. The committee asked the congressman to speak with them voluntarily on Monday. \u201cAt this time, the Select Committee seeks your voluntary cooperation,\u201d wrote Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee. The letter, released Monday, marks a significant step in the investigation and underscores how the panel is zeroing in on Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill. In the letter, the committee said it wants to discuss Perry\u2019s attempted effort to install former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general. \u201cWe have received evidence from multiple witnesses that you had an important role in the efforts to install Mr. Clark as acting Attorney General,\u201d Thompson said in the letter. Thompson added that then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, who have both been interviewed by the committee, \u201chave provided evidence regarding these issues, and we have received evidence that others who worked with Mr. Clark were aware of these plans.\u201d The committee in its letter tells Perry that Clark, whom the panel has begun criminal contempt proceedings against but has been given a second chance to come in and plead the Fifth Amendment, is aware that the committee is planning to ask him about his interactions with Perry. The letter to Perry also states that the committee is aware of \u201cmultiple text and other communications\u201d with Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, including evidence that the pair communicated over the encrypted app called Signal. Addressing Perry\u2019s role in spreading misinformation about the 2020 presidential election directly, the committee writes in its letter that it is aware that the Pennsylvania lawmaker communicated with the White House about a variety of topics including \u201callegations that the Dominion voting machines had been corrupted.\u201d The committee proposed scheduling a meeting with Perry on either December 28, December 29, January 3, January 4 or the week of January 10, when the House returns to session. The committee also suggested this meeting could be held in Perry\u2019s home district if that accommodation works better. In addition to an interview, the committee had also requested that Perry turn over all relevant documents and communication related to January 6.

            "article_content": "On nearly any other day in Washington, Republican Congressman James Comer would likely be calling for oversight investigations into the Biden administration. But on Wednesday, Comer \u2013 who represents Kentucky\u2019s 1st District and is the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform \u2013 accompanied President Joe Biden throughout his trip to Kentucky to survey damage in the wake of deadly tornadoes. Comer\u2019s congressional district includes Mayfield and Dawson Springs \u2013 two towns the President visited where tornadoes had ripped across neighborhoods, destroying homes and businesses. The Republican congressman\u2019s appearance next to a Democratic President marked a rare moment of putting politics aside. The moment was propelled by tragedy, with at least 71 people dead in the state in the wake of last weekend\u2019s extreme weather. During his speech in Dawson Springs, Biden briefly thanked the congressman for giving him a \u201cpassport\u201d into his district. Biden also reaffirmed his frequent call for unity during the trip, saying, \u201cPeople just come out of nowhere to help as a community, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be. That\u2019s what America\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d Biden says feds will cover 100% of the cost to clean up from Kentucky tornado for the first 30 days of recovery \u201cThere\u2019s no red tornadoes or blue tornadoes. There\u2019s no red states or blue states when this stuff starts to happen. And I think, at least in my experience, it either brings people together or really knocks them apart,\u201d he continued. Comer said in a statement to CNN following Wednesday\u2019s trip that he \u201cwas back on the ground in West Kentucky to further assess the damage caused by this devastating storm.\u201d \u201cI followed up on productive conversations with local officials and relayed requests regarding needs facing the 1st Congressional District directly to the President,\u201d the congressman added. \u201cIn the coming days, my office will continue working to help our constituents navigate the disaster relief programs available to them at a time of tremendous need.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s entire congressional delegation, which has only one Democrat, was invited to travel with the President, according to the White House. The delegation includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as well as Republican Sen. Rand Paul. Both Paul and McConnell were in Washington on Wednesday for Senate votes and are expected to return to their home state later in the week. In Washington, where he leads Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, Comer has said the business dealings of the President\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, will be a top priority if the House majority is flipped, calling the first son \u201ca national security threat.\u201d He\u2019s criticized the Biden administration for the US\u2019 chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as the President\u2019s approach to border security. And he\u2019s asserted that Biden\u2019s climate envoy, John Kerry, has been granted \u201cthe ability to unilaterally set foreign policy and bind the United States to international agreements without consent from Congress.\u201d On the House floor in recent days, Comer sparred with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, over the investigation into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings. The district Comer represents heavily leans toward Republicans. Voters in the state chose Trump in the 2020 presidential race and Comer\u2019s district has been represented by Republican members of Congress for more than 25 years. Tragedy, unfortunately, can be a rare unifying force in politics. And though comparatively trivial beside death and destruction, those moments of comity can be politically consequential. Notably, then-New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie commended then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012 following Hurricane Sandy. Christie credited Obama for springing into action to meet his requests, thanking him and calling it a \u201cgreat working relationship to make sure we\u2019re doing the jobs that people elected us to do.\u201d Christie\u2019s praise, along with photos of Obama placing his hand on the governor\u2019s shoulder, became a political cudgel for opponents within his own party, including its eventual leader. During a presidential rally in 2015, then-GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said he thought his rival was \u201cgoing to vote for Obama\u201d when he saw the image. \u201cI don\u2019t call it a hug, I call it a hug mentally. It was like \u2013 it was unbelievable,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHe was like a little boy: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m with the President.\u2019 Remember he flew in the helicopter and he was all excited to be in the helicopter? I said, \u2018I would have put you in my helicopter. It\u2019s much nicer.\u2019 \u201c Known for the same kind of polarizing and controversial moves as many far-right House members, Comer is a Trump supporter. He campaigned for Trump ahead of the 2020 election and voted against impeachment following the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. But Comer had told The Washington Post in 2017 that he wasn\u2019t sure if \u201cthis Trump thing\u201d was sustainable. Asked if it was difficult for Biden to prepare to visit a conservative-leaning area, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that the President looks at the victims \u201cas human beings, not as people who have partisan affiliations.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s hard to prepare, I would say the President just wants to send a clear message and stand by people in these communities as they\u2019re going through this difficult time,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with comments from Rep. James Comer.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday will announce a new slate of commitments from the private sector to invest in the Northern Triangle, senior White House officials say, marking the administration\u2019s latest attempt to address the root causes of migration from the region by promoting economic opportunity. The announcement follows an initial agreement, dubbed a \u201cCall to Action,\u201d released in May, that detailed $750 million in commitments from major companies like Microsoft, Mastercard, Chobani, Duolingo, Nespresso, Bancolombia and Davivienda. In response to the months-old call, Nespresso is now working with over 1,200 farmers in the region, according to a White House fact sheet, and is sourcing coffees from farms in Honduras and El Salvador for the first time in the company\u2019s history. Mastercard will announce a new memorandum of understanding with Guatemala\u2019s government in an effort to eventually provide digital banking to the region. And Microsoft will announce it has expanded internet access to more than 1 million people in Honduras, including indigenous communities, as part of its pledge to expand internet access to as many as 3 million people in the region by July 2022. For completely new commitments that will raise the total number of investments from $750 million to $1.2 billion for the region, Parkdale Mills will announce it intends to invest $150 million to build a new yarn spinning facility in Honduras, PepsiCo will announce $190 million of investments in northern Central America through 2025, and Cargill will invest an additional $150 million over the next five years \u201cwith the intention of improving farmer livelihoods and building economic resilience in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador,\u201d according to the fact sheet. One senior official said White House staff and federal agencies have made \u201cdramatic progress\u201d in laying down foundational work in the region that was neglected by the Trump administration. The aide credited Harris\u2019 \u201cvision\u201d and \u201cstrategic approach\u201d for making the gains possible. \u201cThe vice president is committed to this project, not simply because it\u2019s something that the President asked her to do, although that\u2019s very important,\u201d the official told reporters in a briefing call. \u201cBut that this region is our neighborhood. These people are our closest neighbors and partners. We want to do the right thing for root causes, but also as part of a broad approach to migration.\u201d Harris will announce the commitments in a joint event Monday, convened by the State Department, the US Chamber of Commerce and the Partnership for Central America, to support investment in the region and attended by multiple CEOs as she continues to try to leverage private sector influence as part of the administration\u2019s strategy for the Northern Triangle, particularly in aiding economic concerns in the region. \u201cThese private sector commitments touch on a range of strategic priorities in the region, including things like digital inclusion, climate smart agriculture, workforce development, gender equity and opportunity and supply chain resilience,\u201d a second official said. \u201cAnd all of this showing the momentum and progress that the vice president feels is necessary for the private sector to go hand in hand with the comprehensive efforts of the US government.\u201d In March, during an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, President Joe Biden tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts with the Northern Triangle. Most minors apprehended on the US southern border are from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras \u2013 a region where major hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic took a devastating toll. Harris has faced ongoing criticism for not being assertive enough on the US-Mexico border, despite aides and Harris herself emphasizing that she does not manage the southern border. In July, the administration later revealed a 20-page root causes strategy that outlined the administration\u2019s approach to improving conditions and creating opportunity in the region by addressing economic insecurity and inequality, combating corruption, promoting respect for human rights, countering and preventing violence, and tackling sexual, gender-based and domestic violence. Experts have told CNN those actions are important to improving conditions on the ground over time but argue that to achieve sustainability, some level of government buy-in will be necessary. And that can be complicated by the systemic issues plaguing Central American governments. In El Salvador, there\u2019s concern about limiting checks and balances in government, while in Honduras, where the outgoing president has been implicated in a drug trafficking case, there\u2019s greater concern about corruption within government. And in Guatemala, there are also concerns about government corruption, though early on the vice president\u2019s office identified the country as their primary liaison to the region. Harris spoke to Honduras\u2019 President-elect Xiomara Castro on Friday, according to a readout distributed by the vice president\u2019s office, marking the first time Harris has spoken to a leader of that country since her assignment began in March. All other communication between countries happened on various other government levels. Officials say Castro\u2019s history-making election as the first woman in that role, as well as her interest in fighting corruption and growing the economy of Honduras, creates an \u201cexciting agenda\u201d for Harris to collaborate. But officials did not answer whether Harris has spoken with the leader of El Salvador or planned to in the future. Still, senior officials told reporters that the investments from private companies and federal government are being monitored \u201cextremely closely,\u201d at the direction of Harris, to limit corruption and waste. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been very clear with the governments: in order to make these work, you\u2019re going to have to implement certain elements of reform. Whether that\u2019s on the tax regulation, whether it\u2019s how shipping has been done, but there are a variety of things that we\u2019ve said, \u2018Look, if you want to maximize the benefit here and you want other foreign companies to follow these, here are the steps that need to be taken,\u2019\u201d the official said. \u201cAnd we are working very closely with the governments, the parliaments and a variety of civil society organizations to make sure that we\u2019re building that out.\u201d Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Political candidates across the country this year have been forced to defend their ties to the states they hope to represent. Whether those attacks are nearly as potent as they once were, however, is an open question. Political operatives and academics argue that recent shifts in politics, including a hyper-partisan electorate where party identification is the most important factor in the minds of voters and a reality that almost every political race has become nationalized, have made residency attacks far less powerful than they once were, especially in a general election. \u201cOpponents in a primary can make a big deal of them and they can hurt you. But because we\u2019re so polarized, because we don\u2019t have conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, once you get that nomination, I think most people in your party are going to come home and vote for you,\u201d said Christopher Galdieri, the author of \u201cStranger in a Strange State: The Politics of Carpetbagging from Robert Kennedy to Scott Brown.\u201d Republican Senate campaigns are rife with residency questions. In Pennsylvania\u2019s GOP primary, several candidates \u2013 most notably Dr. Mehmet Oz \u2013 have had their ties to the Keystone State scrutinized. Georgia US Senate candidate Herschel Walker lived in Texas until recently. And Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski has taken aim at her primary opponent, Kelly Tshibaka, over how long she has called Alaska home. But the trend is not just in Senate campaigns. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who is running to again represent Montana in Congress after he left his seat to serve in the Trump administration, has fielded repeated attacks that he no longer fully lives in Montana but instead spends most of his time in Santa Barbara, California. And since former New York Times columnist Nick Kristof announced a run for governor of Oregon \u2013 the state where he was born and raised \u2013 some have raised questions about his ties to the Beaver State on whether he meets the Oregon Constitution\u2019s standard for gubernatorial candidates. Charges of carpetbagging have been part of American politics for more than 150 years. The term, coined after the Civil War, was primarily used to describe Northerners who traveled to the South to start businesses and eventually run for office. Candidates from outside a state have won in earlier decades: Hillary Clinton became a senator from New York in 2001 after spending most of her life in Illinois, Arkansas and Washington, DC; Robert Kennedy became a senator from New York in 1965 despite his family being famously from Massachusetts; and Mitt Romney became a senator from Utah in 2019 despite serving as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Even with these successes, a candidate\u2019s ties \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 to an area have long been seen as a potent barb, one that allows an opponent to question a candidate\u2019s knowledge of their constituents and label them as out of touch. Even as the sheer number of candidates with suspect links to their desired constituents in 2022 is fueling these questions, candidates take the critiques seriously. When reporters and political opponents raised questions about whether then-New York City mayoral candidate Eric Adams actually lived in the city, the Brooklyn Borough president took the attacks so seriously that he led reporters on a bizarre tour of his basement apartment on Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood that included a look inside his fridge. \u201cHow foolish would someone have to be to run to be the mayor of the city of New York and live in another municipality,\u201d Adams said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s 101 that someone is going to follow me throughout this entire campaign.\u201d Attacks around residency issues have changed in recent years, said Galdieri, a professor at New Hampshire\u2019s St. Anselm College. While they may have become less potent in a general election \u2013 when voters are more concerned now about party identity than just about anything else \u2013 they are more threatening in a primary. Galdieri said the clearest example of this was the race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Scott Brown in 2014. Brown had represented neighboring Massachusetts in the Senate from 2010 to 2013, but after Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren defeated him in the 2012 election, Brown decided to hop across the border and run against Shaheen. Accusations of being a carpetbagger became a central attack against him, but the Republican easily won the party\u2019s nomination and ran a tight race against Shaheen, losing by around 3 percentage points. More notable to Galdieri, however, was that Shaheen, even though she was running against someone who had represented another state the year prior, was held to the same share of the vote she had received six years earlier, when she won her first term. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll win, but I think you\u2019re going to probably not perform that much worse than generic Republican or generic Democrat in your race,\u201d Galdieri said. Even campaigns engaged in some of these attacks acknowledged that they aren\u2019t as powerful as years past. Tom Winter is one of a few Democrats looking to challenge Zinke\u2019s bid to represent Montana in Congress. In a tweet that has now gone viral, Winter takes a selfie video while walking along a street in Whitefish, Montana, to \u201csee where Ryan Zinke supposedly lives.\u201d \u201cBut it turns out, guys, that it\u2019s a hotel,\u201d Winter says, panning to a sign for the Snowfrog Inn before he delivers what has become a familiar attack against the former interior secretary: The Republican splits time between Montana and a home in California. Heather Swift, Zinke\u2019s campaign manager, dismissed any implication that Montana isn\u2019t Zinke\u2019s home, arguing that the Republican and his family built their home in Whitefish when the would-be congressman was still in the military and hoped to one day run it as a bed-and-breakfast. That never happened \u2013 \u201cHe was pretty busy representing Montana in Congress and as secretary,\u201d said Swift \u2013 but it has become one of the most persistent attacks against Zinke since he began running for public office. \u201cPolitical opponents tried this stupid lie in 2014 and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Swift said. \u201cIf they want to waste their time and money on it, have at it.\u201d Blake Cilwick, Winter\u2019s campaign manager, admitted that these attacks against Zinke have failed before, but added that part of the goal is to stir up more recent bipartisan resentment in Montana against out-of-staters \u2013 particularly those from California \u2013 changing the Mountain West state. \u201cZinke has been seemingly immune to this before. But it feels different this time around,\u201d Cilwick said, pointing to the resentment Montanans have toward what out-of-staters are doing to housing prices in Western Montana. Even if the potency of the attacks has diminished, campaigns forced to respond to residency questions are quick to do so, a sign that they worry about the impact they could have in a primary. When Oz announced his Senate campaign in November, one of the swiftest Democratic attacks was that the television doctor actually lived in New Jersey, citing a 2020 People Magazine feature on his \u201cNew Jersey mansion\u201d that featured sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline. Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell, the New Jersey congressman who represents the area, sarcastically congratulated \u201cmy North Jersey constituent\u201d on his run in Pennsylvania, while Malcom Kenyatta, one of the Democrats vying for the seat, tweeted, \u201cDr. Oz (R-NJ) has no business running for Senate here in Pennsylvania or back home in New Jersey.\u201d Asked about questions around Oz\u2019s Pennsylvania residency, a campaign spokesperson said the candidate \u201creturned home to Pennsylvania last year,\u201d noting that the doctor had attended medical and business school in Philadelphia and met and married his wife there. The spokesperson called the attacks \u201ca distraction from the fact our opponents on both sides know Dr. Oz is a formidable challenger.\u201d \u201cI came home a year ago,\u201d Oz said in a Fox News interview. \u201cIt feels good to be back.\u201d Oz isn\u2019t the only candidate in the Pennsylvania US Senate Republican primary with questioned ties to the state. Carla Sands, an ambassador under former President Donald Trump, recently lived in California and was a delegate from that state for Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention. And David McCormick, a hedge fund manager who was born in Pennsylvania, is said to be considering a bid, despite living in Connecticut for years. \u201cThe lack of any strong candidates in this Pennsylvania GOP Senate field has attracted wealthy out-of-staters who see the field\u2019s dysfunction as an opportunity to buy a Senate seat,\u201d said Jack Doyle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. \u201cWhoever limps out of this primary is going to be seriously damaged for the general.\u201d But possibly the most brash candidate with residency questions is Walker, the former University of Georgia star running back who recently returned to his home state from Texas to mount a Senate bid backed by Trump. Walker has lived in Texas for years, the state where he spent much of his professional football career with the Dallas Cowboys. He registered to vote in Georgia in August, as he was on the cusp of announcing a Senate bid. \u201cHerschel\u2019s wife Julie owns a home in Atlanta, GA which is where they live and spend the majority of their time when they are not traveling the state campaigning,\u201d Mallory Blount, spokesperson for the Walker campaign, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cHerschel will always consider his home to be Wrightsville, GA where he grew up, where his family lives, and where he owns property.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Oregon\u2019s state nickname.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden this week has confronted escalating tensions with China and Russia, testing his ability to manage antagonistic leaders and forcing other countries to pick sides. In just the last two days, Biden\u2019s White House has announced that American diplomats would boycott the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in China and the President held a secure video call with Vladimir Putin in which he made clear the US is ready to impose economic penalties should Moscow escalate military action in Ukraine. \u201cOne nation can\u2019t force another nation to change its border; one nation cannot tell another to change its politics; and nations can\u2019t tell others who they can work with,\u201d Biden told the Russian leader, according to an official familiar with the conversation. Two days later, Biden will convene a democracy summit designed as a show-of-force against authoritarian regimes, hoping to make an argument for democracy at the same time he presses his allies to take a harder line against countries like Russia and China. The week\u2019s events have laid bare competing crosscurrents of Biden\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 at once isolating anti-democratic regimes while also trying to engage their leaders. It\u2019s a balancing act that crystallizes the competition Biden sees as defining the rest of the 21st century \u2013 democracy vs. autocracy \u2013 while showing some echoes of the previous one. When the White House announced this week that no American officials would attend the upcoming winter Olympics in Beijing, officials were hesitant to label the decision a \u201cboycott,\u201d wary of drawing parallels to Jimmy Carter\u2019s move in 1980 preventing even American athletes from participating in the Moscow games at the height of the Cold War. Comparison to that long stretch of frigid superpower competition isn\u2019t welcome in the Biden administration, which downplays those similarities to current global threats. Biden himself told the United Nations earlier this year he was not seeking to divide the world into \u201crigid blocks,\u201d though he repeatedly describes an existential battle between democracies and autocracies. Speaking with leaders like Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, while also trying to convince allies to form a united front against them, has proved an enduring element of Biden-era foreign policy as he seeks to keep worsening relations with Russia and China from toppling over into open conflict. The White House insists Thursday\u2019s democracy summit isn\u2019t meant as a challenge to any single country or leader, even if some appear to be interpreting it that way. Yet the list of invitees \u2013 which includes Taiwan \u2013 has already generated anger in China, which insisted it, too, was a democracy. \u201cWe see the summit\u2019s goals as being about much more than any one government,\u201d a senior administration official said on Tuesday in previewing the gathering. \u201cThe summit really aims to bring together a diverse group of participants to build a shared foundation for democratic renewal, and we think it\u2019s a strong story to tell.\u201d Biden confronts 2 rivals in 24 hours Originally conceived when he was a candidate hoping to rebut then-President Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of global strongmen, the meeting will be centered around three pillars: strengthening democracy and defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption and promoting respect for human rights, officials said. They explained the invite list \u2013 which includes some countries with poor track records on human rights, like Pakistan \u2013 was designed to highlight democracy at all levels of society, not just in national government. During the summit, Biden won\u2019t shy away from acknowledging recent struggles in the United States on upholding its own democracy, according to officials involved in planning the event, who cited Biden\u2019s past criticism of Trump\u2019s false allegations widespread election fraud as something he could repeat during his two appearances at the virtual gathering. \u201cThe President has been absolutely clear that protecting Americans\u2019 constitutional rights and the integrity of our elections from the systematic assault that folks \u2013 in particular, Republican legislators \u2013 have been engaged in across the country is a must and that this historic threat requires strong voting rights legislation. And you\u2019ll hear that from the President again this week,\u201d an official said. Proving democracy can better deliver than autocracy has been the underpinning of Biden\u2019s entire foreign policy and the driving theme of his two trips abroad so far. Yet sour domestic politics and persistent inequality have provided an opening for countries like Russia and China to criticize American-style democracy as flawed, seeking to undermine Biden as he works to rally the world against authoritarianism. China\u2019s state council released a paper over the weekend titled \u201cChina: Democracy that works,\u201d despite the country not holding elections for its leaders and banning opposition political parties. Putin, meanwhile, has claimed the arrest of rioters involved in the January 6 insurrection attempt at the US Capitol amounts to a crackdown on dissent, adopting a talking point used by Republicans who have defended the event as a peaceful protest. Presidents Putin and Xi are both men with whom Biden shares a long history, though each has demonstrated a steady drift toward authoritarianism since Biden was taking meetings when he served as vice president. As he began a two-hour-and-one-minute phone call with Putin on Tuesday, arranged to warn of dire economic consequences should he move ahead with an invasion of Ukraine, Biden made clear he wanted to see the Russian leader again soon. \u201cI hope the next time we meet we do it in person,\u201d Biden told Putin as the talks got underway, Biden sitting in the basement White House Situation Room and Putin beaming in from his dacha on the Black Sea. The talk became more serious from there, according to officials, who said Biden spelled out in businesslike terms what might happen should Putin decide to move ahead with an invasion, including potential sanctions on members of Putin\u2019s inner circle and deployment of additional US troops to NATO member countries. \u201cIt was a useful meeting,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said afterward, saying Biden warned Putin he is ready to take steps the US previously avoided should he decide to move ahead with an invasion. \u201cThings we did not do in 2014, we are prepared to do now,\u201d Biden told Putin, according to Sullivan. It was a notable message given Biden\u2019s own recommendations when he was vice president to then-President Barack Obama that the US increase lethal aid to Ukraine and force severe economic pain on Russia \u2013 steps that met resistance from other administration officials. Now, Biden says he is prepared to go further. If they are issued, sanctions are likely to go after top Russian oligarchs, limiting their ability to travel and potentially cutting off access to American banking and credit card systems. Officials have also been weighing disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international payment system, upon which Russia remains heavily reliant, a \u201cnuclear\u201d option that would inflict serious economic damage. Biden spent the evening prior to his call working to convince European leaders to join him in threatening withering economic sanctions on Russia should Putin decide to invade Ukraine, despite fears the Russian President could tighten gas supplies to Europe as the weather turns colder. Over the past several weeks, US and foreign officials have also discussed the possibility of a collective diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics, though as of Wednesday, only Australia had joined the US in announcing one. It was only three weeks ago Biden convened a lengthy virtual summit with Xi intended to bring a sense of predictability to an otherwise fractious relationship between Washington and Beijing. Officials said the topic of the Olympics didn\u2019t arise. There were signs early in Biden\u2019s presidency that diplomacy with Russia and China would be a rocky endeavor. Within the span of one week in March, Biden raised Putin\u2019s ire by calling him a \u201ckiller\u201d in an interview, while in Alaska some of his top diplomats openly sparred with their Chinese counterparts as cameras rolled. Since then, Biden and his team have strived to bring the relationships with Russia and China into more predictable terrain, including by arranging summits between Biden and their leaders. The difficulties of the approach are also becoming plain. Six months after his closely watched face-to-face summit with Putin in Geneva \u2013 the success of which he said afterward could only be discerned in six months \u2013 he is working to stave off a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden is set for one of the most critical calls of his presidency on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he gets stark warnings from the US intelligence community that Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine as soon as next month. Amid \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Russia\u2019s planning for \u201csignificant military action against Ukraine,\u201d the President will not entertain any of Putin\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d on NATO expansion in Eastern Europe and will make clear that the US is prepared to respond to an invasion with sanctions and \u2013 if needed \u2013 additional troops in Europe to reassure nervous allies, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. The call comes nearly six months after Biden met Putin for the first time as president in Geneva, Switzerland, when he hoped to calm tensions by finding areas where the US and Russia could cooperate like cybersecurity and strategic arms control. The two men have a long history, and Biden has said explicitly he does not hold Putin in particularly high regard. After a meeting with Putin in 2011, then-Vice President Biden said he looked into Putin\u2019s eyes and declared: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u201d  During an interview in March, Biden called Putin a killer, saying that the Russian leader \u201cwill pay a price\u201d for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US election. And although the June summit was cordial, the Russian military\u2019s recent escalations show the meeting did not produce the kind of \u201cstable and predictable\u201d relationship the US was hoping for. The relationship took a dramatic turn last month when US officials began to sound the alarm about irregular Russian military movements near the Ukraine border. Russia has now amassed nearly 100,000 troops near the border, US Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said last weekend, and has also erected supply lines in the area such as medical units and fuel that could sustain a drawn-out conflict, sources told CNN. A US intelligence assessment found that Russia could be preparing to invade as early as next month with as many as 175,000 troops from positions near Ukraine\u2019s southern, western, and northeastern borders. Officials report a \u201csignificant spike\u201d in Russian disinformation operations characterizing the Ukrainian government as illegitimate, and US officials have also shared with senior Ukrainian officials evidence that Russia \u2013 through the FSB, Russia\u2019s successor to the KGB \u2013 is engaging in destabilizing activities inside Ukraine to foment dissent against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s administration. Senior administration officials say Biden \u2013 who had the Ukraine portfolio as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president and has made half a dozen trips there \u2013 is realistic about what he can achieve directly with Putin. But in Biden\u2019s view, any conversation is better than silence, and he believes Putin responds to directness and strength. When he sits down in the White House\u2019s Situation Room on Tuesday to conduct the secure video call, he plans to lay out in detailed terms the ways Russia would be punished if an invasion goes forward. Those penalties include \u201csubstantive economic countermeasures\u201d meant to inflict \u201csignificant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy,\u201d the senior official said, in coordination with European allies. In an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Matthew Chance, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov urged Biden to stand firm against Moscow. \u201cIf I can advise President Biden, I would like him to articulate to Mr. Putin that no red lines from the Kremlin side should be here. The red line is here in Ukraine and the civilized world will react without hesitation,\u201d Reznikov said. \u201cThe idea of not provoking Russia will not work,\u201d he added. Despite the military escalations, it is still unclear whether Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine, and some officials have speculated that the buildup could be a way for Russia to leverage concessions from the West. Putin is expected to demand Biden make a binding guarantee that will \u201cexclude any further NATO expansion eastward and the deployment of weapons systems that would threaten us on the territories of neighboring countries, including Ukraine,\u201d Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters last week. Asked on Monday about Russia\u2019s demands for a binding pledge from NATO not to expand further east, however, the senior official said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think talk of red lines is helpful, and as the President has said, we\u2019re not going to operate according to that logic of accepting anyone\u2019s red lines.\u201d Many US officials, meanwhile, believe Russia is just using discussions about NATO encroachment as an excuse to attack Ukraine, knowing that Biden and other western officials will not accept Putin\u2019s demands \u201cOur concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month, referring to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. Blinken spoke to Zelensky on Monday and Biden will speak to Zelensky in the coming days to brief him on the call with Putin, the official said. The US and its European and NATO allies have been weighing a number of measures to deter a Russian attack, including sending military advisers and new weaponry to Ukraine. The US is also taking steps to plan for additional US troop deployments in Europe on NATO\u2019s eastern flank to help reassure allies of continued American support, the senior official said. \u201cI think you could anticipate that in the event of an invasion, the need to reinforce the confidence and reassurances of our NATO allies and our eastern flank allies would be real. And the United States would be prepared to provide that reassurance,\u201d this person said. \u201cWe are working through the prudent planning of what we would have to do in the event of such an escalation and how we would have to ensure the security of our NATO allies in that context.\u201d \u201cAggressive\u201d new sanctions against members of Putin\u2019s inner circle and on Russian energy producers are also being considered, people familiar with the discussions said. The new economic sanctions could target a variety of sectors, including energy producers, Russian banks and Russia\u2019s sovereign debt, the people said. There is also serious discussion underway about denying Russian energy producers from debt markets should they invade Ukraine, a senior US official told CNN. \u201cWe have put together a pretty damn aggressive package,\u201d another senior US official said. This person added that the US has warned Russia that if it invades Ukraine the US and Europe together will impose the worst economic sanctions that have ever been imposed on a country, outside of Iran and North Korea. Officials are also weighing cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system should it move forward with an invasion, sources said, but that would be a \u201cnuclear\u201d option. To some Ukrainians, the potential measures are not enough. An adviser to Zelensky told CNN that imposing sanctions only after Russia moves to invade would be futile, and that at least some penalties should be imposed preemptively to get Russia to back off. \u201cThe view from Kyiv is that any prospective sanctions should Putin invade have already been factored in by Moscow and provide close to zero deterrence value,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHowever, the imposition of strong sanctions now \u2014 with roll back provisions built into them should Russia take real steps to de-escalate \u2014 have a chance to work.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Zahra Ullah and Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy summoned GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace for separate meetings Tuesday night, wanting to deliver a simple message amid their bitter and public feud: \u201cStop it.\u201d His message didn\u2019t seem to take hold. Emerging from her meeting, Greene told CNN that both she and former President Donald Trump would back a primary challenge to Mace in 2022. And after she met with McCarthy, Mace had this to say when asked about Greene\u2019s threat: \u201cAll I can say about Marjorie Taylor Greene is bless her f***ing heart.\u201d The boiling tensions over the hard-right faction of the House GOP conference are alarming many rank-and-file Republicans, who are bluntly warning that the failure of party leaders to rein in their loudest voices directly threatens their efforts to win back the majority next year. At the center of the feud: McCarthy, a California Republican who typically avoids public condemnation of his colleagues and opts instead to hold private conversations with his members \u2013 all in a bid to keep the peace between the warring wings of his conference and bolster his own chances of becoming speaker after the 2022 midterm elections. McCarthy says he'd put Greene and Gosar back on committees if Republicans win House But his failure to tamp down the attacks \u2013 largely from the right wing of his conference against his more moderate colleagues \u2013 is causing growing concern in the ranks, with one GOP lawmaker calling Greene in particular \u201cpoisonous\u201d to the party. \u201cIf Kevin McCarthy does not get Marjorie Taylor Greene in line somewhat, either through the conference disciplining her, or privately, it is going to undermine our efforts,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cAnd this is where leadership can step up. And I think if he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have a bit more of a civil war on your hands.\u201d The tension comes after Greene repeatedly called Mace, a Republican from a swing district, \u201ctrash.\u201d The reason why Greene bashed Mace: The South Carolina freshman had condemned another conservative Republican, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, for saying that Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who is Muslim, could be mistaken as a terrorist. McCarthy, who has been struggling to keep his party focused on its ultimate goal next year, seems to be recognizing that it\u2019s time to redirect members\u2019 focus. Moments before Mace entered his office Tuesday evening, McCarthy told CNN he had a message for both Mace and Greene: \u201cStop it.\u201d But despite McCarthy\u2019s efforts to privately cool the intraparty tensions, his tactics don\u2019t seem to be having much of an effect on the far-right conservatives. After leaving the meeting with McCarthy, Greene told CNN that she and Trump would back a primary challenge against Mace, the first woman to graduate from The Citadel military college, who had been seen by party leaders as a top recruit last cycle. \u201cObviously, I love that man,\u201d the Georgia Republican said of Trump, whom she had spoken with earlier in the day. \u201cAnd I have his support 1,000%. And unfortunately, Nancy Mace doesn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI will be very supportive of a primary challenger (to Mace), along with President Trump,\u201d Greene added. Marjorie Taylor Greene just called another House Republican 'trash' The dust-up is the latest in series of ugly intraparty spats, including a move to punish the 13 House Republicans who voted for the new infrastructure law, such as New York Rep. John Katko, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in his chamber, whom Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz had said \u201cstabbed\u201d Republicans in the back \u2013 a comment echoed by a number of other conservatives. Katko was also one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the US Capitol last January. Returning to session Tuesday after the Thanksgiving recess, senior Republicans said the focus of their party must change immediately in order to capitalize on the major advantages they currently enjoy in the fight for the House majority next year. If not, they said, self-inflicted wounds could give Democrats an improbable victory. \u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Rep. Fred Upton, a veteran Michigan Republican, said when asked whether he thought the most recent eruption over Boebert and Greene hurts their chances at taking back the majority. \u201cIt\u2019s uncalled for.\u201d Upton added: \u201cIt\u2019s tit for tat. Where\u2019s the shovel? This needs to end.\u201d \u201cHave you ever seen a team where they should be winning, and you\u2019ll just look on the sidelines and then coach is yelling at a player, players yell at the coach and it doesn\u2019t show they\u2019re on track to win,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican. \u201cAnytime we\u2019re not focusing on what they\u2019re doing and what we want to do, I think it\u2019s not a good thing.\u201d The aggressive attacks against fellow Republicans also have come from Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters, putting McCarthy in an awkward spot as he tries to stay in the good graces of the former President while also trying to focus his party to stay unified against President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping agenda. Moderate House Republican warns McCarthy over embracing far-right members That dynamic was in full display earlier in November when another member of the hard-right faction, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, tweeted an animated video where he acted violently toward Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Biden himself. That earned him a rare censure from the House, which also stripped him of his committee assignments. But McCarthy chose to deal with Gosar privately \u2013 and rallied his conference to reject the efforts by Democrats to punish him. In the most recent episode involving Boebert and Greene, McCarthy tried to work behind the scenes to tamp down intraparty tensions. He tried to broker a meeting between Boebert and Omar, while later calling Greene on Friday after she criticized his leadership. McCarthy also spoke on the phone with Mace on Tuesday after the South Carolina Republican fired back at Greene, whom she characterized as \u201cbats*** crazy\u201d in a series of emojis on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be a big tent party,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rice, a Republican of South Carolina who voted to impeach Trump. \u201cWe need more conservative Republicans; we need more moderate Republicans. To win nationwide, we\u2019ve got to have all of those. And we\u2019ve got to have independents as well. We\u2019ve got a really good chance to move forward in the next election, but we\u2019ve got to be more inclusive and accepting of each other. We\u2019ve got to stop attacking each other.\u201d Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the GOP whip, who could be the majority leader next Congress, told CNN that it\u2019s time for House Republicans to refocus on issues \u2013 something he said would be a focus of a Wednesday meeting with his full conference. \u201cInflation crisis, border crisis, energy crisis, confidence crisis and Joe Biden\u2019s policies \u2013 that\u2019s what the focus needs to be on, and how we can solve these problems that they\u2019ve created,\u201d Scalise said.  \u201cEverybody\u2019s been away for Thanksgiving. And now that we\u2019re back, we\u2019ve got to get back focused on the things that matter to families back home.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

Ron DeSantis has gone from being a shining example in Donald Trump\u2019s eyes of a MAGA leader molded in his image to an average politician who forgot his roots as he rose to Republican stardom. People close to both men first noticed the palpable shift in Trump\u2019s posture toward DeSantis earlier this year as enthusiasm for the Florida governor swelled among donors and GOP operatives who praised his laissez-faire response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The more DeSantis\u2019 popularity soared, the more obsessed Trump became with receiving credit for his political celebrity. In April, Trump had told Fox News that DeSantis would \u201ccertainly\u201d be under consideration for the VP slot if he were to launch a third presidential campaign in 2024. By October, the former President was demanding that he publicly rule out a White House bid of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Trump is complaining about Ron\u2026 but he likes to remind Ron and others that he made him,\u201d said a person close to the former President, who added that Trump has been telling people around him that DeSantis could show more gratitude. Politico first reported the tension in their relationship last Friday. A statement to CNN from Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich appeared to confirm Trump\u2019s obsession with receiving credit for DeSantis\u2019 success. Budowich said the former President\u2019s 2020 victory in Florida \u201cpaved the way for Republicans, including Governor Ron DeSantis, to sweep the state in 2022\u201d and suggested that Trump \u201ccatapulted\u201d then-Congressman DeSantis \u201cinto the Governor\u2019s Mansion\u201d with his endorsement in the 2018 GOP primary for Florida governor. \u201cPresident Trump remains committed and supportive of Governor Ron DeSantis, who has been a champion for President Trump\u2019s America First agenda,\u201d said Budowich. Though the two remain in regular contact, Trump has become increasingly irritated at DeSantis\u2019 refusal to publicly dismiss a 2024 bid of his own if the former President himself decides to run. Two people close to the situation said DeSantis has privately assured Trump and others that he has no intention of challenging him in a GOP presidential primary, but they noted that Trump won\u2019t be fully satisfied until the governor says so publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump appreciates the conundrum DeSantis is in. He wants him to say, \u2018I won\u2019t run,\u2019 but DeSantis isn\u2019t going to weigh in like that,\u201d said a former Trump aide, who suggested that DeSantis\u2019 current approach was politically savvy given his interest in securing another term as governor. \u201cIt\u2019s a very smart view. Until you get reelected, don\u2019t start to have a conversation about 2024. If you\u2019re trying to ask people for your vote and you\u2019re leaning into presidential speculation, it makes it a lot harder,\u201d the aide said. Though DeSantis has previously dismissed 2024 chatter about him as \u201cnonsense,\u201d he has avoided taking the unequivocal public vow not to challenge Trump that other prospective Republican hopefuls have made. Earlier this month, he officially filed to run for reelection for Florida governor in 2022 and he recently told Fox News host Sean Hannity that\u2019s where his focus lies. \u201cI\u2019m not considering anything beyond doing my job,\u201d DeSantis said. A spokesman for DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment. Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9, the executive director of the Republican Party of Florida who has worked for Trump and DeSantis, told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into that at all. I\u2019ll leave that for somebody else.\u201d Trump allies say it\u2019s the organic enthusiasm for DeSantis \u2013 among deep-pocketed donors and the grassroots flank of the GOP \u2013 that has fueled Trump\u2019s frustration with the governor, especially as it relates to 2024. When Trump\u2019s name was removed from a presidential straw poll at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, it was DeSantis who led the pack with 43% support among the MAGA-friendly audience. Months later, at a September 13 press conference where he decried the Biden administration\u2019s pending Covid-19 vaccine mandate for large companies, DeSantis offered a bashful smirk when another state official pointed to someone sporting a \u201cDeSantis 2024\u201d T-shirt in the crowd. And for months, billionaire Republican donors who bankrolled Trump have opened their checkbooks to boost DeSantis in his bid for a second term as Florida\u2019s governor. Florida Gov. DeSantis officially launches 2022 reelection bid Former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross donated $50,000 to DeSantis\u2019 campaign in April, according to publicly available campaign finance data, as did close Trump pal and Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who contributed $250,000 in March. Interactive Brokers Group chairman Thomas Peterffy, whose last six-figure donation to the Trump Victory fund occurred in September 2017, also gave $250,000 to DeSantis in April. Peterffy told Bloomberg News earlier this fall that he would prefer to see DeSantis as the Republican presidential nominee in 2024 because he is less impulsive than Trump. Nick Iarossi, a Florida lobbyist and DeSantis bundler, claimed Trump supporters are the ones reaching out to support DeSantis, not the other way around. Another person close to DeSantis, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, said he had personally witnessed instances where the governor had to tell donors \u201cwho are all excited about a presidential bid, \u2018No, I\u2019m not focused on 2024.\u2019\u201d \u201cEveryone is talking about my governor,\u201d said Shawn Foster, a GOP state committeeman who helped organize a county fundraiser headlined by DeSantis in September that operatives believe was the largest in state history \u2013 other than one once hosted by Trump. DeSantis has raised $56 million so far this year through a political committee, and in a sign of his growing national stature, almost half of his 2021 haul has come from outside Florida. His committee has spent sparingly \u2013 just $2.3 million in the past 12 months \u2013 though it has paid to keep up with demand for the brash, DeSantis-themed merchandise for sale on his website. DeSantis famously sold \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci my Florida\u201d koozies this summer as the Sunshine State became the epicenter of the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Now for sale: DeSantis-branded golf balls with the slogan \u201cFlorida\u2019s Governor has a pair.\u201d The simmering tension between Trump and DeSantis comes as the former President himself inches closer to another campaign for the White House in 2024. Trump has been closely tracking what rumored Republican presidential hopefuls have said about their own interest in running, and is most interested in those \u2013 like DeSantis \u2013 who command significant popularity with his core supporters. DeSantis claims Biden running 'clandestine' flights to send migrants to Florida, but the routine transport also occurred under Trump With an eye toward 2024, Trump has been working aggressively since leaving office to exert his control over the Republican Party with endorsements of insurgent GOP candidates, regular appearances on the campaign trail and intense demands for loyalty from Republicans across the local, state and federal level. One former Trump White House official said the approach Trump has taken to ensure that he remains in charge of the party spares no one \u2013 not even elected Republicans who have demonstrated the utmost loyalty to him in most situations. \u201cHe wants to be top dog, not just nationally, but in these states\u201d that will matter if he becomes the Republican nominee in 2024, said the former White House official. The official noted that DeSantis isn\u2019t the only GOP governor who has been on the receiving end of the former President\u2019s praise one day and resented the next. \u201cHe was at the border with (Texas Gov.) Greg Abbott three or four months ago and then a month later, you get that statement where he was critical of Abbott,\u201d the official recalled, referring to a letter Trump wrote to the Texas governor in September demanding that he support a forensic audit of the state\u2019s 2020 election results. (Trump joined Abbott on a tour of the US-Mexico border in late June amid a surge of unauthorized border crossings under the Biden administration). \u201cHe changes his tune every other day with some of these guys and what you\u2019re seeing with DeSantis \u2013 Trump being hot and cold \u2013 isn\u2019t necessarily unique to him,\u201d said the former Trump White House official. If asked, Trump advisers believe the former President would campaign for DeSantis\u2019 re-election. Iarossi said he wasn\u2019t sure what Trump\u2019s involvement will be in 2022, but added: \u201cTrump\u2019s brand is still great in Florida so I think he\u2019s a great ally to have.\u201d Some Trump foes have picked up on the former President\u2019s jealousy and are using it to advance their own objectives. Next week, Palm Beach televisions, perhaps including those in Mar-a-Lago, will once again air a commercial by the Lincoln Project intended to remind Trump that DeSantis is the new GOP \u201cit\u201d guy. Rick Wilson, one of the ex-Republicans behind the Lincoln Project, is hoping to provoke a very specific reaction from Trump. \u201cWe want Trump to kill his own babies,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe believe if we narrow the field and it\u2019s only Trump in 2024, it\u2019s an easy choice for Americans to say \u2018no.\u2019\u201d DeSantis, who once aired a campaign commercial reading Trump\u2019s \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d to his infant son, has ably navigated Trump to his own political benefit for years. As a candidate for US Senate in 2016, DeSantis repeatedly declined to endorse Trump in the GOP presidential primary. But after Trump won and his popularity skyrocketed among Republican voters, DeSantis regularly appeared on Fox News where he was a staunch defender of the President. Trump took notice, and tweeted his support for DeSantis in the 2018 gubernatorial primary for governor over a better-funded establishment favorite. Trump has often reminded DeSantis of that history, claiming at a 2020 rally that DeSantis was polling at 3% and \u201chad no money\u201d before Trump got involved. \u201cHe ran, I endorsed him, his numbers went through the roof,\u201d Trump told the crowd. But if Trump is waiting for DeSantis to return the favor by publicly ceding the 2024 nomination, he shouldn\u2019t hold his breath. With a reelection campaign still ahead, and Democrats already accusing DeSantis of campaigning for his next office, the governor\u2019s allies say it doesn\u2019t make sense politically for him to speak about the future. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said he\u2019s running in 2024,\u201d Iarossi said. \u201cWhy would he dismiss something that he hasn\u2019t expressed interest in running for?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Thursday she recognizes President Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States, even as she claimed there were \u201clots of problems\u201d with the 2020 election that Republican candidates should address. \u201cPainfully, Joe Biden won the election and it\u2019s very painful to watch. He\u2019s the President. We know that,\u201d McDaniel said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in Washington, DC. While the RNC has for months criticized Biden in press releases and rapid response materials, McDaniel\u2019s comments Thursday marked the first time the party chairwoman has clearly stated that Biden \u201cwon\u201d the 2020 election. Her comments also come as former President Donald Trump, who McDaniel said remains an overwhelming influence on the Republican Party, continues to push conspiracy theories about the 2020 election with the help of leaders across the GOP\u2019s election apparatus. Earlier this year, the RNC unveiled a \u201cCommittee on Election Integrity,\u201d and, on Thursday, McDaniel declined to say whether Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to block congressional certification of Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory was unconstitutional. \u201cI\u2019m not a constitutional scholar,\u201d McDaniel said. Despite encouraging Republicans to focus on pocketbook issues and their political opponents as next year\u2019s midterm elections approach, McDaniel did not bat down Trump\u2019s relentless focus on relitigating the 2020 election or his attempts to strong-arm GOP governors and lawmakers into supporting election audits in various states. \u201cI think every Republican right now should be talking about 2022. I\u2019m not talking about anything else other than what Biden is doing to destroy our country: high gas prices, an open border, an opioid crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody else can do their own thing, but I think we should be talking about Joe Biden.\u201d However, McDaniel added, Republicans in certain parts of the country can also benefit from talking about election reform. \u201cWe have to talk about the things that people saw,\u201d she said when asked about Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud. \u201cWe have to show our voters we are putting processes in place that will ensure the election is fair and transparent.\u201d Some Republicans have expressed concern that the party\u2019s relentless focus on voter fraud and willingness to enable Trump\u2019s lies about the election will depress turnout in the midterms, potentially thwarting a GOP wave that could place the House and Senate back under the party\u2019s control. Still, leaders at the highest levels of the party\u2019s election apparatus have done little to steer the former President\u2019s focus in a different direction. Over the summer, for instance, the RNC issued a 23-page report accusing Democrat-led states of using the Covid-19 pandemic to change election practices to the benefit of Democratic candidates. The report claimed there were numerous instances in the 2020 election where Democrats \u201cbrought chaos and uncertainty to our sacred Democratic processes\u201d and made a series of policy recommendations for Republicans to pursue \u2013 including the elimination of universal mail-in voting. With McDaniel at its helm, the RNC also joined Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign immediately after the 2020 election in filing dozens of unsuccessful lawsuits that challenged statewide results or changes to election practices. At the time, RNC chief counsel Justin Riemer reportedly warned his colleagues in emails later unearthed by The Washington Post that they shouldn\u2019t elevate the claims about ballot fraud and a stolen election that Trump\u2019s allies were making. \u201cThey are misleading millions of people who have wishful thinking that the president is going to somehow win this thing,\u201d Riemer wrote in one of the emails obtained by the Post, specifically referring to Trump attorneys Jenna Ellis and Rudy Giuliani.",

            "article_content": "Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin, fresh off his victory in Virginia, got a hero\u2019s welcome at a gathering of the country\u2019s Republican governors on Wednesday. The attendees at the Republican Governors Association meeting could not stop gushing about the newest member of their club, who defeated a longtime Democratic politician in a state President Joe Biden had carried by double digits last year. \u201cDoes that sound good, governor-elect?\u201d said Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, when introducing Youngkin on a panel. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of my neighbor to the south,\u201d Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said. \u201cYou ran a great campaign. Congratulations.\u201d Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina could barely contain himself as he praised Youngkin for his win. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy about that, we can\u2019t stand it,\u201d he said. Glenn Youngkin wrote the GOP playbook to navigate the Trump factor. Can it be replicated in 2022? By putting Youngkin front and center at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, where he got several hearty rounds of applause, the governors association is hoping to capture his winning spirit as the organization heads into the 2022 midterm election cycle. Republicans are defending 20 governorships next year and hope to make inroads in several states where Democrats currently hold the top job. During Wednesday\u2019s panel, Republican governors criticized the Biden administration\u2019s record on border security, the economy and the handling of the pandemic. They presented the GOP\u2019s governance in the states as a positive alternative to Democratic leadership in Washington. Their poster child was Youngkin, who made the case that his own election earlier this month can be a model for Republicans in the future \u2013 focusing on \u201ckitchen-table issues\u201d like education and public safety. Democrat Terry McAuliffe had repeatedly tried to tie his GOP opponent to former President Donald Trump, but the strategy didn\u2019t work against a candidate who mostly preferred to talk about local issues, like parents\u2019 frustrations about schooling. \u201cThe issues that I ran on were really straightforward,\u201d Youngkin said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cI think one of the big lessons that I have learned and that I think so many candidates are watching translate into strategies going forward is that these are our customers. We need to listen to them.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s theory about his 2-point victory is that he campaigned \u201cfocused on Virginia\u201d and not national politics. \u201cWhat we found along the way was that America became very focused on Virginia\u2019s issues, as opposed to Virginia being swept up in national issues,\u201d Youngkin said. Despite endorsing Youngkin, Trump did not campaign in Virginia for him. That allowed Youngkin to keep Trump voters in the GOP tent while broadening his coalition to win over those who did not support the former President. Asked whether that formula could be replicated in other states, Youngkin demurred on Wednesday. \u201cI think that everyone\u2019s going to have to decide their strategy for their state,\u201d he said. Keeping Trump at arm\u2019s length may not be a viable or desirable option for some Republican candidates running in purple states with motivated pro-Trump bases. Youngkin won the GOP nomination at a convention, so he didn\u2019t necessarily face the Trump loyalty contests that are animating some GOP primaries in states featuring competitive Senate elections next year. In Georgia, for instance, Gov. Brian Kemp may face a potential primary challenge from former Sen. David Perdue. For Trump, who has harshly criticized Kemp for not challenging the results of the 2020 election, Perdue could be the champion the former President has been searching for. But Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s ire, made it clear he wants Republicans to learn from Youngkin\u2019s example. \u201cI think we saw the road map in the commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d Ducey said.",

            "article_content": "If House Republicans win in the midterm elections, it\u2019s already clear their new majority will be a constant churn of self-radicalization and an extremist political weapon for Donald Trump. The Republican conference is purging heretics who reject the ex-President\u2019s personality cult and fueling his continuing assaults on democracy designed to restore him to power amid ever-growing signs that the narrow Democratic House majority is in trouble. So far this week, the House GOP has shown it\u2019s ready to turn a blind eye to Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar\u2019s tweet of a photoshopped anime video depicting him appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and swinging swords at President Joe Biden. The bulk of the House GOP is expected to stand by Gosar on Wednesday as he faces a rare censure vote by the full chamber and is stripped of two committee assignments. Explaining her decision to hold the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \u201cWe cannot have members joking about murdering each other.\u201d But if they are not bothered enough by Gosar\u2019s glorification of violence to punish him, some of his Republican colleagues do want to strip committee posts from 13 GOP members who backed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that will repair roads and bridges and widen access to broadband. Their sin lies in handing a victory to Biden, in a recently signed law that even some Republicans \u2013 including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 argue is a win for the American people. Trump extended his revenge tour to two House GOP primaries this week, choosing the West Virginia congressman who voted against infrastructure in an incumbent-on-incumbent primary, and backing an opponent to a Michigan congressman who voted for his impeachment earlier this year. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, meanwhile, was again disowned by her state party for telling the truth about Trump\u2019s authoritarian attempt to destroy the peaceful transfer of power, which has  been a hallmark of American democracy for nearly 250 years. Cheney had already lost her House leadership post for defending cherished American values to a Trump acolyte, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, and she\u2019s now one of just two Republicans serving on the House select committee investigating January 6. Cheney spoke out on Tuesday about colleagues who tolerate the violent rhetoric that increasingly characterizes their party but condemn lawmakers who vote for programs that they think benefit their districts \u2013 even though she personally did not support the infrastructure bill: \u201cThe notion that Leader (Kevin) McCarthy won\u2019t full on condemn what Paul Gosar did on multiple occasions, but that he seems to be entertaining this move to push the 13 off of their committees, I mean, it\u2019s indefensible \u2013 morally and ethically \u2013 and it\u2019s crazy politically.\u201d McCarthy said Gosar didn\u2019t mean to promote violence. But contrary to Cheney\u2019s claim, he also argued it was not the right time to go after Republicans who supported the infrastructure bill. Still, the idea that a staunch conservative like Cheney is being ostracized by her own party shows how far the GOP has moved from its ideological roots toward undiluted Trumpism. The new turn against Cheney came after Trump\u2019s allies vowed to use precedents forged by the House select committee to destroy the Biden presidency in a wave of investigations if they capture the majority next November. It\u2019s the role of Congress to serve as a check and balance on the power of the executive. But after most Republicans refused to probe one of the worst attacks on American democracy in generations, they are already plotting similar investigative offensives over far lesser transgressions. This fresh evidence of the GOP\u2019s increasingly extreme path is just the product of a few days. But it follows months in which the party has covered up Trump\u2019s attempt to steal power and supported his lies about a stolen election as part of its countrywide move toward authoritarian conservatism. At the state level, Republicans have tried to make it harder to vote in elections but easier to fix the results. And this week\u2019s ruckus inside the House GOP also coincided with anti-democratic fervor growing outside it, as Trump\u2019s populist political Machiavel Steve Bannon vowed to bring down the Biden \u201cregime\u201d after he was indicted for criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to testify on the attempted Trump coup. There will be another reminder of the horror of January 6 on Wednesday with the scheduled sentencing of Jacob Chansley, the self-described \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d who paraded through the US Capitol during the insurrection shirtless and wearing a horned headdress. And in another another example of American democracy in peril, it\u2019s possible Republicans could gain the seats they need to win the majority next year simply through partisan gerrymandering \u2013 a practice both parties engage in but with which Republicans have had more recent success. Years of gerrymandering by both parties have produced a House in which there are few competitive seats and in which members are driven to extremes to avoid primary challenges by more radical foes. While the Democratic Party\u2019s radicalization tends to push it toward a more progressive democracy, the same process in the GOP has turned the party of Ronald Reagan and Abraham Lincoln against democracy itself. That fact threatens to deny the country the healthy two-party system that has long been a hallmark of its superpower strength. A sense of inevitability over a new extreme, GOP House majority is also being fueled by the Democratic Party\u2019s muddled efforts to sell Biden\u2019s achievements \u2013 including the infrastructure law \u2013 as Americans feel the pain of immediately rising prices, which may overshadow any enthusiasm for long-term investments in roads and bridges. And a drip, drip of Democratic lawmakers announcing their retirements is exacerbating a sense that their party may soon be in the minority. While Republicans are in many cases abetting an illegitimate attempt to steal power, Democrats are proving that effectively wielding power won fairly, but with tiny majorities, can be almost impossible. If McCarthy fulfills his dream of becoming speaker, his riotous conference might make the struggles of ex-GOP Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan to control their radical wings look tame by comparison. Neither man had to deal with someone like freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who said McCarthy was \u201ca failure\u201d on Wednesday despite his constant appeasement of Trump. Angry that the California Republican hasn\u2019t stripped Republicans who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill of their committee assignments, Greene warned that McCarthy isn\u2019t a shoo-in for the speakership by saying Trump\u2019s opinion is going to \u201cmatter big\u201d in who gets the gavel if the GOP wins. The sharp rebuke was a sign that McCarthy must constantly appease the vast Trump wing of his party to secure his own political ambitions \u2013 a factor that saw him quickly visit Mar-a-Lago this year in a bid to walk back his previous criticism of Trump over the insurrection. Greene, who has spread misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines, revealed on Tuesday that she has not been vaccinated. She\u2019s frequently lambasted social distancing and masking measures and has earned thousands of dollars in fines for violating the House\u2019s pandemic-era rules, reflecting the kind of disregard for public health measures Trump exhibited. The turmoil wracking the GOP House minority this week is yet another reflection of the iron fist that Trump wields over his party \u2013 and especially in the House, which traditionally showcases the radicalism of a party\u2019s grassroots. The reason why Republicans are standing by Gosar is that he is one of Trump\u2019s most vehement defenders and accomplices in attacking democracy. The reason why 13 supporters of the popular infrastructure bill are in trouble is that their votes helped hand Biden a win on an issue on which Trump manifestly failed, creating an embarrassing comparison with his presidency. And the reason that Cheney, one of the most consistently conservative members of the conference, was declared persona non grata by the Wyoming GOP is that she had the courage to stand against Trump\u2019s authoritarianism. Scenes of a Trump-led Republican revolution, which is already threatening party members who reject the GOP\u2019s ever more extreme dogmas, are all the more extraordinary since that kind of extremism could up alienating some general election voters in more competitive districts. It\u2019s only been a few weeks since Republicans were parsing the victory of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin in Virginia as a sign that keeping Trump-style extremism at arm\u2019s length could help the GOP win back critical suburban voters. This week\u2019s outbursts have also drowned out an effective midterm election message that McCarthy was pushing for months about Biden\u2019s presidency failing \u2013 on the economy, on the pandemic, on the border and abroad. The evidence of a party that has embraced self-radicalization is dismaying former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who, many years ago, was considered something of a conservative firebrand himself as a young GOP congressman. \u201cIt\u2019s completely crazy,\u201d Kasich said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d bemoaning his party\u2019s failure to rein in Gosar. \u201cThe Republicans are lucky the people aren\u2019t following this thing carefully. If they did, their ability to take over the House, in my opinion, would be in question.

            "article_content": "A California man who is wanted by the FBI for allegedly assaulting police officers during the US Capitol insurrection says he is considering seeking asylum in Belarus because he is the target of \u201cpolitical persecution,\u201d according to Belarus state television. Evan Neumann was charged earlier this year with six crimes related to his alleged participation in the January 6 Capitol riot, including assault on law enforcement officers, according to a criminal complaint. He told the station Belarus 1 in a recent interview that after the FBI began searching for him, he \u201cstarted hiding, traveling across America from one place to another.\u201d Neumann then fled to Europe, according to Belarus 1, where he moved around several countries until he arrived in Ukraine in mid-March. Authorities in Ukraine began following Neumann, he claimed, prompting him to attempt to enter Belarus by foot in August, where he was detained by the country\u2019s border guards, according to the station. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare ask for asylum until the (Security Service of Ukraine) started following me in Ukraine, two weeks later. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d he said in his interview, claiming that he\u2019s the subject of \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d \u201cAnd this is a level that I can\u2019t do anything about,\u201d Neumann said. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who has come under fire in recent years for human rights abuses, recently made reference to the deadly Capitol insurrection during an  interview earlier this year in response to a question on repression and the imprisonment of political opponents. He accused the US of \u201clawlessness,\u201d during his answer, citing the insurrection and invoking false claims about the US presidential election result. The criminal complaint says that, among other things, Neumann allegedly punched two officers at the Capitol on January 6 as he and other rioters wrestled with officers over a barricade. The document says that after the officers lost control of the barricade, Neumann and others used it as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d to strike officers. Neumann said in his interview that he doesn\u2019t believe he committed any crimes and that the assault charge \u201cis wholly without merit.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether Neumann is currently being represented by an attorney.

The new sanctions will come in \u201cclose coordination with the EU and other partners and Allies.\u201d They did not specify when they would come into place. Thousands of migrants are stranded at the Belarus-Poland border, caught in the intensifying geopolitical dispute. The US, EU and NATO have all accused the Lukashenko regime of manufacturing the migrant crisis on the EU\u2019s eastern frontier to destabilize the bloc as retribution for sanctions over human rights abuses. Earlier, European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen told reporters she and President Joe Biden had discussed the possibility of new sanctions on Belarus in an Oval Office meeting. Western leaders are accusing the autocratic regime there of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the European Union\u2019s eastern border. \u201cWe will widen our sanctions against Belarus, very rapidly at the beginning of next week there will be a widening of sanctions against Belarus,\u201d von der Leyen said in front of the White House. She said her understanding is that US sanctions would go into place at the start of December. In August, the White House announced a a sweeping executive order targeting those in the Belarusian regime involved in the repression of human rights and democracy in the former Soviet state. The executive order was released on the one-year anniversary of Belarus\u2019 election, which was declared fraudulent by the United States and much of the international community and sparked widespread protests throughout the country. Other topics that arose during Biden\u2019s meeting with von der Leyen include Ukraine and the ongoing talks between the EU and the UK over trade arrangements in Northern Ireland. Biden has taken a keen interest in the matter. \u201cPresident Biden and I, we share the assessment that it is important for peace and stability on the island of Ireland to keep the withdrawal agreement and to stick with the protocol. This protocol has managed to square the difficult circle that Brexit caused,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "A new national television ad from House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm deceptively uses images of events that occurred during former President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office to attack President Joe Biden\u2019s tenure. The 30-second ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, titled \u201cChaos,\u201d begins with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicting \u201cbold progress for the people when we have President Joe Biden in the White House.\u201d It then contrasts Pelosi\u2019s words with a rapid-fire series of photos and videos depicting scenes of violence and tumult in the US and abroad. Parts of that speedy montage, though, are highly misleading. Facts First: At least three of the images in the Republican ad were actually taken in 2020, during the Trump administration, not during the Biden administration in 2021. Axios reported that the National Republican Congressional Committee would spend less than $100,000 on the ad and that it would run for only one day on right-wing Fox News, Newsmax and One America News Network. (The committee has also posted it on social media.) Still, Axios noted that the ad \u201csets the tone for the cycle\u201d \u2013 Monday is one year out from the 2022 midterm Election Day \u2013 and the deception here is pretty egregious. Nowhere does the ad offer any indication that the images from 2020 are not from Biden\u2019s presidency. The clip of the Molotov cocktail At the 11-second mark, the ad shows a Molotov cocktail being thrown toward police officers. This footage is from rioting in Portland, Oregon, in September 2020, after a Kentucky grand jury decided to indict one of three officers involved in the killing of Breonna Taylor. Videos of the Molotov cocktail incident were filmed by journalists Sergio Olmos and Pierce Singgih and posted online at the time. The clip of the smoke and fireworks Immediately after the clip of the Molotov cocktail incident, the ad shows red smoke rising from a street lined with cars as fireworks go off above. That clip is also from a night of Portland street clashes and also from 2020; an identical or near-identical video from what appears to be the same scene was filmed and posted on Twitter in July 2020 by journalist Justin Yau. (His caption: \u201cActivists threw smoke grenades and fireworks to cover their advance.\u201d) The clip of the Black Lives Matter sign At the 17-second mark, the ad shows flames rising around an elevated sign that reads \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER.\u201d As Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel pointed out on Monday, this image is from Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, during the unrest that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake. (The sign belonged to a Unitarian Universalist church.) Republicans would be free to point out in an ad that each of these three clips are from cities governed by Democratic mayors (though it would be fair for Democrats to respond that Trump was president). But this particular ad does something different \u2013 it tries to pin the scenes of urban chaos on the Biden administration. And that\u2019s simply dishonest. Asked for comment on the Republicans\u2019 use of Trump-era images in the ad, White House spokesman Mike Gwin used the opportunity to take a jab at the former President. \u201cWe want to thank House Republicans for highlighting the mess President Biden inherited from his predecessor,\u201d Gwin said in an email. He went on to tout Biden accomplishments on job creation, major infrastructure legislation and Covid-19 vaccinations. A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Mike Berg, would not tell CNN on Monday which images from the ad were from 2020 and which were from 2021. After Weigel of the Post noted that the image of the \u201cBLACK LIVES MATTER\u201d sign was from 2020, CNN independently confirmed the 2020 context for the images of the Molotov cocktail toss and the smoke-and-fireworks scene. Berg was unapologetic about the ad\u2019s use of images from 2020. In Twitter messages to CNN, he defended the ad by claiming that Democrats \u201cactively supported and encouraged the riots in 2020\u201d and that Biden in particular \u201cactively encouraged the protests.\u201d But Biden never supported rioting. As CNN repeatedly wrote in 2020, when Trump made similar claims during the presidential campaign, Biden endorsed peaceful protests while condemning property destruction, looting and violence. Regardless, Berg\u2019s claim is beside the point. Whatever Biden said before he took office, the ad strongly and inaccurately suggests that it is depicting things that have occurred during his time in the White House. The ad both begins and ends with a clip of Pelosi talking about a Biden presidency; the concluding clip is Pelosi predicting that Biden \u201cwill be an extraordinary president.\u201d In addition, the ad features complaints about Biden-era inflation and various images that were indeed taken during the Biden presidency, such as shots of migrants in the border region and a shot of a dead body the Taliban publicly displayed from a crane after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. It\u2019s clearly deceptive to throw sensational images from the Trump days into this mix.",

            "article_content": "A week before their party endured deep losses in Virginia, some of the most vulnerable House Democrats privately debated how to respond to pointed GOP attacks on an issue that has been percolating in districts across the country: critical race theory. With Republicans again embracing the culture wars, a year after successfully attacking Democrats over the defund the police movement in House races nationwide, leaders of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last week presented research and debated how to handle the once-obscure topic that is primarily taught at the university level but has become a focus on the right, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. And a split emerged between two of the party\u2019s frontline Democrats: Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux of Georgia, who is White, and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, who is Black. Underwood wanted to forcefully counter the GOP\u2019s misinformation head-on, while Bourdeaux was leery about elevating the issue, according to sources familiar with the matter. Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, another Black woman, sided with Underwood during the meeting. \u201cWe have a rising American electorate that are Black and brown people,\u201d Underwood told CNN when asked about the episode. \u201cWe should be able to speak to their issues, their experiences as Americans in this country, without feeling like it\u2019s a liability for other audiences.\u201d Bourdeaux acknowledged it was \u201cone of many conversations among members from competitive districts about how to engage with our diverse and broad constituencies.\u201d Their back-and-forth offers a preview of the internal debate to come for Democrats as they come to grips with their losses in Virginia, where educational issues became a lightning rod and Republicans are already signaling they plan to make the \u201cconcerns of parents,\u201d a centerpiece of their midterm strategy. 5 reasons why Democrats should start panicking about 2022 Democratic leaders say the lesson from their poor performance in Virginia, where they were swept in all three statewide races in a state President Joe Biden won by 10 points in 2020, is to pass their sweeping agenda immediately. But there is also a growing recognition that they need to address issues that resonate on the right as well \u2013 especially in swing districts. Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat, said that the party needs to \u201cstart listening more,\u201d including on issues like the supply chain, inflation and the border crisis. \u201cIf you don\u2019t manage the message, the message will surely manage you,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re being subjected to that.\u201d The term \u201ccritical race theory\u201d refers to the academic concept that racism has been systematically ingrained in American society following centuries of slavery. But conservatives have more recently attempted to recast the phrase, claiming it teaches children to think that the United States is racist. The recent exchange over critical race theory evoked the Democratic party\u2019s struggles in 2020, when they failed in some races to effectively counter Republican attacks that divide the left, including the \u201cdefund the police\u201d slogan. In election autopsies, Democrats determined their lack of a coherent and convincing message on the topic was a key reason why they lost seats. Now, after picking up seats last year, Republicans only need to win a net of five seats to take back the House. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the New York Democrat who chairs the DCCC, said the exchange between Underwood and Bourdeaux was \u201ccompletely unremarkable and respectful.\u201d \u201cIt was two members talking about and effectively responding to Republican efforts to use race to divide Americans,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOne of the lessons from 2020 (is) we\u2019re going to respond to Republican lies.\u201d Democrats need a reckoning after misjudging the nation's mood Still, the episode shows the party has varying viewpoints about its messaging strategy on the issue. Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, who represents a frontline district, called the GOP\u2019s tactics \u201cdeplorable\u201d and said the only way to counter them is with the \u201ctruth.\u201d \u201cWe need more truth. We need more transparency. We need more honest conversations about what\u2019s really the underlying issue,\u201d Horsford told CNN. \u201cAbout everything from our history, to our circumstances, to systemic issues that create inequities.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in ignoring tactics that pit one group of people against another.\u201d Phillips agreed, saying: \u201cI\u2019m saddened by the fact that we aren\u2019t able to generate a narrative that is more truthful about what\u2019s going on, because critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools. And it\u2019s time that we start articulating that a little better.\u201d But some Democrats think it\u2019s not always productive to respond to every Republican talking point, and believe that messaging should be tailored to each person\u2019s district. \u201cWhat I try to do is not to get all caught up in what the GOP is saying about me or about my party, but about things that I have identified as being real salient issues in my district,\u201d said Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, another front-liner. Republicans including Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin have tried to force Democrats to either defend critical race theory, a non-issue in political races until former President Donald Trump declared it a villain last year, or face a backlash from some on the left. Democrats look for lessons in Virginia and New Jersey as a blame game inside the party rages Aside from critical race theory, Republicans have also campaigned on parents\u2019 frustration over school closures and vaccine and mask mandates. Now, the party is packaging it all under the umbrella of educational issues as part of its blueprint to win back the House next year. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced at a news conference on Wednesday that the GOP plans to soon unveil a \u201cParental Bill of Rights.\u201d \u201cThe one thing you will find is, the Republican Party will be the party of education,\u201d McCarthy said, before predicting Democrats could lose over 60 seats in the midterms. And some Democrats recognize that they need to focus on education to keep their seats in 2022. \u201cI got to acknowledge that Glenn Youngkin tapped into, in terms of concerns about education at the local level, he touched a nerve,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat. \u201cThose of us on the Democratic side need to sit back and think about how we address that.\u201d Asked how they should address that, Warner said that will be \u201cpart of the future debate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Winsome Sears, a conservative Republican, will be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor, breaking barriers as the first female and the first woman of color in the office in the commonwealth\u2019s 400-year legislative history. CNN projected Sears\u2019 win over Democrat Del. Hala Ayala, also a woman of color, on Wednesday. Sears will serve alongside Republican Glenn Youngkin, whom CNN projected would win the Virginia gubernatorial race. Ayala congratulated Sears on making history and \u201cpaving the way for future women leaders who look like us.\u201d \u201cWe may not be able to claim victory today, but we know that the results of this election are simply a minor setback in our larger fight for progress,\u201d Ayala said in a statement Wednesday thanking her supporters. She also wished Sears \u201cluck and success\u201d when the two spoke on Wednesday, Lauren Chou, communications director for Ayala\u2019s campaign, told CNN. Sears, who was born in Jamaica, is the first Black Republican woman to be elected to the Virginia General Assembly, representing the 90th district from 2002 for one term. In 2004, she launched an unsuccessful bid for Congress against Democrat Rep. Bobby Scott. She is also a Marine veteran, former vice president of the Virginia Board of Education and owner of an appliance business. She is a wife and mother of three daughters. In 2012, her 27-year-old daughter DeJon L\u2019Air Williams and two grandchildren died in a car accident. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic night \u2013 yes, it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t run to make history. I just wanted to leave it better than I found it,\u201d Sears said before a crowd of supporters early Wednesday morning. At a time of historic change, Virginia will elect a woman of color for the first time as lieutenant governor She was national chair of Black Americans Making America First, a coalition that promotes initiatives by former President Donald Trump and has defended him after controversies and racist comments. Asked about her support for Trump, Sears told CNN, \u201cI am an independent thinker\u201d and promised to ensure \u201cmore diverse representation is appointed on boards and commissions.\u201d She also said she would increase funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In general, Sears has downplayed the influence of race on her political outlook and touted the progress of equality for Black Americans, but has also acknowledged that there is more work to be done. \u201cThere is no Census Bureau category called \u2018of color.\u2019 I am Black. Virginians are ready for strong, principled and sensible leaders who will serve them \u2013 no matter one\u2019s color,\u201d Sears previously told CNN when asked the importance of being the first woman of color as lieutenant governor. She reiterated that progress Wednesday morning, touting the elections of former President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris, who also broke barriers and made history. \u201cIn case you have not noticed, I am Black and I have been Black all my life. But that is not what this is about. What we are going to do is we are going to now be about the business of the commonwealth. We have things to tend to,\u201d she said, which includes fully funding historically Black colleges and universities and mentioning Youngkin\u2019s plans for the state. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have safer neighborhoods, safer communities and our children are going to get a good education.\u201d Her ascension to the second-highest office in the state culminates the end of a nationalized and close gubernatorial race where she and Ayala were split on several issues, including vaccine and mask mandates. It also comes amid the aftermath of a racial reckoning over police brutality and Confederate imagery, a shadow of its dark past stained with slavery. The election of a woman as lieutenant governor in the state takes place nearly two years after the state\u2019s legislature elected its first female speaker of the House. Along with the closely watched gubernatorial race, which was widely seen as a bellwether as President Joe Biden won Virginia by 10 percentage points last year, the commonwealth is also garnering national attention as a civil trial is underway regarding organizers of the deadly \u201cUnite the Rally\u201d in Charlottesville four year ago, fueled by the city\u2019s decision to remove a Confederate statue. Sears would not say whether she supports the removal of Confederate monuments when asked by CNN, though she has previously criticized Republicans who embraced the Confederate flag. Instead, Sears emphasized the progress made by Black people in her lifetime when asked about race relations in the commonwealth. \u201cWe have a saying in church, \u2018I may not be what I\u2019m supposed to be, but I ain\u2019t what I used to be.\u2019 And that\u2019s America,\u201d Sears said. \u201cWe are not back in 1963, when my father arrived at the height of the Civil Rights Movement and things were very bad for us as Black people.\u201d \u201cAre there changes that need to be made? Most assuredly,\u201d Sears added. \u201cThere is no country in this world that does not suffer from racism. \u2026 But you have seen people who are dying to cross the border into America because they know that if they can get their foot on American soil, the trajectory of their lives will change \u2013 as it did for my father.\u201d While Ayala was open about being fully vaccinated and backed mask mandates in certain settings, Sears has refused to say whether or not she is vaccinated, opposes vaccine mandates and called for an end to the state\u2019s mask mandate earlier this year. She has encouraged people to get vaccinated but said \u201cno one should be forced to disclose their vaccination status.\u201d During the campaign\u2019s last weeks, there was fiery debate over how race should be taught in Virginia\u2019s public schools, particularly over the teaching of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d a concept that examines the extent to which longstanding systems in America have led to unequal outcomes for people of color. Although the state\u2019s Department of Education denies that CRT is taught in public schools, the debate emerged as a key issue and is the latest flashpoint in Republican-promoted culture wars. Sears has called the concept \u201cracist\u201d but also said the good and bad of American history should be taught. \u201cIf Critical Race Theory means that telling a child that once you emerge from the womb you are a racist and a colonizer and whatever else, that\u2019s not going to be good. That\u2019s going to create morale problems for everybody,\u201d Sears told the Virginia Mercury in August. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to teach about African American history, why just keep it to one month? Let\u2019s teach it throughout. Let\u2019s talk about these things. You can\u2019t escape history. Let\u2019s talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d As the debate over teaching America\u2019s dark past continues across the country, the legacy of last year\u2019s protests over racial justice has also renewed national debates about policing, crime and gun violence, particularly in Virginia, which is still reeling from the 2019 Virginia Beach shooting that left 12 dead. Sears has vowed to protect gun rights, opposes red flag laws, has voiced support for law enforcement and spoke of the need for \u201cour police, Sheriff, corrections officers to keep our families and our neighborhoods safe.\u201d She told CNN she would work with law enforcement and families who have experienced gun violence to \u201cdevelop workable solutions\u201d to balance her support for gun rights and stem gun violence.",

The rare \u2013 but not unheard of \u2013 meetings between the head of the CIA and senior Russian security officials comes amid persistent tensions between the Washington and Moscow. Russian group that hacked SolarWinds is still attacking America's computer networks The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on Russia related to election interference, the poisoning of dissident critic Alexi Navalny, and cyberattacks on US interests. Officials have been warily watching recent Russian troop movements on the border of Ukraine. Russia also remains under sanctions for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Still, the US does see opportunities for cooperation with Russia, in particular on arms control, and the intelligence community under past administrations has sought points of mutual interest with Moscow. \u201cWe periodically meet with our Russian intelligence counterparts for the same reason our predecessors did \u2014 to keep Americans safe,\u201d former President Trump\u2019s first CIA director, Mike Pompeo, wrote in a letter defending a meeting with top Russian intelligence officials in Washington in 2018. That meeting garnered attention primarily because it took place on American soil with officials who were under US sanction. Burns, a veteran diplomat, has deep experience in Russia. He served as the US ambassador there from 2005 to 2008. The Biden administration has maintained ongoing \u201copen, direct and candid dialogue\u201d with Russia on the issue of cyberattacks, Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, said at a Washington think tank event last week. Biden has put pressure on Putin to crack down on a spate of damaging ransomware attacks on US organizations \u2013 including critical infrastructure \u2013 emanating out of Russia and announced the beginning of US-Russia cybersecurity talks at the end of a summit meeting with Putin in Switzerland in June. The US government has \u201cshared information with Russia regarding criminal ransomware activity being conducted from its territory,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters last month, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules that the White House set for the call. It\u2019s not clear that the talks have yielded any substantive results, however. Nobelium, the Russian hacking group responsible for the SolarWinds hack, has compromised as many as 14 technology firms since May as part of another apparent espionage campaign, Microsoft said last week.",

            "article_content": "At least a dozen of the House GOP\u2019s most prized recruits for the midterms have sown doubts about the 2020 elections, embracing former president Donald Trump\u2019s deceitful battle cry as they seek to flip the chamber next year. The National Republican Congressional Committee announced this month the 32 candidates who qualified for House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s \u201cYoung Guns\u201d recruitment program, which includes promising candidates in competitive races who have met key fundraising benchmarks. At least 12 of them have sought to undermine the legitimacy of the past elections by either signing on to lawsuits challenging them, falsely claiming they were somehow compromised, calling for further investigations or outright saying they were stolen. That includes: Eli Crane and Walt Blackman in Arizona; Cory Mills and Anna Paulina Luna in Florida; Karoline Leavitt, Gail Huff Brown and Tim Baxter in New Hampshire; Jake Evans in Georgia; Tyler Kistner in Minnesota; Monica De La Cruz Hernandez in Texas; Derrick Van Orden in Wisconsin; and Jesse Jensen in Washington. Asked for comment about some of their Young Gun candidates subverting the integrity of the 2020 elections, NRCC communications director Michael McAdams responded by attacking Democrats. \u201cDemocrats are desperate to talk about anything but the fact their reckless policies have led to skyrocketing prices, a crisis on our southern border and a nationwide crime wave,\u201d said McAdams. Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Trump\u2019s campaign lost its challenges in court, and Trump\u2019s own attorney general, Bill Barr, said that the Justice Department did not find any evidence of widespread fraud. But these Republicans are hoping to better positions themselves in a primary by catering to core Trump supporters who believe the former president\u2019s lie that the election was stolen from him. The dynamic is particularly pronounced in New Hampshire\u2019s first district, which spans the southeast of the state. Republican candidates there have remained steadfast supporters of Trump, who remains the party\u2019s most popular leader. When asked who she believed won the 2020 election, Leavitt, a former Trump press aide, said, \u201cDonald J. Trump.\u201d Baxter, a state representative, told CNN, \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump is right, it\u2019s time for an audit in every state.\u201d Asked who won, Baxter responded, \u201cThe candidate who got the most legal votes!\u201d And Gail Huff Brown, a former TV reporter whose husband, former Sen. Scott Brown, served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand, told a local ABC affiliate in September that \u201cthere were a lot of irregularities\u201d in 2020 and \u201cCovid won.\u201d Republicans run the risk of turning off independent voters in a general election against Democrats who are eager to seize on the candidates\u2019 attempts to appeal to their party base through baselessly questioning past elections. \u201cWe are going to make sure they are held accountable for telling these lies about the outcome of the election,\u201d Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, chairman of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, told CNN. \u201cVoters in swing districts know who won the presidential election and they\u2019re not going to put up with this nonsense. But they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with it. They\u2019re trying to have it both ways.\u201d Many Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, would like to move on. They want the 2022 elections to be about the future rather than the past. They believe that a campaign against rising inflation, the price tag of the Democratic bills and the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban could provide the path back to power. Matt Mowers, a former Trump State Department official who lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas by five points in 2020, is running again in New Hampshire\u2019s first district against Leavitt, Baxter, Brown and others. While he has called for \u201cregular audits of elections,\u201d Mowers has also publicly acknowledged Biden got the most votes, drawing the scorn of his opponent Leavitt, and is focused on trying to tie Pappas to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Even McCarthy, a Trump loyalist who has eyes on the speaker\u2019s gavel, has gently pushed back on Trump\u2019s suggestion that Republican voters sit out in 2022 and 2024 if the GOP doesn\u2019t investigate his false claims of voter fraud. \u201cPeople should participate in their elections,\u201d McCarthy said at a recent press conference. \u201cI think everybody should go vote and change the direction\u201d of the country. But Trump continues to lament his loss in public, forcing those who seek higher office to decide whether they are with or against him. The former President has repeatedly lambasted his loss as the \u201ccrime of the century,\u201d and attacked the few Republicans who have pushed back against his so-called \u201cbig lie.\u201d He has even supported several of the GOP challengers running against the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Most Republicans have fallen in line. The House and Senate GOP campaign arms have continued to use Trump\u2019s image in its fundraising messages. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has launched Facebook ads urging supporters to donate with the tagline, \u201cHELP REPUBLICANS PROTECT ELECTION INTEGRITY!\u201d And the NRCC has aired Facebook ads asking potential donors to add their names to the \u201cOfficial Trump Halloween Card,\u201d and offered supporters Trump Christmas wrapping paper and a potential dinner with Trump. The former president has agreed to headline a November fundraiser for the NRCC. The embrace of Trump\u2019s election lies extends beyond the far right. It\u2019s also been a common theme among the party\u2019s so-called Young Guns, who are supposed to \u201cembody the principles of the House Republican Conference and show promise of running a successful campaign,\u201d according to the recruiting program\u2019s website. In Georgia, Evans\u2019 campaign website notes that as an election lawyer he \u201cfought for the counting of only legal votes during President Trump\u2019s re-election in Pennsylvania all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d which rejected hearing the dispute over the state\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots. In Minnesota, Kistner filed a lawsuit in late November 2020 to temporarily halt the certification of his loss against Democratic Rep. Angie Craig and order a recount, which was rejected by the state Supreme Court. A spokesman for Kistner, a Marine Corps veteran, declined to answer questions about whether Kistner believed Biden legitimately won the election. In Florida, Luna falsely said last year that the 2020 election was \u201ccompromised\u201d because a glitch from Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 machines flipped votes to Biden. Meanwhile Mills, an Army combat veteran, is pushing for additional reviews of the 2020 election, telling CNN that \u201celected officials and bureaucrats broke various election laws and changed the rules at the 11th hour.\u201d \u201c3rd party independent audits in key states around the country should occur so everyone could know what happened and have confidence in our democratic process and know whether election integrity has been compromised once and for all,\u201d Mills told CNN in an email. \u201cIndependent audits would help us know the facts and would therefore help us restore confidence in our elections.\u201d In Wisconsin, Van Orden has also alleged without evidence that there was a \u201ctremendous amount of voter fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. The retired Navy SEAL even attended the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, although he has since distanced himself from the deadly event at the US Capitol and said he never entered the building. In Texas, a county elections administrator disputed Hernandez\u2019 claims of voter fraud after she lost to Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020. In Washington, Jensen has acknowledged that Biden is president, but told a local NBC affiliate, \u201cI think that absolutely there was fraud in this election and that should be investigated.\u201d And in Arizona, Crane, a former Navy SEAL, has called on the state legislature to \u201cdecertify\u201d the 2020 election, and for the state attorney general to \u201claunch a criminal investigation to hold all involved accountable.\u201d His GOP opponent, state Rep. Walt Blackman, has said that Trump won and the election was \u201cstolen\u201d by Democrats. Democrats have seized on the GOP candidates\u2019 false statements regarding 2020 as a potential lifeline in their effort to hold onto their slim majorities in Congress. Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who represents the Orlando suburban district Mills seeks, said that Democrats need to pass Biden\u2019s economic agenda and make sure the public is fully aware of Republicans\u2019 attempts to subvert America\u2019s democracy. \u201cWe should emphasize that Democrats are focused on delivering for the American people, especially in this difficult time where we\u2019re still trying to get through the pandemic,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWe also need to remind the American people that the Republicans supported an attack on our democracy and continue to perpetrate a lie that undermines the very cornerstone of our country \u2013 and that is free and fair elections.\u201d",

            "article_content": "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that he would welcome three western Maryland counties whose Republican legislators have asked to join the state. \u201cAbsolutely, without any question, the invitation is wide open,\u201d Justice, a Republican, said Friday, adding, \u201cWe want everyone to always know that we\u2019re absolutely standing here with open arms, we welcome these counties and would be tickled to death to have them.\u201d A handful of Republican lawmakers from Maryland\u2019s Allegany, Garrett, and Washington counties sent two letters this month to West Virginia\u2019s top Republican legislators asking them to consider adding their counties to West Virginia. Such a proposal, however, would be difficult because state legislatures have to approve any moves, followed by the US Congress taking action. \u201cWe believe this arrangement may be mutually beneficial for both states and for our local constituencies. Please advise on next steps,\u201d the Maryland lawmakers, which includes House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, wrote. The other Maryland lawmakers are Sen. George Edwards, Dels. William Wivell, Wendell Beitzel and Mike McKay. CNN has reached out to the lawmakers for comment. Justice on Friday announced his intent to put the issue to a vote in a special legislative session, while also acknowledging the difficulty in such a process and calling it an \u201cunprecedented opportunity.\u201d CNN has contacted the Maryland governor\u2019s office for comment but did not immediately hear back. Last year, West Virginia Republicans encouraged conservative residents in Virginia counties to leave for West Virginia. West Virginia GOP Del. Gary Howell, the Speaker Pro Tempore, said Friday that Beitzel, who represents Garrett and Allegany Counties, reached out to him several months ago to see if a similar offer stood for them. The Maryland legislators came to Charleston to meet with Howell, West Virginia Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw about the process of joining their state, according to Howell. Both Blair and Hanshaw on Friday welcomed the prospect of the counties joining their state, with Blair calling it \u201ca fit that would work very well for the people in both West Virginia and Maryland.\u201d Justice\u2019s invitation for three of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties to join West Virginia underscores a tension seen in many states: In places like Maryland, largely Democratic urban areas are home to most of the population, and therefore ensure the party\u2019s control of statehouses \u2013 to the chagrin of voters in its rural, Republican-leaning western portion. In other states, such as Texas, heavily Democratic cities have little influence in statehouses where larger suburban and rural areas deliver control to Republicans. The urban and rural divide has grown more prevalent in recent years \u2013 a reality on display in West Virginia, where Justice, who was first elected governor as a Democrat, switched parties in 2017 and then ran for re-election as a Republican. International borders with Mexico and Canada have seen minor changes over time as a result of rivers slowly shifting paths, such as in 2009, when six islands along the Rio Grande were ceded from Texas to Mexico. Maritime borders and claims to territory outside the continental United States have also changed. However, after states have been formed, substantial changes to their borders are exceedingly rare. Typically, states are fighting over tiny strips of land. In 2013, North and South Carolina clarified a boundary that resulted in 19 homes moving into a different state. In 1961, about 20 acres was transferred from Minnesota to South Dakota. In 1950, Kansas and Missouri swapped small areas due to the Missouri River\u2019s changing path. Bigger changes, though, are infrequent. The best example remains West Virginia\u2019s break from Virginia during the Civil War. West Virginia split off and remained a part of the union, while the rest of the state seceded and joined the Confederacy. Still, with one of the major dividing lines in American politics being urban voters who typically back Democrats and rural voters who largely support Republicans, calls to shift state boundaries pop up from time to time. Earlier this year, five counties in rural eastern Oregon voted to attempt to break off from the state and join Idaho. In March, in response to Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that sought to establish a process for counties to leave the state. Republican Kristi Noem, the governor of neighboring South Dakota, tweeted in response to the bill: \u201cIn South Dakota, we roll out the red carpet for people who love personal responsibility and Freedom.\u201d That bill never got a hearing or a vote. A host of proposals from local and state officials elsewhere have similarly failed to get off the ground in recent decades. State lawmakers in Illinois in recent years have proposed breaking Chicago or Cook County into its own state, separate from the rest of Illinois. Local officials in Florida have at various times discussed breaking the state into two: North Florida and South Florida. Residents of rural Nevada have petitioned to break away from a state where the politics are largely controlled by the more liberal Clark County, the home of Las Vegas and most of the state\u2019s population. California has regularly seen proposals to break off bits into smaller states \u2013 and a group advocating moving rural eastern Oregon into Idaho also called for part of California to be moved into the state. This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "John Scott, the newly appointed top election official in Texas, briefly represented President Donald Trump in his legal challenge of the 2020 election results in Pennsylvania. Gov. Greg Abbott announced Thursday his appointment of Scott, a Fort Worth attorney, to be the next Texas secretary of state. The position has been vacant since Ruth Hughes resigned from the office in May. \u201cJohn Scott is a proven leader with a passion for public service, and his decades of experience in election law and litigation make him the ideal choice for the Texas Secretary of State,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cJohn understands the importance of protecting the integrity of our elections and building the Texas brand on an international stage. I am confident that John\u2019s experience and expertise will enhance his oversight and leadership over the biggest and most thorough election audit in the country.\u201d Scott will serve as the interim secretary of state until he is confirmed by the legislature, which is not scheduled to meet again until 2023. The announcement did not mention Scott\u2019s previous work representing the former President. CNN has reached out to Scott for comment. On November 13, 2020, Scott was announced as an attorney to represent Trump in his attempt to stop the Pennsylvania election certification. Three days later, on November 16, he filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Bryan Hughes, a Texas state senator who wrote the restrictive election overhaul bill signed into law this summer, was also an attorney on that case. He works for Scott\u2019s law firm and also withdrew from representing Trump. State Democrats have already criticized the appointment. \u201cThe governor\u2019s choice for Secretary of State is unfortunately consistent with his anti-democracy agenda. Abbott is appointing one of the architects of Republicans\u2019 big lie that Donald Trump actually won the 2020 election to oversee all electoral activity in our state,\u201d Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner said in a statement. \u201cThe governor had every opportunity to appoint a new Secretary of State during one of his many special sessions to allow the Texas Senate to hold a confirmation hearing. Instead, he waited until the Legislature adjourned, denying Texans the fair and transparent process they deserve. Scott previously served as a deputy attorney general when Abbott was the Texas attorney general. In 2014, he defended the state\u2019s voter ID law against lawsuits from civil and voting rights organizations. He also worked as the Texas Health and Human Services Commission\u2019s chief operating officer. According to Abbott\u2019s announcement, Scott also serves as senior adviser and liaison to the governor for Texas border and Mexican Aafairs and serves as chief international protocol officer for Texas.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans worry that Donald Trump\u2019s persistent false claims of voter fraud could depress GOP voter turnout and turn off moderates and independents, potentially setting the party up for another Georgia-style disaster in the midterms. As the defeated former President jumps back into the political fray, Trump is continuing to amplify his lies about the election \u2013 and even recently suggested that Republican voters sit out in 2022 and 2024 if the GOP doesn\u2019t do more to back up his false claims about the last election. The painful pair of losses in races for Georgia\u2019s US Senate seats earlier this year still haunt the GOP \u2013 especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who saw the majority ripped away from him. After Trump inaccurately told voters in Georgia that the election was rigged, some election observers believe the former President discouraged Republicans from going out and voting. Now some in the GOP fear a repeat, according to multiple Republican lawmakers and aides. \u201cDonald Trump gave away the Senate once. It looks like he\u2019s determined to do it again,\u201d said one House GOP lawmaker. At the very least, McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, would rather keep their midterm message focused on President Joe Biden, the economy and the border, even though Trump\u2019s false voter fraud claims animate the base and many GOP candidates have made \u201celection integrity\u201d a cornerstone of their campaigns. Still, even of some of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress want to put 2020 in the rearview mirror. \u201cThat\u2019s history,\u201d Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican, said of the 2020 election. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a President Trump guy. But we\u2019ve got to focus on 2022.\u201d But with Trump showing no signs of relenting in his demands to re-litigate his 2020 election loss \u2013 and most Republicans still refusing to reject his lies and threats to democracy \u2013 it\u2019s shaping up to be a major headache and source of frustration for GOP leaders who want to win back their majorities by keeping Trump front-and-center in the party. \u201cI think it does hurt our chances if it becomes the dominant topic,\u201d said another GOP lawmaker. \u201cIf the election is about Afghanistan, inflation, the border and crime, we will retake back the House. If it\u2019s about \u2018rigged elections\u2019 we will lose independents and suburban voters we need to win.\u201d Added a third Republican: \u201cIt\u2019s not a helpful message.\u201d GOP leaders, however, dismissed the idea that Trump\u2019s one-track focus on the 2020 election will hurt their midterm strategy and expressed confidence that the former President will boost voter turnout, saying he remains a popular figure in the party. Republicans also have a strong chance of winning back the House. They only need to flip five seats, and they have both history and redistricting on their side. The House GOP\u2019s campaign arm has also been bringing in some record-breaking fundraising hauls, in another sign of strength and enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019m confident that Republican voters across this country are fired up to vote in the midterms,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe former president, he\u2019s a private citizen and he of course is entitled to his own opinion.\u201d Donald Trump is doing everything he can to hurt Republican chances in 2022 GOP leaders, particularly in the House, are hugging Trump tightly and making clear they view him as an asset in their quest to win back power. The former President is headlining upcoming fundraising events for both the House and Senate GOP campaign arms, even as he continues to publicly attack McConnell. \u201cHe remains the biggest draw in our party and we\u2019re happy he\u2019s helping our efforts to fire Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Emmer added. And Republicans say that behind the scenes, Trump is actively engaged in helping map out a strategy to win back the House. But publicly, it has been a different story. Trump, who appeared along a slate of establishment Republicans at an Iowa rally last weekend, recently said \u201cthe real insurrection\u201d happened on Election Day in November 2020; recorded a video in support of Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was shot and killed after storming the Capitol; and said this week that the Republican Party needs to make the \u201cPresidential Election Fraud of 2020\u201d its top priority. And some of Trump\u2019s behavior and rhetoric suggests he cares more about his own image than the success of the GOP. He said during a recent radio interview that he would rather have Democrats win seats than some of the Republicans who voted to impeach him. And he said late last month that Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams would have been better than Gov. Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican who refused to overturn the election results. House GOP's impeachment backers vow to stay in the midterm fight against Trump and his allies \u201cThe Republican Party has made it very clear that blind loyalty to Donald Trump\u2019s ego is the only principle they hold fast to,\u201d said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm, in a statement. \u201cYesterday was just another reminder that Trump\u2019s toxic rhetoric looks very different when he isn\u2019t on the ballot.\u201d But even as Republicans fret the idea of Trump using his megaphone to focus on the 2020 election, very few Republicans have been willing to call out his lies. They either shrug their shoulders and in some cases embrace his false claims. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, when pressed repeatedly by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace, refused to say on Sunday whether he agreed with Trump that the election was stolen. In response, Rep. Liz  Cheney of Wyoming \u2013 one of the only Republicans willing to stand up to Trump \u2013 tweeted: \u201cMillions of Americans have been sold a fraud that the election was stolen. Republicans have a duty to tell the American people that this is not true. Perpetuating the Big Lie is an attack on the core of our constitutional republic.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s the way Washington has long worked: 1. You get elected. 2. You spend years \u2013 maybe decades \u2013 accruing seniority on your chosen committee. 3. You rise to the chairmanship of that committee, and stay there for as long as possible. Which brings me to the retirement announcement this week of Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, the sitting chairman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cTruth be told, I never expected to be in Congress this long. I always said I couldn\u2019t imagine being here longer than 10 years,\u201d Yarmuth said in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cAfter every election, I was asked how long I intended to serve, and I never had an answer. Today, I do. This term will be my last.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Yarmuth cited his age \u2013 he would be 75 at the end of this term \u2014 and a desire to spend more time with his grandson as reasons for his decision to walk away from Congress after eight terms. And, of course, those reasons are credible and we should believe Yarmuth when he cites them as at least some of why he is retiring. At the the same time, however, there is another message being sent in the Yarmuth retirement too: He doesn\u2019t seem to think Democrats are likely to hold onto their House majority come 2023. Why? Because Yarmuth could serve as Budget chairman for as long as he likes \u2013 or at least as long as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California) allows him to stay in the job. (Democrats, unlike Republicans, do not have term limits on their chairmanships.) If Yarmuth felt good about Democrats\u2019 chances of holding onto their majority in 13 months, it\u2019s hard to imagine he would walk away from such a plum position \u2013 one that he spent nearly two decades in Congress working toward. That he is walking away suggests that he sees the writing on the political wall: Democrats, currently clinging to a three-seat majority, are underdogs to keep their House majority in the 2022 midterms. Both the past and present back up Yarmuth\u2019s possible doubts about Democratic chances. Historically, the first midterm election of a president\u2019s term is hugely destructive for his side in the House. In 2018, Republicans lost 40 seats in Donald Trump\u2019s first midterm. In 2010, Democrats lost 63 House seats in Barack Obama\u2019s first midterm. In both instances, the president\u2019s party lost the majority in the House. Those losses are usually compounded when a president\u2019s approval rating is under 50% \u2013 as President Joe Biden\u2019s is right now. As Gallup noted in 2018: \u201cPresidents with job approval ratings below 50% have seen their party lose 37 House seats, on average, in midterm elections. That compares with an average loss of 14 seats when presidents had approval ratings above 50%.\u201d Couple those historic trends with the reality that Biden is facing a series of crises \u2013 from the stalled stimulus bills in Congress to the ongoing situation at the border to rising gas prices \u2013 and you get a toxic political stew for Democrats on the ballot in 2021 and 2022. When you consider the incredible narrow majority that Democrats currently possess, you see the real \u201cwhy\u201d behind Yarmuth\u2019s no-go decision. Now Pelosi and her leadership team have to avoid that trickle of retirements from turning into a flood.",

            "article_content": "Terry McAuliffe on Sunday downplayed a recent remark in which he observed that President Joe Biden\u2019s sagging popularity is hurting his bid to become Virginia\u2019s next governor and reiterated on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Democrats in Washington need to pass a stalled bipartisan infrastructure bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not dragging me down,\u201d McAuliffe told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, referring to the lack of action by Democrats in Washington. \u201cI worry about the people of Virginia.\u201d Youngkin walks fine line on 'election integrity' \u201cHere\u2019s my message to everybody in Washington: Pass this infrastructure bill. We are desperate in the states,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cWe need these roads and bridges fixed. \u2026 Get in a room, here\u2019s what we need and here\u2019s what it\u2019s going to cost. This should not be so difficult.\u201d That\u2019s a step back from his comments on a virtual call to supporters last week. \u201cWe are facing a lot of headwinds from Washington, as you know. The President is unpopular today unfortunately here in Virginia, so we got to plow through,\u201d the former governor said then. McAuliffe on Sunday again called on lawmakers in Washington to pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve got frustration with Washington. You know, why haven\u2019t we passed this infrastructure bill? It passed the US Senate with 69 votes two months ago. I have been very straight on television. We\u2019re tired of the chitty-chat up in Washington. Get into a room and get this figured out,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re paid to get up in Washington, get this done, and the frustration is why isn\u2019t it done by now? 69 votes in the Senate two months ago. Get it done this week. Do your job.\u201d 'Do your job': McAuliffe watches closely as messy Capitol Hill negotiations threaten Virginia race The race to be Virginia\u2019s governor has tightened in recent weeks, with polling indicating that McAuliffe holds a narrow lead over Republican Glenn Youngkin in a state where Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020. In Washington, bitter intraparty fighting among Democrats has slowed the passage of the infrastructure bill in the House, as progressives demand the Senate also pass a multi-trillion-dollar bill to expand the nation\u2019s social safety net. Meanwhile, amid the stalled legislation, fallout over the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, scenes of migrant surges at the US-Mexico border and lackluster jobs reports, Biden\u2019s popularity has diminished. Asked by Bash if the lack of agreement in Washington was making things hard for his campaign, McAuliffe would not say but expressed confidence that he would win the election. \u201cYou know, hard or not, I mean people understand what I\u2019m doing, my plans, my 20 big plans to take Virginia to the next level, so they\u2019re going to vote for me, but there is frustration all over the country. We just want action,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Eva McKend contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With a debt ceiling crisis punted until December, Democrats are turning their sights back to their own agenda, a move that will shake the party\u2019s resolve and test whether it can make hard choices and compromise a reality. Already, Democrats have struggled to contain bitter infighting between their moderate and progressive wings, divisions that stopped the House from passing a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill to rebuild the country\u2019s roads and bridges in recent weeks, a battle that still threatens to derail President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda overall. Another poor jobs report Friday rattled the White House, putting even more pressure on Democrats to deliver a win for the President. Democrats are grumbling within their ranks about how much to slim down their $3.5 trillion social safety net bill, and members have conflicting views about which programs are most important to the future of the country and the party. A debate also is emerging about how much to focus the legislation. The conflict has only grown as Democrats wait on pins and needles to see how much their moderate colleagues, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virgina, will be willing to spend on Biden\u2019s signature legislation. The two members have come under fire by some who say they are obstructing progress. \u201cWhen you got 48 people on one side and you have overwhelmingly strong numbers from the American people on one side, and you got the President of the United States on one side, it is simply not fair, not right, that one or two people say, \u2018My way or the highway,\u2019 \u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, on Friday. But there is a slow and growing reality that in order to pass Biden\u2019s larger social safety net bill through the Senate, Democrats will have to shrink their price tag, begging the questions of which programs they will choose to cut. The original $3.5 trillion package contained a wish list of Democratic promises including a paid family leave program, child care assistance, an expanded child tax credit and a reimagination of the US tax code that shifts the burden of taxes to the wealthy and businesses. Democrats also want to expand Medicare to provide dental and hearing coverage in the existing program and shore up Obamacare by boosting Medicaid coverage for states that didn\u2019t expand the program and increasing subsidies for Americans Not everything can be preserved. Members and aides point out that the hard-fought discussions about what stays and what goes are just getting underway and the process could be messy and tumultuous. This week, Democrats in the Senate were given handouts laying out how much various programs cost, an effort to focus the discussion about where the party should go with a more limited bill. Democrats say they are now facing a choice. They could choose to keep many of the programs but limit the investment they make in them or have them expire sooner. Some progressives are betting that strategy could create a world where public pressure down the road would keep the programs renewed even after funding lapsed. \u201cAs far as I am concerned all of these programs are things the American public and families have been waiting for \u2026 and so I would like to see all of them get funded to some extent so we can get going,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. \u201cAt some point they all become the fabric of our country.\u201d How Democrats could shrink their $3.5 trillion spending plan Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, told CNN that after a caucus meeting this week, progressives unified around the idea that if the cost of the package has to come down \u2013 which all signs suggest it will \u2013 then the goal is to keep all programs in the package but shorten the amount of time each one is funded. \u201cThat was really important to our members,\u201d Jayapal told CNN. \u201cI communicated that to the White House directly.\u201d One option progressives aren\u2019t open to is means-testing or narrowing who qualifies for programs, a strategy Manchin has advocated. Jayapal\u2019s team put together a memorandum, obtained by CNN, that was sent to the White House and all members of the progressive caucus on Thursday that outlined why such provisions should not be in the final version of the bill. \u201cThey disproportionately exclude the most vulnerable,\u201d the five-page memorandum reads, listing one of the many reasons the caucus is against means-testing and work requirements. \u201cThey delay the delivery of benefits and increase the burden on the very applicants they are designed to serve.\u201d Other members want to go in a different direction. Many moderates are hoping that Democrats will choose to narrow their agenda and invest in fewer programs to help focus the message. Should they go with a smaller number of programs or \u201cmore things for less time or with fewer people?\u201d said Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate we are going through.\u201d Smith argued that Democrats may be better served by investing more in less, citing an example of child care that will matter to families only if they feel like the benefit is robust enough to make a difference in their daily lives. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it in a big enough way, it\u2019s not going to make more than a ripple of difference,\u201d Smith said. Multiple members told CNN that they expect the tough conversations are just in their infancy as the party struggles to contain and rein in legislation that became a kind of legislative Christmas tree of Democratic priorities. Jayapal says progressives are still waiting to know where things stand. Biden tells House progressives spending package needs to be between $1.9 trillion and $2.2 trillion \u201cI know that those negotiations are happening, but I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re at a place where there\u2019s any agreement or any kind of final thing that we can hang our hats on and start to discuss whether or not that\u2019s sufficient for us,\u201d Jayapal told CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s an ongoing process.\u201d But Jayapal added that the strategy her caucus upheld of linking the infrastructure bill to the social safety net package is what she believes kick-started negotiations between the White House and the two Democratic senators who remain holdouts into high gear. \u201cUntil we said we weren\u2019t going to vote for the infrastructure bill without the reconciliation bill, there was no conversation from those two senators about what they didn\u2019t like or what they did like,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cThat only happened because we linked the two bills together.\u201d For the leaders in the party \u2013 many of whom are in their 70s and 80s \u2013 the measure marks a pinnacle in their careers, an opportunity to pass legislation they\u2019ve spent decades working toward. For Sanders, an expansion of Medicare is a top priority. For House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, shoring up Obamacare is crucial. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, has worked to expand the child tax credit, while others have spent decades fighting for paid family leave. But for members who are facing reelection in tough districts, their message to leaders has been to focus on just a handful of things that the party could execute well. Bitterness festers as Democrats try again to pass Biden's economic agenda \u201cWe need to get to a top number, and then what I would prefer is fewer programs for a longer period of time,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana. \u201cBut all of that is negotiable.\u201d Asked if there was a risk in trying to do too much and explain to people what is inside, Tester said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cThere are like 17 different things in this bill that are game-changers, and there is a risk of that,\u201d he continued. Jayapal thinks it is too early to be making immediate concessions just to get something done. \u201cThe something vs. nothing discussion, to me, it\u2019s way too early to have that discussion. That\u2019s something that happens at the end of a negotiation, when you really fought for something,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cAnd the truth is, there was five months of negotiation on the infrastructure bill. And there\u2019s been really no negotiation on the Build Back Better Act.\u201d While nearly every vote matters in Democrats\u2019 razor-thin majorities, Biden has taken extra care to tend to his party\u2019s most vulnerable members, promising in private meetings to deliver wins for their reelection campaigns and even offering to visit their districts to help sell his social safety net package. Biden kicked off a virtual meeting with so-called \u201cfront-line\u201d House Democrats this week by acknowledging that these members will face some of the most competitive reelection races in the country next year, and he stressed that it\u2019s imperative to ensure their needs and concerns are heard throughout the negotiating process. \u201cThe President made it perfectly clear that part of his agenda is to make sure that we get some wins out of this bill, and that they will be things that we can run on,\u201d said Rep. Susan Wild, a Pennsylvania Democrat who participated in the meeting. The virtual meeting came just hours before Biden traveled to a Michigan district represented by Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a key swing district carried by Donald Trump in 2020. Biden also offered to visit other front-line distincts, a proposition that several members agreed would be helpful, according to lawmakers who participated in the meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s still in an effort to try to bring the House together and push us to vote for this historic bill,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who represents a competitive district along the Texas border. \u201cThe urgencies for every member are different. \u2026 We\u2019re living in a big tent in the Democratic Party right now.\u201d Democrats have a numbers problem \u201cHe also realizes that getting this done is important for competitive races, and getting it done in a timely fashion that by next election, the American people will see shovels in the ground,\u201d Gonzalez added of Biden. The President has also been able to keep progressives feeling validated and a part of the process. Jayapal pointed to Biden\u2019s visit to the House last week as important to reinforcing the position that progressives have held all along. While party leaders need progressives to get on board as much as the moderates, there is also a recognition that front-line Democrats have the most to lose if their party fails to deliver on Biden\u2019s economic agenda. Whether these members keep their seats \u2013 and with it, control of the House majority \u2013 may hinge on whether and what type of legislation Democrats are able to pass. With that dynamic in mind, Biden \u2013 who has been in \u201clistening mode\u201d and was seen scribbling on a notepad during his virtual meeting with moderates, according to attendees \u2013 asked front-line members to list their top preferences for the economic bill. The priorities they named included drug pricing, child care and community college. Biden, along with Pelosi, has made clear to members that the cost of the social safety net package needs to be scaled down. On Monday, Pelosi wrote in a letter that Biden \u201cindicated that we would be working with a lower topline number, and decisions must therefore be made regarding the size and scope of the reconciliation bill.\u201d Biden has reportedly been steering the original $3.5 trillion to land somewhere in the $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion range. Manchin has said he\u2019d like to see the package cost $1.5 trillion. Although Jayapal confirmed to CNN that she had told Biden on Monday that she thought his range of $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion \u201cwas too small,\u201d she said she is not moving forward in negotiations with a specific number in mind but wants to keep it \u201cas close to\u201d the $3.5 trillion version of the package that has been marked up in the House as possible. Chuck Schumer picked the wrong moment to go on a partisan rant \u201cI don\u2019t have a number. I told the President I thought 1.9 (trillion) to 2.2 (trillion) was too small in order to get all of our priorities in,\u201d she said. Progressive freshman Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York told CNN that the conversation about the top line for the package is premature. \u201cWe start with needing Manchin and Sinema to tell us what things they want to cut from the $3.5 trillion,\u201d Jones said. In his meeting with front-liners, Biden asked those who have a top-line number to state it, but no one did. \u201cHe made it clear we\u2019re never going to get to $3.5 trillion, and it\u2019s probably somewhere in the middle,\u201d Gonzalez said.",

            "article_content": "Russian state-backed hackers are having greater success at breaching targets in the United States and elsewhere as they make government organizations the primary focus of their attacks, according to data that Microsoft released Thursday. Government organizations accounted for more than half of the targets for Moscow-linked hacking groups for the year through June 2021, compared to just 3% the previous year, according to Microsoft. At the same time, the success rate of Russian intrusions into government and non-government targets has gone from 21% to 32% year over year, the technology giant said in a report focusing on state-backed and cybercriminal activity. The report comes as the Biden administration has looked to bolster US government defenses against cyber espionage from Russia \u2013 and publicly expose that activity with US allies. The European Union last month blasted alleged Russian hacking and leaking operations that the bloc said were aimed at interfering in democracy. But despite the US and its allies condemning Russian and Chinese behavior in cyberspace, those countries are \u201cstill comfortable leaning into nation-state attacks,\u201d said Cristin Goodwin, associate general counsel and head of Microsoft\u2019s Digital Security Unit. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing that increase.\u201d Russian hackers behind SolarWinds hack are trying to infiltrate US and European government networks The data includes the Russian espionage operation that breached at least nine US federal agencies in 2020 by exploiting software made by SolarWinds, a Texas-based firm. CNN reported Wednesday that the same Russian group behind that activity has in recent months continued to try to breach US and European government organizations. The Biden administration in April blamed Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the SVR, for that spying campaign. Moscow has denied involvement in the hacking. Microsoft also reported Thursday that 58% of government-linked hacking attempts originated in Russia, followed by 23% from North Korea, 11% from Iran and 8% from China. The data comes with caveats. A flurry of unsuccessful attempts to guess target organizations\u2019 passwords, for example, count as separate hacking attempts. And Microsoft did not report on US intelligence agencies, which also conduct cyber-espionage campaigns. But with over one billion devices using Microsoft software worldwide, the technology provider has a broader view of malicious cyber activity than most other organizations. And the data tells its own story. Cyber activity, for example, often correlates with larger geopolitical dynamics and tensions. First on CNN: Biden administration to convene 30 countries to crack down on ransomware threat While Russia beefed up its troop presences along its border with Ukraine earlier this year, the same hacking group that carried out the SolarWinds breaches has \u201cheavily target[ed] Ukrainian government interests,\u201d according to Microsoft. The number of Microsoft customers in Ukraine \u201cimpacted\u201d by the Russian hacking group soared to 1,200 in the fiscal year ending in June compared to just six the year prior. \u201cHistorically, nation-state attacks tend to follow where a geopolitical priority sits for a country,\u201d Goodwin told CNN. Google on Thursday announced that APT28, a Russian hacking group that interfered in the 2016 election, had sent some 14,000 malicious emails to Gmail users around the world in late September. The phishing was aimed at government personnel, journalists and defense firms, among others, according to Google. US organizations were among those targeted. Shane Huntley, director of the Google Threat Analysis Group, said that all of the emails had been classified as spam and blocked by Gmail. Much of public attention on alleged Russian cyber operations in the last year has been on the group that bugged SolarWinds software. But there\u2019s an array of hacking teams at Moscow\u2019s disposal that carry out different missions against valuable targets in the US and allied countries, analysts say. Some of those groups specialize in infiltrating critical infrastructure firms, both to collect information and, perhaps in some cases, to have a foothold into networks in the event of a conflict, according to some US officials and private sector experts. \u201cThe concern is that effort that we\u2019ve seen [Russian groups] actively use disruptive effects around the globe,\u201d Rob Joyce, head of the National Security Agency\u2019s Cybersecurity Directorate, said at the Aspen Cyber Summit last week. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen evidence of prepositioning against US critical infrastructure. So, all things that can\u2019t be tolerated and we need to work against.\u201d One such group, known as Berserk Bear in the cybersecurity industry, has been linked to breaches of industrial software at US electric utilities that the Department of Homeland Security blamed on Russian government hackers in 2018. The group, which some analysts have linked to Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency, has in the last three years shown a steady appetite for collecting data held by critical infrastructure firms in the US, Ukraine and Western Europe. That includes breaches, in 2019 and 2020 respectively, of the websites of one Ukraine\u2019s largest energy firms and San Francisco\u2019s International Airport, according to Joe Slowik, a former cybersecurity specialist in the US Navy who now works at security firm Gigamon. Over a decade of operations breaching critical infrastructure firms, Berserk Bear \u201chas almost certainly facilitated significant intelligence gathering, capability development and potentially effects pre-positioning in highly sensitive networks,\u201d Slowik said in a paper that will be presented at the Virus Bulletin conference this week.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Kari Lake, a media-bashing former local news anchor who has parroted his lies about election fraud, in Arizona\u2019s 2022 governor\u2019s race. Trump chose Lake over a packed Republican field that also includes state Treasurer Kimberly Yee, former Congressman Matt Salmon and Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson. The leading Democratic candidate is Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a fierce defender of the state\u2019s elections systems who has seen her profile rise amid the sham audit. She said in part in a Tuesday night statement that \u201cArizonans are sick and tired of our government being run by conspiracy theorists \u2013 like Kari Lake \u2013 who wasted our taxpayer dollars and breached voters\u2019 trust in their effort to discredit the 2020 election.\u201d In a statement announcing his endorsement of Lake, Trump said her years as a broadcast journalist mean that \u201cfew can take on the Fake News Media like Kari.\u201d \u201cShe is strong on Crime, will protect our Border, Second Amendment, Military, and Vets, and will fight to restore Election Integrity (both past and future!),\u201d he said. \u201cShe is against Covid lockdowns, Cancel Culture, and will end \u2018woke\u2019 curriculum in our schools. She will do a far better job than RINO Governor Doug Ducey\u2013won\u2019t even be a contest!\u201d The shot at Ducey was a continuation of Trump\u2019s long-running feud with the term-limited Republican governor, who has refused to back Trump\u2019s efforts to undo the state\u2019s 2020 election results. President Joe Biden narrowly defeated Trump in Arizona last year. But since then, Trump and his Republican allies have sought to reverse that defeat. Republicans in the state Senate commissioned a months-long review of Maricopa County\u2019s 2.1 million ballots. That partisan review yielded a final vote tally that was virtually identical to the county\u2019s November results, even though Cyber Ninjas, the inexperienced firm that conducted it, misapplied standard election procedures and cast unfounded doubt on tens of thousands of votes. Lake is a former television anchor for Fox 10 Phoenix who entered politics this year, launching her campaign with a media-bashing video and an appetite for Trump\u2019s culture wars. She has railed against mask mandates, called for aggressive border enforcement and promised to \u201cfinish the damn wall.\u201d She has also repeated Trump\u2019s baseless lies about election fraud, calling for Arizona\u2019s results in the 2020 general election to be decertified \u2013 something that\u2019s not legally possible.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Buckhead wants to cut out of the Black Mecca. According to a September analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, about 54% of the residents surveyed \u201cstrongly or somewhat support\u201d seceding from Georgia\u2019s capital, ostensibly spurred by fears of recent spikes in crime across the city. Racial demographics complicate the data. Well-to-do Buckhead is a majority-White neighborhood; Atlanta, majority Black. Some observers worry that cityhood for Buckhead could be devastating, removing access to revenue from a critical tax base and even deepening racial tensions. The combustible, decades-long debate over Buckhead shines a light on a broader racial reality in the US. \u201cToday, you really have two kinds of racial residential segregation,\u201d Stephen Menendian, the assistant director and director of research at UC Berkeley\u2019s Othering and Belonging Institute and the lead author of a June report on racial residential segregation in the 21st century, told CNN. \u201cWithin large cities, you have racially identifiable neighborhoods and schools. You also have suburbs that are White and affluent, and then suburbs that are heavily non-White and much poorer.\u201d As Sheryll Cashin, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, explains it, the consequences of residential caste are vast. \u201cThe successful have seceded from the struggling. Highly educated and affluent people tend to live in their own neighborhoods and support policies like exclusionary zoning and neighborhood school assignments that lock others out and concentrate advantage,\u201d she writes in her essential new book, \u201cWhite Space, Black Hood: Opportunity Hoarding and Segregation in the Age of Inequality.\u201d Here\u2019s an overview of how the US got to this point \u2013 and how it might move forward: Cashin presents three anti-Black processes that sustain residential caste. One is boundary maintenance, or practices and policies that keep Black people at a remove. Recall the secession fight over Buckhead, a patrician neighborhood that\u2019s long played an important role in Atlanta\u2019s history of race and space, as the Princeton University professor Kevin M. Kruse maps out in his 2007 book, \u201cWhite Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism.\u201d Or think about the uneven impact that highway construction can have on marginalized groups. Of the people who would be displaced by a project to expand the West I-526 Lowcountry Corridor in South Carolina, 94% live in largely Black and brown communities. Another process is opportunity hoarding, or overinvesting in some communities while disinvesting elsewhere. Cashin calls the former \u201cgold standard\u201d neighborhoods \u2013 neighborhoods of tremendous opportunity that are frequently subsidized by everyone else and that get the best of everything, from grocery stores to infrastructure to schools. In fact, schools are one of the best indicators of racial segregation. \u201cIf you really want to get a handle on this, go online, look at the schools in your community and look at the racial demographics of those schools. They\u2019re often stark in any major metropolis unless there\u2019s an integration plan,\u201d Menendian said. The third process is stereotype-driven surveillance. It\u2019s easier to harden boundaries and isolate opportunity when the image of the \u201chood\u201d is as devoid of dimension as it is. Former President Donald Trump was the most vulgar broadcaster of what Cashin refers to as \u201cghetto myths,\u201d but others also have nourished these narratives. Let\u2019s revisit the Trump example. Remember when he crossed swords with Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings \u2013 who represented Maryland\u2019s majority-Black 7th Congressional District, which includes parts of Baltimore, where Cummings was born \u2013 over conditions at the US-Mexico border? \u201cCumming (sic) District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2019. It was the precise sort of comment \u2013 repellent, clueless, made on Twitter \u2013 that was characteristic of the former President. In his rant, Trump didn\u2019t only snap back at one of his innumerable critics. He conjured the mythos of the inner city, the Black ghetto. Disgusting. Dangerous. Filthy. Other politicians have tossed around similar rhetoric. Here\u2019s Rudy Giuliani, who, in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, made fact-free accusations of voter fraud against cities with significant Black populations: \u201cHappens all the time in Philly. \u2026 And it\u2019s allowed to happen because it\u2019s a Democrat (sic), corrupt city, and has been for years. Many, many years. And they carried it out in places where they could get away from it.\u201d And here\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d booster Richard Nixon in 1967, in the thick of a years-long, nationwide wave of Black rebellion: \u201cToday in the urban slums, the limits of responsible action are all but invisible.\u201d Even politicians on the other side of the aisle have sustained ghetto myths. After the killing of Freddie Gray, former President Barack Obama condemned the \u201cthugs who tore up\u201d Baltimore. \u201cHe was talking about vandals, but he was still participating in a very specific anti-Black idea,\u201d Cashin told CNN. \u201cPart of why it\u2019s so challenging to pursue humane policies that can uplift people in high-poverty areas is because we apply a lens of presumed thug \u2013 instead of presumed citizen.\u201d It looks quite a bit different. Menendian said that about five or six decades ago, you could find the same pattern of segregation in almost every major US city: In big urban areas, Black families were circumscribed to a small number of neighborhoods that were often downwind of factories, near industrial areas, or close to various environmental contaminants. White families, on the other hand, lived in the same cities but in dramatically different neighborhoods. Notably, this trend fits with Cashin\u2019s notion of boundary maintenance. \u201cThe main response (by localities and the federal government) to some six million Great Migrants escaping Jim Crow and going north and west was essentially to contain them in their own neighborhoods,\u201d she said. By the 1990s, residential patterns began to change. For one, between 1990 and 2000, large groups of people of color \u2013 fueled by greater income levels and less housing discrimination, among other things \u2013 started to move into the suburbs. But as the suburbs diversified, they also began to further fragment into inner-ring suburbs and wealthier outer-ring suburbs (or exurbs), which typically have newer infrastructure and better schools. It\u2019s still segregation \u2013 just in a different guise. As the UC Berkeley report lays out in granular detail, \u201cnot only are most of our major metropolitan regions and cities highly segregated, but we find that nearly 81% American cities and metropolitan regions are more segregated today than they were in 1990, after several decades of federal policy applied to this problem.\u201d As you might imagine, concretizing aspirations for large-scale change won\u2019t be easy or straightforward. But there\u2019s hope to be had. \u201cIntegrate and invest. We need to resurface the reality that racial segregation is really the core cause of racial inequality,\u201d Menendian said in June. \u201cYou can\u2019t zero out racial inequality in a highly segregated society.\u201d Cashin underscored that she\u2019s inspired by the fact that the US has ascending, multiracial coalitions of people who say that Black Lives Matter. \u201cThere are growing coalitions that can get to 51% in a mayoral race, in a city council race, in a debate about: Are we going to do our part to affirm and further fair housing? Are we going to pass a mandatory inclusionary zoning ordinance? Are we going to support racial equity, a neighborhood analysis that pays attention to how we spend money?\u201d she said. Baltimore has made headway in this regard. By ballot initiative, the city recently changed its charter and created a permanent fund to nurture racial equity in education, housing and the budget. The move allowed Baltimore to start repairing, and atoning for its treatment of, historically under-funded Black neighborhoods. \u201cI sense an authenticity,\u201d Cashin added. \u201cPeople seem to want something much better than a society that\u2019s premised on separate and unequal, a society that\u2019s premised on fear and the exclusion of the other.\u201d",

            "article_content": "If Rep. Liz Cheney is purged from the Republican Party, it likely will be at the hand of Harriet Hageman. Hageman, the former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman, launched her campaign last week, emphasizing her deep roots in the state, her conservative values and her alliance with former President Donald Trump, who targeted Cheney after the congresswoman publicly refuted his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and held him responsible for the deadly violence at the Capitol on January 6. In an interview, Hageman called Trump the \u201cleader of the party\u201d and questioned the integrity of the past election. She repeatedly declined to acknowledge that Joe Biden won, and said, \u201cI think that there are legitimate questions about what happened during the 2020 election.\u201d When pressed on what questions she had, Hageman pointed to audits conducted by Republicans in Arizona and Georgia. She said the public \u201cwill know more once those reports are released.\u201d Hageman said, \u201cThe legitimate questions are: \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. But the 2022 Wyoming House race could still turn on how Republicans answer Hageman\u2019s question, as the party decides whether to believe a conspiracy. Trump's House GOP enemies get boost from McCarthy's leadership team Cheney has called Trump\u2019s continued effort to claim victory a \u201cbig lie\u201d that is a \u201cgrave threat to democracy\u201d in the hope that Republicans turn the page from him. She was recently named vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. But she is playing on Trump turf: In 2020, nearly 70% of Wyoming voters supported him, more than in any other state in the country, while Cheney received nearly 69%. Even some of Cheney\u2019s supporters wonder whether she will win the race, as other Republican candidates drop out to unite behind Hageman. \u201cI think it will be close,\u201d said Wyoming state senator Charles Scott, a longtime Republican legislator. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sure thing either way.\u201d Cheney was first elected to the House in 2016, after a lifetime of promoting hawkish foreign policy values, and quickly rose to the No. 3 House GOP position. She is the daughter of the state\u2019s favorite son, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served in her statewide seat from 1979 to 1989. But Liz Cheney broke from the GOP base when she voted to impeach Trump in January for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d After a pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol in attempt to stop Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory, she said Trump \u201csummoned,\u201d \u201cassembled\u201d and \u201clit the flame of this attack,\u201d and that \u201cthere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\u201d The backlash in her party was swift. The Wyoming Republican Party censured her, saying that \u201cthere has not been a time during our tenure when we have seen this type of an outcry from our fellow Republicans.\u201d In May, her fellow House Republicans voted her out of her leadership role, lamenting that she continued to reject Trump\u2019s false election claims in public rather than focus all her attention on Biden. Several Wyoming Republicans launched campaigns to run against her, and some potential candidates, including Hageman, met with Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey as he considered whom to back. Cheney\u2019s vote will now be a clear contrast in the race. Hageman told CNN she would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 riot, and that those who \u201ctrespassed or destroyed property should be held responsible for their own actions,\u201d rather than the former president, who she believed was not granted proper \u201cdue process.\u201d \u201cThe FBI has already investigated and concluded that there\u2019s no evidence of a conspiracy or grand plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in collective guilt.\u201d After turning off some Republicans in Wyoming, Cheney has highlighted her record \u2014 she voted with Trump over 93% of the time, according to website FiveThirtyEight \u2014 and her opposition to Biden on everything from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan to energy issues, gun rights, border security and government spending. A spokesman for Cheney declined requests for comment. Last week, Cheney told local reporters, \u201cI\u2019m going to run on what I\u2019ve produced and delivered for the people of Wyoming.\u201d The congresswoman also went on the attack, saying Hageman took an oath as a member of the Wyoming Bar, and \u201cis abandoning that principle, sacrificing that oath, abandoning her duty to the people of Wyoming in order to pledge loyalty to Donald Trump.\u201d Some Wyoming Republicans told CNN they admired Cheney and would continue to support her. \u201cShe stood up to Trump when that needed to be done,\u201d said Scott. \u201cShe had the courage to do that.\u201d \u201cShe stood by her country, her oath, the Constitution and her heart, and she stood up to the cult of personality driving a wedge in the Republican Party,\u201d added state GOP Sen. Cale Case. \u201cShe is smart, brave and a patriot.\u201d But pro-Trump forces are aligning against her. Hageman, a lawyer who has challenged the federal government on water rights and natural resources, has run for statewide public office before, finishing third in Wyoming\u2019s 2018 Republican primary for governor. Her family has been in the state for generations; her father, the late state Rep. James Hageman, was a longtime legislator. In reflecting on her race, she recalled how she felt looking at the crowd during her campaign launch, and seeing her brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. \u201cI think that I was born and raised for this moment in time, and it is to protect the future for those people,\u201d Hageman said. \u201cI have spent much of my adult life, much of my professional career, fighting for and protecting Wyoming.\u201d \u201cWyoming is in my blood,\u201d she added. \u201cI am Wyoming.\u201d Did Liz Cheney risk everything to impeach Trump? In a sign of the strength of her candidacy, three House GOP candidates \u2014 Air Force veteran Bryan Miller, Cheyenne businessman Darin Smith, and state Rep. Chuck Gray \u2014 suspended their House campaigns after she jumped into the race with Trump\u2019s endorsement. \u201cLiz Cheney must go,\u201d said Smith. Wyoming\u2019s two GOP senators also don\u2019t seem to be coming to Cheney\u2019s aid, even though they serve with the congresswoman. Sen. John Barrasso told CNN that he plans to stay neutral in what he expects to be a \u201cspirited\u201d primary contest, noting that \u201cthe President has made an endorsement; that will carry an impact.\u201d In his endorsement, Trump said Hageman also has \u201cthe support and respect\u201d of Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis, though Lummis told CNN she has \u201cno idea\u201d if she\u2019s going to endorse a candidate in the race. The senator\u2019s spokesman, Darin Miller, told CNN, \u201cWhile Senator Lummis is not making an endorsement at this time, she believes President Trump has made an inspired choice in backing Harriet Hageman.\u201d Still, state Sen. Anthony Bouchard and a few other House GOP candidates have remained in the race. Some Trump supporters were dismayed that the former President chose Hageman, citing her involvement on Cheney\u2019s leadership team during her brief 2014 Senate campaign, donations to Cheney\u2019s congressional campaigns and pictures of the two women at various events. In 2013, Hageman defended Cheney, telling The Associated Press that her family had a long history in Wyoming and that criticism of her upbringing in Virginia was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the issues of the Senate race. But after Cheney\u2019s conduct over the past year, Hageman\u2019s tune changed. \u201cHaving supported her in the past, I feel completely and totally betrayed by what she\u2019s done,\u201d Hageman told CNN. \u201cShe has betrayed Wyoming. She has betrayed my country. And she has betrayed me.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With all eyes turning to California on Tuesday to see whether Gov. Gavin Newsom is recalled, a few places within the Golden State could offer some early clues \u2013 not only about whether the Democratic governor can keep his job \u2013 but also what the political climate might look like next year in a state where Republicans picked up four House seats in 2020. Republicans\u2019 best scenario for ousting Newsom in this overwhelmingly blue state has always been outsized GOP turnout and low Democratic turnout. That\u2019s because registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2 to 1.   All of the state\u2019s 22 million registered voters were mailed ballots last month. All counties were also required to make one or more early voting locations available for at least four days beginning the Saturday before the election, and many kept them open longer. So there\u2019s already significant data about who\u2019s casting votes. Republicans are hoping for a massive Election Day turnout that could tip the scales. But so far, Democrats have been more engaged than expected. About 53% of ballots cast so far have been from registered Democrats and 25% from registered Republicans, according to Political Data Inc., a firm that does work for Democratic candidates, progressive organizations and nonpartisan campaigns. That means Democrats are still outperforming their registration level in the state. But to see whether that turnout advantage holds (and translates into Newsom\u2019s survival), here are some specific places to watch on Tuesday. When those first results drop after the polls close at 8 p.m. PST, all California politicos will be looking closely at the margins in the heavily Democratic Bay Area (home to San Francisco and Oakland) and Los Angeles County to see whether Democrats managed to turn out the huge numbers in raw votes that could start to make the math look impossible for Republicans. Several Democratic strategists said that if the \u201cno\u201d side hits the mid-60s when that early vote posts from those areas, they believe Newsom will be headed for victory. Strategists will also be keeping a close eye on the traditionally red pockets of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties in the Inland Empire, which is east of Los Angeles, as well as within Orange County and eastern San Diego County to see if Republicans are able to pump up turnout there toward presidential levels and beyond. \u201cIf there\u2019s no Republican blowout in those areas, it\u2019s impossible for the math to add up,\u201d said Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. (San Bernardino and Riverside counties were once Republican strongholds, but the growing, diverse, younger populations in those areas has turned them blue in the last few presidential cycles). Keep an eye on GOP turnout in a place like California\u2019s 50th Congressional District in eastern San Diego County \u2013 the seat once held by former Rep. Duncan Hunter and now by GOP Rep. Darrell Issa \u2013 to gauge how high Republican enthusiasm is for the recall. The California battlegrounds of 2020 will be the battlegrounds of 2022. Last year, Republican Young Kim beat Democratic incumbent Gil Cisneros in California\u2019s 39th Congressional District, which includes portions of Orange County, Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. Republican Michelle Steel beat Democratic incumbent Harley Rouda in California\u2019s 48th, which encompasses much of coastal Orange County, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa. It was a show of strength by those female candidates, who became the first Republican Korean American women in Congress, to appeal to the many different ethnic groups that make up their racially diverse districts. They each overperformed the top of the ticket, earning a higher share of the vote than former President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden won both districts, carrying Steel\u2019s by just a point and a half and Kim\u2019s by a wider 10-point margin. But the margins in the two congressional races were razor thin, so strategists from both sides of the aisle are looking to see whether Tuesday\u2019s recall results could offer some hints about how the national Republican Party\u2019s messaging on Covid will play out in these districts next year, without Trump on the ballot, in a state where the vast majority of Californians favor mask and vaccine mandates. \u201cThe results will tell me how much work we\u2019ve got ahead of us,\u201d said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party. \u201cThis is a big training for the marathon that is to come for 2022.\u201d The anger at Newsom is palpable in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 especially in red counties like Kings, Kern and Tulare. Pro-recall signs dot the highways in this heavily agricultural area that has been hard hit by the state\u2019s historic drought and water restrictions. Those three counties all voted for Trump in last year\u2019s election even though Biden won the state by nearly 30 points. Voters there may use the recall as an opportunity to punish the Democratic governor for the havoc the drought and the state\u2019s water crisis have created, even though they have been decades in the making. Also keep a close eye on California\u2019s 21st District, where Republican David Valadao unseated Democrat TJ Cox by another tight margin in 2020 \u2013 50.4% to 49.6%. Valadao, who also held this seat from 2013 to early 2019, is one of Democrats\u2019 top targets in 2022 because he represents a district that Biden carried by nearly 11 points. The district includes Kings County and portions of Fresno, Kern and Tulare Counties and is 75% Latino, according to the latest Census data. There have been a lot of questions about what the level of participation will be among Latinos in this recall election, because that community was hit disproportionately hard by the pandemic. Some 64% of Latino voters supported Newsom in 2018, when he was first elected governor, but some Democratic leaders have worried that they are not as engaged in the recall after the turmoil of the last year and a half. Political experts will be looking at the level of turnout in areas like populous East Los Angeles to see whether the heavy push to get those late-deciding Latino voters to turn in their ballots was effective. Rural Imperial County, east of San Diego County along the southern US border with Mexico, is 85% Latino, and could offer an interesting window into the mood of Latino working-class voters in an area that was among the hardest hit by Covid-19. The county is often described as its own universe because of its uniqueness within the state as a sparsely populated agricultural county with a high level of poverty. But it will be interesting to see whether an area that endured so much tragedy from Covid-19 turns out to support the governor, who many recall proponents have blamed for being too strict with his pandemic restrictions.",

            "article_content": "The White House announced this week that President Biden will fly to California to campaign for Gov. Gavin Newsom ahead of the September 14 recall election. Which raises a basic question: Why? After all, Biden is in the midst of the most challenging period of his young presidency as the situation in Afghanistan, the Delta variant of Covid-19 and the situation at the southern border have combined to complicate his political fortunes. (Sidebar: It\u2019s possible that Biden cancels his planned California trip, which was announced Wednesday, as Vice President Kamala Harris did this week after the devastating terror attack in Kabul Thursday that killed 13 US service members and more than 170 others.) And it\u2019s a long way to go to defend a Democratic governor in one of the most Democratic states in the country. Given all of that, there\u2019s really only one answer to that question above as to why Biden is making the trip for Newsom: The President \u2013 and Democratic strategists more generally \u2013 are worried about the governor losing the recall vote. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! And they\u2019re right to be concerned. A CBS poll released earlier this month showed 52% of likely California voters oppose the recall effort while 48% support it. There\u2019s lots of other data out there that suggests something similar \u2013 that as the recall vote date gets closer, the public is increasingly undecided about whether to keep Newsom around. Newsom himself expressed his concern in a recent interview with The Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz. \u201cDemocrats up and down the state haven\u2019t taken this seriously, whereas Republicans have,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cRepublicans see this as a historic opportunity.\u201d The Biden visit is aimed at closing that enthusiasm gap. A presidential visit typically creates excitement among base voters \u2013 and draws lots and lots of favorable press coverage, which might sway Democrats (and independents) who remain on the fence about Newsom. It\u2019s the ultimate trump card \u2013 with apologies to the former president \u2013 that a party can pull. And it\u2019s usually a sign of the a) import of winning a race and b) worry that said race is not heading in the right direction. The Point: Early ballots returned look good for Newsom. But he\u2019s clearly nervous about turnout. And Biden traveling to the state suggests that the White House shares those worries. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that the White House did not specify in its announcement when Biden planned to travel to California next week.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham thinks pretty highly of himself. So highly, in fact, that the following two paragraphs were written about him in a lengthy New York Times profile over the weekend: \u201cHe alone can fix the former president, he believes, and make him a unifying figure for Republicans to take back both houses of Congress next year and beyond. To that end, he says, he is determined to steer Mr. Trump away from a dangerous obsession with 2020. \u201c\u2018What I say to him is, \u2018Do you want January the 6th to be your political obituary?\u2019 he said. \u2018Because if you don\u2019t get over it, it\u2019s going to be.\u2019\u201d Lindsey Graham thinks he can \u201cfix\u201d Donald Trump, turning the former president from a narcissistic obsessive about nonexistent fraud in the 2020 election into a powerful force for good within the Republican Party. Which, in a word, HA! THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! There\u2019s lots of reasons why Graham\u2019s belief that he can fundamentally alter Trump is deeply misguided. Let\u2019s go through them. 1) Trump remains totally focused on nonexistent election fraud: While the former president no longer has Twitter \u2013 he was permanently banned from the platform after his reaction to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol \u2013 he is still issuing a slew of statements every week via his \u201cSave America\u201d PAC. And the common theme in the majority of them is that the 2020 election was somehow stolen from him \u2013 and that the truth will emerge sometime soon. \u201cIt is time for Joe Biden to resign in disgrace for what he has allowed to happen to Afghanistan, along with the tremendous surge in COVID, the Border catastrophe, the destruction of energy independence, and our crippled economy,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, because he wasn\u2019t elected legitimately in the first place!\u201d \u201cWhy are RINOs standing in the way of a full Forensic Audit in Michigan?\u201d Trump said late last week. \u201cThe voters are demanding it because they have no confidence in their elections after the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election Scam.\u201d Yeah, that totally seems like a guy who is ready to move on! He\u2019s totally coming to terms with losing the 2020 election! 2) There is NO Trump 2.0: Remember when Trump promised \u2013 after it became clear he would be the Republican nominee in 2016 \u2013 that he would be \u201cso presidential [that] you will be so bored. You\u2019ll say, \u2018Can\u2019t he have a little more energy?\u2019\u201d How\u2019s that promise looking with five years of hindsight? The truth is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 that there is no pivot possible. There is not other gear that Trump can go to, some other side of his personality he hasn\u2019t shown yet. He\u2019s a 75-year-old man who has behaved the same way \u2013 boorishly, crudely and utterly without introspection \u2013 for his entire adult life. The idea that he will suddenly change \u2013 because Lindsey Graham told him to! \u2013 is beyond ridiculous. 3) Graham isn\u2019t the boss of their relationship: Even if you discount the two points above \u2013 and you shouldn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s still no chance that Graham can bring his vision of Trump to fruition. Why? Because even by Graham\u2019s own admission, he\u2019s not that guy! This, from the Times, is illuminating on that point: \u201cMr. Graham, 66, has from his school days chosen to ally himself with protective figures he calls \u2018alpha dogs,\u2019 men more powerful than himself\u2026 \u201c\u2026\u2019To be part of a football team, you don\u2019t have to be the quarterback, right?\u2019 Mr. Graham said in the interview. \u2018I mean, there\u2019s a value in being part of something.\u2019\u201d Sure! But the left guard doesn\u2019t tell the quarterback what to do. Or suggest how the QB can change himself in order to be a better team player. That Graham thinks he can change Trump, then, speaks to two things: His own towering sense of self-importance and his fundamental misreading of who Donald Trump is (and always has been). There is no \u201cnew\u201d Trump waiting to be discovered by Graham (or anyone else). There\u2019s just Trump. Take him or leave him.",

            "article_content": "The passage of a sweeping infrastructure plan in the Senate on Tuesday gives both parties plenty of ammunition heading into a midterm campaign season \u2013 look no further than the most competitive Senate seats for how that will play out. Democrats are on offense in six of the 10 top races; they\u2019re trying to flip those red seats blue, and they\u2019ll be pointing to the $1.2 trillion package as a shining example of what Democratic control can deliver for the American people, while some GOP candidates attack it for spending too much money. One of Democrats\u2019 top targets \u2013 Pennsylvania \u2013 remains the seat most likely to flip. The top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, polling and advertising spending data will also become factors. Our ranking first published in March, and was updated in April, May and July. President Joe Biden carried Pennsylvania in 2020 after former President Donald Trump narrowly carried it in 2016, and it\u2019s now an open seat since GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection. Toomey, a former president of the Club for Growth first elected to the Senate in 2010, voted against the infrastructure bill, calling it \u201ctoo expensive, too expansive.\u201d The bill passed 69-30 with 19 Republicans joining with Democrats. Most of the other GOP senators vacating competitive seats backed the bill: Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio. As CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Alex Rogers have reported, that puts them at odds with many of the Republicans vying to replace them, underscoring how today\u2019s GOP candidates are much more likely to follow Trump\u2019s lead than their senators\u2019. After Pennsylvania, Democrats\u2019 best pick-up opportunities remain Wisconsin and North Carolina, where one GOP senator \u2013 Sen. Ron Johnson \u2013 still hasn\u2019t made up his mind about running for reelection and the other, Burr, announced five years ago that this would be his last term. Democrats are attacking Johnson for voting against the infrastructure package and they\u2019re deploying a similar line against Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida. Republicans still have the advantage in the Sunshine State, but it\u2019s the eighth most likely to flip for the second month in a row. Republicans\u2019 best pick-up opportunities are in Georgia and Arizona, two states that Biden and Senate Democrats flipped last cycle. Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock, who won in a 2021 runoff, and Mark Kelly, who won last year, face reelection again next fall for full six-year terms. Here are the 10 seats most likely to flip: Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) The Democratic field in this top pick-up opportunity got a new candidate last week, when Rep. Conor Lamb made official his campaign to replace Toomey. The Marine veteran and former prosecutor, whom Biden once said \u201creminds me of my son Beau,\u201d joins Lt. Gov. John Fetterman \u2013 the biggest fundraiser in the race \u2013 Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh, who has the backing of EMILY\u2019s List, and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as the major candidates trying to flip this seat blue. Lamb first came to Congress in a 2018 special election, winning a conservative district that Trump had carried comfortably two years earlier. Like Fetterman, he\u2019s from the western part of the state, but unlike the former Braddock mayor, Lamb has tried to cut a more moderate image, which could be advantageous in a general election. Republicans haven\u2019t yet coalesced around a candidate of their own, but they\u2019re gleeful that a competitive Democratic primary may be pushing all their potential opponents to the left. Lamb, for example, has come out in support of ending the filibuster. Meanwhile, Republicans Jeff Bartos, a businessman, and Army veteran Sean Parnell, who lost a House race to Lamb in 2020, continue to duke it out, while Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s ambassador to Denmark and a top donor, announced her candidacy late last month. Former congressional candidate Kathy Barnette, who hadn\u2019t gotten much attention in the race so far, generated some buzz by outraising the other GOP contenders in the second quarter. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock There\u2019s no question that Georgia, where Warnock is running for a full six-year term, will be a close race. But that\u2019s not quieting GOP anxiety over who their candidate will be. All eyes are still on Herschel Walker, who\u2019s received encouragement from Trump but lives in Texas and has yet to get in the race. Plenty of Republicans are hoping he doesn\u2019t get in, with a recent Associated Press report detailing his past \u2013 including that he threatened violence against his ex-wife \u2013 deepening concerns that he could jeopardize this top GOP pick-up opportunity. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has privately raised the idea that former Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both of whom lost in runoffs earlier this year, should reconsider this race, CNN reported last week. While the party establishment desperately searches for someone besides Walker, the idea that the Heisman Trophy winner already has Trump\u2019s blessing may make it more daunting for other would-be candidates to throw their hats in the primary ring. Three candidates are already running, including state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, who tried to attack Walker in a digital ad last week in which he rides a tractor and says he\u2019s \u201chad Georgia plates all my life,\u201d a not-so-subtle dig at Walker\u2019s June video teasing a Senate run by revving the engine of a car with Peach State license plates. Biden only narrowly carried Georgia \u2013 as did Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff \u2013 so no matter who the Republican nominee is, Warnock is likely to have a fight on his hands. But for now, he has the race largely to himself, allowing him to start the third quarter with more than $10.5 million in the bank. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson While everyone waits to see whether Johnson runs for a third term, Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is, quite literally, running \u2013 announcing his campaign in a video late last month in which he laces up his sneakers at 6 a.m. and hits the streets. State Sen. Chris Larson soon ended his campaign and endorsed Barnes, leaving state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry as the other major Democratic candidates, although the race got another new candidate last week in Wisconsin Emergency Management Administrator Darrell Williams. Johnson raised $1.2 million in the second quarter \u2013 more than double his first-quarter haul \u2013 but he still hasn\u2019t said whether he\u2019s seeking a third term. As the only GOP incumbent who hasn\u2019t announced a retirement who\u2019s running for reelection in a Biden state, he would automatically be vulnerable. But some Democrats believe that his increasing penchant for peddling conspiracy theories \u2013 about the 2020 election, the January 6 insurrection and the coronavirus and vaccines \u2013 may make the race even more winnable for them than if this were an open seat. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Kelly is running for a full six-year term after flipping this seat blue last fall. While Republicans fretted earlier this year that they lacked a candidate in one of their top pick-up opportunities, there\u2019s a bevy of candidates lining up to take on Kelly, while Gov. Doug Ducey \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s favorite Republicans to attack \u2013 insists he isn\u2019t running. Blake Masters, the president of the Thiel Foundation, launched his campaign last month, with expectations that Thiel will invest $10 million in a super PAC for him. He joins retired Maj. Gen. Michael \u201cMick\u201d McGuire, the state\u2019s top National Guard officer who also headed Arizona\u2019s emergency response department during the pandemic, Attorney General Mark Brnovich and solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon in the race. But much of the early jockeying here isn\u2019t about the 2022 election \u2013 it\u2019s about relitigating the last one, when Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state since 1948 and then-GOP Sen. Martha McSally lost. Masters told CNN in an interview when he announced that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to know\u201d who won the presidential race. Upping the pressure on local Republicans to embrace that perspective, Trump traveled to the Grand Canyon State later that month for a misleadingly called \u201cRally to Protect our Elections,\u201d seizing on Maricopa County\u2019s partisan audit and repeating his lies about election fraud. While it\u2019s a powerful narrative among some Republicans \u2013 including the state party, which earlier this year censured Ducey \u2013 there\u2019s a risk that parroting too much Trump talk about stolen elections will turn off the same suburban voters who (twice) rejected McSally\u2019s efforts to cozy up to the former President. Republicans are hitting Kelly on the border, while some in Washington are showing plenty of love for the state\u2019s other Democratic senator, Kyrsten Sinema. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, for example, recently published an op-ed praising her efforts on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, while the National Republican Senatorial Committee has been trying to use Sinema as a foil to argue that Kelly isn\u2019t as moderate as he says he is. As Republicans fight amongst themselves \u2013 and will for another year, given the state\u2019s late primary \u2013 Kelly ended the second quarter with nearly $7.6 million in the bank. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) This is one open race where Trump has already weighed in, throwing his weight behind GOP Rep. Ted Budd to replace retiring Sen. Richard Burr in a surprise endorsement earlier this summer. But it hasn\u2019t winnowed the field \u2013 former Gov. Pat McCrory is still running, as is former Rep. Mark Walker. The political arm of the conservative Club for Growth, which has been with Budd since he emerged from a 17-way primary to come to Congress in 2016, recently ran an ad during the Olympics attacking McCrory, whose previous campaigns and time in statewide elected office make him a well-known commodity in the race. On the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who\u2019s running with the backing of EMILY\u2019s List, raised about $1.3 million during the second quarter, despite not being in the race for the full quarter \u2013 more than either state Sen. Jeff Jackson or former state Sen. Erica Smith raised during that period. Democrats have struggled in North Carolina at the Senate and presidential levels recently, but there\u2019s excitement that running a non-White male candidate could drive turnout among minority voters, especially in some of the rural areas where Republicans have continued to hold an advantage. Higher Heights PAC, which works to elect progressive Black women, and the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus both endorsed Beasley this summer. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan Still waiting\u2026 that\u2019s the refrain in the Granite State, where Republicans (and Democrats) are watching to see when Gov. Chris Sununu will make a decision about challenging Hassan. Trump has said he would like to see him run \u2013 as would establishment Republicans. He had said he\u2019d make a decision after the end of the legislative session, but that deadline has come and gone. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a decision for a while,\u201d Sununu said last week on the \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast, hosted by longtime McConnell adviser Josh Holmes. While the holdup may be frustrating some Republicans, Sununu is probably right that he has time. As a sitting governor, he doesn\u2019t need to introduce himself to voters. (Hassan, herself a former two-term governor, didn\u2019t announce for Senate until October 2015.) And if he doesn\u2019t run, the GOP may have another good option in former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who only lost to Hassan by 1,017 votes in 2016. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to turn the GOP excitement for Sununu into an attack by tying him to McConnell, launching digital ads last week about how they are \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d They\u2019re also leaning hard into Sununu\u2019s signing of a budget with abortion restrictions \u2013 an issue that could be problematic for the Republican in a state that\u2019s increasingly trended blue in federal elections. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Republicans are also waiting in Nevada, where there\u2019s not yet a major challenger to first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. But that could soon change. All eyes have been on former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who\u2019s hosting his Basque Fry next weekend with a list of speakers that includes conservative heavyweights like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth. If Laxalt doesn\u2019t run for Senate, it\u2019s not clear the party has a backup in the same way the GOP does in the Granite State, especially with so many other Republicans in Nevada running for governor. Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator and the former chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, ended the second quarter with more than $6.5 million in the bank. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio This race moved up one spot on the list last month \u2013 and Democratic Rep. Val Demings\u2019 quarterly fundraising report, released later in July, underscored why: she raised nearly $4.7 million, ending the period with about $3 million in the bank. Rubio raised about $4 million, but still had a hefty cash-on-hand advantage of more than $6 million. Republicans scoff at big Democratic fundraising, arguing that it\u2019s become standard in the Trump era and isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of victory. And while past races have shown that money certainly isn\u2019t everything, it can say something about the strength and enthusiasm around a certain candidate \u2013 not to mention it\u2019s pretty useful for Florida\u2019s expensive media markets. Rubio still has the clear advantage in this state that Trump won by 3 points, but Democrats are enthused about their candidate and think Rubio\u2019s vote against infrastructure gives them a powerful attack. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) Portman isn\u2019t running for reelection, although he\u2019s still a crucial player in the Senate, leading GOP negotiations over the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The crowded field of Republican candidates vying to replace him isn\u2019t on board with the compromise \u2013 just one example of how Republican candidates in open-seat races are trying to run much closer to Trump than to the incumbent. Former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, former state party chair Jane Timken, businessmen Mike Gibbons and Bernie Moreno and \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance are all hoping a Trump endorsement will come their way, but so far the ex-President has stayed out of the race. Vance has benefited from a surge of earned media since his announcement last month, and he already had the backing of a super PAC with a $10 million cash infusion from Thiel. But his high profile has also led to scrutiny of his past anti-Trump comments, including calling him a \u201cmoral disaster,\u201d as CNN\u2019s KFile has reported. Democrats are ready to use Republicans\u2019 opposition to the infrastructure plan against them, and Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 who raised more $3 million in the second quarter \u2013 is consolidating support with the backing of Rep. Joyce Beatty, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. But in a state Trump won by 8 points, Ryan still faces an uphill battle to replicate Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s success of winning statewide here. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) The fallout from Blunt\u2019s decision not to run for another term jolted a race that should never have been competitive onto the list of seats most likely to flip. Other Republican retirements in red states have undoubtedly made races more competitive \u2013 see Ohio above, for example \u2013 but Blunt\u2019s impending departure has created an opening for former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct. Republicans haven\u2019t forgotten 2012, when Todd Akin\u2019s \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost them a Senate race here. And the problem for Missouri Republicans this year is that more of them keep launching campaigns, which could eventually splinter the anti-Greitens vote and reduce the threshold he needs to win the primary. GOP Rep. Billy Long recently announced his campaign, joining Rep. Vicky Hartzler, Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Mark McCloskey, whom the Republican governor recently pardoned after he and his wife had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges for pointing guns at protesters near their home last summer. The only other GOP woman in the congressional delegation, Rep. Ann Wagner, announced she\u2019d run for reelection instead. On the Democratic side, former Gov. Jay Nixon also announced he\u2019d pass, putting an end to the chatter that the bigger-name would jump in now that Greitens\u2019 candidacy is making a solid Republican seat, in a state carried by 15 points, look more vulnerable. Democrats have a handful of lesser-known candidates, and some who are still eying the race, who could still make this race competitive \u2013 or at least force the national GOP to spend money defending the seat.",

            "article_content": "The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a state district judge\u2019s temporary restraining order that had prevented the arrest of Texas House Democrats, who left the state last month in an attempt to stop the passage of restrictive voting bills. The ruling means that many of the Democratic lawmakers who returned to Texas but continue to break quorum during the second session could now be at risk for arrest after state House Republicans voted later Tuesday to direct the sergeant-at-arms to compel attendance \u201cunder warrant of arrest if necessary.\u201d The Texas House Speaker\u2019s office confirmed Tuesday night that the Speaker has signed civil arrest warrants for 52 House Democrats who are absent without excuses. Those warrants will be delivered to the sergeant-at-arms in the morning for service. The 80-12 vote came just hours after the Texas Supreme Court ruling and was mostly along party lines, with one House Republican voting against the motion. Texas\u2019 high court on Tuesday issued a stay of Travis County State District Judge Brad Urrutia\u2019s order and gave the group of Democrats until Thursday evening to file a response. Urrutia\u2019s order signed Sunday barred Texas\u2019 Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan from \u201cissuing any warrant or other instrument\u201d and \u201cdetaining, confining, or otherwise restricting a Texas House Democrat\u2019s movement without his or her consent.\u201d \u201cIt is no surprise that Republican Governor Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dade Phelan want to arrest their political opponents. Thankfully, this is still the United States of America. We will defend the freedom to vote, and we look forward to our temporary injunction hearing on August 20th,\u201d said Texas state Reps. Trey Martinez Fischer, Gina Hinojosa, and Jasmine Crockett in a joint statement issued after the Supreme Court ruling. The three Democrats are part of the 19 who filed the original petition for relief. The lawmakers were among the more than 50 Democrats who flew to Washington, DC, to prevent their Republican counterparts from having a quorum needed to carry on legislative business during July\u2019s special session. In a statement, Abbott\u2019s press secretary Renae Eze said, \u201cWe look forward to the Supreme Court upholding the rule of law and stopping another stall tactic by the Texas Democrats.\u201d CNN has reached out to Phelan\u2019s office for comment. Abbott and Phelan, represented by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, had asked the Texas Supreme Court to overturn Urrutia\u2019s order on Monday, saying the judge\u2019s order had stopped them from exercising their constitutional authority. \u201cCompelling the attendance of its members is a prerogative given to the House by the Texas Constitution,\u201d the two Republican leaders argued in their petition.   The petition also claimed that the district court\u2019s order could make the rare move of breaking quorum a more frequently used option in the future stating, \u201cRather than leaving the State to break the quorum, minority factions need only convince a court to ignore the Texas Speech and Debate Clause and secure a temporary restraining order against the Speaker [\u2026]or other temporary injunctive relief to wait out a legislative session and prevent the Legislature from carrying out Texans\u2019 interests.\u201d The governor and House speaker\u2019s emergency motion, first reported by the Austin American Statesman, requested that the Supreme Court overturn the order before Tuesday night \u2013 citing the ongoing second special session that began this weekend. There is a hearing on the temporary restraining order scheduled for August 20. And it expires in two weeks, if it is not extended. Texas House Democrats successfully blocked an election overhaul bill that would add new restrictions and criminal penalties to voting in the Lone Star State when they broke quorum by flying to Washington, DC, during the first special session called by Abbott in July. Members said they left the state to lobby congressional lawmakers for federal voting protections, but also to avoid being arrested and forced back to the Texas state Capitol. More than two dozen Texas Democrats vowed to remain in Washington through August, while others have left the nation\u2019s capital but haven\u2019t returned to the Texas House for the new special session. On Monday, the Texas House experienced higher attendance, but once again failed to reach a quorum. The Texas House, which requires two-thirds of members to be present for a quorum, fell five members short of that number on Monday night. Members voted to institute a \u201ccall of the House,\u201d locking the chamber doors and requiring members to get written permission from the Speaker to leave. The House did not call to send law enforcement to find and compel members to attend on Monday. Abbott\u2019s agenda for the second session includes \u201celection integrity,\u201d \u201cbail reform,\u201d tightening enforcement at the US border, and legislation preventing students from playing on sports teams of a different sex than they were assigned at birth. This story has been updated with additional details Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "For House Republicans, their path back to power could rest on the backs of GOP women. After a historic number of Republican women were elected to the House in 2020 \u2014 including in some of the most competitive races in the country \u2014 the party sees a recipe for electoral success and is now doubling down on that same strategy in the battle for the House next year. What has emerged among party leaders, operatives and outside groups is a two-pronged approach: retain their current Republican women in critical swing seats and recruit additional strong female candidates to run in key battleground districts that they hope to flip next year. And so far, there are signs of that strategy bearing out: A record-breaking number of Republican women have already filed to run for office, while some of the GOP\u2019s top fundraisers this year have been freshmen Republican women. \u201cThere are several roads to taking back the House, but I think one road contains a lot of Republican women on it,\u201d said freshman Rep. Young Kim, a California Republican who flipped a blue seat in Orange County last year. \u201cWithout a doubt, getting more GOP women elected to join the Republican conference is critically important.\u201d Republicans \u2014 who have history and redistricting on their side \u2014 only need to flip five seats to seize back the House. And party operatives can point to at least six competitive races where female GOP candidates have already decided to jump in, meaning Republicans could theoretically win back the majority with women alone and add to their historic ranks. But that would mean holding on to every single female incumbent, which will be no easy feat. The GOP women who were responsible for flipping 11 out of 15 seats last cycle will be locked in some of the toughest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 contests in the country, and Democrats are determined to take them on. \u201cRepublican women are now our not-so-secret, secret weapon,\u201d said Olivia Perez-Cuba, spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a super PAC dedicated solely to electing GOP women. \u201cAnd in order to keep winning \u2014 and it\u2019s all about electoral success at the end of the day \u2014 then we need to find and support qualified women.\u201d While Republicans are still lagging behind their Democratic counterparts in closing the gender gap, there was a real attitude and cultural shift inside the GOP after their female ranks were nearly decimated in 2018. Now, after Republicans experienced their own \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d in 2020, a record-breaking number of female candidates have been inspired \u2014 and in some cases, directly recruited \u2014 to run for office. So far, 155 Republican women have filed to run, compared to 60 at this point in 2019 \u2014 a new record for the party. \u201cWe got started last cycle. We had some success. Now we have to build off that success,\u201d Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters at a recent briefing. \u201cI anticipate that we\u2019re going to set a new record this time, just like we did last time, because we\u2019re going to continue to add to the talent pool of women that we\u2019ve attracted to the House.\u201d GOP operatives point to several top recruits with sparkling resumes whom they think could have a strong shot at flipping seats currently held by Democrats. That includes Monica De La Cruz-Hernandez, a small business owner in Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley; Jen Kiggans, a former Navy pilot and nurse practitioner and state lawmaker in Virginia; Lisa Scheller, the head of a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania; Amanda Adkins, the former chairwoman of the Kansas Republican Party; Esther Joy King, an Army lawyer from the Quad Cities in Illinois; and Meagan Hanson, a former state legislator in the Atlanta suburbs. One key difference between the GOP\u2019s abysmal 2018 and their historic 2020 was leadership\u2019s willingness to finally play in primaries, which has long been the biggest barrier to getting more Republican women over the finish line. And leadership is making clear they once again plan to get involved early on in the cycle: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already endorsed and sent money to Joy King, De La Cruz-Hernandez and Adkins; the California Republican has also hosted Joy King at various campaign events. Not to mention, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York \u2014 who has been leading the charge inside the Republican party to elect more women \u2014 was elected to the No. 3 spot in GOP leadership this May, ensuring the issue gets even more attention. But the party\u2019s notable gains with women have been overshadowed at times by some of the most controversial -\u2014 and vocal \u2014 firebrands in the freshman class, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Democrats plan to yoke the entire party, especially vulnerable members in tough districts, to Greene in the midterms. And while Stefanik was elevated to the conference chair position, it was only after the party booted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, then the highest-ranking woman in the GOP, from her leadership job for repeatedly calling out former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the election \u2014 something else Democrats will not let voters forget. But for Republicans to flip the House, it will take more than just strong recruitment: They will also need to hold on to as many seats as they can. In an encouraging sign for the GOP, some of the party\u2019s most vulnerable Republican women are stockpiling cash. Freshman Reps. Michelle Steel of California, Ashley Hinson of Iowa and Nancy Mace of South Carolina all raked in mroe than $800,000 in the second quarter of this year, while Kim cleared $1 million during the same period \u2014 massive fundraising hauls for an off-year. And McCarthy has sent more than $100,000 to both Kim and Steel\u2019s reelection campaigns this cycle. Aside from padding their war chests, leaders have also sought to elevate their new class of GOP women by inviting them on border trips, tapping them for task forces and select committees, inviting them to weekly leadership pressers and using their bills for procedural votes. Hinson, widely viewed as a rising GOP star who could wind up in leadership one day, was even given a speaking slot during McCarthy\u2019s major donor retreat in Jackson Hole. And freshman Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a former Telemundo host who won a key district in southern Florida, was among the crew of House Republicans who traveled with McCarthy to Miami on Thursday for a Cuba freedom rally. \u201cLeadership has been very helpful in giving us opportunities to run with issues, to be leaders on issues, and to obtain a spotlight on issues, which sometimes you don\u2019t see from leaders. Sometimes they hog the spotlight for themselves,\u201d said freshman Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, who flipped her Staten Island seat last year. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wanting to promote the freshman class because they\u2019re so proud of the freshman class.\u201d Some of the new Republican women have already been deployed on the campaign trail to stump for other candidates this year, including for the special elections for the Georgia Senate races at the start of this year. And Kim and Steel, Korean immigrants who have been friends for decades, have formed a joint fundraising committee to boost their own campaigns and help elect other diverse Republicans. \u201cWe can raise money, we can meet people, and we can actually promote other women,\u201d Steel said. \u201cSo we\u2019re gonna keep these seats, and we\u2019re gonna recruit more, because the Republican Party has to be a big tent. All these diverse faces with unique backgrounds \u2014 this is actually reflecting our country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday called for a second special session of the state legislature to begin this weekend, after Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block a restrictive voting bill. In the Republican governor\u2019s proclamation, which includes \u201celection integrity\u201d on the agenda, he says the special session will begin at noon on Saturday\u2014twelve hours after the first special session ends. Texas state House Democrats effectively stalled any action during the initial special session when they broke quorum to block a voting bill that would add new restrictions by flying to Washington, DC. More than 50 Democrats have remained out of the state since July 12. The first special session ends at 11:59 p.m. on Friday. In addition to \u201celection integrity\u201d and \u201cbail reform,\u201d Abbot\u2019s 17-item agenda for the second session also includes items meant to prohibit mask mandates in schools, tighten enforcement at the US border and prevent students from playing on sports teams of a different sex than they were assigned at birth. \u201cThe Texas Legislature achieved a great deal during the 87th Legislative Session, and they have a responsibility to finish the work that was started,\u201d Abbott said in a statement Thursday. \u201cI will continue to call special session after special session to reform our broken bail system, uphold election integrity and pass other important items that Texans demand and deserve. Passing these Special Session agenda items will chart a course towards a stronger and brighter future for the Lone Star State,\u201d Abbott said. Republicans in Texas have sought to join Florida, Georgia and other GOP-controlled states that have seized on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election and adopted new restrictions that will make it harder for some of their residents to vote. Abbott\u2019s call for a second session comes as Texas Democrats remain in Washington, focused on pressuring President Joe Biden and Democratic members of Congress on passing federal voting rights legislation. The Texas lawmakers have held a number of meetings with national Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who is a key vote. Federal voting rights legislation, Democratic state legislators and voting rights activists argue, would help secure the right to vote for all Americans in the wake of the new restrictive bills. This week, Texas Democrats were joined by more than 100 state legislators from across the country as part of a planned \u201cweek of action\u201d on voting rights. The Texas Democrats have for months been strategic in their actions against the restrictive voting bill. In May, just before the end of the year\u2019s legislative session, the Democratic legislators walked off the state House floor, leaving Texas Republicans without the quorum they needed to approve the voting legislation in the final hours before a midnight deadline.",

            "article_content": "Hakeem Jeffries is sick of hearing from liberals carping about how Democrats \u2013 and their leaders, of which he is one \u2013 aren\u2019t doing enough to advance progressive policies. \u201cThe extreme left is obsessed with talking trash about mainstream Democrats on Twitter, when the majority of the electorate constitute mainstream Democrats at the polls,\u201d Jeffries, the Democratic caucus chairman, told The New York Times on Wednesday. \u201cIn the post-Trump era, the anti-establishment line of attack is lame \u2014 when President Biden and Democratic legislators are delivering millions of good-paying jobs, the fastest-growing economy in 40 years and a massive child tax cut.\u201d Jeffries\u2019 fiery comments came after Rep.-elect Shontel Brown, the establishment favorite, triumphed over Nina Turner, an outspoken liberal former legislator, in an Ohio special election on Tuesday. Brown\u2019s win marked the latest in a series of victories by more pragmatic candidates over more liberal alternatives. In New York City earlier this summer, moderate Eric Adams defeated Maya Wiley, a liberal favorite, to claim the Democratic nomination for mayor. In a Louisiana House special election in April, Troy Carter defeated Karen Carter Peterson in a contest that CNN cast as a \u201cgauge of the direction of the party more than three months into Biden\u2019s tenure, with voters in the largely Black congressional district choosing between two divergent approaches to politics.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That\u2019s not to say that liberals haven\u2019t had their moments. The sit-in at the US Capitol steps organized by Missouri Rep. Cori Bush to protest the failure of the White House to extend the eviction moratorium quite clearly played a role in the Biden administration\u2019s reversal on the policy earlier this week. And the likes of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez remain hugely prominent voices within the party. But there\u2019s no question that this year has exposed the limitations of the activist left \u2013 in and out of Congress. And as Jeffries\u2019 comments make clear, the Democratic leadership is fed up with having to hear from the Twitter left about how everything they are doing isn\u2019t good enough. While Jeffries is the latest member of House Democratic leadership to poke holes in the supposed influence of the liberal left wing, he\u2019s not the first. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made little secret of her skepticism of the electoral and legislative chops of the most prominent liberal group in Congress \u2013 known as \u201cThe Squad.\u201d (\u201cThe Squad\u201d has emerged as a high-profile group of young women of color in Congress that includes Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.) \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Pelosi told The New York Times\u2019 Maureen Dowd in 2019 of \u201cThe Squad.\u201d \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d (Pelosi was referring to a House backed border-funding bill.) A few months before that, Pelosi had offered a similarly dismissive message about the liberal left in Congress. \u201cWhile there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what\u2019s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,\u201d Pelosi said. And a few months before that, Pelosi said this when asked about the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which had been pushed hard by Ocasio-Cortez: \u201cIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they\u2019re for it, right?\u201d So, yeah. Some of this is just normal human stuff. Pelosi and Jeffries are in leadership positions and are tasked with trying to manage the entire Democratic caucus \u2013 from its most liberal end to its most conservative. Liberals like AOC don\u2019t have to do that \u2013 they are free to push for their preferred solutions without any real concern for what the most conservative members among House Democrats think about it. But the obvious emotion \u2013 as evidenced by that Jeffries quote \u2013 suggests that there is more here than just the usual tensions that exist between leaders and the rank-and-file. And since the Twitter left is a perpetual outrage machine, it\u2019s hard to imagine that they will take the attacks by the likes of Jeffries without some significant reaction. The battle highlights the reality that even with Democrats in charge of the White House, House and Senate, things are not all kumbaya for the majority party. Not even close.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 warning this week of a \u201cFaucian distopia\u201d offered the latest glimpse at how ambitious Republicans eyeing 2024 presidential bids are increasingly targeting public health officials as they attempt to grow their national brands in front of conservative audiences. \u201cIt is very important that we say unequivocally no to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,\u201d DeSantis told the crowd at a conservative state policy conference in Utah on Wednesday. The approaches by DeSantis and other potential GOP 2024 contenders frequently mirror former President Donald Trump\u2019s downplaying of the pandemic and right-wing television networks \u2013 poised to play a central role in the next GOP presidential primary race \u2013 that have criticized Dr. Anthony Fauci, opposed government mandates and raised questions about the effectiveness of vaccines. Ahead of his 2022 gubernatorial re-election \u2013 and a potential presidential run in 2024 \u2013 DeSantis is using Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease official, as a political punching bag, touting his opposition to Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His comments followed the CDC issuing stricter mask-wearing guidelines as the more contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 ravages parts of the United States and President Joe Biden adopting a tougher approach to urging Americans to get vaccinated. \u201cPeople are dying, and will die, who don\u2019t have to die,\u201d Biden said in a Thursday speech. Florida reported on Wednesday its fourth-highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began, with 17,589 new cases. It is one of the 32 states to see an average number of new cases over the last seven days increase by more than 50% from the week before, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. But it is one of only two states in which every county in the state is listed as having high Covid-19 transmission. In a Wednesday fundraising email, DeSantis said Fauci should be fired. \u201cThe corporate media is Fauci\u2019s Praetorian Guard, and they are attacking me because I\u2019ve been willing to hold Fauci accountable,\u201d DeSantis said. The political team of the Florida governor, who is up for re-election next year, sent another fundraising email lambasting Fauci on Thursday. \u201cThe Left\u2019s beloved unelected bureaucratic leader, Dr. Fauci, who assured us that vaccinated individuals no longer needed to wear masks, is now recommending vaccinated adults wear masks\u2026 again,\u201d the email said. \u201cFauci also wants to force 3-year-old kids to wear masks indefinitely.\u201d And on Friday, DeSantis said at a press conference that he will sign an executive order barring schools from requiring students to wear masks \u2013 a move that followed Broward County Public Schools opting to make masks mandatory. He also said his three young children don\u2019t wear masks. \u201cMy wife and I are not going to do the mask with the kids. We never have, we won\u2019t. I want to see my kids smiling. I want them having fun,\u201d he said. DeSantis and other potential Republican 2024 presidential contenders have begun competing over who has most proudly ignored federal public health officials\u2019 recommendations and condemned those officials and agencies. \u201cHas there ever been an institution in American public life that has more discredited itself more rapidly than the CDC?\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on the Senate floor this week. The headline on a fundraising email Friday from Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul: \u201cFauci\u2019s lies are criminal.\u201d The race to resist mask mandates, business closures and more is already playing out as the party\u2019s shadow presidential race \u2013 one that might only burst into full view if Trump decides not to run again in 2024 \u2013 begins to develop in early-voting primary states and at conferences with party activists. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has used early trips to Iowa and to conservative political gatherings to take implicit jabs at DeSantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other Republicans who mandated masks and closed some businesses during the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn\u2019t shut down their states; that they didn\u2019t close their regions; that they didn\u2019t mandate masks,\u201d Noem said at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering in Dallas last month. \u201cNow I\u2019m not picking fights with Republican governors. All I\u2019m saying is that we need leaders with grit. That their first instinct is the right instinct.\u201d She bragged that South Dakota hadn\u2019t ordered a \u201csingle business\u201d to close. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mandate. We trusted our people and it told them that personal responsibility was the best answer,\u201d Noem said. South Dakota has seen an increase in Covid-19 cases but isn\u2019t seeing the dramatic spike that other states \u2013 particularly across the south \u2013 have seen in recent weeks. Abbott, in Texas, on Thursday signed an order prohibited vaccination requirements or mask mandates \u2013 a step that also prohibited local governments from implementing their own policies. Texas, which is seeing a dramatic spike in Covid-19 cases, has reported an average of more than 7,700 new cases per day over the last week. Hospitals there are bracing for a surge in Covid-19 patients, and an analysis of data from the Texas Department of State Health Services shows that 99% of the people who died in Texas since February because of coronavirus were unvaccinated. Abbott also identified a new scapegoat for the surge of Covid-19 cases in Texas: Migrants. He signed an executive order instructing state troopers to stop any vehicle if there is \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that it is transporting certain migrants who illegally crossed the US-Mexico border and were released from the custody of US Customs and Border Protection. If the state officials confirm that migrants being transported fit that category, the agency then must reroute the vehicle to its point of origin, according to the order. The order also gives state troopers the authority to impound vehicles being used to transport the migrants in question. \u201cThe dramatic rise in unlawful border crossings has also led to a dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases among unlawful migrants who have made their way into our state, and we must do more to protect Texans from this virus and reduce the burden on our communities,\u201d Abbott said in a statement about the order Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Sen. James Lankford stood on the Senate floor in the afternoon of January 6, explaining why he opposed certifying Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory. He said that there was a \u201cconstitutional crisis in our country\u201d not because many Republicans rejected the election\u2019s verdict, but because \u201cmillions of Americans are being told to sit down and shut up.\u201d A couple minutes later, a staffer interrupted the Oklahoma Republican\u2019s speech, and urged every senator to evacuate. That night, after a pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol, attacked police officers and forced its representatives to seek shelter, Lankford changed his position, voting to certify the 2020 election, and announced that the Senate would work \u201cto set a peaceful example.\u201d But instead of salving the wounds of a violent riot, Lankford\u2019s vote has only opened them in Oklahoma. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters are now considering supporting Lankford\u2019s Republican challenger \u2014 29-year-old pastor Jackson Lahmeyer \u2014 even though Trump himself hasn\u2019t yet endorsed anyone, while the state\u2019s Democrats continue to criticize the senator for opposing certification in the first place. Facing a backlash from the left and from some on the pro-Trump right, Lankford acknowledged in an interview that Biden is president but questioned whether his victory was valid. \u201cBiden is the constitutional President. No question about that,\u201d Lankford told CNN. \u201cAre there questions that are still hanging out there? Yes.\u201d When asked if those questions would\u2019ve changed the outcome of the 2020 race, Lankford replied, \u201cThere is no way to know because we can\u2019t get a full answer to some of them.\u201d \u201cI am not trying to be coy about it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s unknown at this point. I just want all the questions answered so people can know one way or the other on it.\u201d Biden defeated former President Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College. There were numerous recounts reiterating the outcome. Trump\u2019s legal team and his supporters failed in dozens of contests in court. Yet Trump\u2019s lie that the election was \u201cstolen\u201d has convinced a majority of Republicans, shaping the future of the GOP and creating a litmus test in the US Senate race in Oklahoma. In recent weeks, state party chairman John Bennett endorsed Lahmeyer, a decision that Lankford acknowledged was an \u201cunheard of\u201d break from a top party official who should be loyal, or at least neutral, to an incumbent senator. And on July 17, Lankford narrowly defeated a measure by members of the Oklahoma Republican Party to censure him in a reported 93 to 122 vote. The nonbinding resolution also called for him to resign. In an interview with CNN, Lahmeyer is claiming the \u201cmomentum\u201d on the race, building a Senate campaign out of a simple falsehood. \u201cI know Donald Trump won the 2020 election,\u201d Lahmeyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try to actually say, \u2018Joe Biden got 80 million votes\u2019? Nobody honestly believes that.\u201d Lankford is still the clear frontrunner. The incumbent voted with Trump nearly 90% of the time. He boasts the endorsements of the state\u2019s governor, lieutenant governor and almost all of Oklahoma\u2019s members in Congress. He has a campaign war chest with almost $1.5 million more on hand than Lahmeyer and the backing of the Senate\u2019s campaign arm. Lahmeyer is a political newcomer boasting the support of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who received from the former president a pardon after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI. But after Lankford\u2019s vote to certify the election, some Oklahoma Republican activists who believe Trump won have come out against the senator. Kyle Brown, the GOP chairman for Logan County north of Oklahoma City, said he supported Lahmeyer even though it\u2019s an \u201cuphill battle,\u201d blasting Lankford\u2019s \u201cinability to take a stand for anything.\u201d Brown said the pastor has a path to victory \u201cif people still remember and stay disgruntled.\u201d In the past couple of months, Lankford has taken steps to assuage his critics. In January, Lankford apologized to the Black community in Oklahoma, observing the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, for initially opposing the certification of the election. Leaders of the Black community claimed he would disenfranchise Black voters in battleground states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan. And in May, Lankford stepped down from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission. But neither the pro-Trump right nor the Democrats seem appeased. Lahmeyer told CNN it was a \u201cracist commission\u201d that Lankford should never have been on in the first place; Oklahoma Democratic party chair Alicia Andrews found his apology letter \u201ccringy, disgusting and tone deaf.\u201d In July, Lankford announced his opposition to Biden nominees in protest of Biden not continuing to build Trump\u2019s wall on the US-Mexico border and called for a boycott of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream after the company pulled its products out of the West Bank. Lankford proposed an amendment replacing one federal holiday \u2014 Columbus Day \u2014 with Juneteenth to save taxpayer money, and then withdrew it amid criticism. In an interview, Lankford said that he has \u201ca lot of support\u201d and said that it\u2019s up to voters, not the state party, to determine the litmus test for conservatism. He argued that some people back home have gone too far in emulating Trump but declined to say whether he sought the former President\u2019s endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. I do find some people saying they\u2019re trying to out Trump Trump,\u201d Lankford told CNN. \u201cSome people have a belief that conservatism is about who\u2019s angriest and who\u2019s loudest. I don\u2019t think that actually wins the day; it\u2019s a set of ideas that actually wins the day.\u201d While many Republicans have paid Trump a visit to earn his endorsement or try and win his support, Lankford hasn\u2019t made such a pilgrimage to Trump\u2019s homes in Florida or New Jersey. Asked if he wanted Trump\u2019s support, Lankford treated it as no more weighty than any of the other GOP endorsements he\u2019d received. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll add as many as I can.\u201d The former President is now using the second impeachment trial as the ultimate loyalty test. He has pledged to campaign in 2022 against 11 Republicans: the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him on the charge \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted to convict him. But even some Republicans like Lankford, who voted to acquit Trump, have drawn primary opponents even more devoted to the former President. Trump has endorsed North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd and Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, two Republicans who led the charge in Congress to overturn the election, for Senate, even though a former governor, Congressman, ambassador and business leader are running against them. The low-key Arkansas Sen. John Boozman is facing GOP challengers after saying that Trump bears \u201csome responsibility\u201d for January 6 \u2014 in his statement explaining his vote to acquit. Lankford likewise said he acquitted Trump because the Senate can\u2019t remove someone from office who\u2019s already gone, although convicting Trump would\u2019ve also disqualified from holding future office as well. That vote likely prevented some political fallout in Oklahoma, where Trump won all 77 counties, beating Biden by 33 points. In 2020, Trump did better in only Wyoming and West Virginia. The split within the state GOP over January 6 was reflected by the state\u2019s congressional delegation. All five of Oklahoma\u2019s House members voted against certifying the election. But Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe voted with Lankford for it, defending it as \u201cthe constitutional vote.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone who has voted [further to the] right than I have in terms of conservative votes,\u201d Inhofe said. \u201cThere is no reason to have a test that is predicated on one particular issue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Texas state Rep. Jake Ellzey will win the special election runoff in Texas\u2019 6th Congressional District, CNN projects \u2013 without the endorsement of Donald Trump. The Republican overcame the former President\u2019s backing of his opponent, Republican Susan Wright, to claim victory. Wright is the widow of the late Rep. Ron Wright, who had cancer and died in February after contracting Covid-19. Trump endorsed Susan Wright shortly before the first round of voting, which ended with none of the 23 candidates securing a winning majority, then doubled down ahead of her one-on-one race with Ellzey. He recorded a robocall for Wright in the final days of the campaign and his super PAC, Make America Great Again Action, made a late $100,000 ad buy. But Ellzey outraised Wright by a 2-to-1 margin among smaller dollar donors and collected the support of a number of high profile Texas conservatives, including a pair with close ties to Trump: former Gov. Rick Perry, the former President\u2019s first Energy secretary, and Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who defended Ellzey against a barrage of attacks from the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group, and testified to his allegiance to Trump. Despite his inability to boost Wright into Congress, the results were not a full rebuke of Trump, who remains popular in the state. But the result showed the limits of his influence \u2013 at least at the ballot box. On the trail, both candidates embraced his political agenda and there was little daylight between them on the policy front. The dividing lines, ultimately, formed around endorsements and alliances. Trump narrowly won the district in 2020, an increasingly competive one in North Texas that includes Ellis, Navarro and parts of Tarrant counties. His margin of victory diminished from 2016 and was down from former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s four years earlier. Ellzey, a former Navy fighter pilot, also actively sought the support of Trump\u2019s supporters. He released a video titled \u201cTrump Supporters Love Jake Ellzey\u201d and attended Trump\u2019s and Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s border visit last month. The race came down to the pair of Republicans after none of the more than 20 candidates in the May 1 election won an outright majority. Ellzey edged out Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez for his place in the Tuesday run-off by fewer than 400 votes, guaranteeing that the balance of power in the House, where Democrats hold a razor-thin majority, would not change. Ellzey\u2019s victory comes on his second attempt to win the seat. He previously ran in 2018 but lost the GOP primary to Ron Wright.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris is making voting rights her top public focus, elevating a long-shot battle as she seeks to more clearly define her role and stake out high-value territory within the Biden administration. A little more than six months into her time in office, Harris is also hiring new staff to replace those who announced their departures earlier this summer. One source says they\u2019re even considering additions to her communications team, citing heightened interest in her vice presidency, which at times has seen some missteps and intense scrutiny. The vice president\u2019s carefully crafted push to put voting rights center stage in the past two weeks includes speeches, meetings with activists and local leaders across the country, and calls to lawmakers on Capitol Hill to find a way forward on the issue even as legislation remains at a standstill. \u201cIt\u2019s given people something to really sort of focus on, that is so important to the country, and so foundational to what all of those in her office believe is critically important,\u201d said a source familiar with the dynamics in Harris\u2019 office, who contended that her team would have taken on the issue regardless. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way for them to sort of turn the page and really begin to potentially create some better dynamics within the office.\u201d But the assignment also presents another political challenge for Harris as voting rights legislation currently has little hope of advancing on Capitol Hill. The question now is whether Harris can build confidence in her ability to lead one of the administration\u2019s top priorities, an issue that has no quick solution but could galvanize Democratic activists across the country ahead of the 2022 midterm campaign. \u201cThe fact that we are continuing to have conversations, that the issue of voting rights is so present and prevalent in the media, is a direct result of the work that just the administration has been doing to elevate that issue,\u201d said Symone Sanders, Harris\u2019 chief spokesperson and senior adviser, told reporters this week. The vice president\u2019s role as the administration\u2019s lead on voting rights was formalized in early June when President Joe Biden publicly tasked her with the assignment, one that officials say she asked for. But as she jumpstarted that process, other issues came into the spotlight. 'Complaints are pretty widespread': Axios editor on VP office infighting Days after her assignment was announced, Harris made her first foreign trip to focus on another politically sensitive task \u2013 her diplomatic work to stem the flow of migrants from the Northern Triangle. While traveling in Guatemala, Harris fumbled through an answer about traveling to the US-Mexico border, a moment that left some White House officials perplexed over her response to a predictable question. Just a few weeks later, the dynamics in Harris\u2019 office were put under the microscope as anonymous allegations of dysfunction and tension spilled into public view. The White House jumped into damage control mode to defend the vice president and her chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, in an attempt to keep a drama-filled narrative from taking hold. But Harris is now pushing ahead and has been engaged in a weeks-long push to put the fight to protect voting rights front and center with a senior administration official calling it a \u201cfront burner issue\u201d at a time when Republicans across the country seek to enact restrictive voting laws. As of July 14, 18 states have enacted 30 laws that restrict voting access in some capacity, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law. The vice president has approached voting rights similarly to how she tackled diplomacy with the Northern Triangle nations after receiving that assignment: Talking to as many people as she can as often as possible. On Wednesday, Harris held a listening session with poll workers and election officials at the White House, lauding them for \u201cupholding some of the most important tenets of our democracy.\u201d Officials said the meeting gave the vice president a chance to hear the challenges the workers have faced and express solidarity with a group that experienced some threats in the wake of the 2020 election, many of which Harris said came from people who were \u201cunhappy with the outcome of the election.\u201d Harris draws criticism from all sides during her first foreign trip When Texas Democrats fled the state to block Republican changes to voting laws, Harris was the one dispatched to express the administration\u2019s support, though later multiple lawmakers that met with Harris tested positive for Covid-19. Her office said on Saturday she was \u201cnot at risk of exposure\u201d and it was later reported she tested negative. \u201cI specifically asked her, you know, should we even be here right now? Are we making a difference? And you know, it was an emphatic, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d said Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, who was among the Texas Democrats to meet with Harris in the nation\u2019s capital. And last week, the vice president traveled to Michigan to meet with state and local officials, following past trips to states like Georgia and South Carolina to hear from officials on the ground about efforts to protect the right to vote. She has also hosted disability advocates at the White House and convened a group of Black female leaders to discuss voting rights in the Roosevelt Room with Cedric Richmond, the director of the White House\u2019s Office of Public Engagement, and other administration officials. Harris has also spoken about the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a visit at the Naval Observatory last week and has done a high-profile event with the Democratic National Committee, unveiling new voting-focused investments. The full-court press reflects the public and private emphasis Harris is taking on with this issue with a senior administration official describing it as a nearly \u201c24/7\u201d focus on the issue. \u201cI think what was conveyed in the meeting is that she absolutely understands the gravity of the moment. I think that she understands the fight, what we\u2019re up against. And why this is an urgent moment, I do,\u201d said Latosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, who participated in the Black women leaders voting meeting. \u201cBut we also recognize that she\u2019s the vice president, that the administrative priorities are not set by her. That\u2019s just the truth.\u201d Harris\u2019 office says the initial strategy revealed in June of building coalitions of Americans concerned about the right to vote, educating Americans on the perils of state legislatures passing more restrictive voting laws and collaborating with Congress is still ongoing \u2013 despite the path to legislative success narrowing. In public, Harris has leaned heavily on that \u201cbuilding coalitions\u201d aspect of the strategy, another move used in her diplomatic efforts. \u201cThe convening power is important because part of convening is the way that you raise the awareness among Americans who may not be aware what is happening and bringing groups together so we can have a unified strategy as well as a whole of government strategy,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist and CNN commentator who participated in the meeting with Black women leaders. Those in that meeting said Harris detailed what her office was currently doing to further protect voting rights, but also solicited suggestions from the women present on what more they believed her office should do to \u201chelp elevate and keep this issue in the forefront.\u201d Fight for voting rights intensifies as the nation marks one year since civil rights icon John Lewis' death One suggestion, a source told CNN, that Harris seemed particularly interested in was a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach that would require every federal agency to create an task-force that would focus on how voting rights and restrictive new laws passed impacted their agency, similar to the inter-agency approach former President Barack Obama set-up for the Affordable Care Act and former President Bill Clinton created for \u201cY2K.\u201d Harris played a similar role in her meeting with Texas state House Democrats last week, receiving an update from the lawmakers about their efforts in Washington and on the state level and stressing the administration won\u2019t back down from the voting rights fight. \u201cI know that she gets it at a personal level, like a lot of us do, who for whom our communities are Latino, Black communities feel attacked with voter suppression legislation or anti voter legislation. So I think she\u2019s a critical player in this,\u201d said Texas state Rep. Gina Hinojosa. Her recent push has coincided with the anniversary of John Lewis\u2019 passing, which the vice president used to issue a symbolic call to action to pass voting rights legislation even as Republicans have shown little appetite towards moving those bills forward. Harris\u2019 congressional outreach has included conversations with Republican lawmakers, a White House official said, though her team has declined to provide names. In an interview with CBS this week, Harris said she spoke about voting rights with Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska about voting rights, but an aide later clarified the two women had discussed infrastructure. A spokesperson for Murkowski also said their recent conversations have focused on infrastructure. Harris hosts female senators for 'evening of relationship building' at vice president's residence Last month, Harris presided over the upper chamber when Senate Republicans blocked a vote to open debate on the \u201cFor The People Act,\u201d a key Democrat-led voting and elections bill. Since that vote, the vice president has remained engaged with lawmakers to find other ways forward, officials said, though she and the White House have not gone as far as embracing calls from civil rights leaders, activists and progressives to gut the filibuster, arguing it is a decision left up to the Senate. In a CNN town hall Wednesday, Biden condemned efforts to curb voting rights on the state level, calling the Republican attempts, \u201cJim Crow on steroids.\u201d But the President did not budge on his position on the filibuster, warning its unraveling would \u201cthrow the entire Congress into chaos.\u201d The filibuster topic was broached near the end of Harris\u2019 meeting with Black women at the White House on Friday, one source said, adding the vice president did not weigh in on the future of the rule. The source said when the matter was raised, a group of White House counsel aides who attended stood up and left, causing one attendee to say, \u201cWell, there go the lawyers!\u201d A senior administration official later told CNN the lawyers\u2019 departure was coincidental and not tied to the discussion of the filibuster. Richmond told the attendees that a host of Senate Democrats don\u2019t want to end the filibuster, and the White House would continue to work the phones to find a solution in addition to other efforts.   Allies of Harris, who have been critical of the White House\u2019s resistance to call for more drastic changes to the filibuster, say change can\u2019t be made without Biden or the White House at large putting their full weight behind the effort. \u201c(Biden) has not sent the message yet, that I am willing to protect your right to vote at all costs,\u201d Brown told CNN. Referencing Biden\u2019s pledges to sign voting rights bills, Brown added, \u201cThe fact of [Biden] signing is not the question. The question is: will he leverage his power to get in the position to get to his desk?\u201d Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, agreed both the vice president and President should leverage their relationships to push senators to act. \u201cThis is not something that we\u2019re going to be able to organize ourselves out of. This is squarely the responsibility of the US senators to address. Her role as a former member of that body is to use all of her relationships and her knowledge to get us to a majority of the votes to protect the rights of voters,\u201d Johnson said. He added, \u201cThat\u2019s the same thing for the President, that the two of them, we are asking in this moment, to use their relationship, their skill, their knowledge of the Senate to get a solution.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s an old saying that goes something like this: You can judge a man by the company he keeps. Which spells trouble for Donald Trump. At least 11 people who played a role in Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns or his administration have been charged with crimes, with Tom Barrack, who chaired Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and has been a longtime friend, accused of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday. Below, a list of everyone in Trump\u2019s orbit over these past five years who has run afoul of the law over these past 5 years. (They\u2019re listed in alphabetical order by last name.) 1. Steve Bannon: Trump\u2019s political Svengali was charged with fraud in August 2020 for a fundraising scam tied to raising dollars to build Trump\u2019s much bally-hooed border wall. The allegation, which Bannon has denied, was that he and others involved in the We Build The Wall group used money raised to pay for lavish personal expenses. 2. Tom Barrack: Barrack was charged on seven counts on Tuesday. The allegations, according to the indictment, center on the idea that Barrack used his closeness to Trump to \u201cadvance the interests of and provide intelligence to the UAE while simultaneously failing to notify the Attorney General that their actions were taken at the direction of senior UAE officials.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, Barrack asked UAE officials to provide him with a \u201cwish list\u201d they hoped for from the administration over the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cThe defendant is charged with acting under the direction or control of the most senior leaders of the U.A.E. over a course of years,\u201d wrote the prosecutors of Barrack. 3. Elliott Broidy: Broidy, a top fundraiser for Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, pleaded guilty in October 2020 to conducted a secret lobbying campaign in exchange for millions of dollars. As CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell wrote at the time of his Broidy\u2019s guilty plea: \u201cBroidy was charged earlier this month with conspiracy for failing to register and disclose his role in a lobbying effort aimed at stopping a criminal investigation into massive fraud at a Malaysian investment fund and advocating for the removal of a Chinese billionaire living in the US.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 4. Michael Cohen: The one-time fixer for Trump, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for a series of crimes, most notably secret hush-money payments made during the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign to two women alleging affairs with Trump.  The sentencing judge said that Cohen had pleaded guilty to \u201ca veritable smorgasbord\u201d of crimes. Cohen turned informant on Trump and, in sworn testimony in front of Congress in 2019, Cohen called Trump \u201ca racist,\u201d \u201ca conman\u201d and \u201ca cheat\u201d \u2013 and insisted that the president was fully aware of the hush-money payments. 5. Michael Flynn: Flynn spent a brief stint as Trump\u2019s national security adviser before being forced to resign after he failed to disclose the depth and breadth of his contacts with Russian officials during the transition. Later that year, Flynn admitted that he had lied to the FBI about his contact with Russia and had also done work for Turkey as an unauthorized lobbyist. In early 2020, Flynn and his legal team sought to have his conviction overturned. That effort was rendered moot when Trump pardoned him in November 2020. 6. Rick Gates: Gates, deputy to the campaign chairman of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Paul Manafort in concealing $75 million in foreign bank accounts. Gates turned informant for the government as part of the broader probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and was sentenced to 45 days in jail. 7. Paul Manafort: Trump\u2019s campaign manager for part of the 2016 presidential campaign, Manafort pleaded guilty in 2018 to on count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice due to attempts to tamper with witnesses \u2013 and agreed to cooperate with the ongoing Russia probe. Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison in 2019. Trump pardoned Manafort, who wound up serving just under two years in prison, in the final weeks of his presidency. 8. George Nader: An informal foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Nader cooperated heavily with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In early 2020, he pleaded guilty to two counts of sex crimes involving minors. 9. George Papadopoulos: Papadopoulos, a relatively junior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign, was sentenced to 12 days in prison for lying to investigators about his contacts with individuals tied to Russia. Papadopoulos was defiant about his innocence; \u201cThe truth will all be out,\u201d he tweeted the night before reporting to prison. \u201cNot even a prison sentence can stop that momentum.\u201d Trump pardoned Papadopoulos in December 2020. 10. Roger Stone: Stone spent years advising Trump although he was only formally affiliated with the 2016 campaign very briefly. He was convicted in November 2019 for lying to Congress and threatening a witness regarding his efforts for Trump\u2019s campaign. According to the judge, Stone\u2019s actions \u201cled to an inaccurate, incorrect and incomplete report\u201d from the House on Russia, WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. Stone, and stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before, was pardoned by Trump in December 2020. 11. Allen Weisselberg: Earlier this month, the longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization was charged with tax crimes tied to perks he was given in lieu of salary. \u201cAll told, the indictment alleged, Weisselberg evaded taxes on $1.76 million in income over a period beginning in 2005 and concealed for years that he was a resident of New York City, thereby avoiding paying city income taxes,\u201d wrote CNN\u201ds Erica Orden, Kara Scannell and Sonia Moghe. Weisselberg pleaded not guilty. The Trump Organization, which was also indicted and has pleaded not guilty, called the Weisselberg a \u201cpawn in a scorched-earth attempt to harm the former president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans on the House\u2019s new investigative committee are gearing up for a protracted clash with Democrats over former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 attack, with the GOP looking to turn the focus into the Capitol\u2019s lack of preparedness, Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s actions and political violence more broadly in the US. The planning is still in its nascent stages after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy spent weeks methodically selecting GOP members he believes would be best equipped to deliver the Republican counterpoint to the probe. But Republican sources and lawmakers involved in the investigation made clear that they will attempt to push the investigation into areas that Democrats may be unwilling to go. \u201cThere\u2019s one fundamental question that I hope Democrats will actually answer and address and that is why wasn\u2019t there a proper security presence that day?\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio who helped the lead the effort in Congress to try to overturn the electoral results. \u201cAnd frankly, only the speaker can answer that question so let\u2019s see if the Democrats bring that up.\u201d Democrats say that the GOP is already trying to muddy the waters to focus on Pelosi, contending she\u2019s not directly in charge of the Capitol\u2019s security posture, while taking attention away from Trump\u2019s months-long effort to overturn the election, lie about the results and rile up his supporters at the January 6 rally before the deadly riot. \u201cWell, if you look at the charge that we have in the resolution, it says the facts and circumstances around January 6. I don\u2019t see the speaker being part and parcel to that,\u201d Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country, and people can say what they want. As to whether or not it has a place in this committee remains to be seen.\u201d Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to Pelosi, responded to the GOP angle of attack, by saying, \u201cYou know your strategy is desperate when even Ron Johnson has given up on it,\u201d a reference to Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has made significant efforts to downplay and rewrite the events of January 6. \u201cOn January 6th, the Speaker, a target of an assassination attempt that day, was no more in charge of Capitol security than Mitch McConnell was,\u201d Hammill said in a statement. \u201cThis is a clear attempt to whitewash what happened on January 6th and divert blame.\u201d While Pelosi has the power to veto the picks, and has not said what she will do, the newly named Republicans are expected to hold a strategy session either this weekend or on Monday in order to gear up for the committee\u2019s first hearing next week with police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, according to multiple GOP sources. And the GOP may lean heavily on Rep. Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas and one of McCarthy\u2019s committee picks who is a former sheriff and military officer, as they start to craft their line of questioning and try to avoid being seen as bashing or dismissive of law enforcement. Democrats, too, are beginning to craft their own plans for next week\u2019s hearing with police officers, some of whom are expected to raise concerns about the efforts by some Republicans to rewrite the events of that day. In private, Democrats have met in Pelosi\u2019s office with a top investigator who led the charge in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, Daniel Goldman, to help prepare for the hearing, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have very serious parliamentary order within the committee,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the Democratic lead impeachment manager in Trump\u2019s second impeachment and a member of the panel. \u201cObviously when we go around, people are going to be able to say what they want to say during their five minutes. But we cannot tolerate constant interruption and derailment of the purposes of the committee.\u201d Kevin McCarthy's trip shows House Republicans see the path back to power is with Donald Trump Privately, Democrats are in the throes of prep now with staff holding closed-door sessions and Zoom calls with key officers Tuesday ahead of the hearing. Members say they are spending considerable time reading prior testimony and interviews with their witnesses and others. They also say they are spending time reading indictments to familiarize themselves with more details about the alleged events that occurred in the Capitol on January 6. \u201cYou read a lot,\u201d Rep. Peter Aguilar, a Democrat from California, told CNN about his prep. McCarthy settled on a collection of members he viewed as emblematic of his conference, but which include three members who voted to throw out the results of the election in Arizona and Pennsylvania and two who voted to certify Biden\u2019s win. Pelosi told CNN on Tuesday that a vote to certify the election is \u201cnot a criterion\u201d for serving on the panel, simply saying she is \u201cconsidering\u201d McCarthy\u2019s \u201cproposals.\u201d \u201cThey have a diverse caucus,\u201d said Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Democrat selected by Pelosi to serve on the panel. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of hard to avoid characters \u2013 given the diversity in the caucus.\u201d Within hours of McCarthy making his picks public Monday evening, Republicans made clear how they viewed the panel. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Rep. Jim Banks, the Indiana Republican whom the GOP leader selected as the ranking member on the select committee. \u201cNancy Pelosi created this committee solely to malign conservatives and justify the left\u2019s authoritarian agenda.\u201d Banks added: \u201cI will not allow this committee to be turned into a forum for condemning millions of Americans because of their political beliefs.\u201d While most Republicans applauded McCarthy for his selections, GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois praised the selection of fellow Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis, but not some of the others. \u201cObviously, Jim Jordan wouldn\u2019t have been my pick, but I hope as long as they do mature work to get to the bottom that\u2019ll be good,\u201d said Kinzinger, who has emerged as a chief Trump critic. Asked about Jordan, Kinzinger added: \u201cWell I mean I think he\u2019s made it clear that he has a preconceived notion of the outcome. And so if he\u2019s going to go into this, this process with a preconceived notion of the outcome, well, that\u2019s bad.\u201d How the Capitol Police's intel about potential violence on January 6 didn't get shared Sources familiar with the prep tell CNN that Republicans are ready to play defense in upcoming weeks, but are also looking for opportunities to chip away at what they view as the Democratic narrative that Trump actively encouraged his followers to challenge the election results violently on January 6  and that he was solely responsible. \u201cWe all know that this is just about going after Donald Trump,\u201d Jordan said Tuesday. \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want to talk about anything else. They gotta talk about this. They don\u2019t want to talk about the crime that is going up in every major urban area, they don\u2019t want to talk about the crises on the border, they don\u2019t want to talk about the fact that the price of everything is up.\u201d On Pelosi\u2019s role, an aide familiar with the planning told CNN, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what role she played. It is legitimate to ask.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to imply there was something nefarious \u2026 but I think there were questions to be answered.\u201d Democratic and Republican lawmakers say they are now in the process of interviewing and hiring staff, with the Democrats planning to name a staff director in the coming days. Thompson said they are reviewing three finalists for the job. Republicans, however, can\u2019t proceed with hiring any staff until Pelosi formally approves McCarthy\u2019s selections for the probe. Throughout the process, Democrats have sought to downplay their probe as potentially unleashing a political circus and many said that remained the goal of the first hearing. \u201cMy feeling is I am going to start with trusting those people there to be driven by following the facts until they prove me otherwise,\u201d Aguilar said. Another key element of the GOP\u2019s attack plan will be to highlight political violence on the left, including last summer\u2019s protests in response to police brutality. That was a point of contention during negotiations on a proposed bipartisan commission to probe the insurrection, with Republicans demanding that any independent body include that subject area in its scope. \u201cThe Democrats in the summer of 2020 normalized anarchy, they normalized rioting and looting,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s an important element that we\u2019ll have to point out.\u201d But where the investigation goes from here remains to be seen. Democrats have made no secret that they may seek to interview some of Trump\u2019s defenders who talked with him about the effort to overturn the electoral results. And that could include Jordan. \u201cIf they call me, I got nothing to hide,\u201d Jordan said Tuesday, indicating he\u2019d be willing to talk about his conversations. GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, the Alabama freshman who fielded a brief call from Trump while the insurrection was taking place, told CNN he\u2019d be willing to speak with House investigators. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll call me,\u201d Tuberville said Tuesday. \u2018It\u2019s not a secret,\u201d he said of his call with Trump. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles, Morgan Rimmer, Whitney Wild and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Friday, assailing President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for unleashing \u201ca tidal wave of left-wing policies that threaten to wipe out all the progress that we made\u201d in speeches that could preview his potential 2024 message. The trip to the first presidential nominating state offered a window into how Pence is attempting to craft a political future outside the shadow of former President Donald Trump. Despite four years of loyalty, Pence has drawn the ire of the GOP\u2019s pro-Trump base over his refusal to heed Trump\u2019s wishes and attempt \u2013 without any legal mechanism to do so \u2013 to thwart the counting of some states\u2019 electoral votes on January 6. But in front of friendly audiences, he received warm receptions as he dipped his toes into the early-state campaign waters \u2013 flipping burgers in Sioux Center and drawing cheers from a socially conservative crowd that included longtime allies in Des Moines. Pence insisted that the agenda he and Trump had campaigned on in 2020 is a winning one, pointing to GOP gains in the House. But he largely left Trump out of it, omitting the frequent credits to the former President that had filled his speeches during his four years as vice president. He made no mention of their relationship since departing Washington. He did, though, include a reference to the January 6 riot that followed Trump\u2019s speech riling up supporters who wanted Pence to throw out some states\u2019 electoral votes \u2013 and, after Pence had refused, marched on the Capitol, chanting, \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d \u201cTruth is, we\u2019ve been through a lot in the last year, a global pandemic, civil unrest, a divisive election, a tragic day in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Pence said. In Des Moines, he criticized Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, complaining of \u201cthe damage they\u2019ve done in such a short period of time.\u201d \u201cI came here today to say, after 177 days of open borders, higher taxes, runaway spending, defunding the police, abortion on demand, censoring free speech, canceling our most cherished liberties, I\u2019ve had enough. And the time has come \u2026 to stand up and fight back against the agenda of the radical left,\u201d Pence said. The earliest stages of the 2024 Republican presidential primary are unfolding with the party\u2019s biggest question of all \u2013 whether Trump will run again \u2013 looming large. Trump recently resumed holding campaign-style rallies that he is using to settle intraparty scores. He has endorsed Republicans in 2022 primaries. And he has teased another presidential run, telling the right-wing propaganda network Newsmax in June that he will be \u201cmaking an announcement in the not too distant future.\u201d If he does not run again, though, Republicans would begin with a wide-open field \u2013 a prospect that has led the party\u2019s most ambitious figures to begin traveling to early-voting states, making connections with activists, potential staffers and GOP officials, a year and a half before the 2022 midterm elections. In his speech, Pence accused Biden of overseeing an \u201cexplosion in runaway spending,\u201d pointing to budget talks in Washington. He criticized the Biden administration for ending construction of Trump\u2019s border wall. And he accused the administration of replacing \u201cpatriotic education\u201d with \u201cindoctrination\u201d focused on race \u2013 while offering a misleading explanation of critical race theory. \u201cCritical race theory teaches children as young as kindergarten to be ashamed of their skin. Critical race theory is state-sanctioned racism, pure and simple, and it should be opposed by every American, every day,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s far past time to discard the left-wing reflex to find systemic racism in every institution in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica is not a racist country. America is the most just, noble and inclusive nation ever to exist on the face of the earth.\u201d Along with Pence, two other potential 2024 contenders were on hand for the Family Leadership Summit: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Both got polite \u2013 but subdued \u2013 receptions from the crowd of hundreds of social conservatives. Noem positioned herself as opposed to America under Biden, describing a country that she said \u201cis built on hate and division. On pitting people against each other.\u201d \u201cIt is a shame to watch the violence and the crime and the lack of unity,\u201d she said. She bragged that South Dakota had not ordered any businesses to close during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shelter in place. We didn\u2019t mandate anything. We just trusted people,\u201d she said. South Dakota has the third-most Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the nation, with 14,103, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. But the state has recently seen just 1 new case per 100,000 people each day. After watching last year\u2019s protests over racial injustice, Noem said, the state launched a week of advertising attempting to recruit out-of-state law enforcement officers to work in South Dakota, a campaign that she said drew interest from 900 police officers in 41 states. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to be a state that wraps its arms around our law enforcement officers,\u201d Noem said. Pompeo touted the role his faith played in foreign policy decision-making during his tenure as Trump\u2019s top diplomat. He said the Biden administration\u2019s unwinding of Trump-era policies \u201chas been tough for me to watch.\u201d Pompeo argued that Biden has not been tough enough against China and in responding to crime in American cities, and he complained that Democrats have not been sufficiently supportive of police. He lambasted \u201cthe garbage they\u2019re trying to teach in our schools today\u201d \u2013 a reference to critical race theory, an increasingly frequent Republican target \u2013 and said the United States is not \u201cinherently and systemically racist.\u201d \u201cWe should not challenge our founding. It was noble,\u201d Pompeo said. He added: \u201cWe are not a nation in decline. We are not a racist nation. We are a God-blessed Christian nation. Do not let the woke socialists get you down.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House GOP\u2019s plan to win back power is becoming increasingly centered on one man: Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy became the latest in a parade of Republicans to make the pilgrimage to a Trump-owned property seeking the former President\u2019s support, while scores of GOP candidates have been invoking Trump\u2019s name and image to boost their campaign coffers, which are filling up at record rates. The steady stream of schmoozing by top Republicans and the groundswell of grassroots support suggest that, six months after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, Trump still maintains an iron-like grip on the GOP and there are zero signs of that loosening anytime soon \u2013 even amid a damning drip of revelations about his conduct during his final months in office. And with Republicans counting on Trump to be a crucial pillar of their efforts to reclaim the House majority next year, both in terms of fundraising and turnout, they are eager to stay in his good graces and reluctant to damage or provoke the mercurial ex-President over the next 16 months \u2013 especially as the January 6 probe heats up, which Trump will undoubtedly be keeping a close eye on. \u201cHe\u2019s still the biggest dog in the Republican pound among the base,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, referring to Trump. Of course, tying the party so closely to Trump has its risks, too. The battle for the House will largely play out in suburban battleground districts where moderates and independents fled the party under Trump. Not to mention that the GOP lost the House, the Senate and the White House on Trump\u2019s watch. Mitch McConnell responds to Trump's 'Old Crow' insult: 'It's quite an honor' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has taken a decidedly different approach toward Trump, careful to avoid talking about the ex-President even as Trump promises to play a role in several key contests. But for the most part, Republicans see far more political upside to keeping Trump front and center. \u201cLeader McCarthy\u2019s relationship with President Trump is an asset for the GOP as we all work together to retake the majority,\u201d said GOP Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas. Added Rep. David Valadao, a California Republican who voted to impeach Trump and backed an independent commission on January 6: \u201cMcCarthy is always going to do what he thinks is right for the entire caucus, so I trust him.\u201d In a sign that Trump is eager to show he\u2019s still in charge, he is the one who announced Thursday\u2019s meeting at his New Jersey golf club \u2013 not McCarthy. \u201cMuch to discuss!\u201d Trump said in a brief statement ahead of the meeting. The purpose of their huddle was to talk about the midterms, including vulnerable House Democrats, upcoming special elections and fundraising numbers, according to a GOP source familiar with the meeting. McCarthy had already been in New Jersey stumping for Republican congressional candidate Tom Kean this week. Afterward, McCarthy made clear that Trump will be central to their efforts to flip the House and called their conversation \u201cproductive.\u201d \u201cAs the midterm elections draw closer, I look forward to working together to build upon our success in 2020 where House Republicans flipped 15 seats, lost zero incumbents and elected the most women in conference history,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate President Trump\u2019s commitment to help House Republicans defeat Democrats and Take Back the House in 2022.\u201d But the meeting \u2013 McCarthy\u2019s second such sit-down since Trump left office \u2013 also came at a critical moment for the California Republican: McCarthy is weighing his picks for a select committee to investigate the deadly pro-Trump riot at the Capitol, though a GOP source said the issue did not come up on Thursday. There is enormous pressure on McCarthy to name GOP members who can mount a vigorous defense of Trump. During his first impeachment, Trump was vocal about who he wanted out there fighting for him. McCarthy ultimately tapped Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and a staunch Trump ally, for a high-profile role defending the then-President. But with the select committee, McCarthy is trying to strike a delicate balance between Trump acolytes and more serious members who could have more credibility with middle America. While McCarthy has publicly said he hasn\u2019t decided who to name \u2013 or even whether to name anyone \u2013 to the panel, sources expect him to have Republican members in place before the committee\u2019s first hearing on July 27. The lone Republican on 1/6 panel so far, Liz Cheney vows to 'stand for the truth' Further upping the ante for McCarthy, Democrats have made clear that he and Trump could both be called to testify before the select committee. How the congressional probe plays out could earn McCarthy a pile of chits or criticism from Trump, which could factor into any future speaker\u2019s race. McCarthy is hardly the only top Republican who has sought to stay on Trump\u2019s good side. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana trekked to Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, while newly elected House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik of New York and members of the conservative Republican Study Committee both made separate recent trips to Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf club to raise campaign cash and talk midterm strategy. Democrats, however, framed Thursday\u2019s meeting as just another example of the GOP\u2019s unflinching fealty to Trump, charging that Republicans are willing to look the other way when it comes to the ex-President \u2013 and in some cases even downplay the deadly events of January 6 \u2013 to boost their own political prospects. \u201cHouse Democrats are the party of monthly child tax credit payments that help working and middle-class families. The radical right continues to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\u201d said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. One reason Republicans have hugged Trump so tightly is that they see him as a fundraising goldmine for their party \u2013 and there is some evidence to suggest that might be true. McCarthy and the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm both recently posted record-breaking fundraising hauls, outpacing their Democratic counterparts in the money race. The minority leader raised a staggering $43.6 million in the first half of 2021, including $16.5 million raised in the second quarter, his office announced Wednesday. And the National Republican Congressional Committee raked in $45.4 million in the second quarter of 2021, the most it has ever raised in three months of a non-election year. Meanwhile, plenty of Republican lawmakers have been padding their war chests by using Trump\u2019s name and image in their fundraising appeals. On Trump\u2019s birthday, for example, Scalise asked his supporters in a campaign email to wish the former President a happy one. Freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert, meanwhile, used her recent border trip with Trump to raise cash, with the Colorado Republican saying in an email that she was \u201cLIVE from the border\u201d with the former President and \u201cTrump asked me to be here.\u201d Another freshman, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, attached a picture of himself and Trump flashing thumbs up in a fundraising pitch. Mike Carey, a Republican candidate for an Ohio House seat, recently blasted out a fundraising email touting his Trump endorsement with the subject line: \u201cPresident Trump says \u2018YES.\u2019 \u201c Taken together, these Trump-focused fundraising emails show how Republicans are fully embracing the former President in their quest to raise money and flip control of the House next year. \u201cPeople still love the President. So if he is involved, we\u2019re going to be successful,\u201d said Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican, when asked about Trump\u2019s ability to help the GOP raise cash.

            "article_content": "James Carville sees himself as the Cassandra of the modern Democratic Party \u2013 a man who can prophesy the future but who is doomed to never be believed. Carville, whose claim to fame is electing \u2013 and reelecting \u2013 Bill Clinton as president in the 1990s, has been telling anyone who asks that his party\u2019s current focus on, for lack of a better word, \u201cwokeness\u201d is a major problem as they seek to hold their majorities in the House and Senate next November. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on Tuesday night, Carville explained his view: \u201cWe\u2019re letting a noisy wing of our party define the rest of us. And my point is we can\u2019t do that. \u201cI think these people are all kind of nice people. I think they\u2019re very naive, and they\u2019re all into language and identity. And that\u2019s all right. They\u2019re not storming the Capitol. But they\u2019re not winning elections.\u201d Carville\u2019s case, in short, is that the broad mainstream of the Democratic Party is letting the \u201cnoisy\u201d liberals dominate what the average American \u2013 particularly those who identify as swing voters \u2013 thinks the party stands for. Calls to defund the police, pass the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d or end the detention of people coming across the US\u2019s southern border illegally are, in Carville\u2019s mind, simply not majority positions in the country. Pushing them \u2013 loudly \u2013 is, therefore, a major mistake. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! There\u2019s a decent amount of polling data to back up Carville\u2019s contentions about his party. In NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll conducted shortly after the 2018 midterm elections, a clear majority of people (52%) said they were \u201cagainst the country becoming more politically correct and upset that there are too many things people can\u2019t say anymore.\u201d Just 36% said that they were \u201cin favor of the United States becoming more politically correct and like when people are being more sensitive in their comments about others.\u201d A May 2021 Pew poll showed that 57% of Americans believe that \u201cpeople today are too easily offended by what others say\u201d while just 40% agreed that \u201cpeople should be careful what they say to avoid offending others.\u201d And even on specific issues, there\u2019s some sentiment that people believe the so-called \u201cwoke mob\u201d has gone too far. In an Axios-Ipsos poll from May, 70% of Americans opposed \u201cthe \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement\u201d while just 27% supported it. A May Fox News poll showed that 47% of registered voters said the Biden administration is proposing too much of an increase in government spending, while 17% said not enough, and 33% chose just about the right amount. And there\u2019s no question that Republicans see the focus on \u201cwokeness\u201d as a major opening for them in 2022. \u201cAmericans do not support the woke left,\u201d former President Donald Trump said in a speech last weekend to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas. \u201cThe people are with us. You have no idea how much.\u201d The big question for Democratic strategists \u2013 and politicians seeking to either win election or reelection in swing and Republican leaning areas \u2013 is how to navigate the woke army that comprises a decent-sized chunk of the party base. Elections aren\u2019t won if your base walks away from you. On the other hand, embracing policies to appease that base \u2013 particularly on crime \u2013 almost certainly jeopardize a candidate\u2019s chances of appealing to the critical center in a general election. Carville, for his part, knows where he thinks Democratic candidates should land on that question. \u201cI think people sort of see this for what it is, and people way more interested in their lives, and how to improve them, than they are in somebody else\u2019s pronoun or something,\u201d he told Cuomo.",

            "article_content": "The Senate on Monday unanimously confirmed Jen Easterly to lead the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cybersecurity division, a role that will be key in the administration\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. Easterly, a two-time recipient of the Bronze Star, was nominated by President Joe Biden in April to be the second director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The agency has been led in an acting capacity by career official Brandon Wales since then-director Chris Krebs was fired for pushing back against lies by then-President Donald Trump and his supporters about election security. Easterly\u2019s confirmation comes at a crucial time for the administration as it works to respond to a flood of recent ransomware and cybersecurity incidents. She will assume the post on the heels of the ransomware attack targeting software vendor Kaseya, and in the wake of the SolarWinds breach and back-to-back ransomware attacks that crippled critical infrastructure companies \u2013 Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods. Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida had blocked a vote on Easterly\u2019s confirmation for unrelated reasons, holding it up ahead of the July Fourth holiday weekend. Scott had previously said it wasn\u2019t about Easterly or cybersecurity, but about DHS nominees and a \u201clack of accountability\u201d from the Biden administration to address the border crisis. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan had urged colleagues to confirm her to the role. \u201cI warned that without confirming Ms. Easterly, we risked leaving ourselves vulnerable to cyber-attacks. And in the two weeks since I last called on my colleagues to approve this critical nomination, nation-state actors and criminal organizations have continued their relentless targeting of the United States,\u201d Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a statement Monday. Easterly\u2019s confirmation drew praise from Palo Alto Networks Chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora, who called her a \u201ctremendous leader who has driven the nation\u2019s cyber defense in government and the private sector.\u201d Easterly said during her confirmation hearing last month that ransomware and cyberattacks are \u201cat a place where nation-states and non-nation-state actors are leveraging cyberspace largely with impunity.\u201d She also expressed support for mandatory private-sector reporting to the government on cyber incidents. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sense across the board. But it seems to me that voluntary standards are probably not getting the job done,\u201d Easterly said at the time. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which describes itself as the \u201cnation\u2019s risk adviser\u201d for cybersecurity and infrastructure, is the lead agency responsible for protecting federal civilian networks. Easterly has said she sees the cybersecurity agency as the \u201cquarterback\u201d responsible for protecting and defending federal civilian government networks, leading asset response for significant cyber incidents and sharing information with federal, state, local and private-sector partners.",

The Alaska Republican State Central Committee voted overwhelmingly \u2013 58-17 \u2013 to throw its support behind former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka, who is the most high-profile challenger to Murkowski as she seeks a fifth term in 2022. Why would the top Republicans in Alaska abandon Murkowski, who has been the state\u2019s senator since 2002, in droves? Two words: Donald Trump. The former President has made Murkowski enemy No. 1 because she, uh, voted to convict him for inciting the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. (Six other Republicans joined Murkowski in that vote; she is the only one running for reelection in November 2022.) While Trump had long made clear his unhappiness with Murkowski, he took it to another level in endorsing Tshibaka. \u201cLisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,\u201d Trump said in a statement released from his Save America PAC. \u201cMurkowski has got to go! Kelly Tshibaka is the candidate who can beat Murkowski\u2014and she will. Kelly is a fighter who stands for Alaska values and America First. She is MAGA all the way, pro-energy, strong on the Border, tough on Crime and totally supports our Military and our great Vets.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! And since what Trump says goes \u2013 particularly at the state party level \u2013 what happened over the weekend in Alaska was utterly predictable. Trump said Murkowski wasn\u2019t appropriately loyal to him (she voted with him more than 70% of the time, according to 538, but whatever), so it must be true. Trump endorsed Tshibaka. So the Alaska GOP had to do the same. Because, well, Trump. Losing the endorsement of the state central committee doesn\u2019t prove Tshibaka will beat Murkowski for a lot of reasons \u2013 the most important being that there will be an all-party primary in 2022, with ranked-choice voting used to determine the winner. And don\u2019t forget that in 2010, Murkowski was beaten in a Republican primary by a tea party-backed challenger. She managed to win reelection by running a write-in campaign during the general election. What it does prove is that the GOP is still entirely under Trump\u2019s control. The Point: Donald Trump rules by fear. And Alaska Republicans are running scared.",

            "article_content": "The Conservative Political Action Conference\u2019s summer gathering in Dallas over the weekend showcased the hold former President Donald Trump \u2013 and the conspiracy theories he is touting \u2013 has over the Republican Party\u2019s activist base. In his 90-minute speech Sunday, Trump repeated his now-familiar lie that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 election. Throughout the weekend, Republicans picked up on Trump\u2019s themes, bashing President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s management of the border, seizing on the former President\u2019s grievances against social media companies and complaining about critical race theory. Some attendees were handed cards featuring a \u201c7-pt. plan\u201d to reinstall Trump as president by electing him speaker of the House and then removing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris from power. A painting of Trump hugging and kissing the American flag was auctioned off for $25,000 from the CPAC stage. Fact check: Untethered to reality, Trump lies over and over about the 2020 election at CPAC And as Republicans considering 2024 presidential campaigns of their own sought to differentiate themselves from potential rivals, Trump continued to assert that he remains the leader of the party \u2013 the one and only leader of what he called \u201cthe greatest political movement in the history of our country.\u201d The weekend gathering offered a vivid window into the political resistance Biden\u2019s administration is encountering in its efforts to vaccinate Americans against Covid-19 \u2013 showcasing the growing opposition to vaccines among the conservative base. Attendees at CPAC cheered author Alex Berenson when he noted that Biden\u2019s administration is falling short of its goal of vaccinating 70% of adults by July 4. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, on CNN Sunday called the cheers \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201calmost frightening.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re cheering about someone saying that it\u2019s a good thing for people not to try and save their lives,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci says Americans who are fully vaccinated do not need booster shots at this time Conservatives in recent weeks have lambasted Biden for pushing the vaccines, mischaracterizing his push to enlist volunteers to go \u201cliterally knocking on doors\u201d to encourage vaccinations. North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn bizarrely suggested in an interview with a right-wing outlet at CPAC that the Biden administration could eventually \u201cgo door to door to take your guns; they could go door to door to take your Bible.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, demanded credit for the vaccines, which were developed during his presidency. But the former President has not used any of his own political capital to urge his supporters to get vaccinated \u2013 even as Covid hospitalizations rise, particularly in red states where a larger share of adults are unvaccinated. Increasingly, conservatives have hailed those who rioted at the Capitol on January 6 as heroes \u2013 downplaying violence against police officers and disputing the circumstances of the rebellion against Congress certifying Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Trump in recent weeks has attempted to revise the history of the riots. Ahead of his speech at CPAC, Trump appeared on Fox News, telling host Maria Bartiromo that those who attended his rally that day before storming the Capitol were \u201cpeaceful people.\u201d He also claimed that Ashli Babbitt, the insurrectionist who was shot and killed at the Capitol while attempting to climb into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby of the House, was a hero. \u201cWho is the person that shot an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no repercussion \u2013 that were on the other side, it would be the biggest story in this country. Who shot Ashli Babbitt? People want to know and why.\u201d The events of January 6 led to Trump\u2019s second impeachment. And in Dallas, he railed against Republicans who voted to impeach him \u2013 including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who was then the No. 3-ranking GOP House member. \u201cYou have to live with her, I guess. Maybe not much longer,\u201d Trump said, referring to primary challenges against Cheney in 2022. The early stages of the 2024 Republican presidential primary are unfolding along two tracks: One if Trump runs again and dominates; another if Trump passes and the party begins with a wide-open field. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem continued her aggressive pursuit of the second track with an unmistakeable swipe at potential 2024 rivals \u2013 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \u2013 who took more restrictive approaches to the pandemic in their states. Donald Trump just accidentally told the truth about his view on polls \u201cWe\u2019ve got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn\u2019t shut down their states; that they didn\u2019t close their regions; that they didn\u2019t mandate masks,\u201d Noem said. \u201cNow I\u2019m not picking fights with Republican governors. All I\u2019m saying is that we need leaders with grit. That their first instinct is the right instinct.\u201d \u201cDemand honesty from your leaders and make sure that every one of them is willing to make the tough decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cSouth Dakota did not do any of those (measures). We didn\u2019t mandate. We trusted our people and it told them that personal responsibility was the best answer.\u201d DeSantis, the Florida governor, stood out as the clear second choice of CPAC attendees over the weekend \u2013 a very early indicator of his growing popularity with that portion of the party\u2019s base. CPAC conducted two straw polls: One that included Trump, and one that did not. Trump, as expected, easily won the straw poll in which he was included, with 70% support. But DeSantis finished well ahead of all other Republicans, with 21% support. DeSantis cruised in the straw poll that did not include Trump. He got the backing of 68% of CPAC attendees, followed by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 5% and Donald Trump Jr. at 4%. Still, at CPAC  \u2013 where Trump got a rock star\u2019s welcome \u2013 there is no mistaking the reality that the Republican Party\u2019s base remains overwhelmingly behind Trump. One looming question is whether Trump will at some point turn against Republicans who are positioning themselves to run in 2024 \u2013 and who have so far aligned themselves closely with the former president and his policies. \u201cI love my Republicans, but we\u2019re really kicking their ass, too,\u201d Trump said in his CPAC speech of party members who might run against him for president. \u201cBut we love them. But we like it because they\u2019re friends of ours, right? So it\u2019s OK. I think we can say that affectionately.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As Democrats begin the uphill climb to hold their majorities in the House and Senate next November, politicians and party strategists are admitting that their biggest challenge comes from within: \u201cWoke\u201d liberals demanding adherence to policies on crime, the environment and government spending that are simply not shared by a majority of the country. \u201cHow do Democrats win in places like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and Georgia?\u201d asked former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges (D). \u201cFocusing on how lives have improved since January of 2021. COVID rates are down and jobs are up. People are generally free to visit family and friends without restriction. The circus has left Washington and Biden has already cleaned up the mess. I\u2019m not sure why Democratic candidates would stray from that message \u2013 particularly in purple states.\u201d Hodges\u2019 comments are reflective of a broader acknowledgment \u2013  and concern \u2013 that talking about things like defunding the police or the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d or ending the detention of people coming across our southern border illegally are a recipe for political disaster in the 2022 midterm elections. The current concern is perhaps best reflected in an essay by Kevin Drum, a former staffer for Washington Monthly magazine. Noting that liberals have been aggressively stoking the culture wars in recent years, Drum writes: \u201cDespite endless hopeful invocations of \u2018but polls show that people like our positions,\u2019 the truth is that the Democratic Party has been pulled far enough left that even lots of non-crazy people find us just plain scary \u2013 something that Fox News takes vigorous advantage of. From an electoral point of view, the story here is consistent: Democrats have stoked the culture wars by getting more extreme on social issues and Republicans have used this to successfully cleave away a segment of both the non-college white vote and, more recently, the non-college nonwhite vote.\u201d While Drum has been beating the, um, drum on this issue of late, it\u2019s actually James Carville who was the first to warn Democrats that focusing on very liberal policies \u2013 and demanding that the general public pronounce support for those issues or run the risk of being labeled \u201cintolerant\u201d \u2013 is political poison for the party. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cWokeness is a problem and everyone knows it. It\u2019s hard to talk to anybody today \u2013 and I talk to lots of people in the Democratic Party \u2013 who doesn\u2019t say this. But they don\u2019t want to say it out loud,\u201d Carville, who made his name helping to elect Bill Clinton president, said in an interview with Vox this spring. Asked why his party won\u2019t admit the wokeness problem, Carville responded bluntly: \u201cBecause they\u2019ll get clobbered or canceled.\u201d There\u2019s data to back up those concerns too. In NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll conducted shortly after the 2018 midterm elections, a clear majority of people (52%) said they were \u201cagainst the country becoming more politically correct and upset that there are too many things people can\u2019t say anymore.\u201d Just 36% said that they were \u201cin favor of the United States becoming more politically correct and like when people are being more sensitive in their comments about others.\u201d A May 2021 Pew poll showed that 57% of Americans believe that \u201cpeople today are too easily offended by what others say\u201d while just 40% agreed that \u201cpeople should be careful what they say to avoid offending others.\u201d And even on specific issues, there\u2019s some sentiment that people believe the so-called \u201cwoke mob\u201d has gone too far. In an Axios-Ipsos poll from May, 70% of Americans opposed \u201cthe \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement\u201d while just 27% supported it. A May Fox News poll showed that 47% of registered voters said the Biden administration is proposing too much of an increase in government spending, while 17% said not enough, and 33% chose just about the right amount. Now, as Drum rightly notes, there are plenty of issues where the so-called \u201cwoke\u201d policy has significant support. More than 6 in 10 (63%), for example, in a Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll from 2019, said the country needs a green new deal to help address climate change. But as CNN polling and election analytics editor Ariel Edwards-Levy rightly notes, most people don\u2019t really know what is in the actual Green New Deal. So, the support for it is rightly read as general support for addressing climate change rather than backing any specific policies laid out in the Green New Deal. Then there\u2019s the political reality of all of this. Campaign politics tend to strip the nuance off issues, paring them back to the sort of lowest common denominator stuff that motivates people to vote (or, in some cases, not to vote.) And it is on that front where the woke crowd truly endangers Democrats at the ballot box. Although the election is more than a year away, Republicans \u2013 led by former President Donald Trump \u2013 are already making clear that they intend to make it a referendum not as much on President Joe Biden and his policies but rather on political correctness, wokeness and \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u201cWe stand up to political correctness, and we reject the intolerance of left wing cancel culture,\u201d Trump said in a speech over the weekend to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas. At another point in the address, he pledged: \u201cWe will stop left wing cancel culture. We will restore free speech and fair elections, and we will make America great again. It\u2019s very simple. Very simple.\u201d And predictably, Republican leaders have followed Trump\u2019s lead. Following Major League Baseball\u2019s decision to move this year\u2019s All-Star Game out of Georgia after the state passed a restrictive voting bill, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said this: \u201cThe movement in this country about wokeness has got to stop.\u201d Of the All-Star Game decision, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was even more blunt: \u201cFrom election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment, parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government. Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.\u201d There\u2019s no secret, then, about the ground on which Republicans want to fight the coming election. And Democrats, worried about alienating their liberal left base, are playing right into the GOP\u2019s hands. \u201cIf we learned anything from 2020, it was that growth with suburban voters \u2013 many former Republicans \u2013 carried Biden across the finish line,\u201d said Hodges, the former South Carolina governor. \u201cAnd these same voters will make the difference in competitive swing state elections. They want to hear how candidates will make their lives better; stray from that message and we risk Mitch McConnell becoming majority leader again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Texas Republicans are set to mount another push for restrictive new voting laws in their state as lawmakers on Thursday begin a 30-day special legislative session that Gov. Greg Abbott says he wants to see focused in part on \u201celection integrity.\u201d Abbott released an 11-item agenda for the special session that includes a raft of issues designed to appeal to cultural conservatives, among them social media censorship, banning the teaching of critical race theory in Texas classrooms and banning transgender students from competing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identities. But voting measures \u2013 particularly Republican proposals designed to stop expansive practices such as drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting allowed by Harris County, the home of Houston, during the 2020 election \u2013 are expected to be the political flashpoint, and one that commands national attention. Lawmakers will be picking up where they left off five weeks earlier, when Texas House Democrats walked off the floor in the waning hours of this year\u2019s legislative session to block the Republican majority from having the quorum necessary to pass Senate Bill 7, a measure that would have made casting mail-in ballots harder, banned drive-thru voting centers, empowered poll watchers, made it easier for courts to overturn election results and more. It was an unusual defeat for Republicans, who control every lever of power in Texas. The GOP has sought to hang on to that power as the state becomes more competitive: Then-Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke finished less than 3 percentage points from winning a Senate seat in 2018, and President Joe Biden was less than 6 percentage points behind former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election \u2013 the closest margin in a Texas presidential race since 1996. Democrats were particularly incensed over language in SB 7 that would have limited early voting hours until after 1 p.m. on Sundays \u2013 effectively barring Black churches from conducting \u201csouls to the polls\u201d early voting drives. Key Republican lawmakers later said the restriction was a drafting error and they\u2019d meant to allow early voting to start at 11 a.m., rather than 1 p.m., on Sundays. In a letter to House Speaker Dade Phelan on Monday, Texas House Democrats accused Republicans of excluding Democrats from negotiations over SB 7 in the legislative session\u2019s final days and adding new voting restrictions that hadn\u2019t been discussed before. \u201cWe are meddling with the very core of our democracy and with the most fundamental rights of our constituents. We cannot deliberate on these issues through a process that is at best a blundering mess and at worst a deceptive, hyperpartisan sham,\u201d Democrats said in the letter. A bill filed by House Republicans on the eve of the special session, House Bill 3, includes many of the same restrictions as SB 7 but drops the weekend early voting limits. The Senate could advance its own measure, and it might take weeks for majority Republicans to determine the contents of a final election bill. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick had previously tweeted that two of the most controversial provisions \u2013 limits to Sunday early voting hours and language that would make it easier for courts to overturn election results \u2013 will be dropped from the version of the bill Republicans seek to advance in the special session. \u201cNeither will be in Special Election bill,\u201d he said in a tweet Tuesday in which he also blamed the House for the language that restricted Sunday early voting hours. The Republican push for new voting restrictions in Texas is part of a nationwide effort this year, inspired by Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud costing him the 2020 election. Already, Georgia, Florida, Iowa and other states with Republican governors and legislatures have enacted new voting restrictions. Texas is seeking to join their ranks, ahead of Abbott\u2019s 2022 bid for a third term. In recent months, Abbott has increasingly embraced Trump, including announcing that the state will build its own border wall, as he faces a list of challengers from the right who include Allen West, who\u2019s the outgoing Texas GOP chairman and a former Florida congressman. There is no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Texas or elsewhere. But Republicans in Texas have largely based their arguments in favor of new voting restrictions on claims that any fraud is too much \u2013 and that current systems allow it to go undetected. \u201cBasing statistics on the occurrence of voter fraud of off convictions is like assuming the number of items stolen from a convenience store in a year is equal to the number of people convicted of shop lifting from a store,\u201d state Rep. Briscoe Cain, a leading House Republican architect of the voting bill, tweeted Saturday.",

            "article_content": "The Republican primary for Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat got even more crowded Thursday with the entry of best-selling author J.D. Vance \u2013 setting up a messy fight for the GOP nomination in a state that voted for former President Donald Trump twice. At a kickoff rally Thursday night in his hometown of Middletown, near Cincinnati, Vance delivered a populist message, with large corporations, big tech firms and \u201cpublic health leadership\u201d in the crosshairs. He also promised to fight for the grandmothers who believe in a secure border and for the \u201cmiddle-class worker.\u201d \u201cI want to be not just a fighter, but a fighter who\u2019s fighting for you,\u201d Vance said from behind a lectern where, moments before his announcement, a campaign sign had fallen down. Vance joins a field that already includes Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer; Jane Timken, the former chair of the Ohio Republican Party; and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons. The primary race to succeed retiring Sen. Rob Portman, a relatively moderate Republican, could turn on who appears to be the most authentically pro-Trump candidate. \u201cThere has never been a Republican primary for statewide office in Ohio this wide open and this chaotic,\u201d said one Republican strategist familiar with Ohio. \u201cEach one of these candidates has their own claim to the Republican base.\u201d The knives were already out for Vance before the 36-year-old venture capitalist joined the race. Earlier this week, Ohio Republicans received anonymous text messages blasting Vance as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d The texts are similar to a flurry of messages sent to voters in April,denouncing Vance shortly after he announced he was exploring a Senate run. Most Ohio Republicans doubt Trump will endorse until closer to the May 3 primary next year, but the fight over his mantle is on. Mandel, for instance, has taken on the role of pro-Trump culture warrior, releasing a video last month of himself burning a protective mask to protest Covid-19 restrictions. The more establishment-aligned Timken can point to Trump\u2019s support for her as Ohio GOP chair in January 2017. And Vance has taken up Trump\u2019s criticisms of \u201cBig Tech\u201d \u2013 aligning him with the Trump donor and Silicon Valley gadfly Peter Thiel, who earlier this year pledged $10 million to a pro-Vance super PAC. Trump\u2019s centrality in the GOP primary reflects how the former president remains a political force in the Buckeye State. Trump won the state twice, earning more than 3 million votes in 2020 and improving his share of the vote from four years earlier by 2 percentage points. Once considered a perennial swing state, Ohio has trended toward the GOP for the past decade. In that time, Republicans have held every state executive office and the majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Since 2010, only two Democrats have been able to win statewide in Ohio: Barack Obama in his 2012 reelection bid and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who won reelection in 2012 and again in 2018. Trump\u2019s ascendance has accelerated the GOP\u2019s takeover, allowing the party to corner the White working-class vote that Democrats have struggled to keep in the fold. Amid their own primary battle, Republicans are trying to define the Democrats\u2019 leading candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan, as someone who is captured by his party\u2019s left wing and out of touch with Ohioans. \u201cAs Tim Ryan seeks a promotion, he is trending more and more leftward to appease his liberal bosses \u2013 Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, AOC and Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Lizzie Litzow of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cHe is in lockstep with these radicals on issues like open borders that have led to the outrageous crisis at our Southern Border and abolishing the filibuster \u2013 a blatant power grab.\u201d Hoping for a reversal in their fortunes, Democrats in Ohio and nationally are counting on a chaotic and messy Republican primary to give their nominee a chance. \u201cTheir chaos is our opportunity,\u201d said Liz Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic Party. \u201cThese Republican candidates are so desperately running their campaigns for an audience of one, for Trump.\u201d Ryan declined to be interviewed for this story. This competition came to a head in Wellington, Ohio, on Saturday, where each of the top Republican candidates treated Trump\u2019s rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds as a proving ground. Leading into the rally, Timken ran a radio ad touting her Trump credentials. On the day of, she had a plane flying over the rallygoers touting her campaign and had campaign volunteers around the event to meet voters. Gibbons hosted a pro-Trump tailgate before the rally and had volunteers and the event. Both Mandel and Moreno took a more casual approach to the event \u2013 they attended but mostly just mingled with people. Trump \u2013 in Ohio to kick off his revenge tour against Republicans who haven\u2019t been loyal to him \u2013 clearly enjoyed the competition vying for his base\u2019s support. Standing on stage deep into his rally, the former President began to play up the divisions. \u201cHey, do you want to take a poll,\u201d Trump exclaimed about the Senate race, throwing the crowd of supporters into the contentious affair. When Trump mentioned Timken, the former state party chair earned a smattering of cheers, groans and boos. Mandel, who has tailored his campaign narrowly to Trump\u2019s base, earned more hearty applause, while the response to Gibbons \u2013 more of an unknown in the race \u2013 was more muted. The former President, seemingly sensing the divisions, said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll get out of this poll stuff,\u201d before mentioning Moreno. The tension at the Trump rally was just the latest \u2013 and possibly most public \u2013 chapter of an already frenzied race, one that has seen the candidates already fighting. Mandel, the 43-year-old Marine veteran, is considered the current frontrunner even by those supporting his rivals. Thanks to his two terms as state treasurer, he has high name identification and connections with conservative groups and leaders in Ohio. Mandel also brings a considerable amount of campaign dollars \u2013 more than $4 million \u2013 left unspent from his short-lived 2018 run for Senate, when he dropped out months before the primary. \u201cIf the election were today, Josh would win,\u201d said one adviser to another GOP candidate. But Mandel is also facing headwinds in the early months of his current campaign. The Columbus Dispatch reported in May that three of Mandel\u2019s fundraisers had left the campaign, followed by a report this week that two of those staff members departed because of a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d created by Mandel\u2019s girlfriend and finance director, Rachel Wilson. Mandel declined to comment to CNN about those reports. Mandel\u2019s most direct competition appears to be Timken, who comes to the race without the experience in elected office but with a formidable organization \u2013 including committee chairs in all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. Timken also has access to financial and political resources through her husband, Tim Timken, a former steel executive who is a lobbyist in Columbus. Timken has faulted other candidates \u201cwho have based President Trump, refused to campaign for him or quit the tough fights\u201d \u2013 something she has done regularly on campaign literature that calls out her opponents by name. Mandel has regularly attacked Timken, casting her as someone not entirely loyal to Trump and tying her to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has drawn the ire of Trump loyalists. Much of Mandel\u2019s focus on Timken has centered around Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, the Republican congressman who voted in favor of impeaching Trump earlier this year. The Ohio Republican Party later censured Gonzalez and called for him to resign. Timken carefully defended Gonzalez after his vote, touting his record as a legislator and opening up a line of attack for Mandel. \u201cQuestion: Why did Jane Timken refuse to censure Gonzalez when she was Chairman? She clearly had time to do so,\u201d Mandel tweeted in May. \u201cSo what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d Vance enters the Senate race as something of a wild card. Known primarily for his best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, the Yale Law School graduate and venture capitalist has emerged as an authoritative voice on the White-working class that makes up the base of Trump\u2019s support in the GOP. But Vance\u2019s political fate could come down to how he talks about his transformation on Trump, who he publicly opposed in 2016 before reversing his position in 2020. During the 2016 campaign, Vance wrote in USA Today, \u201cTrump\u2019s actual policy proposals, such as they are, range from immoral to absurd.\u201d The same year, as it became clear Trump would become the GOP presidential nominee, Vance wrote in The Atlantic that \u201cTrump is cultural heroin,\u201d who \u201cmakes some feel better for a bit.\u201d \u201cHe cannot fix what ails them, and one day they\u2019ll realize it,\u201d added Vance. As the anonymous text message demonstrates, Vance is already facing attacks for his past opposition to Trump. Some of that will come from the national conservative movement, which has begun to coalesce around Mandel. The Club for Growth\u2019s political action committee, which endorsed Mandel in March, released a statement Wednesday night going after Vance. \u201cHe claims to be a Trump Republican, but in the short time Mr. Vance has been active in politics he\u2019s spent the bulk of it tearing down President Trump and mocking Trump voters,\u201d said the Club\u2019s president, David McIntosh. Nevertheless, Vance\u2019s allies say he is the most authentic candidate in the field because he can express so well why Trump became president. (They also point out that some of his opponents, including Mandel, first supported other Republicans in the 2016 Ohio presidential primary.) Earlier this year, Vance met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He also attended his rally last week in Ohio. And his connection with Thiel may further help soften any bad feelings Trump could have for Vance. A spokesman for the Thiel-backed super PAC, Protect Ohio Values, told CNN that Vance \u201cbelieves deeply in President Trump\u2019s America First agenda and is laser focused on fighting for policies that will benefit Ohio\u2019s mighty Middle Class.\u201d \u201cOhioans want elected leaders with the spine to stand up to Washington\u2019s corrupt political class and we\u2019re confident that JD Vance is the only candidate in this race who fits that bill,\u201d added the spokesman. The Republican strategist familiar with Ohio called Vance a \u201cdifferent kind of candidate\u201d with an idiosyncratic style and issue-set who could break out if primary voters find themselves underwhelmed by Mandel and Timken. That jibes with the overwhelming sense from Ohio Republicans that, barring an intervention by Trump, anything could happen. \u201cThis could be the wildest primary of the cycle,\u201d said the GOP strategist. This story has been updated with Vance\u2019s remarks Thursday evening. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been hard at work raising his profile within the national Republican Party. Between base-boosting moves like fighting big tech over banning conservative politicians, and even sending National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border, DeSantis is doing a lot to pop up on the radars of would-be GOP primary backers come 2024. That is what makes his appearance with President Joe Biden in Miami Beach on Thursday so noteworthy. Both leaders stated the visit would be apolitical, and it certainly was. After all, Biden is there to mark one week since the deadly Surfside condo collapse. The devastating structural failure, which so far has resulted in 18 confirmed deaths with another 145 people still unaccounted for, could become the deadliest non-intentional building collapse in American history. Not a place to play partisan politics. Yet it would have been just as easy for DeSantis to conveniently have something else on his schedule during Biden\u2019s visit, preventing him from being photographed with the Democratic president. Instead, he joined a midday briefing alongside the President and even offered praise for Biden. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cYou recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one and you\u2019ve been very supportive,\u201d DeSantis said during Thursday\u2019s briefing. Biden also had positive things to say about their working relationship: \u201cYou know what\u2019s good about this?\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe live in a nation where we can cooperate. And it\u2019s really important.\u201d If this interaction seems otherwise harmless, don\u2019t forget there is a blueprint for an unsuccessful visit between a GOP governor and a Democratic president. When President Barack Obama visited New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy devastated the area in late October 2012, Gov. Chris Christie embraced the President as cameras snapped away and effusively praised Obama\u2019s response. The image backfired on Christie \u2013 with the election roughly a week away, Republicans were furious, and some ill will even lingered into the 2016 cycle as Christie considered his own presidential bid. The Point: DeSantis got a moment on the national stage during Biden\u2019s Florida visit, and despite his recent made-for-2024 moves as governor, he left the politics out of it.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas blamed President Joe Biden for porous borders, waning support for police officers and \u201ca crime wave of unprecedented proportions\u201d Tuesday night in Iowa. Cotton joined the ranks of prospective 2024 Republican presidential candidates to make early visits Tuesday when he appeared at a state GOP event at Jim Dean\u2019s Classic Car Museum in Sioux Center, in Iowa\u2019s northwestern corner. The stop was punctuated by an only-in-Iowa ending: Cotton and longtime Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley went through Grassley\u2019s workout routine onstage, doing 22 push-ups face-to-face while the state\u2019s other Republican senator, Joni Ernst, counted them off. Cotton\u2019s 20-minute stump speech offered a preview of the themes the senator could emphasize as a candidate. He attacked critical race theory, a decades-old concept that recognizes that systemic racism is part of American society and challenges the beliefs that allow it to flourish. The theory has become the subject of attacks from Republicans \u2013 who have at times mischaracterized the concept and how it is taught \u2013 in recent months. Some GOP state legislatures have moved to ban it from schools. Cotton said critical race theory \u201cmay be the most dangerous theory of all.\u201d \u201cIf we put the brakes on the Biden agenda, if we win in 2024, that\u2019s all for the better. If we, however, let the left indoctrinate an entire generation of our kids to hate America, what will we have gained?\u201d Cotton said. He was the latest in a steady stream of 2024 Republican presidential prospects to visit Iowa. Already, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Florida\u2019s Sen. Rick Scott are among the potential contenders to make stops in the state in 2021. Former United Nations Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley took top billing at a state GOP event last week. And former Vice President Mike Pence, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Pompeo are set to visit Iowa next month for the Family Leadership Summit, an event hosted by the organization led by prominent Iowa social conservative Bob Vander Plaats. Pence will also headline the Feenstra Family picnic in Sioux Center. The early jockeying underscores the two-track reality of the GOP\u2019s 2024 race: Ambitious Republicans are positioning themselves in case former President Donald Trump does not run again. But Trump himself is teasing a bid to return to office \u2013 and the party\u2019s base has not yet moved on from his lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Still, a Trump decision could be years away. And if he passes, it would leave a wide-open field \u2013 which has possible candidates speaking with party leaders and operatives and banking favors early. Cotton timed his trip to the launch of a new political program called Veterans to Victory, which will align the senator\u2019s political and fundraising muscle behind Republican military veterans running for House and Senate seats in 2022. Among the first three candidates to receive the backing of Cotton\u2019s initiative is Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Army veteran who won Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District race in 2020 by just six votes. Cotton also made a stop Tuesday in Sioux Falls, South Dakota \u2013 the home state of a potential 2024 presidential rival in Noem \u2013 for a luncheon hosted by the state GOP. Cotton began by promising he wouldn\u2019t pander to the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say I\u2019m the only one who loves you so much that I married a girl born in Iowa,\u201d he said, adding that his wife, who grew up in Nebraska, was born in a hospital in Iowa\u2019s nearby Sioux City. Missing from Cotton\u2019s speech: any mention of Trump, the figure who towers over the GOP\u2019s 2024 race. Cotton did not repeat any of Trump\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election\u2019s outcome. But he did emphasize many familiar Trump themes, hammering what he called a \u201chostile media\u201d and accusing Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of having \u201cinherited the most secure border in modern times\u201d and failing to keep it secure. He peppered his speech with tough talk on China, saying the country \u201chas been up to no good for a very long time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time, ladies and gentlemen, to lower the boom on China for their decades of lying and cheating and stealing and yes, unleashing a plague on the world,\u201d Cotton said. He said China \u201cbasically ended the traditions of freedom in Hong Kong. \u2026 They did it because Hong Kong is a democracy of Chinese citizens on Chinese soil, and they will not tolerate that in the world, just like they cannot tolerate that Taiwan is a democracy of Chinese citizens on Chinese soil.\u201d \u201cNever forget that China is run by a Marxist, Leninist, communist dictatorship,\u201d Cotton said, comparing China to the Soviet Union and Cuba. He also gave Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann what he wanted to hear: a commitment to support Iowa\u2019s continued status as the first state to cast votes in the Republican nominating process, even as Democrats reconsider after the state\u2019s 2020 vote-counting debacle. \u201cWhy should there be any change to Republicans\u2019 first-in-the-nation status just because the Democrats can\u2019t run a caucus?\u201d Cotton said. He said Iowa has played its role as the first state to hold caucuses for decades. \u201cThat develops more than just a custom or a habit \u2013 it develops a tradition, really, of civic engagement,\u201d Cotton said.",

            "article_content": "Rockets landed at a US military base in eastern Syria, prompting US forces to return fire on Monday, a day after the US carried out airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias, according to a spokesman for the US-led military mission in Syria. A US defense official with direct knowledge of the rocket fire said it is \u201clikely\u201d they were launched by Iranian-backed militias operating in the immediate area, near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria, but the origin of the rockets has not been confirmed and the official could not immediately say how many projectiles were fired. Some rockets did land within the immediate vicinity of US troops, but early reports indicated there were no injuries. \u201cU.S. Forces in Syria were attacked by multiple rockets. There are no injuries and damage is being assessed,\u201d Col. Wayne Maratto, a spokesman for the US-led mission in Syria, tweeted. Maratto later added in a second tweet that, \u201cU.S. Forces in Syria, while under multiple rocket attack, acted in self- defense and conducted counter-battery artillery fire at rocket launching positions.\u201d On Sunday, the White House said it had directed the military to conduct defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups in the Iraq-Syria border region following a recent spate of attacks against US military facilities and personnel in Iraq by a new class of Iranian-made drones that US officials say can evade US surveillance and defenses. President Joe Biden, speaking at the White House during a visit by outgoing Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, referred to some US lawmakers who think he might have overstepped his authority by directing the Sunday strikes and want Congress to authorize military action. \u201cI directed last night\u2019s airstrikes targeting sites used by the Iranian-backed militia groups responsible for recent attacks on US personnel in Iraq,\u201d Biden said Monday. \u201cAnd I have that authority under Article II, and even those up in the Hill who are reluctant to acknowledge that have acknowledged that\u2019s the case.\u201d Monday\u2019s apparent retaliation took place at an oil field site the US calls \u201cGreen Village\u201d in the larger security zone where some 900 US troops operate to protect support local Syrian fighters against ISIS. Secretary of State Tony Blinken, speaking in Rome on Monday, said the US airstrikes on the Iraq-Syria border were meant \u201cto disrupt and deter\u201d attacks against US personnel in Iraq, though they prompted condemnation from Baghdad. \u201cWe took necessary, appropriate, deliberate action that is designed to limit the risk of escalation, but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Rome, where he is attending a meeting focused on stability in Syria and the terror group ISIS. The exchange marks an escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran, which have been gridlocked in talks to coordinate their mutual return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear treaty. The US has signaled that it could walk away if progress isn\u2019t seen soon, while Iran said Monday it has yet to decide whether it will permit international inspectors to monitor and verify its commitments under the deal. During his meeting with Rivlin on Monday, Biden committed to the relationship between the US and Israel \u2013 and to making sure Iran doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon. \u201cIran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch, as they say,\u201d Biden said. US airstrikes follow a spate of sophisticated attacks by Iran using new drones that can avoid US surveillance The rocket fire also comes less than two weeks after the election of a hardline candidate to be Iran\u2019s next president. Blinken and the State Department were \u201cvery engaged\u201d as planning for the US attack on Iranian-backed militias came together, State Department officials tell CNN, adding that Sunday\u2019s strike was a carefully planned mission. \u201cThere was a process as you might expect, involving the military, State Department, other relevant department and agencies that proceeded these operations,\u201d explained one official. Members of the de-ISIS coalition attending the meeting in Rome did not raise the US airstrikes along the Syria-Iraq border during meetings on Monday, senior State Department officials said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki, discussing the Sunday strikes, said Biden also viewed them as \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cappropriate.\u201d \u201cThe President\u2019s view is that it was necessary, appropriate, and a deliberate action\u2026 designed to limit the risk of escalation,\u201d Psaki told reporters Monday at the White House. \u201cWe will take, and he believes, we should and will take, necessary appropriate measures to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the region.\u201d The Iraqi government, one of those allies, condemned the US strikes for violating Iraqi sovereignty and said it was \u201cstudying all available legal options to prevent the recurrence of attacks that violate Iraq\u2019s airspace and territory,\u201d according to a statement from the Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi\u2019s office on Monday. The statement, issued after an emergency meeting of the National Security Ministerial Council, said that the council is \u201cconducting an investigation into the circumstances of the strike,\u201d said it \u201cviolates Iraqi sovereignty\u201d and rejected \u201cmaking Iraq an arena for settling accounts or using its lands and skies to attack its neighbors.\u201d The statement added that talks with Washington about the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq have \u201creached advanced stages, to the level of discussing the logistical details of the withdrawal of combat forces from Iraq, the details of which will be announced later.\u201d In Washington, the strikes renewed debate about the President\u2019s authority to take military action without consulting Congress \u2013 particularly because Biden had already targeted Iran-backed militias in Syria in February \u2013 but Democratic lawmakers offered statements of support. Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who heads the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said that, \u201cbased on what I have learned so far, I believe these were an appropriate and reasonable use of force intended for defensive purposes.\u201d Schiff added that the House Intelligence Committee will \u201cclosely review the basis for this strike, including an assessment of whether this action will truly deter or prevent further attacks by these militias using [drones] and other means,\u201d and has also asked for a Pentagon briefing on the strikes. US airstrikes fuel congressional debate over war powers At the White House, Psaki said the administration sees its strikes in Iraq and Syria as separate from the talks to revive and expand the Iran nuclear deal, which Blinken recently said have been slowed by \u201cserious differences\u201d between the US and Iran. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that on the same exact track,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cWe continue to believe and have never held back from noting that Iran is a bad actor in the region,\u201d Psaki said adding, \u201cAt the same time we\u2019re moving forward and seeking the opportunity to move forward on negotiations to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is in our national interests and that\u2019s how we will evaluate.\u201d Blinken told the New York Times in an interview published Saturday that the US could walk away from talks to salvage the Iran nuclear deal and said that a potential decision point is \u201cgetting closer.\u201d That decision could come if Iran continues to develop its nuclear program beyond the limits allowed in the Iran nuclear deal, Blinken said. \u201cIf this continues, if they continue to spin more sophisticated centrifuges at higher and higher levels, we will get to a point where it will be very difficult as a practical matter\u201d to return to the deal as it was initially agreed to, he said. Blinken made similar comments in a news conference in France on Friday, saying that he could not pinpoint a deadline when the US would walk away. \u201cI can\u2019t put a date on it, but it\u2019s something that we are conscious of. Having said that, we are only going to reach an agreement with Iran if it makes good on its obligations under the JCPOA. And again, we\u2019re just not there yet, so we\u2019ll see,\u201d Blinken told reporters. Blinken also made clear that after six rounds of indirect negotiations in Geneva over the last few months, a deal is not imminent. \u201cWe still have serious differences with Iran, with regard to returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA. Our teams are going back for a seventh round of indirect negotiations in the coming days,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can bridge the differences, but they\u2019re real.\u201d CNN\u2019s Aqeel Najim in Baghdad, Allie Malloy, Maia Noah and Nikki Carvajal in Washington, Kylie Atwood in Rome, Mostafa Salem in Abu Dhabi and Hira Humayun in Atlanta",

            "article_content": "Nikki Haley took top billing at the Republican Party of Iowa\u2019s Lincoln Dinner Thursday night, decrying what she called Democrats\u2019 \u201csocialist\u201d agenda and calling for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as she became the latest potential 2024 contender to lay her marker in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. But Haley and the other Republicans eying the White House are facing one very big hurdle: former President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t moved on, and neither have his voters. Haley, a former South Carolina governor, made no allusion to her potential White House ambitions during her speech to the party faithful, focusing squarely on the 2022 midterm elections as she criticized President Joe Biden as \u201cweak\u201d on China and played up her experience collaborating with Trump as his former ambassador to the United Nations. She argued that Biden\u2019s fiscal policy \u201cmakes Barack Obama look like a conservative\u201d and said the administration\u2019s efforts to extend economic Covid-19 relief have led to a deepening deficit and a labor shortage as workers choose to stay home. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us stop socialism in its tracks,\u201d she said. In another time, Haley\u2019s speech might have served as the opening salvo for her 2024 campaign, but Trump is still casting a long shadow here. He defeated Biden by 53% to nearly 45% in the Hawkeye State in 2020, widening his margins in many of the Republican counties and the pivot counties that once supported former President Barack Obama, who won Iowa twice. In interviews this week before Haley\u2019s arrival, many GOP voters spoke of Trump\u2019s presidency as unfinished business. Not only were many uninterested in the candidates who would like to succeed him, but they also echoed Trump\u2019s false assertion that the election was stolen, citing that as a reason he should run again. Lurlin Hoelscher, a 78-year-old corn and soybean farmer, still had a red Trump bracelet encircling his wrist as he waved off questions about other potential GOP candidates after a stop by The Machine Shed in Urbandale for breakfast. \u201cHe put life back into America. He took our country back from where we were going,\u201d Hoelscher said of Trump. When asked about potential candidates like Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 whose name sparks a striking level of vitriol here \u2013 Hoelscher said Trump was the only person who could finish \u201cgetting rid of the establishment.\u201d He said he\u2019d like to see someone like Haley replace Pence on a Trump 2024 ticket and excused her comments criticizing Trump\u2019s response to January 6 by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s more truth coming out\u201d about the circumstances surrounding the attack on the US Capitol. Lyndal Neal, a 71-year-old former teacher from Lamoni, Iowa, shared the view that Trump should run in 2024 and replace Pence with a woman like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was on the 2008 ticket, or another female contender with \u201ctall boots\u201d who could withstand the heat. \u201cHe\u2019s got to find somebody other than Pence for his running mate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a strong woman who stands behind her convictions.\u201d \u201cI like (Haley) but she doesn\u2019t have as much backbone as she needs,\u201d Neal said, citing what he described as her lack of \u201cconfidence\u201d in Trump. He said he was unimpressed with Haley\u2019s role as US ambassador to the United Nations: \u201cWho gives a damn? You could put Attila the Hun in as an ambassador to the UN and what difference would it make?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nobody to take his place,\u201d Neal said of Trump. Loyalty to Trump among the candidates-in-waiting is emerging as a key litmus test as they gingerly attempt to lay the groundwork for their candidacies if the former President chooses not to run in 2024. Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail \u2013 with an Ohio event this weekend, a planned trip to the border and \u201c45 Fest\u201d and fireworks bonanza scheduled for July 3 in Sarasota, Florida \u2013 is only heightening the anticipation among average voters that he will run again. Pence rebuked Trump in his own speech in California on Thursday night, saying he will \u201calways be proud\u201d of his role in affirming the election results on January 6, but he laid out a largely pro-Trump platform as he too tests the waters for a possible 2024 bid. He called Trump \u201cone of a kind,\u201d drawing a comparison to former President Ronald Reagan. The Indiana Republican, who will appear with Pompeo and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem at a forum held by The Family Leader in Des Moines next month, is trying to navigate around the hostility from Trump\u2019s base stemming from his refusal to acquiesce to Trump\u2019s request to overturn the 2020 election results \u2013 a power the former vice president did not have. He was recently heckled by Trump supporters who shouted \u201ctraitor\u201d at a conference of religious conservatives. Haley, who is 49, was one of the few leading GOP figures who managed to leave the Trump White House in 2018 with her reputation intact while still in his good graces \u2013 a feat that underscores her political talents. But her ability to win the allegiance of Trump\u2019s base voters if she decides to run in 2024 has been complicated by her criticism of his role in the January 6 riot and his treatment of Pence. During a closed-door speech at the Republican National Committee\u2019s winter meeting, Haley broke with Trump by stating he had been \u201cbadly wrong with his words\u201d about the January 6 attack, adding that \u201chis actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history.\u201d She told Politico Magazine\u2019s Tim Alberta that she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Trump\u2019s treatment of Pence on January 6 given the then-vice president\u2019s loyalty to him, alluding to how Trump badgered Pence to interfere in the election results and then was slow to respond when his life was in danger at the Capitol as rioters chanted about hanging him. She also predicted that Trump would \u201cfind himself further and further isolated\u201d \u2013 which proved to be a miscalculation. Haley tried to soften her criticisms of Trump in a February 17 Wall Street Journal op-ed, and in April she said that if Trump runs again in 2024, she would support him and not launch her own White House bid. On Thursday night, she warmly shared anecdotes about how she had collaborated with Trump as the ambassador to the UN, and she praised his forcefulness on the world stage. Many GOP voters in Iowa said they had not followed Haley\u2019s January 6 comments closely \u2013 and they were much more eager to rule out Pence as a potential successor, because of what they view as his disloyalty to Trump. \u201cShe definitely has a path,\u201d said Kim Schmett, who chairs the Westside Conservative Club, after a meeting of its members at The Machine Shed this week. \u201cBut it\u2019s such an abnormal year. \u2026 Clearly (Trump) is the huge question and everyone else is circling. Right now, my reading of the Iowa Republican Party is that it is massively pro-Trump.\u201d But if Trump decides not to run, Schmett predicted, Haley would be \u201chighly forgivable\u201d for what she said about Trump and January 6. \u201cBecause she was very much a key part of the administration. She was very supportive.\u201d \u201cMike Pence, he\u2019s got a much harder position \u2013 and yet you couldn\u2019t have found anybody more loyal the entire four years,\u201d Schmett said. But George Wood, an 81-year-old member of the club who recently saw Pompeo address the group, said he believes Haley has a steep challenge ahead as she tries to finesse her post-January 6 comments. \u201cHer problem in Iowa is with Trump supporters,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThings linger,\u201d he said, adding that some candidates get \u201cbeat up for what they said 40 years ago that is inconsequential in today\u2019s world.\u201d Wood said he was \u201cwide open at this point,\u201d including to the possibility of another Trump candidacy: \u201cIn my view, he did a great job for the country. He listened to the people, and we need that.\u201d In the short term, Haley is skirting questions about 2024 by stating that she is focused on reelecting GOP lawmakers in 2022 and attempting to restore a Republican majority in Congress. She has worked hard to build strong relationships over the years by offering her hand campaigning and raising money for Iowa lawmakers at both the state and federal levels. After a turbulent year of demonstrations against racial injustice in policing and Black Lives Matter protests, she has used touch points in her own life as the daughter of immigrants from India to decry \u201ccancel culture,\u201d stating that America is not \u201ca racist country.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe the things I hear the left saying these days,\u201d she said Thursday night. \u201cThe things they are teaching our kids, like critical race theory. It\u2019s being taught to little kids who don\u2019t see color.\u201d \u201cThey claim America is racist. Take it from me, the first female and minority governor of South Carolina: They are wrong,\u201d she said to applause. Alluding to the battle over voting rights, Haley highlighted how she had been demonized when she pushed for voter ID as governor of South Carolina and suggested that as an Indian American woman, she is offended when Democrats argue that voter ID laws make it harder for minorities to vote. \u201cIt is wrong when Democrats say that minorities are incapable of going to the DMV and getting a picture ID. We are perfectly capable of getting a picture ID in the DMV,\u201d Haley said. \u201cWe\u2019re perfectly capable of picking the school our kids should go to. We are perfectly capable of doing all things when we have the opportunities in front of us. It is racist when the Democrats say that, and we should call them out every single time.\u201d Earlier this year, Haley announced her new political action committee, Stand for America, to focus on electing what she described as a \u201cconservative force\u201d to Congress that would stand as a \u201cbulwark against the liberal agendas of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Haley campaigned in 2020 for Iowa\u2019s Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as Rep. Ashley Hinson \u2013 who defeated Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District \u2013 and GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who won the open seat in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. She is resuming those efforts this week, raising money for Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, Miller-Meeks, Rep. Randy Feenstra and Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley. She held a roundtable Thursday with female legislators and other women interested in running for office with Republican Party of Iowa co-chair Linda Upmeyer, and will address Iowa\u2019s Young Republicans on Friday. Nationally, Haley has focused on shoring up the prospects of female officeholders in swing districts, noting that she wants to help maintain the gains that made 2020 the \u201cyear of the Republican woman.\u201d The thing she loves most about Iowa, she said Thursday, is that the state \u201cloves to elect badass Republican women.\u201d David Kochel, a long time Iowa GOP strategist, pointed to the assets that Haley would bring to a future White House bid, noting that \u201cIowa Republicans and a lot of independent voters and Democrats value strong accomplished women in politics.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt, particularly in places where Republicans have struggled in the past few cycles in the suburbs, good women candidates have a high upside,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a successful governor, she has foreign policy experience and she had a very successful run in the Trump administration \u2013 all those things are to her credit.\u201d Haley\u2019s challenge in the coming months and years will be whether she can get Iowa\u2019s GOP voters to pay attention to those aspects of her biography as she and others try to get them focused on what the future might look like beyond Trump. As she wrapped up her remarks Thursday, Haley argued that \u201cRepublicans are too nice\u201d and that they keep getting \u201csteamrolled and then whine and complain about it.\u201d \u201cThe days of being nice should be over,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we have to be disrespectful. I wear heels \u2013 it\u2019s not for a fashion statement. I use it for kicking. But I always kick with a smile. We have to fight for America\u2019s promise.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada imposed fresh sanctions on Belarus Monday in a coordinated response to the Lukashenko government\u2019s forced landing of a Ryanair flight and arrest of an opposition journalist last month as well as the \u201ccontinuing repression\u201d in the former Soviet state. In a joint statement, the partners said they were \u201cunited in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenka regime\u2019s continuing attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law.\u201d \u201cToday, we have taken coordinated sanctions action in response to the May 23rd forced landing of a commercial Ryanair flight between two EU member states and the politically motivated arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich and his companion Sofia Sapega, as well as to the continuing attack on human rights and fundamental freedoms,\u201d the statement said. Pratasevich, a critic of Lukashenko, was arrested after his Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Minsk. The diversion of the flight and his arrest sparked international outcry, and Pratasevich\u2019s appearances on Belarusian state television have prompted opposition members and observers to suggest he showed signs of being tortured. Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich appears on state TV as critics decry his detention as a 'hostage'-taking In a separate statement Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced visa restrictions on 46 officials \u201cfor their involvement in undermining or injuring institutions in Belarus, making these individuals generally ineligible for entry into the United States.\u201d \u201cThese individuals hold key positions in the Presidential Administration, State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (Belarusian KGB), Ministry of Internal Affairs, Investigative Committee, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Sport and Tourism, State Border Committee, Ministry of Health, Constitutional Court, Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, and district courts in Minsk,\u201d he said. The US Treasury Department sanctioned an additional 16 individuals and five entities, including Lukashenko\u2019s press secretary and his former chief of staff, who currently serves as chairperson of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly. \u201cThe persons designated today have harmed the people of Belarus through their activities surrounding the fraudulent August 9, 2020, presidential election in Belarus and the ensuing brutal crackdown on protesters, journalists, members of the opposition, and civil society,\u201d the Treasury Department said in a press release Monday. US Ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher told lawmakers in early June that new sanctions were coming \u201csoon,\u201d and one source told CNN that the Biden administration attempted to announce these sanctions during President Joe Biden\u2019s first international trip \u2013 before he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 but the EU was unable to get on the same timetable and the US decided to wait and move alongside its allies. Biden said in a press conference following the meeting that he discussed Belarus during his meeting with Putin in Geneva. The European Union announced sanctions on 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities on Monday after a Foreign Affairs Council meeting attended by Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Belarus lashes out at the US, reducing embassy staff numbers \u201cSeven individuals and one entity subject to this new round of restrictive measures were designated in connection to the forced and unlawful landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on 23 May 2021, endangering aviation safety, and the detention by Belarusian authorities of journalist Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega. Among those targeted are also several prominent business figures who support and benefit from the Lukashenko regime,\u201d the Council of the EU said in a statement. The Canadian Foreign Ministry announced sanctions on 17 individuals and 5 entities. The UK imposed sanctions on seven individuals and one entity \u201cin response to the detention of journalist Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega following the unlawful diversion of Ryanair flight FR4978 in May 2021,\u201d the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement, \u201c4 individuals and 1 entity have also been designated in response to the continued suppression of democracy and human rights in Belarus by Lukashenko and his regime,\u201d it said.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s first overseas trip as US President \u2013 a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of Europe \u2013 achieved its primary goal of signaling to America\u2019s closest friends that it was ready once more to lead the Western alliance. Yet, while European leaders were delighted to see a US President extolling the values of multilateralism and Western stability, it\u2019s going to take a lot more than a week-long visit to fully repair the damage done by four years of erratic hostility under Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump. Indeed, for the bulk of Trump\u2019s time in the White House, European officials conceded the election of an anti-European in the US was a wake-up call for them after decades of assuming that America would always have their best interests at heart. The conclusion many in Brussels reached was that, should someone more friendly follow Trump, the transatlantic alliance needed to be refreshed and strengthened in a way that could not be broken by a possible Trump 2.0 later down the line. However, they also agreed this should be done alongside the EU pursuing its own geopolitical goals to ensure its independence from America, including building its own defense capabilities and trading with countries like China and Russia in a way that is politically unthinkable in the US. On the first of these points, Biden\u2019s trip was a success. In both the New Atlantic Charter agreed by Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as the joint statement from the US and the European Union, all parties agreed that if the democratic rules-based international order is to thrive in a world of rising autocracies, the rules created by the West \u201cneed an update.\u201d In a speech delivered at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the commander-in-chief of the world\u2019s most advanced army said, \u201cWe have to prove to the world and to our own people that democracy can still prevail against the challenges of our time and deliver for the needs of our people.\u201d European diplomats said there is a new awareness that the US and other countries could again see the rise of populist movements that were seen to stymie international cooperation and in some places, undermine democracy \u2013 and that fueled a desire to find agreement and create \u201cirreversible\u201d progress. \u201cWe saw what happened with the US election, we know it can also happen in our democracies too, sadly, it\u2019s something that has in a way happened in the UK with Johnson and the Brexit. It\u2019s something that has happened in France with the Yellow Jackets,\u201d said one European diplomat, referring to populist movements in Europe. \u201cWe know that in two years, four years, it can be somewhat completely different. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working together now to go as fast as we can to build some things that are irreversible.\u201d Despite a flurry of efforts in some US states to roll back democratic participation, European observers said they thought Biden\u2019s appeal to democratic, shared values, and his pledge that the US is \u201cback\u201d was the main purpose of his trip. Pointing to Biden\u2019s five different engagements over the week \u2013 meetings in the UK, the G7, meetings with the EU and NATO, then the summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u2013 a second European diplomat said the US carefully constructed the week to deliver and emphasize that message. \u201cAll of [the events] carefully built on each other to send the same message: the US is back, the US is returning to the fold of democracies, and it\u2019s committed to leading them.\u201d Pointing to Biden\u2019s five different engagements over the week \u2013 meetings in the UK, the G7, meetings with the EU and NATO, then the summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u2013 a second European diplomat said, \u201call of them carefully built on each other to send the same message: the US is back, the US is returning to the fold of democracies, and it\u2019s committed to leading them.\u201d This sort of pro-West, pro-democracy rhetoric is absolute catnip to European leaders, many of whom like to believe they are the closest ally of the most powerful nation on earth. And the fact Biden is inviting Europeans to rebuild the democratic order along with the US is an enticing prospect. But only a fool would ignore the fact that, despite the best of intentions, the political stability of both Europe and the US is far from certain beyond the next 18 months. The reasons for this include domestic electoral politics, such as the midterms in America, as well as French, German and Northern Irish elections, to dramatic differences in political priorities on both sides of the ocean. For all the friendly words and commitments to work together, there is still a major question mark over how the refreshed alliance interacts with current politics. \u201cThe table is set, the cooking has started, but none of us know what this is going to taste like,\u201d says Tyson Barker, a former State Department official under Barack Obama. The Biden administration \u201chas already accepted that the two sides are going to have different approaches to China,\u201d Barker says, adding that the unknown for now is what the White House does if the EU continues to pursue deeper economic ties with Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s not implausible, given US sentiment to China, that it will affect how willing American officials are to work with Europeans on key future technologies like artificial intelligence, given American concerns over China\u2019s record on intellectual property theft and security concerns.\u201d Another issue blighting Europe and likely to get out of hand very soon is the post-Brexit spat over Northern Ireland \u2013 which Biden has personally commented on more than once. In short: as part of the UK\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU, Johnson agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Johnson\u2019s government is currently refusing to fully implement the protocol over fears it will lead to shortages of foods, including chilled meats, in Northern Ireland due to the UK and EU\u2019s new trading relationship. Biden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage, reportedly told Johnson in a \u201ccandid conversation\u201d that the issue must be resolved. The EU \u2013 which believes that anything less than the protocol\u2019s full implementation is a violation of international law \u2013 has implied Biden is supportive of its stance. However, as Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King\u2019s College London, points out: \u201cWe only know that he wants the issues resolved. There is no indication that he holds the UK primarily responsible; we don\u2019t know if he thinks the EU is being a little bit precious over cold meat.\u201d If Biden does publicly pick a favorite in the latest Brexit scuffle, the consequences for the losing side could be severe. For the UK, it could imply the most powerful country on earth saw it as an unreliable law breaker; for the EU, it would be a public undermining of the legal infrastructure that holds the bloc together. Either outcome would have an immediate and damaging effect on the renewed alliance and make the progress that all sides want much harder to achieve. Reviewing the areas where the US and Europe do have differences, a third European diplomat said, \u201cthe idea was not to fix all the problems in one week. \u2026 it was to lay the foundations and the technical work that needs to be done in order to sit at the table and address the issues in a cooperative approach, not a confrontational approach, that allows things to move forward.\u201d While no one doubts that the spirit of cooperation and renewal on display between Biden and allies this week was sincere, the time frame for meaningful, lasting change is tight. \u201cThe window of opportunity to show that America is back is small, with the US mid-terms being next November,\u201d says Georgina Wright, an expert in European politics at the Institut Montaigne in Paris. Steven Blockmans, acting director of the Centre for European Policy Studies, agrees that the words are sincere, but action could be difficult. \u201cThe question of whether the jet-setting recovery tour will amount to more than just a sugar rush for transatlantic relations depends on the West\u2019s ability to translate summit conclusions into concrete initiatives,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cEuropeans will need time to gain confidence about the health of US democracy and that America is not just back but also here to stay.\u201d For the time being, European officials are delighted with what they perceived to be a Biden love-bombing. One senior EU official told CNN that \u201cthe US return to a leading force, while we filled the void left by Trump.\u201d Contrary to the idea there were any major differences of opinion on broader foreign policy, Biden had actually moved closer to the EU\u2019s position, the official boasted. Brussels officials have long dreamed of staking a claim to be a global economic power. With an ally in Biden, rather than an adversary in Trump, they now have the opportunity to step up and take a place at the top table alongside the US. \u201cThe pressure on Brussels is enormous,\u201d says Wright. \u201cIf they are sincerely going to be a major geopolitical power that isn\u2019t subservient to America, the 27 member states will need to be more united than ever.\u201d Ah, disunity \u2013 that constant thorn in the side of the EU. Some member states are openly violating EU law while others are going through political transitions that could make solidarity on foreign policy across the bloc impossible. If Germany elects a Green-led government later this year, the bloc\u2019s biggest economy will become hawkish on trade with China; if the far-right wins in France in 2022, appeasement of Russia becomes more likely in Europe\u2019s main military power. And if Irish nationalists succeed in forthcoming elections in Northern Ireland, that will drag the Brussels into year seven of its Brexit hell, as the thorniest issue of all \u2013 the unique status of Northern Ireland and its precise relationship with the EU and the UK \u2013 remains as unstable and potentially dangerous as ever. While Biden\u2019s Europe trip delighted his hosts, the reality is Trump had set the bar so low after his previous trips, his predecessor was able to get away with wearing sunglasses to meet Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth and have a chat with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Europeans see in Biden a leader who at least shares their basic values and that, following Trump, earns him a huge amount of good will. However, it\u2019s impossible to just forget the past four years. Despite all the warm words and sincere affection for the US, European leaders know that the relationship forged in the aftermath of World War II is gone and something new needs to take its place. And, bluntly, in the long-term, that will likely mean keeping Washington at an arm\u2019s length on many key issues.",

            "article_content": "On Friday afternoon, former President Donald Trump made it official: He is actively working to oust Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski in next year\u2019s Republican primary. Trump threw the weight of his endorsement behind Kelly Tshibaka, a former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner who had announced her challenge to the incumbent back in March. \u201cLisa Murkowski is bad for Alaska,\u201d Trump said in a statement released from his Save America PAC. \u201cMurkowski has got to go! Kelly Tshibaka is the candidate who can beat Murkowski\u2014and she will. Kelly is a fighter who stands for Alaska values and America First. She is MAGA all the way, pro-energy, strong on the Border, tough on Crime and totally supports our Military and our great Vets.\u201d And with that, Murkowski officially became Enemy No. 1 for Trump \u2013 and the former President (and still the most powerful figure within the GOP) put himself in direct conflict with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), who has endorsed Murkowski for reelection. Trump\u2019s endorsement comes as little surprise, given that he has been vocally opposed to Murkowski for months. She had been one of a small group of Republicans in the Senate willing to break ranks with Trump \u2013 including casting a vote to impeach him for his actions during and after the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. As far back as April, Trump was promising to unseat Murkowski. \u201cI will not be endorsing, under any circumstances, the failed candidate from the great State of Alaska, Lisa Murkowski,\u201d he said at that time. \u201cI do not know where other people will be next year, but I know where I will be \u2013 in Alaska campaigning against a disloyal and very bad Senator.\u201d Murkowski has said little about Trump (or Tshibaka) to date. And while Trump\u2019s popularity within the GOP base is unquestioned \u2013 and would worry any candidate on the other side of his endorsement \u2013 there are reasons to believe Murkowski still has a solid chance of winning. Murkowski has been in office since 2002. Her father, Frank, had previously served in the Senate and as governor. Thanks to recent election law changes in the Last Frontier, there will be a single primary in Alaska next year, with the top four vote-getters \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 advancing to the general election. Voters will be allowed to rank their candidate choices from 1st to 4th. If Murkowski (or anyone else) can\u2019t get to 50%, the last-choice candidate will be eliminated and their votes divvied up based on who their voters ranked second on their ballots. The belief is that a ranked-choice system, which is still in its infancy, helps moderates like Murkowski. To be clear: It is not an easy road to reelection for Murkowski. And Trump\u2019s active backing of Tshibaka complicates it even more. But she\u2019s not a lost cause just yet. The Point: Trump, always focused on seeking vengeance for alleged wrongs done to him, will go all out to beat Murkowski. McConnell (and the rest of the GOP establishment) will fight like hell to get her across the finish line. In short: This just became a central front in the fight for the soul of the GOP.",

It was the first known time that Harris hosted lawmakers in the vice-presidential residence at the Naval Observatory since moving in April, a process that was delayed due to renovations. CNN previously reported that Harris had invited all 24 female senators \u2013 16 Democrats and eight Republicans. \u201cWhat a wonderful bipartisan women Senators dinner at our @VP \u2018s residence!\u201d Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan tweeted. In photos Stabenow shared, Harris is seen toasting the group from her seat at the table between Democratic Sen. Patty Murray and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. What a wonderful bipartisan women Senators dinner at our @VP\u2019s residence! Thank you Kamala! I am so proud of you! pic.twitter.com/l5sVNWO7lU The senators dined on roasted mahi-mahi and ended the night with strawberry rhubarb croustades and vanilla ice cream, according to a menu shared by Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska. The meal was paired with wines from Harris\u2019 home state of California. \u201cOur Vice President even made the cheese puffs herself! And they were so good!\u201d Stabenow tweeted. Afterward, Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn told Fox News that Harris was a gracious host and that the dinner was a \u201clovely event,\u201d while adding that it \u201cwasn\u2019t a policy discussion at all.\u201d \u201cBut if she had brought up policies, I would\u2019ve loved to have said, \u2018Madame Vice President, you need to get to the border. You need to talk to the Border Patrol,\u2019\u201d Blackburn said Tuesday night in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. Pushed on whether there was any policy talk, Blackburn said it was an \u201cevening of relationship building.\u201d Blackburn said the dinner is an annual bipartisan event for the women of the Senate, but that last year\u2019s gathering had been canceled due to Covid-19. Harris was a former US senator from California \u2013 the chamber\u2019s only Black female senator while she served \u2013 before being tapped as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in the 2020 election. Now as vice president, Harris returns to the Senate to be the tie-breaking vote and President Biden has tasked her with spearheading the administration\u2019s efforts on voting rights. The Senate is also negotiating on the President\u2019s key priorities including an infrastructure package. Harris had recently returned from her first foreign trip as VP to Guatemala and Mexico as she sought a serious strategy for stemming migration from the Northern Triangle. The senators who attended included Tammy Baldwin, Marsha Blackburn, Maria Cantwell, Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins, Catherine Cortez-Masto, Tammy Duckworth, Joni Ernst, Dianne Feinstein, Deb Fischer, Kirsten Gillibrand, Maggie Hassan, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Lisa Murkowski, Patty Murray, Jacky Rosen, Jeanne Shaheen, Debbie Stabenow, Tina Smith and Elizabeth Warren.",

President Joe Biden is girding himself for an epic confrontation of democracy vs. autocracy at his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, even as some Republicans back at home are openly questioning if democracy has much of anything to do with America at all. Biden and Putin to meet in summit reverberating with Cold War echoes The defense of democracy has so far been the ideological cause of Biden\u2019s presidency. \u201cThis is democracy\u2019s day,\u201d he said in his inaugural address, promising to pursue unity at all costs and defend people\u2019s rights to disagree. He\u2019s come back to the theme repeatedly, including in his address to Congress in April, when he declared: \u201cWe have to prove that democracy still works.\u201d Earlier this week, as he brought NATO and members of the G7 in line, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re in a contest \u2013 not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world \u2013 as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.\u201d Putin\u2019s Russia actively meddles in US elections, persecutes its own political opposition, appears to harbor criminals who target US infrastructure and repeatedly looks to take land by force. It is, along with China, where a bastardized version of communism has blended with oligarchy, the autocratic antipode of Biden\u2019s vision of democracy. More than a clash of ideas. There\u2019s a realpolitik element behind everything, and as CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson writes, even the genesis of this summit started with a diplomatic element underneath its clash of ideas.   \u201cThe greatest success of the summit may be what it stopped from happening, not what it achieves on Wednesday,\u201d Collinson writes. \u201cBiden surprised many in Washington by suggesting the talks. But the invitation came at a time when Russian troops were massed on Ukraine\u2019s border, with many observers fearing a full-scale invasion and with the imprisoned [opposition leader Alexey] Navalny apparently close to death after being denied medical treatment.\u201d He added: \u201cThe President\u2019s carrot offered Putin a platform he craves alongside the US commander in chief that comes with the implied respect for Moscow some other recent US leaders have discarded, and that will be maximized by Russia\u2019s propaganda machine.\u201d Read the whole thing here. Stage-managing everything. The two men will meet for hours, although never apparently alone, as Trump did with Putin, and they will not conduct a joint news conference. There will be a herculean effort to control the post-summit perceptions. The Americans opposed a joint news conference and Russians pushed for it, writes CNN\u2019s Maegan Vazquez. \u201cThe US resisted because they did not want to give Putin a platform like he had after a 2018 summit with former President Donald Trump in Helsinki. Officials said they were mindful of Putin\u2019s desire to appear like he\u2019d gotten the better of a US president, and wanted to avoid a situation that devolved into a tit-for-tat playing out in public.\u201d Biden is no newbie to high-level diplomacy. He gave Barack Obama some foreign policy cred as vice president. But even earlier, he was a statesman as a senator. CNN\u2019s Christopher Hickey documented Biden\u2019s long history with Russia in a very good visual timeline. The part that surprised me was his trip in the 1980s as Ronald Reagan\u2019s secret emissary along with fellow then-Sen. William Cohen: \u201cReagan wrote in his diary that the two had \u2018been to Russia and are all wrapped up in \u201carms reductions.\u201d I suspect that at least one of them (J.B.) doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019m sincere about wanting them.\u2019 \u201c Democracy is having some troubles. Back then, the US might have smirked at the USSR about the impending collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, there are legitimate questions about the condition of American democracy. Questioning the very idea of democracy. Add to all those facts the open argument by Sen. Rand Paul this week that democracy isn\u2019t even what the country is built on. \u201cThe idea of democracy and majority rule really is what goes against our history and what the country stands for,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told The New York Times in a story published Monday, arguing it was his job to obstruct the majority. \u201cThe Jim Crow laws came out of democracy. That\u2019s what you get when a majority ignores the rights of others.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza pointed out that Paul\u2019s argument is in line with a similar point made by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah in 2020 and that, yes, the US is a representative democracy, but also that such disdain for democracy is awkward in a country that has \u201cWe the people \u2026\u201d as the opening to its founding document. Related: GOP senator goes public against democracy The truth about Jim Crow. More importantly, Paul\u2019s point about Jim Crow laws seemed incredibly off to me, so I called Steven Reich, a historian at James Madison University who has written about them. He pointed out there were Jim Crow laws that segregated people, but also the concurrent effort to regulate elections and make it harder for people to vote, specifically disfranchising Black people. It was a self-selected majority. \u201cIt\u2019s not accurate,\u201d Reich said of Paul\u2019s analysis. Jim Crow \u201ccame out of a complete manipulation of the electoral rules.\u201d Which is something that sounds somewhat familiar, albeit on a different scale, if you\u2019ve been following Republican efforts to change election rules in key states. I flipped the idea of democracy around and asked Reich if he thought Biden was wrong, given the difficulties of American democracy right now, to push the democracy vs. autocracy narrative. He said Biden should maybe be making a stronger case for pluralism \u2013 where everyone has the same equal rights and access to political power. And the time when the most people in the US could vote is since 1965, when the Voting Rights Act passed. For all the difficulties, the most pluralistic the US has ever been is right now, not in a romanticized past.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s showdown with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin on Wednesday is one of the most critical summits of recent times, and not just because relations between the two nations \u2013 which together own 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons \u2013 have plummeted to post-Cold War lows. The Presidents will meet in Geneva on Wednesday for talks resonating with historic echoes of past Soviet-US confrontations. Their nations are at a strategic crossroads that if not properly navigated could erupt into a disastrous escalation on a new battlefield \u2013 in cyberspace. The talks also represent a critical early political trial for Biden and exemplify the all-encompassing challenge facing a presidency anchored on a fight to preserve democracy, which is under siege at home and abroad. Biden's experience with Russia, in key moments from 1973 to now After all, Putin\u2019s core foreign policy goal is the fracturing of US political stability and prestige. He is accused of meddling in two elections to help ex-President Donald Trump \u2013 the top homegrown threat to US democracy. Biden will hold the summit at a time when multiple factors are pushing US democracy to a breaking point: Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud, Republican state efforts to make it harder to vote and easier to rig elections, and the GOP\u2019s refusal to hold the former President to account for the Capitol Insurrection. The chaos, much of which was encouraged by Putin himself in misinformation operations targeting American politics, will play into the Russian leader\u2019s conceit that the US is weakened, turning on itself and hardly a beacon for the world. The talks, on neutral Swiss soil, are the culmination of Biden\u2019s first foreign trip as President, which he used to reinvigorate European alliances battered by Trump and to invoke a new struggle by the West for its political values and future. The United States finds itself between the remnants of the last Cold War with Moscow, which lacks the Soviet Union\u2019s former power but retains the capacity to wreak havoc on US interests, and a building new superpower confrontation with China \u2013 another grave threat to the primacy of the West. The buildup to the summit has meant that Biden\u2019s entire tour \u2013 so far, a qualified success \u2013 will be judged on his clash with one of the most cunning global leaders, whose on-camera smirks underscore his outmaneuvering of past US presidents used to a more conventional geopolitical game. RELATED: Why Biden and Putin won\u2019t hold a joint press conference The run-up to the summit has seen huge expectations-setting and robust exchanges between the leaders. Biden earlier this year agreed Putin was \u201ca killer\u201d and brands him an unrepentant autocrat. Putin has denied all knowledge of hacking and ransomware attacks against US government, private businesses and vital infrastructure that have been blamed on Russian intelligence agencies and criminal gangs. And with classic false equivalency, he has compared political prisoners like Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny \u2013 a victim of an apparent poisoning plot by the state \u2013 to Capitol insurrection suspects charged by US courts. Biden\u2019s opponents at home, in a narrative picked up by his traveling press pack, have been wondering why \u2013 given Russian belligerence and low US hopes for \u201cdeliverables\u201d \u2013 the meeting is taking place at all. Yet the greatest success of the summit may be what it stopped from happening, not what it achieves on Wednesday. Biden surprised many in Washington by suggesting the talks. But the invitation came at a time when Russian troops were massed on Ukraine\u2019s border, with many observers fearing a full-scale invasion and with the imprisoned Navalny apparently close to death after being denied medical treatment. The President\u2019s carrot offered Putin a platform he craves alongside the US commander in chief that comes with the implied respect for Moscow some other recent US leaders have discarded, and that will be maximized by Russia\u2019s propaganda machine. \u201cThis meeting was done in part to save Ukraine, to save Alexey Navalny, so that\u2019s already something. At least a short-term gain,\u201d Evelyn Farkas, a former US deputy assistant secretary of state for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Tuesday. Biden says a goal of the summit is to test whether Putin is willing to agree to a more stable and predictable relationship with the US. The US President, who has long experience with Putin\u2019s cantankerous behavior, has no desire for a \u201creset\u201d with Moscow. But lowering the tone could produce progress on common interests like Syria, Afghanistan, climate change and the Iran nuclear agreement. \u201cHe is looking for some kind of predictable, stable relationship. The question is whether you can get that with Putin,\u201d said Sen. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who\u2019s chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cPutin sees that in his actions, not only does he achieve what he wants and creates instability in the world. There has to be a clear message that there is going to be a consequence for that.\u201d   But even Biden\u2019s limited goals set a high bar. Putin\u2019s strongman Kremlin rule for more than 20 years needs to denigrate democracies like the US to render his own rule more attractive to Russians. A change of tack toward the US would require him to crack down on cyberattacks and to halt propaganda and misinformation campaigns intended to damage US democracy. It would mean a former KGB officer \u2013 who saw the demise of the Soviet Union as a tragedy \u2013 giving up strategic pressure by Moscow in its former sphere of influence, including Ukraine. Whether through coercion or diplomatic carrots, Biden knows the US may simply lack the leverage to change Putin\u2019s zero-sum game. \u201cAutocrats have enormous power, and they don\u2019t have to answer to a public, and the fact is that it may very well be if I respond in kind, as I will, then it doesn\u2019t dissuade him \u2013 he wants to keep going,\u201d the President said at the weekend. Biden also says he will take the opportunity to convey to Putin the kinds of consequences the US will bring for continued assaults on American interests \u2013 including if Russia refuses to crack down on ransomware attacks on staples of US life, like food production, transport and pipelines. The most glaring danger in US-Russia relations is rooted in emerging cyber confrontation. While each adversary has the power to destroy the world, nuclear arms are regulated and systems exist to deter escalation. Safeguards are nowhere near as sophisticated in the relatively new area of cyber warfare. Any US response to Russian provocations \u2013 and there may well have been secret reprisals \u2013 risks tipping a showdown out of control. Biden rarely has nice things to say about Putin \u201cWe are prepared to take responsive actions that are seen and unseen,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters. Political stakes for the Biden and Putin meeting have been spiked to new levels every day of the President\u2019s European tour. But paradoxically, the rising heat may ease Biden\u2019s political exposure at home. With the world expecting a contentious head-to-head, any outcome of the summit that doesn\u2019t include open conflict can be spun as a success. And given the lack of a joint news conference in Geneva, the US President will have the chance to characterize himself as laying down the law to Putin without being undermined in real time by the Russian leader. Biden will also be flattered by comparison with one of the most extraordinary moments in the colorful history of post-Cold War US and Russia relations: Trump\u2019s fawning behavior toward Putin at their Helsinki summit. The then-President astounded his own team and the rest of the world by publicly taking the poker-faced Putin\u2019s denial of election interference at face value. His comment effectively took the word of a former Soviet intelligence officer over that of the US espionage community. And it renewed frenzied speculation about the mysterious relationship between Trump and the Russians. However the summit turns out, the heavy political, diplomatic and historical forces weighing down the US and Russia relationship are unlikely to be eased. There\u2019s no expectation that Biden and Putin will walk away after setting the tone for an era of rapprochement, as President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev did in Geneva in 1985. In fact, the opposite is more likely to be the case. \u201cUndoubtably (Putin) will test us after this summit,\u201d Farkas said.",

            "article_content": "A growing number of GOP Senate contenders are spurning former President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes with campaigns that defy his criticism or ignore his support of a rival, as the Republican Party debates his role in its future. In Alabama, Trump\u2019s early endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks has failed to stop the GOP primary field from expanding. Last week, Katie Boyd Britt, the former CEO of the state\u2019s Business Council, entered the race for the open US Senate seat, joining a field that includes Brooks and Lynda Blanchard, who served as US ambassador to Slovenia during the Trump administration.

Ted Budd at the state\u2019s GOP convention earlier this month as a minor obstacle as opposed to a campaign-ending blow. And in Alaska, Sen. Lisa Murkowski is running for reelection even though Trump has vowed to campaign against her, calling her \u201cdisloyal\u201d after she voted to convict the former President for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol in January. The increasing number of Republican Senate hopefuls who have deferred their political futures to Trump has raised new questions about the former President\u2019s influence, right as he weighs a comeback bid in 2024 that aides say will hinge, in part, on how well Trump-backed candidates perform in the midterm elections next fall. Rather than dropping out or reconsidering the viability of their campaigns, GOP candidates who have endured Trump\u2019s wrath or missed out on his endorsement are taking a different approach. While aligning themselves with Trump on various issues, they are also refraining from supporting his false claims about the 2020 election \u2013 hoping the two-track approach will afford them a primary win and position them as the strongest candidate against their future Democratic opponent. \u201cTrump\u2019s presence looms over every race in ways that have a profound effect on the field, eliciting allies and rooting out foes, but the nod is diminished when every Republican is effectively running as a Trump-aligned candidate,\u201d GOP strategist Liam Donovan said. Trump privately gave Budd his endorsement about 15 minutes before he took the stage in Greenville, North Carolina, earlier this month, immediately upending the primary for the crucial 2022 Senate race. Budd\u2019s two main competitors \u2013 McCrory and Walker \u2013 have stayed in the race, undaunted that the most powerful figure in the Republican Party chose another standard bearer. In their response to the former President\u2019s announcement, both men chalked it up as a premature decision based on poor guidance Trump received from his team. Walker said \u201cit was tough\u201d watching his girls cry during Trump\u2019s speech, while McCrory accused former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows of giving Trump \u201cbad advice.\u201d In a tweet following Trump\u2019s endorsement, McCory added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the development, saying Budd had \u201cdone more to oppose the Trump agenda than anyone in this race,\u201d pointing out the congressman\u2019s votes against a border security bill and hundreds of billions of dollars in pandemic relief that the former President supported. \u201cPat McCrory is clearly the most electable candidate Republicans can put forth,\u201d said McCrory political consultant Paul Shumaker. \u201cRepublicans will not be able to win a majority in the United State Senate without winning North Carolina.\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN that while \u201cendorsements can give you a bump,\u201d other factors, such as \u201cyour priorities\u201d and \u201cthe issues\u201d of the campaign, will prove decisive. But Jonathan Felts, Budd\u2019s political adviser, told CNN that the other candidates\u2019 response to Trump\u2019s endorsement could cost them with GOP primary voters. \u201cBoth of them have suggested that President Trump doesn\u2019t really know who supported his America First agenda,\u201d Felts said. \u201cIt appears their new strategy in a GOP primary is to insult President Trump. Good luck with that.\u201d In Alabama, Brooks became the front-runner for Senate after earning Trump\u2019s support for leading the charge in early January against Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election. That was before Britt, a former top staffer to the retiring Sen. Richard Shelby, entered the race last Friday \u2013 quickly earning her old boss\u2019 approval and setting up a proxy fight between Trump and the senior senator\u2019s allies in the business community. In the deeply red state, where the primary will virtually ensure Alabama\u2019s next senator, Britt has only had positive things to say about the former president, despite lacking his endorsement. \u201cPresident Trump accomplished so many tremendous things for our nation,\u201d Britt told CNN in a statement. \u201cIn the Senate, I will continue to advance the America First agenda by fighting to secure our Southern border, stand up to China, stand with Israel, protect the unborn and support conservative, commonsense economic policies that grow good-paying jobs and opportunity for all Alabamians \u2013 no matter where in our great state they live.\u201d A person involved in Trump\u2019s post-presidential operation said his inability to effectively clear the field in both Alabama and North Carolina was \u201ca potential red flag,\u201d particularly as he weighs endorsements in other high-profile Senate primaries, such as those unfolding in Ohio and Missouri. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to have the other candidates running scared and that could become a serious issue later on,\u201d this person said. Trump and his team had already been eying a summer rally in Alabama \u2013 where he would appear alongside Brooks \u2013 as one way to ignite momentum behind the outspoken conservative congressman before Britt entered the field. And while the process of selecting a location and planning the event had stalled in recent weeks, two people familiar with the effort said Shelby\u2019s glowing endorsement of Brooks\u2019 opponent revived the planning. \u201cShe\u2019s like family,\u201d Shelby told Politico. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the best-qualified candidate to come along in a long time. I\u2019d support her, I\u2019d vote for her.\u201d \u201cIt definitely lit a fire under their asses,\u201d one of the people familiar with Trump\u2019s rally plans said of his team. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement to CNN, senior Trump adviser Jason Miller said the former President\u2019s support remains coveted in GOP primaries and has already boosted the profiles of candidates who have received a Trump endorsement. \u201cEverybody wants President Trump\u2019s endorsement because it\u2019s an automatic catapult into first place, from Max Miller in Ohio to Mo Brooks in Alabama to Ted Budd in North Carolina,\u201d Jason Miller said. Trump has often bragged about the potency of his endorsements, once claiming to have an \u201c88 and 2\u201d win-to-loss success rate in 2020 GOP primaries. But while the former President has mostly chosen successful candidates in the past, the current slate of races where his maneuverings have failed to trigger dropouts comes against a different backdrop. Mulling a potential White House bid in 2024, Trump and his aides have come to view 2022 as fertile ground to test his appeal and influence with the GOP base. People close to the former president told CNN it is highly unlikely that Trump will make a firm decision about 2024 until he\u2019s seen the outcome of next November\u2019s congressional elections. Trump has been using the 2022 midterm cycle to flex his muscles as a GOP kingmaker and assist Republicans in their quest to regain control of the House and Senate. One of the people close to Trump said the former President \u201cknows (that) 2022 will put his influence to the test\u201d and either confirm his grip on the Republican Party or bolster calls for him to step aside for fresh talent. Trump\u2019s sway will also be under scrutiny in Alaska, where Murkowski is waging a reelection bid despite his pledge to oppose her. Murkowski supported impeaching Trump during the Senate trial following the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, saying he \u201cfailed\u201d to uphold his oath to \u201cdefend America and all that we hold sacred.\u201d Kelly Tshibaka, a former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner, is running against Murkowski with the aid of several members of Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign team, though Trump has not yet offered Tshibaka his endorsement. Murkowski challenger wrote in support of 'ex-gay' organization and posts on evils of 'addictive' witchcraft and 'Twilight' To be sure, Trump still holds power over Republicans seeking higher office. Last week, Arizona, state attorney general Brnovich entered the Senate race against Jim Lamon, a solar energy entrepreneur, and Retired Maj. Gen. Michael \u201cMick\u201d McGuire even though Trump had blasted him for not supporting his false claims of widespread election fraud in the state.Lamon has taken to the airwaves in a bid for Trump\u2019s attention and possible endorsement, airing a TV ad on enhanced border security in New Jersey, where Trump is spending the summer at his Bedminster golf club. Lamon spokesman Stephen Puetz told CNN, \u201cMark Brnovich has never had President Trump\u2019s back \u2013 which is why President Trump has made his feelings about Brnovich so clear.\u201d \u201cArizona needs a fighter in Washington who will stand up for conservative values and that\u2019s Jim Lamon,\u201d Puetz added. But Brnovich has said he\u2019s spoken with Trump since the former president criticized him and on Monday the Arizona attorney general told the Justice Department his office would \u201cnot tolerate any effort to undermine\u201d the state Senate\u2019s controversial audit of its most populous county. His campaign took on Biden\u2019s presidency in a statement. \u201cAttorney General Brnovich is no stranger to attacks from the left, but it is sad that we are seeing politically motivated disinformation coming from unvetted members of his own party just days after he launched his campaign for US Senate,\u201d Brnovich campaign spokesman George Khalaf said. \u201cAttorney General Brnovich will continue to fight for Arizonans, uphold the rule of law, and push back against the Biden administration\u2019s gross executive overreach.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Michael Warren contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul has a very interesting view on American democracy: He\u2019s not a fan. \u201cThe idea of democracy and majority rule really is what goes against our history and what the country stands for,\u201d the Kentucky Republican Senator told The New York Times in a story published Monday. \u201cThe Jim Crow laws came out of democracy. That\u2019s what you get when a majority ignores the rights of others.\u201d So, er, what? Paul\u2019s point, I think, is that the rights of the minority party in the Senate are sacrosanct because we have a representative democracy (where people elect representatives to cast votes on policy) rather than a direct democracy (where people decide the policies they want). Paul means to argue that because people elected to have members of Congress represent their interests, they inherently believed that simple majority rule was not the best answer. And, therefore, the current obstruction by Republicans in the Senate \u2013 on the January 6 commission bill, among other things \u2013 is entirely in keeping with the founding principles of America. Paul\u2019s view echoes that expressed by Utah Sen. Mike Lee, an ally of the Kentucky Republican, last October. \u201cDemocracy isn\u2019t the objective; liberty, peace, and prospefity [sic] are,\u201d tweeted Lee. \u201cWe want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.\u201d So, what Paul (and Lee) are trying to do is make a political science argument about representative democracy and its inherent superiority to simply allowing the majority to rule. (Sidebar: I always thought we were an autonomous collective\u2026) But the way Paul (and Lee) are going about it is all wrong. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! For starters, democracy is not solely about majority rule. It is about the right of citizens to have a free and fair say about the way in which the country they live in is governed. That usually takes the form of representative democracy, like what we have in the United States \u2013 including one chamber where majority rules (the House) and one where any single Senator has the ability to slow or stop action on a particular policy, thanks to the filibuster. Then there\u2019s Paul\u2019s attempt to use Jim Crow laws as evidence of the dangers of majority rule. Which doesn\u2019t, candidly, make a ton of sense. Jim Crow laws \u2013 passed primarily in southern and border states immediately  following the end of the Civil War \u2013 were primarily intended at lessening Black Americans\u2019 ability to exert influence and power over the political system. Jim Crow\u2019s root goal was to keep a small number of (white) people in power \u2013 at the expense of Black majorities. Which, well, has some unfortunate parallels in the modern moment for Paul. Already more than a dozen Republican-controlled states have passed laws that make it harder to vote since the 2020 election alone. Study after study shows that limiting polling hours, requiring an ID to vote and limiting early voting disproportionately impacts communities of color. Those sorts of laws do the exact thing that Paul is touting as proof-positive of the negative effects of majority rule governance. Three things have always been true of Paul: 1) He is utterly convinced he is smarter than just about anyone, 2) He tends to think and talk in broad theoretical terms without considering lived experiences and 3) He loves to create controversy via trolling. When all three of those character traits combine, you get moments like this from Paul. Moments in which he sounds more like a college student in a late-night riff session over Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in America\u201d and a lot less like a United States senator.",

            "article_content": "Alejandra Gomez worked tirelessly to get Democrats, including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, elected in 2018. But now she feels betrayed. The 39-year-old co-executive director of the community organizing group LUCHA went door to door in the sweltering Arizona heat in 2018, turning out the Democratic voters that helped get Sinema elected to the Senate. The work was arduous and the hours long, but Gomez and others believed deeply in the need to defeat Republican Martha McSally, who had aligned herself with then-President Donald Trump. Her work paid off \u2013 Sinema won by nearly 3 percentage points. But it is what happened next \u2013 the Arizona Democrat has become one of the most unmovable roadblocks on Democratic priorities in Washington \u2013 that has shocked people who considered themselves ardent Sinema supporters a few short years ago. Gomez now has another label for the woman she helped elect: A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. \u201cWhat has happened is a complete slap in the face to our members, to the work they have done and to the change that they are trying to make in our communities,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIf she is not part of the solution, she is part of the problem. And what we are seeing is that she is touting herself as a bipartisan leader, but we have yet to see where the bipartisanship stands. She has done nothing.\u201d In an evenly divided Senate, each individual senator wields considerable power. But the bulk of that influence has fallen on the shoulders of Democratic senators like Sinema, willing to buck their party on key priorities. The positioning has elevated the senator\u2019s profile \u2013 she is now often talked about nationally as someone President Joe Biden\u2019s administration must court and is at the center of talks over a sweeping infrastructure bill. But back home, her refusal to support a number of Democratic priorities \u2013 from getting rid of the filibuster to raising the minimum wage to $15-an-hour \u2013 has created deep distrust with her party\u2019s base and even spurred groups like LUCHA to look for alternatives to run against her in the Democratic primary when she is up for reelection in 2024. \u201cWe are prepared to support a viable candidate that is ready to actually stand for our communities,\u201d Gomez said. When asked if challenging Sinema was worth the risk of losing the seat to a Republican, Gomez didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cWe already have a Republican in that seat,\u201d she said. Sinema, whose Senate office declined to comment for this story, is partially a product of a politically changing Arizona. The Democrat began her career as a member of the Arizona Green Party and became an outspoken proponent of liberal positions, including writing a letter to the Arizona Republic editor that \u201cuntil the average American realizes that capitalism damages her livelihood while augmenting the livelihoods of the wealthy, the Almighty Dollar will continue to rule.\u201d Her political career began with a loss \u2013 she finished fifth in a five-person race for an Arizona House of Representative seat in 2002 \u2013 but her fortunes began to turn around in 2004, when she joined the Democratic Party and won a state House seat. Sinema served in the position for six years before jumping to the Arizona Senate in 2010. The Arizona Democrat then won her US House seat two years later in 2012, and subsequentially won reelection fairly easily over the next four years. During that time, Arizona \u2013 once a Republican bastion that produced the likes of Barry Goldwater and John McCain \u2013 began to shift to the left, spurred by a growing Latino population and voters moving to the desert from more liberal states like California and Illinois. While Sinema\u2019s win in 2018, in many ways, signaled that political shift was coming, the would-be senator\u2019s politics began to move toward the center during her time in the House. The Arizona Democrat joined the Blue Dog Coalition, a group for Democrats who identify as centrists, and The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group that fashions itself as dealmakers across party lines. Sinema won the support of nearly all Democratic groups ahead of her Senate run, touted as a top tier recruit and someone who could win in a state that had not been too favorable to Democrats. But she ran a careful campaign, avoiding numerous contentious issues and, in the eyes of national Democrats, banking that the national anti-Trump sentiment would be enough to win. Her election, like many in 2018, brought out people who had never been involved in politics, spurred by Trump\u2019s White House victory two years earlier and the sense that the midterms could show the country rejected his kind of leadership. With that help, however, Sinema won, becoming the first woman to represent Arizona in the Senate. The fact that so many new political activists helped Democrats get elected in 2018, argued Julie Erfle, an Arizona communications consultant and AZMirror columnist, is part of the reason so many of Sinema\u2019s one-time supporters feel deflated. \u201cThey\u2019re upset at Sen. Sinema because they believe that she\u2019s holding the party back and she\u2019s really a hindrance to some of these policies,\u201d Erfle said, adding that she, too, is \u201ca little puzzled\u201d at the senator\u2019s political positioning because there are very few signs that Republicans are willing to strike the compromise that Sinema says she is looking for. Few issues have targeted liberal anger at Sinema more than the Senate filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes to pass most legislation. Many Democrats want to change the filibuster rule and allow most legislation to pass with a simple majority. Sinema has opposed those changes, and recently stood alongside Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn to say Democrats are pushing a \u201cfalse choice\u201d in the debate over the filibuster. \u201cThe reality is that when you have a system that is not working effectively \u2013 and I would think that most would agree that the Senate is not a particularly well-oiled machine, right \u2013 the way to fix that is to fix your behavior, not to eliminate the rules or change the rules, but to change the behavior,\u201d she told reporters in Texas while touring the US-Mexico border. The blowback was swift, with Dan Pfeiffer, once a top aide to President Barack Obama, arguing Sinema\u2019s statement was \u201ctelling every Democratic activist and grassroots donor that helped get her elected to go screw themelves.\u201d Erfle described herself as \u201ca little frustrated.\u201d \u201cI really hoped that she wouldn\u2019t have dug in this far on saying no to (changing) the filibuster,\u201d said the columnist. \u201cI think that there is room to reform the filibuster. I would personally like to see it gone, but if it\u2019s not gone, at least reform to make it a real filibuster.\u201d Sinema\u2019s problems are not exclusively in Arizona, with national Democratic operatives regularly and publicly calling the lawmaker out for her actions. This happened most viscerally earlier this year when Sinema joined seven other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Even though the Arizona Democrat was part of a broader group, it was her vote \u2013 which she made with what looked like a gleeful thumbs down and knee bend on the Senate floor \u2013 that incensed liberal Democrats, even if she said she cast the vote because she wanted the measure separated from the coronavirus relief bill. \u201cSenator Sinema a little too happy for poverty wages to remain,\u201d Roots Action, a progressive outside group, tweeted with a GIF of Sinema casting her vote. Rep. Mark Pocan, a progressive Democrat who represents Madison, Wisconsin, went a step further by retweeting a message Sinema published in 2014 where she pledged to raise the minimum wage. \u201cA full-time minimum-wage earner makes less than $16k a year,\u201d Sinema wrote back then. \u201cThis one\u2019s a no-brainer. Tell Congress to #RaiseTheWage!\u201d \u201cJust wow,\u201d Pocan tweeted, capturing just how befuddled progressives have become with the Arizona senator. And back home, with Gomez and Lucha, the way she did it infuriated them. \u201cTo see her curtsy and dance and walk away so flippantly,\u201d said Gomez, \u201cshe was sending that message to millions of Americans and to Arizonans that she doesn\u2019t care.\u201d In response, liberals have geared up to oust the same senator they helped elect in 2018, hoping to knock her off her Senate perch as a warning to other moderates. \u201cThere was a real excitement to the campaign she ran. She seemed like she was going to be a progressive stalwart and a new kind of progressive fighter in the Senate,\u201d said Corbin Trent, who joined with other progressives to launch the No Excuses PAC as a venture to oust both Sinema and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, another Democrat holding up the party\u2019s priorities. \u201cThat is what is especially disappointing.\u201d The super PAC is now running radio ads in Arizona accusing Sinema of \u201cflip-flopping\u201d and being \u201cmore committed to protecting Washington inaction and dysfunction.\u201d \u201cRight now, what she is fighting to protect is her own political relevance,\u201d Trent told CNN. \u201cShe is basically on a political campaign to protect the power of an individual senator.\u201d Sinema has stridently stood by her political positioning. She defended her vote against a federal minimum wage increased by saying it should be \u201cseparate from the COVID-focused reconciliation bill\u201d and her spokeswoman, Hannah Hurley, has slammed liberals for commenting on the \u201cbody language\u201d and \u201cphysical demeanor\u201d around her vote. But it was a picture the senator posted to Instagram in April that activists back at home believe truly captures the way she feels about them: Sinema is seen wearing a ring that says \u201cF*** Off\u201d as she is sitting at what appears to be a restaurant and sipping a drink. \u201cHer message to them,\u201d said Gomez, \u201cwas clear from her ring.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden plans to address the strained US-Russia diplomatic relationship when he meets President Vladimir Putin next week with the hope that the two leaders can agree to send their ambassadors back to Washington and Moscow after months with no senior diplomat being present in either country, according to three sources familiar with the plans. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations. Not having an ambassador in either country has made conducting basic diplomacy even more difficult at a time when relations are already severely strained. Their departures signaled a new low point in an already tense relationship, and their return appears to be the only modest deliverable that the Biden administration is eyeing out of the high-stakes summit. The aspiration comes as the Biden administration has tempered expectations that the US and Russia would come away from the meeting with any groundbreaking agreements. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of US-Russia summits in terms of deliverables,\u201d National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters this week. \u201cWe are thinking of it as an opportunity to communicate what our intentions and capabilities are.\u201d Biden warns he'll tell Putin 'what I want him to know' as he defines goals of foreign tour A State Department spokesperson said that Sullivan will \u201creturn to Moscow in the coming weeks\u201d and that the US remains committed to \u201copen channels of communication with the Russian government, both to advance US interests and to reduce the risk of miscalculation between our countries.\u201d The US and Russia have engaged in tit-for-tat diplomacy which has shrunk the diplomatic footprint in each country dating back to the 1980s. But in recent years the reductions have been dramatic: In 2016 the US expelled 35 Russian intelligence operatives and shut down two Russian compounds, Putin expelled more than 700 US diplomats in 2017 and the US ordered Russia to close their consulates in San Francisco and Seattle in 2017 and 2018. In April, the US imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and announced it was expelling 10 Russian diplomats in response to Russia\u2019s election interference, cyberattacks, and human rights abuses in and the ongoing occupation of Crimea. In response, Russia announced that it was sanctioning eight senior US government officials, expelling 10 US diplomats and imposing sharp restrictions on personnel at the US Embassy. Brexit trouble overshadows Biden and Johnson's first meeting Retired US ambassador Kenneth Yalowitz, who served two tours in Moscow and as ambassador to Belarus and Georgia, told CNN that he would like to see Putin and Biden agree to return restore the ambassadors to their respective capitals and \u201crestoring the embassies to some of the levels that were there before all the sanctions.\u201d \u201cThis is not really a favor; this is not giving into the Russians. This is very much in our interest to have a fully functional embassy in Moscow which can project our values, can explain our positions,\u201d he said. Sending the ambassadors back to the capital cities of Cold War foes is viewed as a necessary step to keep open working-level dialogue between the two countries which will be pivotal as the Biden administration seeks a stable and predictable relationship with Russia, US officials told CNN. But they also acknowledge that more needs to be done to fix the deeply strained diplomatic relationship given the total number of US diplomats in Russia is at the lowest figure in modern history. \u201cThere has been a weaponization of diplomatic expulsions in recent years that is dangerous,\u201d said Heather Conley, a former State Department official for European issues who is now a senior vice president at CSIS, who also noted the cutback on consular affairs and issuances of visas which has reduced valuable exchanges between academics, experts and scientists from the two countries. Russia has also threatened to prevent the US from using locally employed Russian staff at the US embassy in Moscow \u2013 a figure currently in the hundreds \u2013 which would greatly diminish US capabilities at the embassy. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that \u201cthe decision of the Russian government to prohibit the United States from retaining, hiring, or contracting Russian or third-country staff will have a direct impact on hundreds of staff members and contract employees in Moscow, Vladivostok, and Yekaterinburg \u2013 colleagues who have dedicated themselves to working to advance positive relations between our two countries.\u201d US ambassador to Russia warned senators that Biden administration risks repeating predecessors' mistakes in dealing with Putin \u201cProhibiting their employment will also severely impact our operations, our remaining staff, and the mission community,\u201d they said. Sullivan briefed members of Congress in recent weeks about the status of the US diplomatic presence in Russia. Those briefed on the matter came away with a clear understanding that the status quo is not sustainable, explained two sources familiar with the briefings. The Biden administration has appointed a number of Russia with significant experience as foreign service officers \u2013 including stints in Moscow \u2013 to powerful posts, demonstrating just how important it is to develop that expertise. CIA Director Bill Burns, the US Ambassador to Russia during the George W. Bush administration, has been relied on heavily as the administration has developed a plan for how it will handle US-Russia relations, US officials told CNN. Another example is Victoria Nuland, the State Department Under Secretary for Political Affairs, who came through the ranks as a foreign service officer, spent time in Moscow and negotiated with the Russians throughout her career. There are concerns among US diplomats and Russia experts about the possibility of future miscalculation if the diplomatic drawdowns continue or are forced to accelerated. The limits in place could impede the US from developing Russia experts in the diplomatic corps who know how to interpret Russian signals, two US officials explained. Russian officials are known for being opaque and speaking in riddles, which is a challenge to understand for those without expertise. This is one reason the Biden administration is seeking to rebuild a more steady and regular US-Russia diplomatic relationship, the officials said. Angela Stent, a professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a former national intelligence officer for Russia at the State Department, noted that \u201cless contact makes it more difficult to understand what is going on, especially in Russia.\u201d Boris and Biden: A diplomatic odd couple faces pressure to define the US-UK relationship \u201cPeople at the State Department or at the Embassy need to be in regular contact with their counterparts, and to be able to comprehend how things function in Russia. Cutting back on personnel means losing some of that understanding,\u201d she said. By holding the summit the Biden administration is signaling a desire to keep open communication, from the top down. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that it is important for the president himself to articulate US expectations to Putin face-to-face, particularly because Putin has a \u201chighly personalized style of decision-making,\u201d explained. While sending the ambassadors back would not be a major deliverable, it would be a step towards stabilizing the fraught relationship which has been tremendously politicized in recent years which both leaders could cast in their favor. \u201cWe know the US-Russia relationship is a difficult relationship and it will remain very difficult. But a lot of practical, day-to-day work we need to do to advance our arms control dialogue, manage our maritime border and mitigate the effects from climate change cannot happen if there are not people in place to do the work,\u201d said Conley. \u201cEmbassies without ambassadors and diplomats increase the likelihood that the US-Russia relationship will continue to slide toward crisis.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The day before the White House announced that President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would hold their first in-person meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, the US ambassador to Russia privately told lawmakers he\u2019s worried about Washington giving concessions to Moscow without getting anything in return. In a two-hour briefing to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May, described to CNN by two people familiar with the matter, Ambassador John Sullivan suggested that Putin is not acting in good faith with the US and the Biden administration risks repeating the same mistakes of its predecessors if it does not approach the issue with clear eyes, according to one of the sources. The overarching theme of Sullivan\u2019s briefing was that Putin \u201chas not really changed his stripes,\u201d said the first source, despite efforts by the current administration and its predecessors to curb Putin\u2019s malign behavior with sticks, like sanctions, and to shape Russia\u2019s actions in other areas using diplomacy, including through in-person engagements. Sullivan\u2019s warnings are emblematic of the concerns that officials and lawmakers have expressed ahead of the summit, which is set to be held next week after Biden meets with NATO and European allies in the United Kingdom and Belgium. And within Biden\u2019s administration there has been vigorous debate about the right way to engage with Putin, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, particularly within the State Department. Many of Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats, along with Republicans, have grave concerns about the idea of his granting a meeting with Putin in the wake of aggressive Russian actions along the Ukrainian border and the jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. State Department spokesperson Ned Price declined to comment \u201con what was said during a classified hearing\u201d but called the characterizations of Sullivan\u2019s testimony \u201cwildly off base.\u201d \u201cThe Ambassador has been deeply engaged in preparations for the President\u2019s upcoming meeting with President Putin,\u201d Price said. \u201cAs we engage Russia in ways that advance American interests, we remain clear eyed about the challenges that Russia poses and will work to hold Russia to account for its reckless and adversarial actions.\u201d Price added that Sullivan will return to Moscow in the coming weeks and that the administration remains \u201ccommitted to open channels of communication with the Russian government, both to advance US interests and to reduce the risk of miscalculation between our countries.\u201d A White House spokesperson also said in a statement that \u201cPresident Biden and Ambassador Sullivan \u2013 indeed, our full national security team \u2013 are fully aligned on our approach to Russia and the upcoming summit with President Putin.\u201d Sullivan, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump but was asked by Biden to stay on in his role, has been advising the President\u2019s national security team ahead of the summit and has attended all of the White House\u2019s meetings on Russia leading up to the meeting. The whirlwind European trip was deliberately choreographed so that Biden would meet with key partners first and go into the Putin summit \u201cwith the wind at his back,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Monday. The administration used a similar playbook ahead of a US-China meeting in Alaska earlier this year \u2013 Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Indo-Pacific partners beforehand to reaffirm US support for democratic allies in the region. Biden has told his aides he believes Putin responds to signs of strength, something he feels is better conveyed in person rather than over the phone, according to people familiar with the conversation. He has held two phone calls with the Russian President that officials describe as direct \u2013 but without the type of personal interaction and body language derived from an in-person meeting. Looming over the Geneva talks are the summits Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, held with Putin, which drew heavy criticism after Trump appeared to side with the Russian leader on interference in the 2016 presidential election. Trump and Putin also met alone, without US aides or interpreters present, on multiple occasions. Sullivan on Monday said the White House was still determining the format of the Biden-Putin meeting and whether there would be a joint press conference afterward. Ambassador Sullivan\u2019s briefing last month appears to have left an impression on senators. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told CNN after the session \u2013 which he declined to comment on directly \u2013 that he didn\u2019t see an upside to the Geneva summit. \u201cVladimir Putin is in the midst of an attempt to assassinate and then silence a political opponent, attacking a political opponent with a banned chemical weapon in a foreign country,\u201d Kaine said, referring to Russia\u2019s attack on Navalny with the deadly poison Novichok. \u201cDo you think you can negotiate with a guy like that?\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, was similarly wary upon emerging from the briefing. \u201cI think we need to have a lot more backbone and make it very clear that what Russia is doing is unacceptable to us, and that there are going to be severe consequences for their malign actions,\u201d Romney told CNN. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN that Biden gave a \u201chuge gift to Putin\u201d ahead of the summit by not sanctioning the companies behind a controversial Russia-Germany gas pipeline that critics say will increase Russia\u2019s geopolitical leverage over Europe. Kaine aside, several Senate Democrats said they were confident that Biden would handle himself well with Putin, pointing to his experience both directly with the Russian leader and his long foreign policy record. \u201cI\u2019m not at all worried that he\u2019s going to get tricked or trapped,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat. \u201cThis is one of those instances where you\u2019re glad you have someone who served on the Foreign Relations Committee and vice president and various capacities in foreign policy for a long time. This would be a tough one for a rookie.\u201d \u201cHe knows how to handle the issues, but he\u2019s also very firm about our mission and our values,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat. \u201cI have all the confidence he\u2019ll handle him properly,\u201d Cardin said. Biden, known for his blunt talk to foreign leaders, will thus be walking a tightrope between forcefully condemning Putin\u2019s regional aggression, election interference efforts and hacking campaigns, and working to facilitate a more \u201cstable and predictable\u201d American relationship with Russia. \u201cWhat sounded like a good idea a month ago, I bet is causing a lot of regret now,\u201d said Jim Townsend, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO Policy, referring to the summit. Townsend pointed to a recent episode where the Russia-backed leader of Belarus forced down a plane to arrest a dissident journalist. \u201cThat showed that the problems with Russia are really severe,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cBiden is going to have to really dig in because a lot of people are watching. There is more of a premium now for him to come out looking tough.\u201d The administration has emphasized in recent days that it does not intend to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia, which would imply a willingness to forgive Moscow\u2019s past aggression. But it also wants to facilitate an early dialogue with the Kremlin to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings \u2013 something Biden finds easier to do directly, a White House official told CNN. Putin, too, has a \u201chighly personalized style of decision-making,\u201d national security adviser Sullivan told reporters on Monday. \u201cSo, it is important for President Biden to sit down with him face to face.\u201d Sullivan acknowledged, though, that the meeting is unlikely to yield immediate results. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of US-Russia summits in terms of deliverables,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are thinking of it as an opportunity to communicate what our intentions and capabilities are.\u201d Still, Putin is one of the few world leaders with whom Biden does not have a robust personal relationship, for better or worse. \u201cIt has been a fairly correct, albeit not cordial, relationship,\u201d said a former US official who worked closely with Biden on foreign policy issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is anything to it beyond that. Based on what I have seen of their interactions, it\u2019s just one professional politician talking to another. Not cold and hostile, but also not warm and chummy. It\u2019s just frank.\u201d That dynamic was on display last time they met in 2011, when Biden was vice president and the Obama administration was working on resetting the US-Russia relationship. When Putin suddenly proposed during a joint press conference that the countries introduce a \u201cvisa-free regime of exchange,\u201d Biden called it a \u201cgood idea.\u201d He backtracked when he realized that wasn\u2019t his call to make but managed to turn the awkward moment into a lighthearted, but pointed, swipe at Russia\u2019s political system. \u201cMr. Prime Minister, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s a real difference between being President and Vice President,\u201d he told Putin, who was serving as prime minister at the time because he was constitutionally barred from serving a third consecutive term as president. \u201cThe very good news is the President and I agree 100% on the need to continue to establish a closer and closer relationship.\u201d By 2014, the reset had all but failed with Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Relations between Washington and the Kremlin deteriorated further when Russia interfered in the 2016 election and spiraled following Russia\u2019s use of banned chemical nerve agents against perceived traitors on European soil while continuing its enduring disinformation campaigns targeting American voters. The administration earlier this year blamed Russia for the massive cyber-espionage campaign known as SolarWinds that affected dozens of federal agencies and private companies across the country. \u201cWe are not interested in a reset nor do we want escalation with Russia,\u201d Eric Green, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Russia, said during an event hosted by the Center for New American Security on Friday. Green said the White House believes \u201cthis a much different Russia\u201d than it was in 2009, one that is generally harder to deal with. But the administration also recognizes that some important things have not changed in the last decade, he said, specifically the fact that Russia still has one of the world\u2019s largest nuclear arsenals. The country is also still a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, \u201cwhich means, whether we like it or not, we have to work with them on certain core challenges out there in the world,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut we have no illusions about what is happening inside Russia and we don\u2019t see a lot of opportunities for real constructive engagement in a lot of areas.\u201d Fundamentally, Biden believes that Putin, like most world leaders, is \u201ca rational actor\u201d who will ultimately always act in his own best interests, said two former officials who worked closely with Biden on these issues. But the President also understands that Putin\u2019s values are unlikely to ever align with traditional western values, said one of the former officials, and Biden is proud of his record of not mincing words with the Russian leader. Over the years, Biden has repeatedly recounted to aides the story of when he first met with Putin and told him directly that, contrary to what George W. Bush had apparently surmised upon their first meeting a decade earlier, Biden didn\u2019t think Putin had a soul at all. Biden told The New Yorker that Putin seemed pleased by the assessment. \u201cWe understand each other,\u201d Biden said Putin told him. Biden gave a blunt answer earlier this year when he was asked by ABC whether he believes Putin is \u201ca killer.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. The remark sparked uproar in Russia, which responded by recalling its ambassador to the US and warning of an \u201cirreversible deterioration of relations.\u201d Ambassador Sullivan, meanwhile, has still not returned to Moscow after being asked to leave by the Kremlin \u2013 a sign that relations remain at a low point. The administration has asserted, though, that Biden is meeting with Putin because of their differences, and not in spite of them. \u201cAt the end of the day, what we are looking to do is for the two presidents to be able to send a clear signal \u2026 to their teams on questions of strategic stability so we can make progress on arms control and other nuclear areas to reduce tension and instability in that aspect of their relationship,\u201d the national security adviser told reporters on Monday. \u201cAnd second,\u201d he added, \u201cbeing able to look President Putin in the eye and say, \u2018This is what America\u2019s expectations are. This is what America stands for. This is what America\u2019s all about.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Listen to this audio, exclusively obtained by CNN, of Rudy Giuliani in July 2019 \u2013 when he was still President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and henchman \u2013 cajoling an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Joe Biden. Giuliani\u2019s call was a precursor to the infamous call where Trump pressured Zelensky, a move that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial. The fact of Giuliani\u2019s call was previously known, but the audio makes the pressure clear. \u201cAll we need from the President [Zelensky] is to say, I\u2019m gonna put an honest prosecutor in charge, he\u2019s gonna investigate and dig up the evidence, that presently exists and is there any other evidence about involvement of the 2016 election, and then the Biden thing has to be run out,\u201d Giuliani said, according to the audio. \u201c\u2026 Somebody in Ukraine\u2019s gotta take that seriously.\u201d CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen and Matthew Chance write: The new audio demonstrates how Giuliani aggressively cajoled the Ukrainians to do Trump\u2019s bidding. And it undermines Trump\u2019s oft-repeated assertion that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d where Zelensky could secure US government support if he did political favors for Trump. The call was one of the opening salvos in the years-long quest by Trump and his allies to damage Biden and subvert the 2020 election process \u2013 by soliciting foreign meddling, lying about voter fraud, attempting to overturn the results, and inciting the deadly January 6 assault on the Capitol. A catalog of anti-democratic activity. That last clause, in which they line up examples of Trump\u2019s pre- and post-election attempts against Biden, represents a chronicle of anti-democratic subversion. Giuliani dangled an in-person meeting between Trump and Zelensky, essentially in exchange for Zelensky investigating Biden. Listening to it now \u2013 with the knowledge that Trump would ultimately be impeached, twice, and that Giuliani would find himself under criminal investigation for his international efforts on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2013 does not make Giuliani brazenly trading on American world power for Trump\u2019s political gain less jarring. Biden invites Zelensky to White House\u2026 later. The Ukrainian President was denied a White House meeting with Trump, perhaps because he refused to investigate Biden. Now, Biden will give Zelensky that courtesy, national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced Monday, after the leaders talked on the phone. But the meeting won\u2019t happen until after Biden meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in a planned summit in Geneva next week. Zelensky is far from happy with Biden. He told Axios he had wanted desperately to meet before Biden\u2019s Putin meeting. Russia has been the aggressor against Ukraine by seizing control of Crimea in 2014 and raised serious recent concerns when it conducted military exercises just across its border with Ukraine. Sullivan said Biden promised Zelensky on Monday that he would \u201cstand up firmly for Ukraine sovereignty, territorial integrity and its aspirations as we go forward.\u201d At immediate issue is the Nord-2 pipeline, which Russia will use to bypass Ukraine as it sends gas to the European Union. Biden decided to not forcefully oppose the pipeline as Zelensky had hoped, by sanctioning European companies involved. Ukrainians fear they will become more isolated if Russia has easier access around them to Europe. Read more here. Zelensky told Axios last week Biden\u2019s decision to let Russia proceed with the pipeline would be a victory for Putin and Moscow. In a Washington Post Op-Ed, Biden promised to make Ukraine and European security a main topic of his meeting with Putin. Biden sees his presidency as a key moment in world history as democracies square off against autocracies, like China and Russia, where a small group of leaders have consolidated power and crush opposition. Biden\u2019s list of gripes with Russia is very long and includes: In March, Biden told Good Morning America that Putin would pay a price for his election interference and told George Stephanopoulos he thinks Putin is a killer. Biden said he once told Putin to his face: \u201cI don\u2019t think you have a soul.\u201d Putin\u2019s response, according to Biden, was, \u201cI think we understand each other.\u201d \u201cStrategic stability.\u201d Now they\u2019ll be squaring off as opposing leaders, but Biden is, first and foremost, seeking stability, Sullivan told reporters. \u201cAt the end of the day what we are looking to do is for the two Presidents to be able to send a clear signal\u2026 to their teams on questions of strategic stability so we can make progress on arms control and other nuclear areas to reduce tension and instability in that aspect of their relationship,\u201d Sullivan said. Also, what America stands for. Here\u2019s more Sullivan: \u201cAnd second, being able to look President Putin in the eye and say, \u2018This is what America\u2019s expectations are. This is what America stands for. This is what America\u2019s all about.\u2019 This we believe is an essential aspect of US- Russian diplomacy because President Putin is a singular kind of personalized leader and having the opportunity to come together at a summit will allow us to manage this relationship and stand up and defend American values most effectively.\u201d Trump\u2019s subversion continues. Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming congresswoman stripped of her leadership role by House Republicans, made a provocative point on CNN\u2019s Axe Files podcast. Trump, she told CNN\u2019s David Axelrod, increasingly sounds like the Chinese Communist Party when he questions the US election system. \u201cWhen he says that our system doesn\u2019t work \u2026 when he suggests that it\u2019s, you know, incapable of conveying the will of the people, you know, that somehow it\u2019s failed \u2013 those are the same things that the Chinese government says about us,\u201d Cheney continued. \u201cAnd and it\u2019s very dangerous and damaging \u2026 and it\u2019s not true.\u201d Ransom recovery. From CNN\u2019s report: US investigators have recovered millions of dollars in cryptocurrency paid in ransom to hackers whose attack prompted the shutdown of the key East Coast pipeline last month, according to people briefed on the matter. \u2026 The ransom recovery is a rare outcome for a company that has fallen victim to a debilitating cyberattack in the booming criminal business of ransomware. New security rules for US pipelines after attack. From CNN\u2019s report: The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday will mandate that critical pipeline operators comply with several cybersecurity measures, including reporting cybersecurity incidents to the department within 12 hours, according to DHS officials. Death knell for voting bill. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin doesn\u2019t necessarily oppose the voting rights bill Democrats want to push through Congress. He just wants bipartisanship. It\u2019s a prerequisite for his vote, much less his support for circumventing the filibuster. Which basically means the voting bill is dead. And it may mean the same for Biden\u2019s wish for a massive infrastructure bill. Actually, Manchin opposes the restrictive state laws Democrats want to supercede with a federal voting law, he writes in The West Virginia Gazette. But he won\u2019t support any remedy that\u2019s not bipartisan. \u201cThe truth, I would argue, is that voting and election reform that is done in a partisan manner will all but ensure partisan divisions continue to deepen,\u201d he writes. His faith that Republicans will be willing to work with Democrats is, I think, contra the recent history of Republicans in the minority, but we shall see. Manchin: Yes, this process can be frustrating and slow. It will force compromises that are not always ideal. But consider the alternative. Do we really want to live in an America where one party can dictate and demand everything and anything it wants, whenever it wants? I have always said, \u201cIf I can\u2019t go home and explain it, I can\u2019t vote for it.\u201d And I cannot explain strictly partisan election reform or blowing up the Senate rules to expedite one party\u2019s agenda. Chris Cillizza\u2019s succinct analysis: Joe Manchin just totally screwed Democrats. Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to male-only draft. From CNN\u2019s report: The court\u2019s order means that for now even though the draft is not implemented, only men will still be required to register for the selective service. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh wrote to explain their vote noting that Congress may take up the issue in the short term. \u201cAt least for now,\u201d Sotomayor wrote, \u201cthe court\u2019s longstanding deference to Congress on matters of national defense and military affairs cautions against granting review while Congress actively weighs the issue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A cadre of aides and advisers working to tame Donald Trump\u2019s obsession with the 2020 election, including his fixation with debunked voter fraud theories and ballot audits, are realizing the task at hand is much tougher than they thought. Over the past few weeks, Trump has faced pleas from inside his orbit to move the ball forward as Republicans approach the 2022 midterm elections, when the party hopes to regain control of both congressional chambers, and brace for his high-profile return to the campaign trail. Several former advisers and allies still close to the 45th President said he is under mounting pressure to concentrate on promoting GOP policy priorities and defining his successor, rather than re-litigating his failed reelection campaign. But the former President has brushed those voices aside, choosing instead to listen to a crowd of characters both on television and in his wider circle who have encouraged him to keep his focus on the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s preoccupation with the election is expected to take center stage on Saturday, when he kicks off his first post-presidential summer with an address to the North Carolina Republican Party. The speech, a preview of the campaign-style rallies he plans to start hosting next month, will signal to what degree he intends to ignore advice from those imploring him to redirect his message toward the future. Because it will be his first public appearance in three months, sources close to the former President said the tack he decides to take will be critical in setting the course going forward \u2013 not only for him, but for all Republicans on the ballot in 2022. Sources familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking describe him as bored by the issues his advisers wish he would focus on \u2013 from threats to America\u2019s energy infrastructure to increased inflation and other economic concerns. He is so obsessed with his unsuccessful quest for reelection, one ex-Trump official said, that he has been moving himself toward irrelevance. \u201cIt\u2019s like a slow leak of a balloon that is now laying on the floor,\u201d is how the ex-Trump official described it. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Lately, Trump\u2019s obsession with 2020 has also led him to indulge unhinged and false notions about being \u201creinstated\u201d as commander-in-chief, according to three people familiar with these conversations, one of whom said he has been constantly watching the conspiracy-laden TV channel One America News and intensely following an ongoing Republican-demanded audit of votes in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County. Trump has claimed the Arizona audit could lead to similar investigations in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia that would ultimately prove he won the 2020 election, one person close to Trump said. The reinstatement theory Trump has been sharing with aides was first reported by The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman on Tuesday. Should Trump use his Saturday appearance to deliver a public tirade about 2020, he could hobble GOP efforts to develop a compelling message for the midterm cycle. To prevent that from happening, he has received advice from several corners of his orbit to deliver a forward-looking speech featuring fresh lines of attack against President Joe Biden and bold references to GOP policy priorities. Some Trump allies hope his remarks will serve as a blueprint for Republican candidates seeking to court his supporters on their own between now and next November, while others find the prospect of him focusing on anything but 2020 laughable. One ally trying to guide Trump in his messaging is Sen. Lindsey Graham, according to a source familiar with their conversations. While the South Carolina Republican has been realistic about Trump\u2019s fixation on 2020 \u2013 recognizing that it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to get him to steer totally clear of that topic \u2013 he has encouraged Trump to deliver a speech that is \u201ctwo-thirds forward-looking, one-third grievance,\u201d the source said. \u201cAny good consultant will tell him to look ahead, not back and that would be good advice,\u201d said David Kochel, a Republican strategist for multiple presidential campaigns. \u201cBut one of Trump\u2019s superpowers is knowing exactly what his audience wants. They want the hits, and the #1 hit on the charts right now is \u2018Stop the Steal.\u2019 There\u2019s no way he can give a speech without playing that tune.\u201d More likely than not, Trump\u2019s remarks will resemble the address he delivered to the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. In that speech, Trump thrilled the crowd of grassroots activists by castigating what he called a \u201cvery sick and corrupt electoral process\u201d and teased a 2024 White House run by saying he may even decide to beat Democrats \u201cfor a third time.\u201d As is the case with his speech this weekend, his CPAC address was drafted by the same speechwriting crew Trump worked with inside the West Wing: Stephen Miller, Vincent Haley and Ross Worthington. While some allies have floated Trump\u2019s Saturday appearance as the ideal launchpad for an updated stump speech, the internal push to get him to ditch his intense preoccupation with election fraud goes well beyond his visit to North Carolina. The behind-the-scenes effort, which has included Graham, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox News host Sean Hannity, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and other outside advisers, has shifted into full gear amid mounting fears that Trump is alienating certain voters and forcing Republican candidates to adopt the wrong foil in a critical election cycle. \u201cThe conspiracy theories and election fraud rhetoric are helpful for keeping a certain audience engaged but they do virtually nothing to move other voters \u2013 especially those who care about pocketbook issues \u2013 into our column,\u201d said one person close to Trump. \u201cAt some point, the election integrity stuff just becomes dull,\u201d this person added. \u201cWe\u2019re six months out and I think we\u2019re starting to see that happen. He can keep running through the greatest hits but he needs to weave in some new material too.\u201d The overwhelming expectation that Trump will instead veer off script on Saturday has many Republicans, including some in his inner circle, questioning whether his reemergence onto the political scene at this point is a good idea. In the weeks following his North Carolina appearance, Trump has plans to resume his signature rallies in Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, according to a senior adviser. This very public re-entry into electoral politics has already left Republicans grappling with how the former President fits into the party\u2019s future \u2013 including whether his fixation on 2020 is stymying GOP efforts to regain power in next year\u2019s midterms and beyond. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s insane conspiracy theories about the election cost Republicans the two Georgia Senate runoffs and with them, our seat at the table in Washington,\u201d said Michael Steel, a former aide to House speaker John Boehner and Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cIf you actually care about conservative public policy \u2013 stopping tax hikes and massive government spending, securing the border, supporting the police \u2013 you have to focus on the future, not the past.\u201d On several occasions since Trump left office, Republicans have become so distracted by the former President\u2019s demands for loyalty that they have missed valuable opportunities to launch effective broadsides against congressional Democrats and Biden, whose approval rating continues to hover above 50 percent. Most recently, House Republicans spent three weeks orchestrating the ouster and replacement of Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who has flatly rejected Trump\u2019s election lies, in the midst of a dismal jobs report for the Biden administration, swelling inflation and the migrant crisis at the US-Mexico border. Some of Trump\u2019s aides have thus been left to wonder if now is the right time to deploy him as a surrogate for the GOP, having already witnessed the disruptive impact his election fraud obsession has had on the party\u2019s ability to craft a succinct message for 2022. They question whether the time he spends publicly griping will do more harm to the Republican Party\u2019s prospects of regaining control of the House and Senate next fall. One of the people close to Trump said it may be smart to limit his public appearances for the time being as GOP candidates settle on a midterm message that he can then echo at rallies next year. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to let him spend the next 17 months talking about how our elections are rigged ahead of a midterm election where turnout is going to determine how well Republicans perform. We all saw what happened in Georgia,\u201d this person said, referring to claims that Trump inadvertently suppressed GOP votes in two January Senate runoff contests by repeatedly telling Georgia voters his 2020 defeat in their state was the result of widespread voter fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s totally possible this rally tour is going to backfire in exactly the same way if he continues to beat the drum on this one issue,\u201d the person added. Others, including Meadows, are looking forward to Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail due to his unique ability to connect with the party\u2019s grassroots base, according to a person familiar with his thinking. But Republican leaders hoping for a reliable messenger are ignoring Trump\u2019s nature, said Republican strategist Liam Donovan. \u201cHe cares about the party and its fortunes to the extent it furthers his interests, but as a private citizen circa 2022 he has vanishingly little skin in the game,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cNobody should be surprised that he is more focused on nursing 2020 grudges than helping Republicans win next fall.\u201d",

            "article_content": "This Bud\u2019s for you, and anyone else ready to roll up their sleeve to put the pandemic behind them. The White House\u2019s new partnership with Anheuser-Busch offering free beers if the country reaches its goal of getting 70% of adults at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot by July 4 \u2013 almost Prohibition in reverse \u2013 is more than a gimmick. It\u2019s a headline that heralds a widening, more micro-targeted approach to getting skeptical Americans vaccinated against Covid-19 and a shift from an approach that saw mass vaccination sites in stadiums earlier this year. It\u2019s also a sign of growing concern about slowing inoculation rates, fears that millions of unprotected Americans could be vulnerable to new viral spikes in the fall and a desire to preserve the miracle wrought by vaccines. After several days in which Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s just-released emails painted a picture of foreboding at the beginning of the crisis last year, President Joe Biden conjured up the prospect of a Covid-free future at the White House. \u201cGet a shot and have a beer. Free beer for everyone 21 years or over to celebrate the independence from the virus,\u201d he said. There\u2019s more than free booze on offer from the teetotaler Biden and his web of private-sector partnerships announced on Wednesday to convince skeptics to get vaccinated. Go for a trim in a Black-owned barbershop \u2013 traditional community hubs \u2013 and a Covid-19 vaccine comes at no extra cost. Parents who get the shots can get free child care while they\u2019re inoculated. Cities will compete to grow vaccination rates. Employers can cash in tax credits if they let workers feeling side effects from the vaccine take time off. And Vice President Kamala Harris is adding to her growing portfolio of intractable issues, which includes voting rights and stemming the stream of humanity approaching the US southern border, by launching a national vaccine tour. The raft of incentives builds on the success of states like Ohio that saw vaccine rates improve when they adopted strategies like million-dollar lotteries for those that had their injections. Officials always knew that the country would reach a point where the supply of once-scarce shots would outstrip the demand. The fact that so many people are now at least partially protected, and the virus has by consequence ebbed, may mean that latecomers see less need to get inoculated. \u201cBecause we have had so much success early on, we are now getting to the part of the campaign which is tougher,\u201d Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d on Wednesday. The new White House vaccine push reflected important public health, economic and political considerations. The fear of new human misery later in the year, after nearly 600,000 US deaths from Covid-19, is a powerful motivating factor. The return of the virus with a vengeance in some regions could also hamper the economic rebound, which has been halting in places amid complications in getting millions of Americans back to work. Making good on new government predictions of 5% economic growth this year is vital to Biden in a political sense, as well. The President has made ending the pandemic the core project of his administration and hopes to ride into midterm elections next year by telling Americans that he has delivered. But the seven-day average of new vaccines administered tumbled from more than 3 million per day in early April to just over 1 million per day before the Memorial Day weekend, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Some 136 million Americans are fully vaccinated. But the percentage of US adults who have had at least one dose is at 62.8%, meaning that Biden\u2019s target of 70% before Independence Day could represent a challenge. But in an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Thursday, Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases specialist, said that the country was on a \u201creally good track now to really crush this outbreak.\u201d He also said he was \u201cfairly\u201d confident that the US would not see the infectious surges after the Memorial Day holiday as were observed after holidays last year. The President promised Americans a golden summer on Wednesday as the country reopens at a rapid pace and the economic recovery accelerates. But he leavened his cheerleading with a stark warning of a possible grim winter \u2013 unless more citizens overcome their unwillingness to get vaccines. \u201cAmerica is headed into the summer dramatically different from last year\u2019s summer: A summer of freedom, a summer of joy, a summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves,\u201d he said. But the President added: \u201cWhat happens after the summer? \u2026 For all the progress we\u2019re making as a country, if you are unvaccinated, you are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading disease to others, especially when Americans spend more time indoors again closely gathered in the fall, and as we face the potential threat of a new, more dangerous variants.\u201d The President\u2019s warning raises a prospect that has been troubling health professionals: that there could be hot spots of infection in the winter, especially in areas of the country where vaccine take-up has been low. In some scenarios, this could mean America\u2019s deep divides being sketched in a pattern of higher Covid-19 infections. Data shows a tendency for residents of more politically conservative states and counties to be more skeptical of vaccines, often in a way that mirrors the laxer adherence to coronavirus mitigation measures. Former President Donald Trump won all but seven of the 50 counties with the lowest percentage of fully vaccinated adults in the country in the last election, according to a CNN Politics analysis of May 20 data from the CDC. The analysis does not include data from nine states (Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia) where less than 85% of the vaccination records had valid information about a person\u2019s county of residence or the CDC otherwise had incomplete data. With that in mind, it was notable that Biden argued that getting a shot was not a partisan act. \u201cThe science was done under Democratic and Republican administrations. Matter of fact, the first vaccines were authorized under a Republican President and widely developed by a Democratic President,\u201d he said. Still, it remains unclear how effective Biden can be in addressing grassroots Trump supporters, many of whom do not believe he is a legitimate President thanks to his predecessor\u2019s campaign of lies about a stolen election. That\u2019s one reasons why the prospect of using Trump as a messenger keeps bubbling up. The former President, however, doesn\u2019t seem to have much interest in public service announcements, other than claiming the vaccines as a personal achievement that saved the country. In fact, he took his own shot behind closed doors before leaving the White House. There are multiple reasons beyond politics, for example, why people may choose not to get a vaccine. There is mistrust of government scientists and experts in some communities. Some African Americans are suspicious of mass vaccination campaigns for historical reasons. Some rural areas that have not seen heavy concentrations of the virus and where people live further apart than in cities may see vaccines as less of a priority. Young people, who are less likely to get seriously ill or die but who can still have long-lasting effects from Covid-19, are a particular concern for health officials. Despite public information campaigns, confusion remains among some Americans over whether they are eligible to get the shots. Relentless misinformation and politicization by some conservative media outlets hardly help in this regard. Dr. Seema Yasmin, a former CDC disease detective, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Wednesday that the month of action on vaccines was important because it was targeting different communities in different ways. \u201cOne of the things that annoys me about public health is when we have a one-size-fits-all message for everyone: \u2018Just go get vaccinated, it\u2019s safe,\u2019 \u201d Yasmin said. \u201cIn reality, you speak to six people on the fence about vaccines \u2026 you can hear six very different reasons \u2013 historical, geographical, cultural, faith-based reasons \u2013 as to why they may not be very confident about getting vaccinated.\u201d That is why government officials are now stressing almost a one-by-one approach to getting sufficient Americans vaccinated in order to beat back the virus. \u201cThis is not just about what government can do. It\u2019s about what each of us can do. It\u2019s about you making the decision to get vaccinated and about you talking to your family and friends,\u201d Murthy told Tapper.",

The Army is not investigating these statements further at this time,\u201d an Army spokesperson said in a statement. Given the fact that Flynn is retired, the Army\u2019s decision is in line with the US military\u2019s typical approach to similar situations, when potential misconduct carried out by retired members who are out of uniform does not prompt an investigation by the armed services. Flynn is facing bipartisan criticism after appearing to endorse a Myanmar-style coup in the US during an event in Dallas on Sunday in which an audience member raised the idea. \u201cI want to know why what happened in Minamar (sic)can\u2019t happen here?\u201d the audience member, who identified himself as a Marine, asked Flynn. \u201cNo reason, I mean, it should happen here. No reason. That\u2019s right,\u201d Flynn responded. A message posted to a Parler account used by Flynn on Monday, however, claimed Flynn\u2019s words had been twisted. Flynn says he didn't endorse Myanmar-style coup after he appears to back plan in video exchange \u201cLet me be VERY CLEAR - There is NO reason whatsoever for any coup in America, and I do not and have not at any time called for any action of that sort,\u201d the message said. Some QAnon followers are obsessed with the idea that the US military will somehow put former President Donald Trump back into office. Some believed and hoped Trump would declare martial law on Inauguration Day to stop Joe Biden from entering the White House. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cthe department is not going to have an official comment one way on this.\u201d Flynn\u2019s comments have prompted criticism from some lawmakers, including Rep.

But as his case swerved toward a possible brief prison sentence, Flynn fired his lawyers, replacing them with a defense team that worked to unravel his plea in court, and publicly campaigned for a pardon, which he ultimately received from Trump in November.

            "article_content": "On Election Day in November, Democrats across Texas waited with hopeful anticipation. High early-voter turnout, recent political trends and changing demographics fueled one burning question: Could the state actually turn blue this cycle? By midnight, the answer was a resounding no. Then-President Donald Trump easily carried Texas, by 5.6 percentage points. And while Democrats gained one seat in the state Senate, they didn\u2019t pick up a single seat in the state House, nor win any of the competitive US congressional races in Texas. Still, Trump\u2019s lead in Texas was the narrowest for a Republican presidential candidate in years. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the state by 16 points. In 2016, Trump won by 9 points. Conventional wisdom suggests that such a downward trend for Republicans might spur the party to adapt and become more moderate. But that hasn\u2019t been the case in the nearly seven months since the election. Republican leaders here feel more emboldened than ever to push forward with conservative priorities, embodied by the Texas Legislature, which is about to conclude its most conservative sessions in recent memory. Similar to other Republican-led states that have pushed major conservative initiatives this year, the Texas Legislature, which meets once every two years, has passed a bill that bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected and one that eliminates the permit and training requirements to carry a handgun. And with only a few days left in the session, lawmakers are still trying to push an election overhaul with new voting restrictions and legislation that would ban the teaching of critical race theory, among other agenda items. The state is changing demographically and is set to gain two congressional seats in the upcoming redistricting process, due to the state\u2019s rapid population growth over the past decade. While some Republicans are on edge about the future of the party, many of its state leaders see the GOP\u2019s success in Texas last cycle as a mandate to continue moving to the right. Republicans also tout the gains that Trump made in the typically Democratic stronghold of South Texas, flipping several counties that voted for Clinton in 2016 and making massive inroads in others. Of the 17 counties that Clinton won in 2016, Trump took back seven of them. In Starr County, along the southern border, for example, Trump had lost to Clinton by 60 percentage points. But in 2020, he lost to Joe Biden by only 5 percentage points in the same county. \u201cFor every Karen we lost in the suburbs, we gained a Julio,\u201d said one GOP operative in the state. Lt. Col. Allen West walked across the street of an affluent neighborhood in a Dallas suburb, followed by a throng of supporters who gathered at a fundraiser to meet the former congressman who\u2019s now chairman of the Texas Republican Party. He came outside for an interview \u2013 CNN had been initially invited to the event but was escorted off the property upon arrival \u2013 as dozens of donors surrounded him. He was there to speak to The Southlake Families PAC, a group that funded school board candidates who opposed teaching critical race theory in a local election that gained national attention. West, who helped spearhead the GOP agenda for the legislative session, pushed back at critics who think the Legislature is shifting too far to the right. He pointed to the droves of people moving to Texas from traditionally blue states like California, New York and New Jersey as examples of the party\u2019s success in policy. \u201cTexas is a strong, successful, constitutional conservative red state,\u201d he said. As for concerns that the agenda might push away middle-of-the-road voters, West used an old political trope. \u201cYou know what my dad taught me?\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in Georgia. He said the only thing in the middle of the road is roadkill, and I don\u2019t want to be roadkill.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment underwritten by Trump\u2019s still influential and unabashed style. Many of the state\u2019s leaders, who are up for reelection next year, are keenly aware of the power he continues to hold over the party, especially with potential endorsements. Attorney General Ken Paxton, who could soon be facing a primary challenge from Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, is among the former President\u2019s biggest allies. He helped lead a lawsuit alleging election fraud in four states that was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court. Trump said in a statement that he\u2019ll be making an endorsement in the primary race, which Bush is expected to join next week. Even Bush, whose family, critical of the former President, has been routinely maligned by Trump in recent years, has shown support for him. \u201cI like them both very much,\u201d Trump said in the statement Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ll be making my endorsement and recommendation to the great people of Texas in the not-so-distant future.\u201d Trump\u2019s baseless claims that the election was stolen still loom large nationwide and here in Texas. For his part, West attended a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Dallas after the election and refuses to acknowledge that Joe Biden got more votes than Trump. When asked three times about the election results in November, West responded with the same carefully crafted answer: \u201cI believe that there were unconstitutional actions that led  to nefarious things that happened in five battleground states.\u201d Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard has been representing the Austin area in the Texas Legislature since 2006. She fought hard this year against the abortion bill, and she joined fellow Democrats onstage late Tuesday night to celebrate one of the few victories her party had this year: running out the clock on a bill that would prevent transgender students from playing on sports teams that aligned with their gender identities. \u201cWe\u2019ve just swung totally to the right,\u201d she said, standing outside her office underneath the state Capitol and reflecting on the past few months of the legislative session. \u201cIt\u2019s been like steamrolling of all these red meat wedge issues and not focused on what we came in here to deal with.\u201d Howard acknowledged Texas is still a red state but was among those who had expected Democrats to do better here in the 2020 election, especially after they performed well in the state in 2018 and Beto O\u2019Rourke came close to defeating incumbent GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. Like many Democrats, Howard argued that her party suffered in 2020 from adhering to social distancing guidelines and not doing the kind of in-person door knocking and grassroots politicking that can be so effective. They\u2019re already focused on trying to regain momentum for the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cThe blue wave is growing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s actually going to get here.\u201d That\u2019s in large part because primaries are king in Texas. Very few state lawmakers have competitive general elections, so courting the base is still the main objective for most politicians. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political incentive for those in the state House or in the state Senate, who are Republicans, to do anything but appeal to the base,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a veteran GOP strategist in the state. \u201cThey\u2019re not having to necessarily wage a competitive general election campaign, and so until that changes \u2013 and we are seeing trends that that\u2019s going to happen \u2013 I think you\u2019ll continue to see this out of our state Legislature,\u201d he added. Steinhauser ran the campaign for Michael Wood, an anti-Trump Republican who competed and lost in this month\u2019s special election to replace Republican Rep. Ron Wright of Arlington. Wright died from Covid-19 in February, and Trump endorsed his widow, Susan Wright, who has advanced to a runoff this summer for the final election. While many Republicans, like Allen West, think that Trump steered the party in the right direction, some conservatives, like Steinhauser, are concerned that as the electorate in Texas becomes younger and more diverse, Republicans will have problems. For Steinhauser, that fear of a blue wave down the road is very real. \u201cWe find ourselves having been very successful in the last cycle, but also kind of worried about the long-term future of the party, worried about demographic changes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really weird place to be in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A Vietnam veteran who allegedly brought Mason jar bombs to Capitol Hill on January 6 had scoped out the Capitol Building in December by driving around it, and had called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s office and tried to visit the Republican at home, a court filing revealed on Monday. The filing provides new details about a right-wing follower\u2019s response to the election fraud myth in one of the most serious Capitol riot criminal cases. Lonnie Leroy Coffman of Alabama had also participated in a paramilitary patrol on the southern border seven years ago, and on January 6, carried information about border enforcement paramilitary groups, the court filing said. Prosecutors revealed many of the details about Coffman\u2019s political inclinations to the court in recent weeks under seal, but federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly described them in a public opinion Monday to keep him in jail as he awaits trial. Coffman has pleaded not guilty, and his family has described him as a troubled Vietnam veteran who suffers from mental health issues. Coffman was arrested shortly after the Capitol riot on several weapons charges because of the arsenal he carried in his truck on January 6. As the investigation progressed, investigators were able to see Coffman\u2019s movements up to January 6 because of a GPS device found in his truck, the filing said. The long tail of Trump's Big Lie: 9 ways it continues to affect American politics Cruz\u2019s office also had notes about his call on December 11. \u201cMan says that he went to [Senator Cruz\u2019s] DC home to visit him with no answer at the door, and then called to try to arrange a meeting with him over the phone. Directed him to the scheduler\u2019s email address. He is also looking for contact info for S. Hannity, M. Levin, and R. Limbaugh,\u201d a Cruz staffer had noted. The staffer also told US Capitol Police that Coffman seemed \u201cnot 100% there\u201d during the call and that he seemed \u201cto be coming from the \u2018friend\u2019 angle in wanting to \u2026 help with the election fraud he saw,\u201d according to the court record. In addition to militia contact details found in his wallet from January 6, Coffman had been on the FBI\u2019s radar from a 2014 trip to Camp Lonestar, where armed groups meet to patrol the US-Mexico border for immigrants. He had taken a shotgun and pistol there, the court filings say. The camp\u2019s address and the name of a Texas militia member were on a paper in his wallet January 6, prosecutors said, and investigators who searched his home also found documents about another militia group. \u201cThis evidence indicates that Mr. Coffman had potential plans to coordinate with other members of the January 6, 2021 riots at the United States Capitol,\u201d Kollar-Kotelly wrote in the opinion Monday. His connections to militia groups, the judge noted, \u201craise questions about Mr. Coffman\u2019s community ties and his willingness to engage in armed paramilitary activity.\u201d Coffman\u2019s criminal allegations are some of the most chilling to emerge from the Capitol riot investigation. Coffman had parked his truck blocks from the Capitol building and left it to sit there for most of January 6. Inside the truck or on him, Coffman had a shotgun, a rifle, three pistols and 11 Mason jar bombs inside a cooler that, if detonated, could have acted like napalm. Law enforcement had cordoned off the truck midday on January 6, and stopped him before he returned to there, court filings say. Republicans have downplayed the US Capitol riot violence. The evidence paints a different picture. Where Coffman had gone during the day was a mystery, court filings previously said, but on Monday, the judge revealed that investigators had found photos of Coffman among the crowd around the Capitol. Coffman had been living out of his truck in DC for a week, prosecutors say, and also had handwritten notes with names of elected officials and a federal judge he noted to be a \u201cbad guy.\u201d On Monday, the judge also noted that investigators had found a second list in his home, where he noted to locate people, and listed unnamed people as \u201cex Dem. Senator, traitor,\u201d \u201cbillionaire oilman & fund-raiser for Obama,\u201dand \u201cG.E., Obama\u2019s lap dog.\u201d In a 24-page ruling explaining her decision to keep Coffman in jail, Kollar-Kotelly said \u201cthe record contains a variety of compelling evidence\u201d detailing his alleged preparations for the day of the Capitol riot, including \u201chis possession of substantial weaponry, his militia connections, and his specific targeting of political figures, all of which demonstrate a concrete and prospective threat to the community posed by Mr. Coffman\u2019s release.\u201d CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, the first high-level encounter between the US and Russia since President Joe Biden took office, which comes amid heightened tensions between the former Cold War foes \u2013 friction Blinken acknowledged right away. \u201cIt\u2019s also no secret that we have our differences,\u201d Blinken said at the top of the meeting, after he and Lavrov had greeted each other warmly. \u201cWhen it comes to those differences, as President Biden has also shared with President Putin, if Russia acts aggressively against us, our partners, our allies, we\u2019ll respond,\u201d Blinken said as he and Lavrov sat facing each other at a long rectangular table flanked by their delegations. \u201cAnd President Biden has demonstrated that in both word and deed, not for purposes of escalation, not to seek conflict, but to defend our interests.\u201d Biden singles out competition with Russia and China in Coast Guard commencement But the top US diplomat added a caveat. \u201cHaving said that, there are many areas where our interests intersect and overlap,\u201d he said, and urged cooperation on a range of \u201cintersecting interests\u201d including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, dealing with the nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, and Afghanistan. \u201cWe seek a predictable, stable relationship with Russia,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s good for our people, good for the Russian people and indeed good for the world.\u201d Lavrov responded by saying that Russia\u2019s \u201cposition is clear. We are prepared to discuss all issues on the table, with the understanding that our discussions will be honest, factual and with mutual respect.\u201d But he, too, added a caveat, telling Blinken that \u201cwe greatly diverge when it comes to our assessment of international situation and our approaches towards how we should resolve it.\u201d And Lavrov appeared to signal that whatever steps the Biden administration might take against Russia, Moscow stands ready to respond. \u201cLaws of diplomacy recommend mutuality, especially when it comes to response to any kind of hostile actions,\u201d the Russian foreign minister said. \u201cYou can always rely on us to respond mutually to such intentions.\u201d Blinken and Lavrov met on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting in Iceland and were expected to chat without a stringent time limit or any topics off-limits, sources familiar with the plans for the meeting explained. The discussion was expected to cover a wide range of substantive issues between the two nations ahead of a possible summit between Biden and President Vladimir Putin early this summer \u2013 but many of them are fraught. Blinken ultimately raised \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about malign Russian behavior during Wednesday\u2019s meeting, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a readout. This included \u201cRussia\u2019s continued military deployments in and near Ukraine, its actions against VOA and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and the health of Aleksey Navalny and the repression of opposition organizations,\u201d Price said. The two diplomats also discussed areas in which both countries could benefit from cooperation, \u201cincluding Afghanistan, strategic stability, and curbing Iran and the DPRK\u2019s nuclear programs,\u201d he added. Lavrov called the meeting \u201cconstructive,\u201d Russian state news agency TASS reported. \u201cThe conversation seemed to me constructive. There is an understanding of the need to overcome the unhealthy situation that developed between Moscow and Washington in previous years,\u201d Lavrov said following the talks, according to TASS. \u201cToday we confirmed our proposal to start a dialogue, considering all aspects, all factors affecting strategic stability: nuclear, non-nuclear, offensive, defensive. I have not seen a rejection of such a concept, but experts still have to work on it,\u201d the foreign minister was quoted as saying. Biden administration decides not to sanction company building controversial Russian gas pipeline The two men met a day after news broke that the US will not sanction the company in charge of building Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, despite strongly opposing the project with a State Department spokesperson calling it a \u201cRussian malign influence project\u201d that \u201cthreatens European energy security and that of Ukraine and eastern flank NATO Allies and partners.\u201d As Blinken met with Lavrov, the State Department released a statement about Nord Stream 2 from the top diplomat. \u201cI have determined that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the application of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, its CEO Matthias Warnig, and Nord Stream 2 AG\u2019s corporate officers. \u201cToday\u2019s actions demonstrate the Administration\u2019s commitment to energy security in Europe, consistent with the President\u2019s pledge to rebuild relationships with our allies and partners in Europe,\u201d Blinken said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue to oppose the completion of this project, which would weaken European energy security and that of Ukraine and Eastern flank NATO and EU countries. Our opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is unwavering.\u201d The top US diplomat was expected to directly raise a range of aggressive Russian activities, including the Solar Winds hack that targeted private businesses and government, Moscow\u2019s election interference, the wrongful detention of US citizens in Russia, its human rights abuses and detention of opposition activist Alexey Navalny, and the expulsion of each other\u2019s diplomats, three sources said. Blinken also planned to emphasize areas where the countries could work together \u2013 such as North Korea, Iran, and Arctic issues \u2013 explained another source. In comments to reporters Tuesday, Blinken made clear that the US also has disagreements with Russia on the resource-rich and strategically important Arctic, particularly Moscow\u2019s push to militarize the region, but stressed that there, too, the US will look for areas of cooperation. \u201cWe have concerns about some of the increased military activities in the Arctic. That increases the injuries or prospects of accidents, miscalculation, and undermines the shared goal of a peaceful and sustainable future for the region, so we have to be vigilant about that,\u201d Blinken said, speaking at a press conference Tuesday in Iceland. \u201cThere\u2019s been cooperation on a number of important areas, over the years on education, oil spill response, search and rescue, pollution issues, and it is our hope that that \u2026 the Arctic means an area of peaceful cooperation and peaceful collaboration,\u201d Blinken said. Biden administration officials want the Putin-Biden summit to go forward so that the two leaders can discuss matters face-to-face. In the lead-up to that high level meeting, US officials are taking a measured approach to Moscow, explained one source familiar. That approach contributed, in part, to Biden\u2019s carefully calculated response to the recent hack on the Colonial Pipeline, which was carried out by a criminal group based in Russia, one source said. There is no evidence \u201cso far\u201d that Russia is involved in the cyberattack, Biden said, but he added that Russia has \u201csome responsibility to deal with this.\u201d US investigates second suspected case of mystery 'syndrome' near White House Price said the hope is to \u201cachieve a relationship with Moscow that is more stable and predictable.\u201d Since Biden\u2019s election, stability and predictability have been in short order and in April, the US intelligence community said in an annual report that Russia \u201cpresents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.\u201d Moscow has also been making clear it can pose a military threat. Russia built up a massive troop presence along the border of the US\u2019s eastern European allies, including Ukraine, this spring and in April blocked foreign naval ships and state vessels in the Kerch Strait, the sea of Azov and parts of the Black Sea \u2013 a move NATO and the Pentagon criticized. As Blinken met with Lavrov, a major question for Biden administration officials was where Russia intends the presidential summit to go in terms of substance and tenor, two sources said. During Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Biden and Lavrov were expected to take stock of one another, said sources familiar with the planning, as well as Russia experts, which will inform how their countries prepare for a possible leaders meeting. One critical issue on the agenda involves the US embassy in Moscow and its ability to function. Russia sanctions eight US officials and expels diplomats in retaliation for Biden's actions In April, Lavrov announced what he called \u201ctit for tat\u201d measures against the US after Biden announced sanctions to punish Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, the SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d in Crimea. Those US penalties included the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including \u201crepresentatives of Russian intelligence services.\u201d Russia responded with a barrage of measures that included sanctions against eight senior US administration officials, including FBI director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines; expelling 10 US diplomats; curbing the ability of those remaining to travel around Russia; barring the ability of Russians or third-country nationals from working at the embassy; and suggesting US Ambassador John Sullivan leave the country. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US had already returned to Moscow in March after Biden agreed with the assessment that Putin is a \u201ckiller\u201d in a TV interview. Like his administration officials, Biden has said the US will work with Russia where possible \u2013 the two sides cooperated soon after Biden took office to extend the New START arms control agreement \u2013 but that Moscow will also face consequences for its actions against the US and its allies. During his first foreign policy speech, Biden underscored that point. \u201cI made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days the United States rolling over in the face of Russia\u2019s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning citizens are over,\u201d he said. This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Michael Conte, Sugam Pokharel and Karen Smith contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Another tragic Middle East conflict is offering fresh insight into Joe Biden\u2019s sometimes ruthless calculations about the purpose of his presidency and his view of America\u2019s global role. The violence between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas is the latest crisis that failed to distract Biden from what he sees as his core task \u2013 ending the pandemic and rescuing the economy. Biden declined Monday to publicly condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Gaza raids in reprisal for Hamas\u2019 rocket attacks, a move consistent with a record of strong support for Israel that is longer than that of many previous presidents. Domestic and international heat for Biden is escalating, however, amid rising Palestinian civilian casualties \u2013 including the deaths of children in Gaza \u2013 and the Israeli destruction of a building in the enclave used by the Associated Press and other media groups. Other presidents might have felt the need to appear on camera to call for calm or to at least offer public condolences for the deaths of civilians. Some administrations would have launched a Middle East peace shuttle by now. But in a region where the \u201cpeace process\u201d long ago expired \u2013 a region with complications that Biden had hoped to avoid, if possible \u2013 there\u2019s no easy payoff for spending limited US political or diplomatic capital. \u201cWe\u2019ve made clear that we are prepared to lend our support and good offices to the parties should they seek a ceasefire,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Denmark, in remarks emblematic of a low wattage US diplomatic push and reluctance to urge Israel to stop before it is ready. Biden\u2019s only public event on Monday focused on the pandemic response and expanding vaccine deliveries abroad. The White House stagecraft sent a clear and obvious message about the Middle East. \u201cI think the President frankly wants this thing to go away,\u201d said former Middle East peace negotiator and CNN Global Affairs analyst Aaron David Miller. \u201cHe is shackled with the greatest challenge of national recovery since Franklin Roosevelt. He is picking his foreign policy spots carefully.\u201d Biden\u2019s undiminished focus on the pandemic, and the clear desire to keep his public appearances limited to the matter at hand, recalls his refusal to be drawn into a narrative of crisis as thousands of child migrants poured over the border during his first 100 days in office and set conservative media on fire. Biden has also kept his eye on refashioning the economy to help workers rather than running down a liberal wish list that includes expanding the Supreme Court. Characteristically, Biden kept his work on the conflict on Monday private, speaking to Netanyahu over the phone while Blinken made multiple calls to regional foreign ministers. Egypt, a key interlocutor with Hamas, is a key target of US diplomacy. Biden told reporters he\u2019d talk about the chat with the Israeli leader afterward but his team called a travel photo lid (meaning there would be no further public events for Biden on Monday) at 1:48 p.m. ET, before the conversation took place. A statement about the call released by the White House caused a flurry of attention with a line saying that \u201cthe President expressed his support for a ceasefire.\u201d The comment did send a subtle signal that Biden\u2019s patience is not infinite with Netanyahu, who has indicated he is not yet ready to halt operations against Hamas\u2019 facilities and underground tunnels. Yet it also lacked a time frame by which point the political collateral damage on the President will become a hinderance to his support. In a region as treacherous as the Middle East, coded messages in an unsigned White House news release rarely move the needle. The statement and recent blind quotes from nameless officials about rising \u201cconcern\u201d came across more as spin to relieve pressure on Biden from left-wing Democrats as a real attempt to change the dynamics of a violent confrontation. But criticism of Israel is rising \u2013 at least within Biden\u2019s own party. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who has strong pro-Israeli credentials and underscored its right to defend itself, offered a striking call for a ceasefire. \u201cI want to see a ceasefire reach quickly and mourn the loss of life,\u201d Schumer told reporters, saying he agreed with a statement from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and GOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana that stated, \u201cAs a result of Hamas\u2019 rocket attacks and Israel\u2019s response, both sides must recognize that too many lives have been lost and must not escalate the conflict further.\u201d Those comments may reflect pressure on Schumer himself from within the Democratic Party, not least from fellow New Yorker Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been scathing of Israel, which she called an \u201capartheid\u201d state. Another senior Democrat, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, is one of 28 senators in the President\u2019s party to publicly call on Biden to secure a ceasefire. \u201cHamas is a terrorist group. They operate under the principle of terror. And Israel, as a nation-state, has a higher burden of proof to show that these are necessary military raids,\u201d Reed told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. The Democratic opposition is more a danger sign to Israel than Biden, as it threatens to weaken the Israelis\u2019 position on Capitol Hill. Several prominent Democrats are, for instance, calling for the administration to attach conditions to a $735 million shipment of precision-guided weaponry for Israel, a package that is currently on a fast-track approval process through Congress. Israel\u2019s operation is causing further stress in the delicate balance between progressives in the Democratic Party \u2014 like Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2013 and older, down-the-line pro-Israel party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. That will mean hard work to come for Israeli diplomats here. Conservative media has blamed Biden for the violence, citing his efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran, which funds Hamas. But it\u2019s hard to see how the President could have given Netanyahu more cover. He has not criticized Israel over clashes between its police and Palestinians inside the compound of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem or over possible evictions of Palestinians in a neighborhood of East Jerusalem, the part of the city they see as the future capital of their prospective state. Progressives in Washington blame those incidents for setting off the tinderbox that has been building between Israelis and Palestinians for months. In an earlier sign of Biden\u2019s shielding of Netanyahu, two diplomats told CNN that the US blocked public statements from the United Nations Security Council on the conflict. Even so, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, laid a political trap for the President should the White House harden its line against the Israelis. \u201cPresident Biden must remain strong against the growing voices within his own party that create false equivalence between terrorist aggressors and a responsible state defending itself,\u201d McConnell said. Biden knows the downside of publicly feuding with Netanyahu. President Barack Obama\u2019s pressure on the Israeli Prime Minister, and Netanyahu\u2019s willingness to play politics in Washington behind his back, scarred the administration in which Biden served as vice president. Given Biden\u2019s antipathy to a Middle East peace push, there\u2019s little reason to make an enemy of the Israeli Prime Minister. Still, Biden\u2019s position is not without risks. Rapidly rising civilian casualties would pose questions about why he was not more aggressive in trying to stop the fighting. A possible upside of recent days is that Netanyahu could come out of any ceasefire agreement in Biden\u2019s debt. How the President might choose to use such chits is unclear. Possibly he could prevail on the Israeli leader \u2013 if he can stay prime minister amid his country\u2019s political uncertainty after yet another inconclusive election \u2013 to avoid provocations like the most controversial settlement projects. In the event of a deal with Tehran that could see the US return to the international nuclear deal, Biden may try to ease Netanyahu\u2019s public opposition. The Israeli Prime Minister is, however, so adamantly against the idea that Biden would soon burn off any accrued political capital. The President\u2019s strategy has also underscored the narrow focus of a foreign policy mostly notable for his cementing of a more adversarial posture to China. He is signaling that in the post \u201cAmerica First\u201d era, there will be no return to the days when Washington invested huge efforts to broker Middle East peace deals. The most that might be expected from this limited effort is support for a ceasefire. That in itself is a recognition that the structures that permitted US-sponsored \u201cpeace processes\u201d and efforts to consecrate a Palestinian state no longer exist. An Israeli political move to the right and the Palestinian divide between Hamas in Gaza and aging, ineffective leaders on the West Bank mean this is a moment without promise. In fact, the current conflict is likely to further diminish Biden\u2019s incentives for getting involved.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene confronted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez outside the House chamber on Wednesday afternoon. The incident, first reported by The Washington Post, was just the latest of several hostile confrontations the Georgia congresswoman has had with her Democratic colleagues, but her interactions with the New York Democrat predate Greene\u2019s election to Congress in 2020. During a February 2019 visit to congressional offices at the US Capitol with associates who include a man who would later enter the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, Greene \u2013 then a conservative activist \u2013 can be seen taunting Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff outside the congresswoman\u2019s locked office by talking through a mailbox slot urging her to come out. In the video, from a since-deleted Facebook Live of Greene\u2019s that was saved by CNN\u2019s KFile, Greene tells Ocasio-Cortez to \u201cget rid of your diaper,\u201d referring to the congresswoman\u2019s office as a \u201cday care.\u201d Greene repeatedly indicates throughout her stream that security has been called on them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go see, we\u2019re going to visit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crazy eyes. Crazy eyes. Nutty. Cortez,\u201d Greene says to the camera on the way to the congresswoman\u2019s office, mispronouncing \u201cOcasio.\u201d When Greene and her companions arrive at the office, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office door is locked. Standing outside of the office, Greene and her associates taunt Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s staff through the mailbox, mocking the staff for keeping the door locked. Then Greene talks through the slot to the staff, urging them to unlock the door and let her and her cohorts inside. \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I\u2019m an American citizen. I pay your salary through the taxes that you collect for me through the IRS because I\u2019m a taxpaying citizen of the United States,\u201d Greene says, noting elsewhere in the video that members of Congress are \u201cemployees\u201d who \u201cwork for us.\u201d \u201cSo you need to stop being a baby and stop locking your door and come out and face the American citizens that you serve,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be a big girl, you need to get rid of your diaper and come out and be able to talk to the American citizens. Instead of having to use a flap, a little flap. Sad.\u201d In an email to CNN after publication, Greene said, \u201cMembers of Congress and all government employees are employed by the taxpayers of this country. Holding the government accountable to the people is what I\u2019ve always believed in.\u201d On the Hill Friday, Ocasio-Cortez told reporters that Greene is \u201cdeeply unwell and clearly needs help. And her kind of fixation has lasted for several years now,\u201d adding that this \u201craised concerns for other members. \u2026 I think that this is an assessment that needs to be made by the proper professional.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez also tweeted about the incident Friday, arguing that Greene\u2019s behavior is supported by GOP leadership because House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u201chas worked to protect this person from consequences (including pretending he doesn\u2019t see it)\u2026\u201d In the video, Greene and her companions continue to goad the staff while chuckling from outside the door. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay in there forever. Come out and play,\u201d taunts one Greene ally through the mailbox slot. The video is from February 22, 2019 \u2013 the same day that Greene visited the Capitol and brought to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office a petition to impeach the California Democrat for treason, and suggested she should be executed or imprisoned for her \u201ccrimes.\u201d On social media in 2018 and 2019, Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing other Democratic politicians, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, and FBI agents. Greene also visited Rep. Maxine Waters\u2019 office that day, where she said the California Democrat was \u201cjust as guilty\u201d of treason as Pelosi. She also went on to visit the offices of then-freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, during which she falsely claimed the first two Muslim women elected to Congress weren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d because they had been sworn in on the Quran. Greene stopped by the offices of Reps. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican, and Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and suggested visiting then-Sen. Kamala Harris that day. With Greene at the Capitol that day was her close ally Anthony Aguero, a former El Paso congressional candidate and conservative livestreamer who was captured on camera inside the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection. As they leave Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office, Greene says, \u201cBye. Bye. Bye, AOC. Ocasio-Cortez. Bye, bye, baby. Bye-bye, baby. Bye-bye, little baby girl. Ocasio-Cortez\u2013 she went and hid. She couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d said Greene, mispronouncing Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name again. She and her companions then rearranged the sticky notes placed on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office wall and signed the guest book outside the office by drawing a picture of a border wall before leaving to go to another member\u2019s office. Greene repeatedly says in the video that \u201cwe have security following us everywhere we go\u201d and appears proud of it. By the end of the day, she and her companions appear to be escorted out by security. It\u2019s unclear if the Capitol Police were involved. \u201cWe\u2019re headed back out. That was fun,\u201d she says to the camera. Greene\u2019s disruptive visit is not the first time she\u2019s interacted aggressively with members of Congress. As a congressional candidate in September 2020, she posted an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib and encouraged going on the \u201coffense against these socialists.\u201d Earlier this year, freshman Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said she would move her office away from Greene\u2019s following a heated exchange in which Bush confronted Greene about not wearing a mask in a hallway on Capitol Hill. Greene also faced backlash when she posted an anti-transgender sign outside of her office, antagonizing her hallway neighbor, Democratic Rep. Marie Newman of Illinois, whose daughter is transgender. This story has been updated with comments from Greene and Ocasio-Cortez.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans voted on Friday to elevate Rep. Elise Stefanik to the No. 3 leadership position of conference chair after ousting Rep. Liz Cheney from the role because she repeatedly called out former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen. Stefanik, a high-profile Trump defender, faced a conservative challenger \u2013 GOP Rep. Chip Roy \u2013 but his candidacy was viewed as a long-shot, and the New York congresswoman had the backing of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Trump. The final result was 134 votes for Stefanik and 46 for Roy, according to multiple sources in the room. The congresswoman said in a statement after the vote that she is \u201chonored and humbled\u201d to be elected to the leadership post. \u201cHouse Republicans are united in our focus to fight on behalf of the American people to save our country from the radical Socialist Democrat agenda,\u201d she said. Stefanik\u2019s rise within the ranks of House GOP leadership and Cheney\u2019s removal starkly underscores the Republican Party\u2019s entrenched loyalty to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent even after Trump\u2019s election lies incited a deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6. Aides close to the race also told CNN that Stefanik\u2019s quick rise was a emblematic of the congresswoman\u2019s own ambitions. Elise Stefanik's leadership rise stirs up GOP drama over identity politics \u201cShe just outhustled everyone,\u201d one senior GOP aide told CNN. Amid Trump\u2019s false claims over voter fraud, Stefanik supported an objection during the Electoral College vote count to affirm President Joe Biden\u2019s win. She also signed on in support of an amicus brief backing a lawsuit from Texas to the Supreme Court that sought to overturn the results of the election in several states. Trump stood by Stefanik in her run for the leadership post and weighed in on Roy\u2019s late entry into the race Thursday evening with a statement slamming the congressman and reiterating his support for the congresswoman. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine Republican House Members would go with Chip Roy \u2013 he has not done a great job, and will probably be successfully primaried in his own district. I support Elise, by far, over Chip!\u201d he said. Stefanik has made a pitch to House Republicans that she will help deliver on a message of unity and united opposition to Democrats in Congress and in the White House as the party works to win back the House majority in 2022. McCarthy congratulated Stefanik on her election at a news conference after the vote, before pivoting to criticism of Democrats. \u201cI want to congratulate Elise Stefanik and welcome her to the leadership team,\u201d he said, adding that Republicans had \u201ca healthy debate and a good election.\u201d Stefanik did face pushback from some conservative House Republicans in her bid for leadership. The congresswoman represents a district that pivoted in the past from voting for former President Barack Obama to Trump and she has long been known on Capitol Hill as a more moderate Republican. And while the congresswoman has made a name for herself as an ardent Trump supporter in recent years, that wasn\u2019t always the case. In 2015, 2016 and the early days of his term in office, she criticized Trump on a range of issues from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions, such as overhauling NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia. When House Democrats moved to impeach Trump for the first time in 2019, however, Stefanik emerged as one of the President\u2019s most outspoken defenders, taking on Democrats and earning Trump\u2019s praise as \u201ca new Republican star.\u201d Cheney, on the other hand, is known as a more conservative Republican, but she has also become a major Trump critic. She voted to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol and has continued to speak out against his election lies. House Republicans formally ousted Cheney from her leadership post in a voice vote on Wednesday. Before the vote, the Wyoming Republican called out Trump and other Republicans who aided his efforts to overturn his loss and warned, \u201cwe cannot let the former president drag us backward and make us complicit in his efforts to unravel our democracy.\u201d Stefanik said Wednesday afternoon she \u201cabsolutely\u201d has enough votes to secure her election to the position, even if someone else decides to jump in the race. Roy publicly announced his intention to run Thursday. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of Trump-aligned far-right Republicans held a forum with Stefanik on Wednesday evening, which the New York congresswoman called \u201ca great conversation\u201d after it concluded.   \u201cMy message was I\u2019m focused on unifying the conference and beating Democrats and we have an opportunity to do that, that is historic in beating the most radical socialist agenda in this country,\u201d Stefanik said after the meeting. She did not answer when asked if she had won over the support of the caucus. Stefanik also met this week with the conservative Republican Study Committee in her efforts to win over the conference. That group is led by Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who was seen early on as a potential contender in the race, but never entered. Stefanik has signaled to some colleagues that she plans to stay in leadership and as chair of the House GOP Conference only through 2022, wanting to pursue the top GOP job on the House Education and Labor Committee next Congress, according to a source with direct knowledge of the talks, an assurance that could help assuage concerns from any lawmakers reluctant to support her. This story and headline have updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Annie Grayer, Manu Raju, Alex Rogers and Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "After years of encouraging Democrats and voters to take a meritocratic approach when evaluating candidates for office, Republicans are coming under fire for insisting that ousted House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney must be replaced by another woman. Before the Wyoming congresswoman was booted from her leadership post in a vote on Wednesday, House Republicans had sent out clear signals that her successor would need to be a woman. Male members who had reportedly been interested in the role, such as Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana, were quickly dismissed as the names of three women \u2013 Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York, Ann Wagner of Missouri and Jackie Walorksi of Indiana \u2013 were circulated inside the conference. Soon, party leaders settled on Stefanik, a millennial congresswoman whose profile rose in late 2019 amid her fervent defense of then-President Donald Trump during his first impeachment inquiry.   Born out of what leadership saw as a political necessity given the party\u2019s precarious position with women voters, Stefanik was quickly elevated as Cheney\u2019s presumptive replacement. Even in conversations between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Trump, who vowed to recruit a primary challenger against Cheney after she voted to impeach him in his second inquiry earlier this year, Stefanik was identified early on as a suitable replacement, according to two people familiar with their discussions. The former President eventually offered a public endorsement, describing Stefanik as a \u201cgifted communicator\u201d in a statement on Monday. \u201cThey thought it was going to do damage in the media if they tapped a man for the job,\u201d said one top Trump ally, describing discussions that occurred around Cheney\u2019s ouster between the former President and House Republicans. Instead, the hurried push to install Stefanik as GOP chair \u2013 a vote that is expected to come on Friday \u2013 has begun to backfire. Conservatives both on and off Capitol Hill are raising questions about prioritizing optics \u2013 in this case, preventing the party from having three men occupy its House leadership ranks \u2013 over ideological consistency. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the anniversary of Joe Biden saying he needs to pick a woman as a running mate. This is what the Democrats always do and I\u2019m against it,\u201d said the top Trump ally. \u201cNo GOP woman cares about identity politics!\u201d added conservative commentator Ann Coulter in a tweet Wednesday afternoon. In a column posted shortly after Cheney was removed from her post on Wednesday, the Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin contended that the \u201cmost obvious reason\u201d Republicans had settled on Stefanik, whose voting record has raised eyebrows among the party\u2019s most conservative members, \u201cis because the party \u2013 though it supposedly abhors identity politics \u2013 needs a skirt to hide behind as it jettisons a strong, independent-minded female colleague.\u201d One House GOP staffer agreed with Rubin\u2019s assessment. The anointing of Stefanik, this staffer said, represented \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d inside the party, noting that Republicans have often cast quotas that are aimed at addressing gender diversity inside American companies, presidential Cabinets, and other institutions as pandering or empty symbolism. \u201cThis is what we claim to despise and yet here we are saying, \u2018We can\u2019t consider these other candidates, who are more attuned to what our constituents want, because they are men,\u2019 \u201d the staffer said. Top Democrats have also seized on the GOP\u2019s push to swap Stefanik in for Cheney. In a faux \u201chelp wanted\u201d ad released by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last Tuesday, the California Democrat accused Republican leaders McCarthy and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of seeking to replace Cheney with \u201ca woman who isn\u2019t a \u2018threat\u2019 to them.\u201d To be sure, not every House Republican has supported the Stefanik-for-Cheney leadership swap. Some have said the contest to replace Cheney would benefit from having multiple contenders, while others have shown little appetite for slotting another woman in the role to shield the party from criticism. \u201cI ask myself every day why Jim Jordan isn\u2019t on our leadership team,\u201d Rep. Brian Mast of Florida told CNN earlier Wednesday, signaling that he would be open to seeing others inside the conference fill the No. 3 leadership position. Efforts to coronate Stefanik as incoming conference chair come as the GOP finds itself in perilous territory with female voters, who contributed to the Democratic Party\u2019s suburban gains in the 2020 election and could stymie Republican hopes of retaking the House next fall if the relationship remains strained. Republicans need to flip at least five seats to take over the lower chamber, and some worry that Cheney\u2019s orchestrated removal from leadership will further alienate women right as the party is ramping up for its critical midterm push. But insider efforts to preempt such consequences by promoting another woman to the leadership role may have also underscored the risks of so-called identity politics, if the reaction to Stefanik among conservative House Republicans is any indication. In a scathing letter sent to colleagues on Tuesday, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said Stefanik\u2019s voting record \u201cembodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats\u201d and urged Republicans to consider leaving the position of conference chair open if the party can\u2019t coalesce behind \u201csomeone who reflects our conservative values.\u201d Roy and other conservative skeptics have cited Stefanik\u2019s votes against the House GOP\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Trump administration\u2019s request to use emergency funds for border wall construction as red flags. They have also pointed to her sharp criticism of Trump over his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and rhetoric on trade. \u201cThe lack of any challenger doesn\u2019t remove any questions I have about her voting record and whether her positions are going to interfere with our ability to look to message for the conference,\u201d Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, where Stefanik\u2019s voting record and past criticism of Trump has become a source of consternation in recent days, told CNN on Wednesday. Roy, a Freedom Caucus member himself, was said to be considering an official bid for the job as of Wednesday afternoon, with his spokesperson telling reporters, \u201cIf the position must be filed, then this must be a contested race \u2013 not a coronation.\u201d It is not yet clear if his candidacy would pose a significant threat to Stefanik, who has privately suggested she would only serve in the role through 2022 and has already received the backing of McCarthy, Trump and Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican. Despite publicly backing of Stefanik, McCarthy said late Wednesday that he held off on holding a vote for his colleague immediately after Cheney\u2019s ouster because \u201ccompetition is good.\u201d Former Republican Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who became the first woman to occupy the role of conference chair when she was elected to the position in 2003, had mixed feelings about the push to replace Cheney with a woman. Pryce, who described Cheney\u2019s ousting in an interview with CNN as \u201cvery unfortunate,\u201d said she was pleased that Republicans are likely to maintain female representation in their leadership ranks if Stefanik is voted into the role. But she and others added that there is a potential downside to installing another woman in the No. 3 position for the third consecutive time, following Cheney and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who held the title of GOP conference chair from January 2013 through January 2019. \u201cI think Elise will do a great job \u2026 but it isn\u2019t, it shouldn\u2019t be, and I hope it never becomes the token slot for women in leadership,\u201d Pryce said. Though Republicans made significant strides in the last election to add women to their congressional minority \u2013 including with the help of Stefanik, whose leadership PAC gave $415,000 to Republican candidates in 2020 \u2013 the party still pales behind Democrats in female representation. A study by the Pew Research Center released earlier this year found that 38% of Democrats in the 117th Congress are women, versus 14% of Republicans. A Republican woman has also never served as party whip or House Speaker. For her part, Stefanik said Wednesday she \u201cabsolutely\u201d has enough support inside the conference to clinch the spot after speaking directly with some of the conservative House members who raised concerns about her candidacy earlier this week. \u201cWe have great support conference-wide, from members of the Freedom Caucus to the Tuesday Group,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Lit only by an orange floodlight, a single file of camouflaged men crept along the wall of a small, dark Romanian port on the Black Sea. Suddenly, they opened fire on the two men guarding a darkened warehouse with broken windows. Moving past the fallen guards, an American voice - among the mix of men speaking accented English \u2013 shouted at two others in a car: \u201cGet out! Hurry up, hurry up.\u201d The team of US Navy SEALs, along with Romanian and Spanish Special Forces, quickly and quietly worked their way through the warehouse, firing on enemy fighters and, when possible, taking them prisoner. When the operation was done, the assaulting team \u2013 whose ammunition had consisted of plastic projectiles and paint rounds \u2013 was told by an instructor they had passed the course and to get back in position to run it again. The SEALs, from Virginia Beach, are in Romania this month as part of a contingent of American special forces taking part in the \u201cTrojan Footprint\u201d military exercises across five Eastern European countries that involve 600 NATO and non-NATO forces, including troops from Ukraine and Georgia, which have both been invaded by Russia in recent years. The training is taking place alongside  this month\u2019s much larger Defender-Europe 21 NATO joint exercises, which have some 28,000 forces participating from 26 different countries. Both sets of military training exercises, while long-planned, follow a series of aggressive Russian military moves across Europe. CNN was given exclusive access to see the American special forces - the SEALs and US Army\u2019s Green Berets - exercise in Romania and North Macedonia over several days. In central Romania, the Green Berets fast roped and rappelled down from helicopters alongside Ukrainian and Romanian soldiers before blasting and shooting their way into a makeshift house. In North Macedonia, American special air tactics airmen taught local troops how to call in targets for an AC-130 plane that was firing on a distant ridgeline, the Macedonians carefully annunciating the coordinates in halting English. One salvo, called in by an American officer, was significantly off target, appearing to be the result of a misunderstanding between the ground and air forces: A potentially deadly mistake that spoke to why live fire training is so vital. The annual exercises were canceled last year during the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and while they are over a year in the making, it is lost on no one that they coincide with a dramatic escalation of tension between Russia and the West. \u201cWe have to be strong and supportive of our allies when there is a threat,\u201d said David Muniz, the most senior US diplomat in Romania who serves as the embassy\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires. \u201cWhen we are strong, when we are united, it has a real chilling effect, shall we say, on the kinds of things that can happen.\u201d \u201cIn this way, you cut down on the chance for mischief,\u201d he added, shortly before American paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division poured out of transport planes over a Romanian airfield in Boboc. While some Russian forces have recently pulled back from their deployment to the border with Ukraine, Russia\u2019s navy has also carried out exercises in the Black Sea, challenged Ukrainian Coast Guard vessels in the same waters and closed down parts of the small sea around the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow invaded and annexed in 2014. Few diplomatic or military officials \u2013 American or otherwise - wanted to speak specifically about the Russian threat though several privately admitted there\u2019s no doubt it is hanging over these exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s just showing everybody that we have a capability and we can use it when necessary,\u201d said Major General Joe Jarrard, the deputy commander of the US Army in Europe and Africa, downplaying the significance of the timing of the exercises. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to develop our readiness and the interoperability between all of the allies and partners and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re continuing to focus on.\u201d The head of Romania\u2019s special forces, which copied much from the Americans during the development of their forces, admitted that the Russian maneuvers not far from their coastline in the Black Sea are unsettling. \u201cThey should be of concern for us,\u201d said Lieutenant General Daniel Petrescu. \u201cOur job is to train harder and harder and be prepared for everything.\u201d Since April, the US has sanctioned Russia for its interference in the 2020 election, the SolarWinds hack and the poisoning of activist Alexey Navalny. The two sides have expelled a number of each other\u2019s diplomats. Ahead of a proposed summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin in June, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Ukraine, where he cautioned that Russia could reverse a recent withdrawal of some of the tens of thousands of troops that had amassed along the border with Ukraine. \u201cRussia has the capacity on fairly short notice to take aggressive action if it so chooses, and so we are watching this very, very carefully,\u201d Blinken said in a May 6 press conference with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cWe discussed in some detail the support that we\u2019re providing, we\u2019ll continue to provide to Ukraine to continue to strengthen its security, its defenses,\u201d Blinken said. From the Black Sea, Russia could also launch an attack on Ukraine\u2019s mainland, the former commander of NATO, James Stavridis wrote in a recent column. \u201cThe objective would be to neutralize the Ukrainian naval forces, gain complete sea control in the northern Black Sea, cut off Ukrainian military forces from their supply lines, and obtain dominance over a section of land that could connect Russia with Crimea,\u201d Stavridis wrote. Biden says his 'hope and expectation' is to meet Putin on upcoming Europe trip Last month, the Pentagon scratched plans to send two destroyers into the Black Sea but the US Coast Guard has sent the Hamilton cutter, which the Navy\u2019s 6th Fleet said was there \u201cto support NATO allies and partners.\u201d It has been photographed being shadowed by a Russian patrol vessel. A Russian attack on Ukraine would not necessarily compel the US and the rest of NATO to intervene, since it is not part of the alliance. NATO did not respond militarily to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea but has refused to recognize it as Russian territory. A big part of the aim of the NATO exercises now, beyond sending a message to Russia and others, is simply at a tactical level: should the allies and partners need to join a fight together, they know how to work alongside each other and cross-pollinate with other countries\u2019 equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s just to build that knowledge with each other,\u201d said a Green Beret operator who CNN wasn\u2019t allowed to identify. \u201cIt shows that we\u2019re willing to learn from each other. It is important, significant, whatever\u2019s going on around the world.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s rise within the Republican Party and embrace of former President Donald Trump have met with a mixed reaction in the district she represents, which pivoted in the past from voting for former President Barack Obama to Trump. In interviews with CNN, some voters in New York\u2019s 21st Congressional District, which Stefanik represents, say the congresswoman has worked hard for her achievements and are cheering her on as she appears poised to replace Rep. Liz Cheney, who has spoken out against Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen, as the next House Republican conference chairwoman. Others, however, are critical of Stefanik\u2019s support for Trump and efforts to challenge the results of the election and say she isn\u2019t focused enough on the needs of her district. The 21st Congressional District voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and then went for Trump in 2016 and 2020. Willsboro, a town in the district Stefanik moved to before she was elected to Congress in 2014, is part of Essex County, which has swung even more dramatically between the two parties in recent elections, voting for Obama in 2008 and 2012, then for Trump in 2016 and for Biden in 2020. Against that backdrop, Stefanik has defeated challenges from Democratic opponents by wide margins in recent years. At the same time, she has become a prolific fundraiser and has taken on increasing national prominence on Capitol Hill as an outspoken Trump defender. Stefanik\u2019s trajectory underscores how firmly entrenched Trump\u2019s influence remains on the party even now that he is no longer in office and after his efforts to overturn the 2020 election triggered a deadly attack on the US Capitol. Amid Trump\u2019s false claims over voter fraud and the election, Stefanik supported an objection during the Electoral College vote count in Congress held to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s win. She also signed on in support of an amicus brief to the Supreme Court backing a lawsuit from Texas that sought to overturn the results of the election in several states. John Carver, who described himself as conservative and said he had voted for Trump in 2020, called Stefanik \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d and said that \u201cshe\u2019s got good ideas\u201d and has \u201cbeen great for the North Country, bringing jobs up here.\u201d Stefanik says she supports GOP review of Biden's Arizona victory as she stresses embrace of Trump \u201cWe like everything she stands for,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cShe would be great for the position\u201d of conference chair, the No. 3 House GOP leadership slot. Sandra Murphy, who identified herself as a registered Democrat, said, in contrast, that she is not a supporter of Stefanik because \u201cshe\u2019s backing the Big Lie and Trump too.\u201d \u201cIn her first term when she ran up here, I voted for her, but then I wouldn\u2019t vote again for her,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThen she went totally party line for the Republicans no matter what, and I just don\u2019t go along with that.\u201d A representative for Stefanik cited the district\u2019s recent history of flipping from Democratic to Republican when asked for a response to her constituents\u2019 comments. \u201cCongresswoman Elise Stefanik proudly flipped a district that went from blue to red and voted for President Obama twice,\u201d Stefanik senior adviser Alex DeGrasse said in a statement. \u201cThanks to Elise\u2019s efforts, we are registering Republicans at a 2 to 1 rate over Democrats over the past year. Elise just easily won reelection with the largest number of votes in the history of the North Country.\u201d Stefanik wasn\u2019t always known for being pro-Trump. In 2015, 2016 and the early days of his term in office, she criticized Trump over everything from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions, such as overhauling NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia. When House Democrats moved to impeach Trump for the first time in 2019, however, Stefanik emerged as one of the President\u2019s most outspoken defenders, earning his praise in the process as \u201ca new Republican star.\u201d \u201cShe is a very different politician now than she was a couple of years ago. Different policy ideas, different allies, shedding people who had been close to her for a long time, and that\u2019s turned out to be a winning strategy,\u201d said NPR correspondent Brian Mann, who has reported on Stefanik\u2019s career. \u201cThat willingness to reinvent herself, to change her identity and her brand, it\u2019s been one of her strengths.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s also one of the smartest, most strategic politicians I\u2019ve ever watched. If Elise Stefanik believes that Donald Trump is still the future of the Republican Party, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that\u2019s where this party is going to be going for some time,\u201d Mann said. Some voters think that she is not doing enough to represent the views of a diverse district. Barry Goldstein, who declined to state his party affiliation, said that \u201cever since the election and these recent events about \u2018stop the steal\u2019 being in the news and her support of this, suggests to me that she really doesn\u2019t care a whit about the people who live in her district because it\u2019s a very heterogeneous district. There are a lot of very important issues here.\u201d \u201cTo be spending so much time on an issue that has been resolved in the courts and with numerous recounts time and time again, this idea that somehow the election was stolen leaves me gobsmacked,\u201d Goldstein said. Dana Marshall, who said that she had voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, has a very different perspective on the congresswoman\u2019s time in office and believes that as she rises in the ranks in Washington it will ultimately benefit the district. \u201cShe really is trying her best for the North Country,\u201d said Marshall, who said that if Stefanik becomes House GOP conference chairwoman, \u201cit will do great things for the North Country. It\u2019s going to boost Elise Stefanik\u2019s career, which is very important. She is a young woman, so good for that.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s worked hard and she deserves it,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s really what you want to teach our children is if you work hard and you want something and you work hard enough, you\u2019re going to get there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adam Levy and Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s loudest defenders in Congress, once harshly attacked Trump over both his rhetoric and policies, claiming that she\u2019d be an \u201cindependent voice.\u201d   Stefanik, a rising Republican star who is working to replace Rep. Liz Cheney as the House GOP conference chair, has spent much of the last two years as a fierce defender of the former President, particularly during his first impeachment inquiry. After the 2020 election, she has recently encouraged and promoted lies about the 2020 election and objected to the Electoral College vote in Pennsylvania. But in 2015, 2016 and the early days of his first term in office, Stefanik criticized Trump over everything from his incendiary comments about Muslims and women to his signature policy positions, such as reforming NATO, building a US-Mexico border wall and having stronger cooperation with Russia. In interviews during the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Stefanik said Trump would not become the GOP nominee for president. In one August 2015 interview, she said his campaign had peaked. Stefanik, in her freshman term as a congresswoman, also said she believed Trump should release his tax returns to the public, which Trump famously never did. Stefanik did not endorse any candidate during the primary, and though she pledged she would support the Republican nominee, she initially did not invoke Trump\u2019s name. In another interview, in which she didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, Stefanik blasted candidates who disqualified themselves by making \u201cuntruthful statements.\u201d \u201cI think in the presidential field, there are some candidates \u2014 who over the long run and they\u2019ve already started this process \u2014 are somewhat disqualifying themselves with untruthful statements,\u201d she said in one local radio interview in December 2015. \u201cNot being willing to really talk about the substance of issues and just firing away rhetorical devices that don\u2019t necessarily have a basis in fact.\u201d Stefanik also frequently criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric, saying in one January 2016 interview, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s tapping into the fear today of our security situation.\u201d She added, \u201cI think we should expect more substance out of our candidates.\u201d CNN reached out to Stefanik\u2019s office, but they declined to comment on the record. On Thursday, however, Stefanik said on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast that she would never forget campaigning during the 2016 election and said that she \u201creally paid attention to the voters and the people in my district\u201d who supported Trump. \u201cThe energy was just palpable. Anyone on the ground or who was knocking on doors, talking to voters, understood that it was going to be a historic election. The media didn\u2019t get it. The establishment didn\u2019t get it. I was proud to be a part of it. And I was proud to be on that ticket and to win by a huge, huge margin as well as President Trump\u2019s huge double-digit victory in my district,\u201d she said. Stefanik also said Trump\u2019s \u201cinsulting\u201d rhetoric about women hurt the Republican Party\u2019s efforts to expand its appeal to women voters. \u201cI think he has been insulting to women,\u201d Stefanik said in another local radio interview in August 2015, referring to Trump\u2019s misogynistic comments about then-Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. \u201cI think this may be Mr. Trump\u2019s peak moment. And I think we\u2019re going to see his numbers change and decline over the coming weeks and months as the other candidates have an opportunity to share their vision for the future of this country.\u201d \u201cWe need to ensure that we\u2019re increasing our party\u2019s ability to reach out to women,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I work on that in Congress. I care passionately about that. And Donald Trump\u2019s comments have not helped that effort. They\u2019ve hurt that effort.\u201d At this time, Trump was not considered by political operatives as a serious contender to become the Republican nominee, despite leading the primary race in nationwide polls. In October 2016, after Trump\u2019s crude and sexist comments on the infamous Access Hollywood tape emerged, Stefanik called Trump\u2019s comments wrong. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s inappropriate, offensive comments are just wrong - No matter when he said them or whatever the context,\u201d she said in a statement posted on Facebook. \u201cI hope his apology is sincere.\u201d When Trump proposed as a candidate to ban Muslims from entering the country, Stefanik told a local newspaper in a telephone interview, \u201cThis is not who we are as a country\u2026 This is not according to our constitutional principle.\u201d \u201cAnd I associate myself with Speaker (Paul) Ryan\u2019s comment just saying there is no place for what Trump said about Muslims in this country.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s who we are,\u201d she said again in January 2016 in a radio interview, adding Trump would not be the nominee. \u201cThat\u2019s not according to our constitutional principles.\u201d After Trump won the Republican primary, Stefanik\u2019s critiques of him did not diminish, even though she pledged to support the Republican nominee. Stefanik criticized Trump for attacking Khizr Khan, a 2016 speaker at the Democratic National Convention whose Muslim son was killed in Iraq while serving as a US soldier in 2004. \u201cI think there is no excuse to be attacking Gold Star families,\u201d she said in August 2016. \u201cMilitary families deserve our utmost respect.\u201d In the same interview, she noted that she would always support the GOP nominee but \u201cI\u2019m an independent voice and that has not changed.\u201d While Trump campaigned for president in 2016, Stefanik opposed his signature policy proposals, including building a wall on the US-Mexico border. Talking to the Press-Republican, a Plattsburgh, New York, newspaper in Stefanik\u2019s district, in February 2016, Stefanik said she disagreed on the need to build a wall on the southern border. \u201cI think that you can use technology to have better security along the Mexican border,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cFar too often, securing the border has been a political talking point for the past 10 to 12 years, and there hasn\u2019t been enough kind of common-sense discussions about what that actually means.\u201d A spokesman confirmed in October 2016 to Roll Call that she disagreed on building the wall. When asked again about the wall in May 2017, months after Trump had taken office, Stefanik said the President\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t realistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the President\u2019s plan is exactly right on that.\u201d During the campaign, Stefanik also was dismissive of Trump\u2019s foreign affairs plans. Though she had backed Trump for president, saying he was preferable to the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Stefanik said his military proposals were \u201cabsolutely not a good idea,\u201d but suggested her positions on the House Armed Services Committee allowed her to be a check on Trump.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. We can\u2019t really ever know all the truth, but we are still learning new facts about how former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaigns and administration warped perception. While Trump can\u2019t spread misinformation on Twitter (ever again) or Facebook (at least for the next six months, we learned Wednesday), we\u2019re starting to get a clearer sense of the line between misinformation in 2016, misinformation in 2020 and how it might look now that the majority of the GOP has decided to mainline misinformation going forward. The 2016 version of misinformation came from Russia. Did Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign interact with Russians and did those Russians send information back to the Kremlin? Yes. The Treasury Department made the revelation of Russia\u2019s 2016 interference in April, announcing new sanctions for Russia\u2019s attempted election meddling in 2020. Read more about that revelation, buried in a Treasury release here. Key line from CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen in April: It has long been suspected but never explicitly stated by the US government that Konstantin Kilimnik passed internal Trump campaign data from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russian intelligence services. The announcement Thursday establishes a simple and direct channel of communication from the upper echelon of the Trump campaign to the Russian agencies that were meddling to help Trump win. Back to whether Trump\u2019s actions may have been criminal. We were led by then-Attorney General William Barr to believe that they were not. But a remarkable critique by a federal judge this week and her decision that the Department of Justice must publicly release a highly redacted memo prepared for Barr makes it seem like the fix was in; Trump couldn\u2019t be charged no matter what. Everything else stemmed from that. Barr slow-walked the release of the Mueller report and tried to blunt its effect after already deciding it would not allege criminal wrongdoing. Read more about the Judge Amy Berman Jackson\u2019s decision here. Key line from CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb on Wednesday: Jackson concluded that the redacted memo showed that it was drafted even though the decision not to prosecute Trump had already been settled, suggesting Barr misled lawmakers and the public about the decision not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. The opinion included emails showing that Justice Department officials were drafting the memo on obstruction at the same time as the four-page letter Barr sent to Congress summarizing Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cThe review of the document reveals that the Attorney General was not then engaged in making a decision about whether the President should be charged with obstruction of justice; the fact that he would not be prosecuted was a given,\u201d Jackson wrote. Adjacent to Russia\u2019s interference in 2016 is Trump\u2019s attempt to dig up dirt on Joe Biden ahead of 2020. Despite Trump\u2019s impeachment, we may still learn from the active federal investigation into what exactly Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani was doing for Trump in Ukraine and elsewhere. Where the lies spread. Facebook, the simmering pot of misinformation from all sorts of sources on all sorts of topics, announced Wednesday that a specially convened board would punt for six months on whether to permanently bar Trump from the service. Trump, Russia and other actors generally seek to polarize the country by spreading false facts. That\u2019s not going to stop anytime soon, regardless of what Facebook does to Trump or how many Russian misinformation efforts it takes down. The misinformation spreads to Covid, to vaccines, everywhere. Related: Trump is banned from Facebook. Trumpism is everywhere on it Learning from misinformation. I asked CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, who has covered the Mueller report and the Ukraine scandal for CNN, for her takeaway on the long tail of these stories. She drew a line from the Russian misinformation of 2016 to Trump\u2019s misinformation during his presidency and about his election loss. \u201cIf we think about what\u2019s happening now, and we think about the sweep of history, one of the biggest lessons from the Mueller findings is, THIS is how disinformation works. The Russians did it so effectively in 2016 by harnessing social media to divide Americans and sway them toward Trump. US political voices, Trump included, embraced that type of propaganda and discourse and used the same tactics in 2020. Who needs Russia to do the social media trolling anymore when Trump and his supporters have taken up the task?\u201d Counterargument on misinformation: I enjoyed this CNN Opinion post from Christopher Bail, a professor at Duke who argues the problem is not social media platforms and misinformation, it\u2019s polarization. I\u2019d like to believe we\u2019re overly concerned about misinformation because as a journalist I\u2019m also always very concerned when people push the idea of cutting down on speech, even if it\u2019s wrong. Key line from Bail: Most people don\u2019t care very much about politics, and those that do usually have very strong views that are difficult to change. The small group of people who follow politics closely enough to erect strong echo chambers around themselves also see and share the vast majority of fake news. Though we might like to think that Facebook, Twitter or other platforms could simply tweak some code to save us from our current predicament, these studies hint at a much more unsettling truth: the root cause of political polarization on our platforms is us. And it\u2019s not going away until we find a way to solve it. I can\u2019t entirely buy into Bail\u2019s argument since it feels like conservative partisan media, either taking cues from Trump or giving them to him, is actively pushing misinformation, \u2026 about the election results \u2026 \u2026 about Covid \u2026 turning everything into a partisan issue. We can\u2019t move on from misinformation. President Biden clearly wants to move on from the Trump era, which is probably the healthiest attitude. But it ignores the fact that misinformation is affecting policy, leading Republicans to excise people like Rep. Liz Cheney from their leadership and to push more restrictive voting laws in key states, and, arguably, affecting how some governors have treated Covid restrictions. There\u2019s also, crucially, the effect the Russian meddling and Trump\u2019s Ukraine fishing expedition are having on US foreign policy. CNN\u2019s Matthew Chance has been watching the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukraine border and spoke to Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister about both those troop exercises and the actions of Giuliani before the 2020 campaign. Read that here. He said Giuliani was \u201cplaying politics\u201d but the Ukrainians did their best not to play along. Both topics should be raised if Biden goes ahead and meets Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in June. Certainly that exchange will be different from the Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, Finland, in July 2018, when Trump sided with Putin against US intelligence agencies. It may be an opportunity for a reset between the countries, but it will be impossible to undo the era of misinformation that got us all here.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden said Tuesday it is his \u201chope and expectation\u201d to meet with his Russian counterpart during a planned visit to Europe in June, a high-stakes diplomatic encounter he hopes can restore a degree of predictability to an increasingly fraught relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Biden said at the White House, suggesting his proposed summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin could come as soon as the middle of next month, when he will be in Europe seeking to restore trans-Atlantic ties on his first foreign trip as President. Biden was answering a question on whether he planned to meet with Putin during the upcoming trip, which so far includes stops at the Group of 7 summit in southwest England and NATO and EU summits in Brussels, Belgium. Those summits stretch from June 11 to June 14. A meeting with Putin would likely come after those engagements, officials have suggested, since Biden would value consultations with Western leaders before sitting down with Putin. Symbolically, it is also unlikely Biden would make his first diplomatic engagement outside the United States with Putin. On Friday, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said he\u2019d spoken with his Russian counterpart that morning but that summit details like a time and place hadn\u2019t been settled. \u201cWe are trying to make plans for a summit this summer in a third country in Europe. No date has been fixed, no location has been fixed. But it\u2019s actively under discussion,\u201d Sullivan said during an appearance at the Aspen Institute. Where the talks occur remains an open question. The leaders of Austria, Finland and the Czech Republic have offered up their capitals as potential venues. White House officials have specified it will occur somewhere in Europe. In a phone call with Putin on Friday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz \u201csuggested considering Vienna as the venue of a potential Russia-US meeting at the highest level if a relevant agreement to hold the meeting is reached,\u201d according to a readout from the Kremlin. Vienna hosted talks between the US and Russia to renew a nuclear arms treaty earlier this year. The Austrian capital is currently the site of negotiations between Iran and signatories of the Obama-era nuclear deal \u2013 including Russia \u2013 about bringing the US back into the agreement. In mid-April, Czech Deputy Prime Minister Jan Ham\u00e1\u010dek offered Prague as a potential venue for a summit in a tweet. President Barack Obama met there with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for a summit in 2010. And Finnish President Sauli Niinisto offered Finland as a potential venue after the potential meeting was announced. His office said the possibility of hosting it in Finland had been presented to the US and Russia. President Donald Trump held talks with Putin in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, in 2018, causing consternation when he meet one-on-one with only translators present for more than an hour. Biden initially proposed a summit with Putin last month during a telephone call, and the two sides have been working to finalize details since. Despite deteriorating relations between the two countries on issues like Ukraine and election interference, Biden hopes to establish a clear channel of communication that would avoid undue surprises. Putin has appeared receptive to the offer, even after the United States applied harsh new sanctions and other punishments on Russia for, among other things, its role in a massive cyberattack on government agencies. Ahead of the potential summit, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken is due to visit Ukraine this week. Some officials there are wary of a Biden-Putin summit and are hopeful the US President will find time to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of any talks with Putin. Biden spoke by phone to Zelensky last month, as Russian forces staged a massive buildup on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border that they have since begun winding down. In other areas \u2013 including the continued detention of opposition leader Alexey Navalny \u2013 Putin has not shown signs of ceding to US demands ahead of a potential summit. That has led some experts to question Biden\u2019s decision to go ahead with the meeting. \u201cIs this really the best moment for a Biden-Putin summit? The mere event of a meeting is a win for Putin, but what does Biden or the American people get out of it? If the promise of a future summit was supposed to modify Putin\u2019s bad behavior, that strategy is not working,\u201d wrote Michael McFaul, who served as Obama\u2019s ambassador to Moscow, on Twitter last week. \u201cSummits must seek to advance concrete American national interests. What will those be in June? I\u2019m having a hard time thinking of even small items on a list of deliverables,\u201d McFaul went on. \u201cMaybe better to wait a bit? Or downgrade as a pull-aside at some multilateral meeting instead.\u201d In his appearance at the Aspen Institute on Friday, Sullivan said Biden\u2019s goal was not necessarily to change Putin\u2019s behavior but to inject a degree of predictability into what is now a volatile relationship. \u201cPresident Biden has indicated in his conversations with President Putin and publicly he believes that such a summit would be valuable in establishing better understandings between our two countries and getting this relationship on a more stable, predictable path,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "The top US military intelligence official said during a congressional hearing on Thursday that the Russian military is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the United States. \u201cThe Russian military is an existential threat to the United States,\u201d Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing about worldwide threats. Berrier said the country\u2019s military is being used to maintain influence over states \u201calong its periphery, compete with US global primacy and compel adversaries who challenge Russia\u2019s vital national interests.\u201d \u201cMoscow continues to invest in its strategic nuclear forces, in new capabilities to enhance its strategic deterrent, and that places the US homeland at risk,\u201d Berrier said. US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan has begun Berrier\u2019s comments come as tensions between Russia and the US remain high. The US unveiled sanctions against Moscow earlier this month over its interference in the 2020 US presidential election, the SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d in Crimea. President Joe Biden told a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night that Russia\u2019s \u201cactions will have consequences if they turn out to be true, and they turned out to be true,\u201d referring to Moscow\u2019s interference in the election and the SolarWinds cyberattack. \u201cSo I responded directly and proportionately to Russia\u2019s interference in our elections and cyberattacks on our government and our businesses \u2013 they did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have. But we can also cooperate when it\u2019s in our mutual interests,\u201d Biden said. The White House is hammering out the details of a possible European summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could happen as soon as early summer, according to sources familiar with the planning. Russia has not yet responded officially to the United States\u2019 offer of a summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe are still looking into this proposal and analyzing the situation,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cEach time Washington\u2019s words about the summit meeting are accompanied by words about the need for Russia to pay some kind of price and about inevitable sanctions. So of course, deep analysis is required here.\u201d Russia appeared to be pulling back from a possible confrontation with the West last week as Russian state media reported that troops were returning to their bases after taking part in exercises near the border with Ukraine and in Crimea. Joe Biden can't stop thinking about China and the future of American democracy A buildup of Russian troops along the border in recent weeks had reignited tensions in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists demanding independence from Kiev since 2014. \u201cAt present, military units and formations are marching to railway stations, airfields, loading onto landing ships, railway platforms and military transport aircraft,\u201d Tass reported on April 23, citing the Ministry of Defense. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu\u2019s announcement came weeks after Moscow initiated the largest buildup of troops near the Ukrainian border since 2014. It was unclear from the announcement how many troops would remain in the region. Berrier emphasized that the Russian military\u2019s power comes from its investment into and development of nuclear weapons as well as its \u201cconventional force largely postured for defensive and regional operations.\u201d \u201cRussia has a growing ability to project power with long-range precision cruise missiles and limited expeditionary capabilities,\u201d he added. Berrier pointed out that Russian military leaders are \u201cincorporating lessons from Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria into training and exercises.\u201d When questioned by Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, about Russia\u2019s nuclear warhead development, Berrier confirmed Defense Intelligence Agency assessments from 2018 that stated Russia is updating its nuclear warhead production complex and is producing \u201chundreds of nuclear warheads each year,\u201d saying those assessments are still valid. Berrier also confirmed that while the US is adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium, Russia is not. \u201cThe United States believes that Russia probably is not adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium in the manner consistent with the yield, or with the zero yield standard. The United States, by contrast, is upholding a zero yield standard, end quote,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cDoes that still remain DIA\u2019s assessment?\u201d \u201cIt does, Senator,\u201d Berrier said. CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr, DJ Judd and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott delivered the Republican response to President Joe Biden\u2019s address to Congress Wednesday night. Read his remarks as prepared for delivery: \u201cGood evening. I\u2019m Senator Tim Scott from the great state of South Carolina. \u201cWe just heard President Biden\u2019s first address to Congress. Our President seems like a good man. His speech was full of good words. \u201cBut President Biden promised you a specific kind of leadership. He promised to unite a nation. To lower the temperature. To govern for all Americans, no matter how we voted. \u201cThat was the pitch. You just heard it again. \u201cBut our nation is starving for more than empty platitudes. We need policies and progress that bring us closer together. But three months in, the actions of the President and his party are pulling us further apart. \u201cI won\u2019t waste your time tonight with finger-pointing or partisan bickering. You can get that on T.V. any time you want. \u201cI want to have an honest conversation. About common sense and common ground. About this feeling that our nation is sliding off its shared foundation, and how we move forward together. \u201cGrowing up, I never dreamed I\u2019d be standing here tonight. \u201cWhen I was a kid, my parents divorced. My mother, my brother, and I moved in with my grandparents. Three of us, sharing one bedroom. \u201cI was disillusioned and angry, and I nearly failed out of school. But I was blessed. \u201cFirst, with a praying momma. Then with a mentor, a Chick-Fil-A operator named John Moniz. Finally, with a string of opportunities that are only possible here in America. \u201cThis past year, I\u2019ve watched COVID attack every rung of the ladder that helped me up. \u201cSo many families have lost parents and grandparents too early. So many small businesses have gone under. Becoming a Christian transformed my life \u2014 but for months, too many churches were shut down. \u201cMost of all, I am saddened that millions of kids have lost a year of learning when they could not afford to lose a day. \u201cLocking vulnerable kids out of the classroom is locking adults out of their future. \u201cOur public schools should have reopened months ago. Other countries\u2019 did. Private and religious schools did. Science has shown for months that schools are safe. But too often, powerful grown-ups set science aside. And kids like me were left behind. \u201cThe clearest case for school choice in our lifetimes. \u201cLast year, under Republican leadership, we passed five bipartisan COVID packages. Congress supported our hospitals, saved our economy, and funded Operation Warp Speed, delivering vaccines in record time. \u201cAll five bills got 90 or more votes in the Senate. Common sense found common ground. \u201cIn February, Republicans told President Biden we wanted to keep working together to win this fight. But Democrats wanted to go it alone. \u201cThey spent almost $2 trillion on a partisan bill that the White House bragged was the most liberal bill in American history! Only 1% went to vaccinations. No requirement to re-open schools promptly. \u201cCOVID brought Congress together five times. This Administration pushed us apart. \u201cAnother issue that should unite us is infrastructure. \u201cRepublicans support everything you think of when you think of \u2018infrastructure.\u2019 Roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways, high-speed broadband \u2014 we\u2019re all in! \u201cBut again, Democrats want a partisan wish list. They won\u2019t even build bridges\u2026 to build bridges! \u201cLess than 6% of the President\u2019s plan goes to roads and bridges. It\u2019s a liberal wish-list of Big Government waste\u2026 plus the biggest job-killing tax hikes in a generation. Experts say, when all is said and done, it would lower Americans\u2019 wages and shrink our economy. \u201cTonight we also heard about a so-called \u201cFamily Plan.\u201d Even more taxing, even more spending, to put Washington even more in the middle of your life \u2014 from the cradle, to college. \u201cThe beauty of the American Dream is that families get to define it for themselves. \u201cWe should be expanding options and opportunities for all families \u2014 not throwing money at certain issues because Democrats think they know best. \u201cInfrastructure\u201d spending that shrinks our economy is not common sense. \u201cWeakening our southern border and creating a crisis is not compassionate. \u201cThe President is abandoning principles he held for decades. Now, he says your tax dollars should fund abortions. He\u2019s laying groundwork to pack the Supreme Court. \u201cThis is not common ground. \u201cNowhere do we need common ground more desperately than in our discussions of race. \u201cI have experienced the pain of discrimination. \u201cI know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason. To be followed around a store while I\u2019m shopping. I remember, every morning, at the kitchen table, my grandfather would have the newspaper in his hands. Later, I realized he had never learned to read it. He just wanted to set the right example. \u201cI\u2019ve also experienced a different kind of intolerance. \u201cI get called \u201cUncle Tom\u201d and the N-word \u2014 by \u2018progressives\u2019! By liberals! Just last week, a national newspaper suggested my family\u2019s poverty was actually privilege because a relative owned land generations before my time. \u201cBelieve me, I know our healing is not finished. \u201cIn 2015, after the shooting of Walter Scott, I wrote a bill to fund body cameras. Last year, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, I built an even bigger police reform proposal. \u201cBut my Democratic colleagues blocked it. \u201cI extended an olive branch. I offered them amendments. But Democrats used the filibuster to block the debate from even happening. My friends across the aisle seemed to want the issue more than they wanted a solution. \u201cBut I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m still hopeful. \u201cWhen America comes together, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress. But powerful forces want to pull us apart. \u201cA hundred years ago, kids in classrooms were taught the color of their skin was their most important characteristic \u2014 and if they looked a certain way, they were inferior. \u201cToday, kids again are being taught that the color of their skin defines them \u2014 and if they look a certain way, they\u2019re an oppressor. \u201cFrom colleges to corporations to our culture, people are making money and gaining power by pretending we haven\u2019t made any progress. By doubling down on the divisions we\u2019ve worked so hard to heal. \u201cYou know this stuff is wrong. Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country. \u201cIt\u2019s backwards to fight discrimination with different discrimination. And it\u2019s wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present. \u201cI\u2019m an African-American who has voted in the South all my life. I take voting rights personally. \u201cRepublicans support making it easier to vote and harder to cheat. \u201cAnd so do voters! Big majorities of Americans support early voting, and big majorities support Voter I.D. \u2014 including African-Americans and Hispanics. Common sense makes common ground. \u201cBut today, this conversation has collapsed. \u201cThe state of Georgia passed a law that expands early voting; preserves no-excuse mail-in voting; and, despite what the President claimed, did not reduce Election Day hours. \u201cIf you actually read this law, it\u2019s mainstream. It will be easier to vote early in Georgia than in Democrat-run New York. But the left doesn\u2019t want you to know that. They want people to virtue-signal by yelling about a law they haven\u2019t even read. \u201cFact-checkers have called out the White House for misstatements. The President absurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crow. What is going on here? \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. A Washington power grab. \u201cThis misplaced outrage is supposed to justify Democrats\u2019 sweeping bill that would take over elections for all 50 states; send public funds to political campaigns you disagree with; and make the bipartisan Federal Elections Commission\u2026 partisan! \u201cThis is not about civil rights or our racial past. It\u2019s about rigging elections in the future. \u201cAnd, no \u2014 the same filibuster that President Obama and President Biden praised when they were Senators, that Democrats used just last year, has not suddenly become a racist relic just because the shoe is on the other foot. \u201cRace is not a political weapon to settle every issue the way one side wants. \u201cIt\u2019s too important. \u201cThis should be a joyful springtime for our nation. \u201cThis Administration inherited a tide that had already turned. The coronavirus is on the run! Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the Trump Administration, our country is flooded with safe and effective vaccines. Thanks to our bipartisan work last year, job openings are rebounding. \u201cSo why do we feel so divided and anxious? \u201cA nation with so much cause for hope should not feel so heavy-laden. \u201cA President who promised to bring us together should not push agendas that tear us apart. \u201cThe American family deserves better. And we know what better looks like! \u201cJust before COVID, we had the most inclusive economy in my lifetime. The lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asian-Americans. The lowest for women in nearly 70 years. Wages were growing faster for the bottom 25% than the top 25%. \u201cThat happened because Republicans focused on expanding opportunity for all Americans. \u201cWe passed Opportunity Zones, criminal justice reform, and permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities for the first time ever. We fought the drug epidemic, rebuilt our military, and cut taxes for working families and single moms like mine. \u201cOur best future won\u2019t come from Washington schemes or socialist dreams. It will come from you \u2014 the American people. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white and Asian. Republican and Democrat. Brave police officers and Black neighborhoods. \u201cWe are not adversaries. We are family! We are all in this together. \u201cAnd we get to live in the greatest country on Earth. The country where my grandfather, in his 94 years, saw his family go from cotton to Congress in one lifetime. \u201cSo I am more than hopeful \u2014 I am confident \u2014 that our finest hour is yet to come. \u201cOriginal sin is never the end of the story. Not in our souls, and not for our nation. The real story is always redemption. \u201cI am standing here because my mom has prayed me through some very tough times. \u201cI believe our nation has succeeded the same way. Because generations of Americans, in their own ways, have asked for grace \u2014 and God has supplied it. \u201cSo I will close with a word from a worship song that helped me through this past year. The music is new, but the words draw from Scripture. [May] the Lord bless you and keep you, Make His face shine upon you And be gracious to you\u2026 May His presence go before you, And behind you, and beside you\u2026 In your weeping and rejoicing, He is with you\u2026 May His favor be upon [our nation], for a thousand generations And your family\u2026 and your children\u2026 And their children. \u201cGood night, and God bless.\u201d ###",

            "article_content": "A Texas man arrested for storming the US Capitol and assaulting police officers on January 6 also serves as a Republican Party precinct chair and has been an election poll worker in north Texas. Mark Middleton, 52, was appointed as the chair of Precinct 14 in Cooke County in December, just a month after the presidential election, according to Chris McNamara, chairman of the Cooke County Republican Party. RELATED: Justice Department has charged at least 400 people in Capitol riot so far A precinct chair is a low-level elected position in local party politics. However, Middleton was not elected. He was appointed by a committee of local Republicans to fill the vacant precinct officer position. The Texas Republican Party says the duty of its precinct chairs is to \u201chelp promote and grow the local county party\u201d and \u201cto maximize the Republican vote in your precinct.\u201d Justice Department releases video of attack on Capitol Police officer Middleton is one of multiple rioters with local Republican Party ties. Derrick Evans, a former member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, and Jorge Riley, former secretary for the State Board of the California Republican Assembly, are among those who have faced criminal charges for participating in the riot. Both men resigned after the riot. Middleton and his wife, Jalise Middleton, were both arrested and face seven federal charges each. They have pleaded not guilty. Their attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Middleton also worked as an election clerk in two recent Cooke County elections, according to Pam Harrison, the Cooke County clerk and elections administrator. Clerks are usually picked by the precinct election judge overseeing individual election sites. \u201cThese people tried to overturn the election. I don\u2019t want someone like that near a poll,\u201d said John Angus, the chairman of the Cooke County Democratic Party. Mark and Jalise Middleton traveled to Washington, DC, to attend the protest against the certification of the 2020 presidential election. In court documents, FBI investigators say the Middletons marched from the White House to the Capitol grounds where they engaged in violent confrontations with two police officers trying to prevent the mob from storming inside the building. On officer body camera footage, federal investigators say Middleton is heard saying \u201cF**K You\u201d after Capitol Police officers warn him and other rioters to \u201cget back.\u201d The court documents allege the Middletons helped knock down a barrier that allowed hundreds of other protesters to storm the west side of the Capitol. Investigators say the Middleton couple assaulted the officers by repeatedly grabbing and striking at them with their hands. The couple would later write in Facebook posts that the officers doused them in pepper spray to keep the crowd from moving forward. Investigators say the Middletons documented their movements on January 6 in a series of now deleted Facebook postings. US Capitol rioters charged in Sicknick case were armed with bear spray but only used pepper spray, prosecutors say \u201cWe are on the front lines. We helped push down the barriers,\u201d Middleton wrote in the Facebook post, according to federal investigators. \u201cWe had to retreat, but more patriots pushed forward, and they\u2019re taking back our house.\u201d Mark Middleton started volunteering with the Cooke County Republican Party last year before he was appointed as a precinct chair, according to McNamara. Cooke County is deeply conservative and sits on the Texas-Oklahoma border about 65 miles north of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Trump won the county in the 2020 election with 82% of the vote. Middleton was appointed to the precinct chair position as Trump was scaling up his fraudulent attacks on the 2020 election results. But McNamara says he doesn\u2019t know if Trump\u2019s lies about the election inspired Middleton to take on a more official role in local party politics. Justice Department has charged at least 400 people in Capitol riot so far \u201cI never got extreme vibes from him,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cI felt that he was disappointed that President Trump lost.\u201d If he chooses, Mark Middleton will be able to serve out the remainder of his term until March 2022. The Cooke County Republican chairman says the party \u201chas no mechanism for removing him\u201d from office. McNamara said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in Middleton\u2019s actions and the Cooke County Republican Party does not condone the attack on the Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in American history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the way we do things.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Ted Budd launched his North Carolina Senate campaign on Wednesday, aligning himself with former President Donald Trump in a 2022 bid for the crucial seat. The congressman, who was first elected in 2016, had been widely expected to run to replace the retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr. He joins a growing primary field including former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker. Budd announced his decision in a video featuring a monster truck called the \u201cliberal agenda crusher,\u201d clips of Trump praising Budd, and attacks on the Left. He charged that Democratic leaders in Washington were \u201cshredding our Constitution,\u201d creating an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d at the US-Mexico border, \u201ccutting\u201d American jobs and \u201cmortgaging our children\u2019s future\u201d by adding to the debt. He warned that the Senate is \u201cthe last line of defense\u201d against the US becoming a \u201cwoke socialist wasteland.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a small businessman who was so fed up with the liberals\u2019 attacks on our faith, our families and our way of life that I ran for Congress to stand and fight alongside Donald Trump, drain the swamp and take our country back,\u201d Budd said. The congressman\u2019s announcement was a clear effort to woo Trump and his supporters, who won North Carolina in 2016 and 2020. Budd met with the former president on Friday evening at Trump\u2019s Florida retreat Mar-a-Lago, according to his political adviser, and previously joined the former president in his effort to overturn the 2020 election, which has become an early litmus test in GOP primaries. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 McCrory supported Congress\u2019 certification of Trump\u2019s loss, arguing that it\u2019s the conservative position to hold states, rather than the federal government, responsible for their elections. But in January, Budd voted to throw out the electoral results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, just hours after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. He and Walker also signed onto a Texas lawsuit seeking to discard millions of votes across key battleground states. Budd has claimed that there were \u201clegitimate concerns over voter fraud\u201d even though there\u2019s no evidence of it, and said in his announcement video Wednesday that \u201celections should be fair and secure.\u201d In response to Budd\u2019s announcement, Walker attacked McCrory, who is currently viewed as the front-runner in the GOP primary. The former governor is the only Republican to have won a statewide race, but Walker noted that McCrory also lost two other gubernatorial campaigns. \u201cWe must stay grounded in finally giving our state conservative leadership in the Senate and not gambling on a career politician who has lost more statewide races than he\u2019s won,\u201d Walker said. North Carolina Democrats have struggled statewide in recent federal elections. In 2020, Trump beat Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by a little over a point, while Senate Democratic nominee Cal Cunningham lost his race against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis by close to two points after a sex scandal. But Democrats are hopeful that they can take Burr\u2019s seat in their effort to protect their slim majority. Cheri Beasley, the first Black woman to be North Carolina Supreme Court chief justice, state Sen. Jeff Jackson, former state Sen. Erica Smith, virologist Richard Watkins and Beaufort Mayor Rett Newton are all running for the North Carolina Senate Democratic nomination. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump schooled his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s well in his politics of down-in-the-muck misinformation. The ex-President\u2019s Washington devotees and media backers are proving they don\u2019t need him in the White House or blazing away on Twitter to stir his stew of lies, false realities, assaults on democracy, circus politics and racial grievance. The test of their approach will not be in whether it is true. It\u2019s whether it works in helping House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who has anchored his own reputation to the autocratic and vengeful ex-President, to win the speaker\u2019s gavel next year. It\u2019s not as if unchained lies and cartoonish antics are the only options for the GOP. Sure, Democratic President Joe Biden has spent his first 100 days offering the kind of governance \u2013 in the face of the worst public health crisis in 100 years \u2013 that Trump jettisoned as soon as he figured it might hurt him politically. But it\u2019s an open question if ex-Republicans who took a chance on Biden after being alienated by Trump all favor the multi-trillion dollar makeover of the US economy and society the President plans. Midterm voters are moreover often receptive to the idea of reining in presidents who appear to over read their mandates. With this in mind, Republican House No. 3 leader and Trump heretic Liz Cheney of Wyoming argued Monday that Biden was pursuing \u201ceven farther left policies than we could have anticipated and certainly than he campaigned on.\u201d The right\u2019s favorite hate figure \u2013 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York liberal \u2013 nailed the case shut by saying that progressives expected a \u201cmore conservative administration.\u201d The GOP also has an opening on Biden\u2019s handling of a surge of child migrants across the southern border, his efforts to renew a nuclear deal with Iran and reverse Trump\u2019s disruptive foreign policy. Yet the approach of most of the Republican Party, which remains dominated by an aberrant ex-President who insulted his country\u2019s founding values by trying to steal an election he lost, is closer to caricature than a principled conservative case for alternative government. Republican voters are being falsely told that Biden is coming not just for their guns, but for their burgers as well; that a President who wants to spend billions on helping working Americans actually wants to tax them into destitution, rather than making life a little less comfortable for the one-percenters rewarded by Trump. The attacks are sometimes not consistent, but they create a flagrant false narrative anyway. Biden has for example managed to pass a $1.9 trillion Covid relief package and, with his massive social safety net bills, is doing a passable impression of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Not bad for a President who, according to Trump\u2019s supporters, is senile, doesn\u2019t know where he is and can barely string a sentence together. Again, the truth is not important for Trump\u2019s most prominent followers \u2013 throwing out enough misinformation to cause doubt, cynicism and confusion is the aim. The 45th President\u2019s departure has hardly halted the conservative culture wars. Instead, it has merely brought new actors to center stage as they add their voices to the barrage of falsehoods. Some of the ex-President\u2019s fans took to Fox News and social media to assault the motives of jurors after the murder conviction of Derek Chauvin, rather than dwell on the horror of George Floyd\u2019s agonizing death with a knee on his neck. There\u2019s Fox star Tucker Carlson, who endorsed the racist \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory embraced by White nationalists, which claims that Democrats are importing developing world immigrants to dilute the votes of Americans. Others are busily trying to create a new truth to deny the actions of the mob that surged into the US Capitol after he told them to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d to reverse his election loss. And one of the ex-President\u2019s chief apologists on that issue is Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican who has now turned to undermining the Covid-19 vaccine drive. Trump\u2019s favorite hosts on Fox used Monday night to lay another thick fog of misinformation on masks ahead of a Biden speech on the issue on Tuesday. Across the nation, pro-Trump state lawmakers are effectively making it harder for Black Americans to vote and argue they must act to reassure those who distrust the electoral system \u2013 largely because of Trump\u2019s flagrant lies. Perhaps most perniciously, Trump\u2019s cronies are carrying out a sham recount of the long-settled election in Arizona. It won\u2019t put him back in the Oval Office but will further torch US democracy to soothe a beaten leader\u2019s vanity. Social media firms and media that point out Trump\u2019s obvious lies are accused of censoring or \u201ccanceling\u201d conservative voices. Democrats, according to Trump partisans, want to get rid of the police entirely, not introduce reforms. Never mind that they are working with GOP senators to ban officers from using choke holds and make it easier to prosecute bad cops after Floyd\u2019s death. Given that this brand of stunt and grievance politics in recent years lost the Republicans the House, the Senate and the White House, it might seem like a bad bet. And Biden\u2019s approval ratings, higher than Trump ever managed \u2013 especially on the pandemic \u2013 suggest that the public prefers a president that doesn\u2019t impose his towering ego on the country, or openly lie and stoke the most aching national divides before breakfast. Biden has also deliberately carved out a persona as a fixer who is merely trying to get the country back on its feet. History however suggests that, whatever happens, a first-term president tends to get a hammering in midterm elections. And Democratic majorities are so slim that even a swing of a few points away from the President could leave him hostage to a Republican House and Senate from January 2023. The implication of new census data released on Monday could also be grave for Democrats as it showed population shifts from the Midwest and Northeast towards Trump country in the south. The data generally supported expectations that the GOP could net up to a handful of House seats in the 2022 midterm elections. Given their single figure majority, that could mean big trouble for Democrats. Midterms are often what political scientists refer to as base elections, meaning that only the party\u2019s most committed partisans show up. If that\u2019s the case, keeping Trump\u2019s millions of supporters outraged and looking for revenge could be a decisive strategy for Republicans and will require Democrats to be equally as excited to shield a President who won\u2019t be on the ticket. McCarthy, who for a short while condemned Trump\u2019s actions ahead of the storming of the Capitol on January 6 before making a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, has clearly run all these calculation in his head. He came across in a just-published New York Times profile as half-committed to a Faustian pact to wallow in Trump\u2019s lies to fulfill his ambitions of being speaker and half-cowed by the ex-President\u2019s fury. It\u2019s not a given that Republican tactics will succeed. If Biden manages to navigate the country out of the pandemic and into a new economic golden age, he will have a powerful case to make to up-for-grabs suburbanites who might again prove electorally decisive in 2022. And while Trumpian excess might help House candidates stave off primary challenges from the right and electrify comparatively small electorates in their districts, the strategy might backfire among bigger Senate electorates. And a cadre of Trump-style candidates in swing states could scare off moderates and complicate a map already challenging to Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s hopes of winning back the Senate. But since Trump remains highly popular among the Republican base, has no plans to go away and \u2013 as always \u2013 is using his party as an instrument of his personal revenge, it\u2019s the only strategy the Republicans have.",

            "article_content": "The White House is hammering out the details of an increasingly likely European summit between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which could happen as soon as early summer, according to sources familiar with the planning. The planning comes as the Biden administration is preparing to send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Ukraine next month, according to a Ukrainian government source close to the ongoing negotiations. The visit could ease the European country\u2019s anxiety over a potential meeting between Biden and Putin this summer on the heels of the US President\u2019s meetings with Group of 7 and NATO allies. The fact that the Biden administration would deploy its most senior diplomat to Ukraine in the weeks before a potential summit sends a clear signal that Washington stands with the Eastern European nation and values it as an ally. Ukrainian forces have been battling Russia-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east since 2014, and dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since a ceasefire between the camps broke down earlier this year. Some officials are wary of a Biden-Putin summit, particularly in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials hope that Biden will find time to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of any talks with Putin. Biden spoke by phone to Zelensky last month, as Russian forces staged a massive buildup on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border that they have since begun winding down. Blinken\u2019s visit to Ukraine will be one opportunity to discuss a potential Biden-Zelensky meeting while the US President is in Europe this summer, said the Ukrainian government source. The secretary of state has already spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, several times since taking office, including earlier this month at a meeting in Brussels. Veteran diplomat Daniel Fried, who served as ambassador to Poland from 1997 to 2000, called the potential Blinken trip \u201ca very good move.\u201d \u201cA proper Ukraine strategy needs two parts,\u201d he said. \u201cOne arm around their shoulder to help them resist aggression from the Kremlin and a foot on their back to get them to fix things at home, so that Ukraine is not simply a corrupt state vulnerable to that Russian aggression.\u201d A US-Russia summit is not yet officially in the books, and plans could change. But it is looking increasingly likely as tensions begin to ease between the countries \u2013 Russia recently began drawing down a massive, months-long military buildup on the eastern Ukrainian border and the US ambassador to Russia is expected to return to Moscow in the coming weeks, before any summit takes place. He had been sent back to Washington for consultations following a new round of American sanctions on Russia in response to the SolarWinds hack and 2020 election interference campaign. It is not clear how the condition of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, whose health has been deteriorating rapidly in prison, will affect plans for a summit \u2013 Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said there will be consequences if Navalny dies but has declined to say whether a US-Russia meeting is contingent upon Navalny\u2019s survival. Any potential meeting between Biden and Putin, moreover, would come after the US President\u2019s meetings with G7 and NATO officials, sources say, in keeping with the White House\u2019s practice of coordinating significant national security and foreign policy initiatives with key allies and projecting a united front against Russian aggression and provocations. That policy marks one of the most significant shifts from the previous administration, when President Donald Trump questioned the value of NATO and floated the possibility of allowing Russia to rejoin the G7 while siding with Putin over the US intelligence community on key national security issues, like election interference and hacking. Trump was also continuously wary of penalizing Russia on the world stage, whereas Biden in his first 100 days in office has rolled out two new rounds of sanctions on Moscow and expelled nearly a dozen Russian diplomats from the US.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Monday establishing a task force aimed at empowering workers to organize and bargain with their employers that will be chaired by Vice President Kamala Harris, the White House said in a news release. The White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment will be vice-chaired by Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh and will include more than 20 Cabinet members and heads of other federal agencies. It will aim to facilitate worker organizing across the country, increase worker power in underserved communities\u00a0and increase union membership. The move is the latest of several pro-union actions taken by the President, who pledged the night before Election Day to be the \u201cmost pro-union president you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Biden often says unions \u201cbuilt the middle class,\u201d and days after taking office signed an executive order restoring collective bargaining power to federal employees. The order directs the task force to make a set of recommendations within 180 days on how existing policies, programs and practices can be used to promote worker organizing and collective bargaining in the federal government, and what new policies are needed to achieve the task force\u2019s mission. Biden strongly encouraged the Senate to pass the so-called \u201cPRO Act,\u201d a bill the President said would encourage unions and \u201cdramatically enhance the power of workers to organize and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.\u201d The House passed the bill last month, and it is unclear whether the Senate, which is divided 50-50 Democrats and Republicans, will pass the bill. Earlier this year Biden took an unusual step of issuing a presidential video backing the right to unionize of workers at an Amazon plant in Alabama and appeared to warn the online retail giant not to interfere. Amazon ultimately defeated the landmark union drive that would have established the company\u2019s first US union. The pro-union moves follow on campaign pledges from Biden and also come as the coronavirus pandemic has brought many workers rights issues to the forefront. The task force is the latest high-profile assignment given to the vice president, who has also been tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts with Central American countries to\u00a0stem the flow of migrants to the US southern border. Biden and Harris have worked to deepen their relationship since taking office and have spent five hours or more together per day in meetings at the White House, CNN has reported. Harris recently told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that she remains the last person in the room when big decisions are made. Harris has also molded herself as increasingly pro-union. During a trip to New Hampshire last week, she toured an IBEW training facility. She has often said unions are the reason workers have the rights they have now, including the five-day work week.

            "article_content": "The US Ambassador to Russia will return to the United States this week for discussions with the Biden administration about the relationship between Russia and the US, amid heightened tensions between the two nations. Ambassador John Sullivan plans to come back to the US for \u201cconsultations,\u201d the US Embassy in Moscow said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI believe it is important for me to speak directly with my new colleagues in the Biden administration in Washington about the current state of bilateral relations between the United States and Russia,\u201d Sullivan said in the statement released by the embassy. Sullivan said he will return to Moscow in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d before any meeting between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cAlso, I have not seen my family in well over a year, and that is another important reason for me to return home for a visit,\u201d he added. Sullivan\u2019s return home comes after the US last week imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds massive cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d in Crimea. The penalties included the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including \u201crepresentatives of Russian intelligence services,\u201d for the election interference and the cyber hack. A day later, Russia sanctioned eight senior US administration officials in retaliation, imposed new limits on American diplomats, and said it would expel 10 US diplomats, while the US warned against a \u201ccycle of escalation.\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Kremlin told Sullivan that he should return to Washington to hold \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d consultations. CNN previously reported that the Kremlin had summoned Sullivan to the foreign ministry for what it said was a \u201cdifficult\u201d conversation following the US sanctions against Russia. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday that they \u201chave not yet received any official diplomatic correspondence providing details of the Russian government\u2019s actions against the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Russia.\u201d \u201cWhen we do receive any correspondence from Russian authorities, we will review that, and we reserve the right, of course, to respond as we see fit,\u201d he said at a briefing. \u201cThe ambassador has not been expelled. The ambassador has not been ordered out of the country. The ambassador is returning now at an opportune time to undertake consultations here, to see his family, and again I expect he\u2019ll return to Moscow in the coming weeks,\u201d he added. Price explained that Sullivan has not yet had a chance to meet with incoming administration officials as he has not been home for \u201csome time.\u201d Tensions between the Russia and the United States continue to rise as Moscow is also amassing forces along the Ukraine border in the largest buildup of Russian troops since 2014 when Russia invaded and occupied the Crimean Peninsula, Biden administration officials have said. The Biden administration is also considering options to punish Russia if imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies in state custody, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Sunday. As of Tuesday, the Biden administration has not finalized how it will hold Russia accountable if Navalny dies, according to a source familiar with the planning. Efforts to develop sanctions options are ongoing at the State Department, and there are intense meetings at the working level this week to review and crystalize those options so that the administration can plan for different scenarios, the source said. The department is also developing options for sanctions if Russia makes further incursions into Ukraine, the source said. A NSC spokesperson said they would not telegraph the Biden administration\u2019s punches and would not provide any details beyond the remarks Jake Sullivan made over the weekend. John Sullivan, a Trump administration appointee, has been the US ambassador to Russia for about a year and a half. The Biden administration had recently decided to keep Sullivan on the job for the foreseeable future, two senior administration officials had told CNN. The Kremlin had recalled their ambassador from Washington and brought him back to Moscow to discuss Russia-US relations after Biden said last month he believes Putin is a killer. Biden spoke with Putin last Tuesday in which he proposed a meeting in a third country in the coming months. According to readouts of the call from the White House and Kremlin, Navalny was not a topic of discussion when Biden and Putin spoke last week. As the Biden administration draws up options, there is mounting pressure for the US to be more direct with its warnings to Russia. Maria Pevchikh, a close aide to Navalny, told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cNew Day\u201d Tuesday that the consequences being considered by the Biden administration as a result of what happens to Navalny \u201cneed to happen before he dies. Because who really cares what happens after he dies.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zahra Ullah, Nicole Gaouette, Anna Chernova, Jennifer Hansler and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Russia sanctioned eight senior US administration officials Friday, including FBI director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, one of several measures it took just a day after President Joe Biden announced sweeping sanctions against Russia and warned against a \u201ccycle of escalation.\u201d Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia will also expel 10 US diplomats, curb the activity of US nonprofit groups in the country, impose new limits on American diplomats and diplomatic outposts, and consider \u201cpainful\u201d measures against US businesses in retaliation for Thursday\u2019s punitive actions by the Biden administration. Lavrov also said the Kremlin has told the US Ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, that he should return to Washington to hold \u201cdetailed\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d consultations. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US returned to Moscow in March after Biden said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a \u201ckiller\u201d in a TV interview. The moves are \u201cjust a part of the possibilities at our disposal,\u201d the Russian foreign ministry warned in a statement on its website, and follow Thursday\u2019s announcement that Moscow will block foreign naval ships and state vessels in the Kerch Strait, the sea of Azov and parts of the Black Sea \u2013 a move NATO and the Pentagon criticized. The foreign ministry statement added that the US should \u201cshow prudence by abandoning the confrontational course\u201d and that \u201cnot a single wave of sanctions will go unpunished.\u201d Friday\u2019s wave of Russian penalties comes in a week when Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking for the US and its NATO allies, expressed deep concerns about Moscow\u2019s military build-up along the border with Ukraine, and the US intelligence community said in an annual report that Russia \u201cpresents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.\u201d A US State Department spokesperson called the Russian steps \u201cescalatory and regrettable.\u201d \u201cOur recent actions were proportionate and appropriate to Russia\u2019s harmful activities,\u201d they said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the Russian government was escalatory and regrettable. It is not in our interest to get into an escalatory cycle, but we reserve the right to respond to any Russian retaliation against the United States.\u201d The Russian foreign ministry released a statement on its website Friday naming Wray and Haines, along with US Attorney General Merrick Garland, Biden\u2019s domestic policy advisor Susan Rice, Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and the director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons Michael Carvajal. The statement also names John Bolton, former national security adviser to former President Donald Trump and former CIA Director Robert James Woolsey, Jr. Six key takeaways from Biden's Russia sanctions announcement \u201cTaking into account the unprecedented nature of the complications provoked by Washington in Russian- American relations, it was decided to deviate from the usual practice not to \u2018highlight\u2019 countermeasures publicly undertaken by the Russian side,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement. The State Department has not responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Lavrov told reporters Friday that Putin\u2019s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov recommended to Sullivan on Friday that he return to DC. \u201cThe situation is quite multi-layered, it needs to be studied in detail,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cMoreover, sometimes incomprehensible things happen in Washington. Or at least things that are not completely clear. Therefore, today Ushakov recommended Ambassador John Sullivan to go to his capital and hold detailed, serious consultations there.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Sullivan said the US embassy had not received \u201cany official diplomatic correspondence\u201d on Russian actions against the US. \u201cWe have seen a message that appears on the website belonging to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and are reviewing the information therein, in consultation with Washington,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe have not received any official diplomatic correspondence providing details of the Russian government actions against the diplomatic mission of the United States of America in Russia.\u201d Lavrov, speaking at a press conference in Moscow with his Serbian counterpart, described the measures as a \u201ctit-for-tat response\u201d to the Biden administration\u2019s Thursday announcement of sanctions to punish Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d in Crimea. Those US penalties included the expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including \u201crepresentatives of Russian intelligence services,\u201d for the cyber hack and the election meddling. \u201cTen diplomats were on a list the US side handed over to us asking to ensure their leaving the United States. We will give a tit-for-tat response to that. We will also ask 10 US diplomats to leave our country,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cSome time ago, before the package [of sanctions] recently announced by Biden, the Americans added eight representatives of Russian structures, the Russian leadership, including the presidential administration and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, to the sanctions list,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cToday we will publish a list of eight officials who represent the governing structures of the Washington administration. They will also be included in our sanctions list.\u201d Biden administration confirms Russian agent shared 2016 Trump polling data as part of election interference efforts The foreign ministry announced a slew of other measures that could make it hard for US diplomats to function inside Russia. The State Department will be limited to sending only 10 employees a year to Russia for short-term assignments; the US embassy will be banned from employing Russian citizens or those from third countries; and Moscow is terminating a bilateral agreement that allowed US diplomats to travel around Russia without notifying the foreign ministry. Lavrov also said the Kremlin \u201cwill restrict and terminate the activities on our territory of American foundations and non-governmental organizations, which in fact, directly interfere in our domestic political life.\u201d The foreign ministry said it would target \u201cAmerican foundations and NGOs controlled by the State Department and other American government agencies.\u201d Tanya Lokshina, the Moscow-based Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch, said, \u201cFor years now, the Russian government has been taking different steps to stifle the work of independent critical organizations, be they Russian NGOS or foreign NGOs,\u201d using laws, hostile media campaigns, harassment and painting them as foreign-funded or foreign-controlled. Russia is also considering more \u201cpainful\u201d measures against US businesses, Lavrov said, framing them as a response to sanctions the US placed on Russian sovereign debt and adding that for now, the Kremlin is keeping those steps \u201cin reserve.\u201d The Biden administration is barring US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia\u2019s central bank and other leading financial institutions. US financial institutions weren\u2019t big buyers of Russian bonds, but their withdrawal from the market as potential buyers will still have an impact, said Gary Hufbauer, a former Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cFor obvious reasons, we do not have comparable levers of influence on the United States of this scale,\u201d Lavrov said Friday, adding that \u201cour experts\u201d believe the Russian economy can handle it. \u201cIn any case, we have found and will find a way out of any situation. But we also have the opportunity to take painful measures against American business. We will keep them in reserve,\u201d Lavrov warned. Biden said Thursday that the sanctions against Russia were a proportionate response to cyber-attacks against the US and interference in two presidential elections, but also emphasized that \u201cnow is the time to de-escalate\u201d tensions with the country. As part of Thursday\u2019s announcement, the US formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as the force behind the SolarWinds hack that affected the federal government and wide swaths of the private sector. During remarks at the White House, Biden said that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin during a Tuesday phone call that he could have gone further. Biden said that while he wants to avoid escalating tensions, he made clear to Putin that he would not hesitate to take further action in the future. \u201cWe cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,\u201d Biden said. He added, \u201cI told (Putin) that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election and SolarWinds was \u2026 totally inappropriate.\u201d The 10 Russian diplomats who are being expelled are based in Washington, DC, and New York, and will have 30 days to leave the country, a US official familiar with the plans explained. Asked how the US chose the 10 diplomats who will be expelled, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday that those individuals \u201cwere acting with a manner inconsistent with their status in the US,\u201d and declined to provide further details.

            "article_content": "After President Joe Biden declared Wednesday that the US must shift focus from a bloody and intractable war to more modern-day pursuits, it took less than 24 hours for him to put his words into practice. Unveiling a new package of sanctions on Russia while pressing its leader for a summertime summit in Europe, Biden made clear he believes the bigger threat to America lies in cyberspace rather than in the mountains of Afghanistan. On Friday he\u2019ll welcome his first foreign visitor to the White House \u2013 the Prime Minister of Japan \u2013 and make the case for a united front against China, a country that has steadily expanded its influence in the two decades the US has been sending thousands of troops and trillions of dollars into its longest war. Biden and his senior team believe America\u2019s foreign policy interests overwhelmingly lie in the Asia-Pacific rather than the Middle East, as evidenced by an unofficial delegation that arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday in a show of support for an island that China views as a renegade province. And next week he\u2019ll convene dozens of world leaders \u2013 including potentially those from Russia and China \u2013 for a virtual summit on climate change, an issue he believes eclipses national disputes and imperils the future of the planet just as much as terrorism. All of it adds up to the clearest view yet of how Biden sees his role as commander in chief. Having spoken again and again about proving to the world that democracy still works, officials say Biden is taking steps to free up the time and money needed to actually make his case. After spending decades watching as other presidents\u2019 priorities were waylaid by a war that had long outlived its original objectives, and having his advice brushed aside,  Biden \u2013 who views foreign policy as his \u201cfirst love\u201d in politics, according to his press secretary \u2013 now hopes to illustrate what it means to move on. \u201cWhat President Biden wants to do is put America in a position of strength, to be able to deal not just with great power competition from Russia and China but with the significant transnational threats that affect the American way of life: pandemics and climate change, terrorism, cyber threats,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d when asked Thursday how new sanctions on Russia fit within the Biden doctrine. \u201cTo do that, we need to invest at home to build up a strong foundation,\u201d Sullivan went on. \u201cWe need strong, powerful, capable allies. We need to be writing the international rules of the road for things like cyber and emerging technologies, not letting autocrats do it. Above all, we need to stop the forever war in Afghanistan.\u201d Not everyone in Biden\u2019s administration agreed. Senior Pentagon and State Department officials sought to maintain a US troop presence in Afghanistan, fearing a rapid deterioration of security in the country and backsliding on democracy and human rights. An intelligence assessment appeared to back that up, and the CIA\u2019s director revealed publicly on the day the White House announced the decision that withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan would pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to the United States. Biden, fully aware of the risks, approached the decision having spent two decades watching American interests and objectives shift in Afghanistan. From his position chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he had grilled military leaders about the war. That continued in the White House Situation Room when he was vice president, pressing the generals to explain their reasoning for staying in the country. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been around this town for too long, but one thing I know is when these generals are trying to box in a new president,\u201d he told President Barack Obama in a dramatic stage whisper, according to Obama\u2019s recent memoir. \u201cDon\u2019t let them jam you.\u201d As president, Biden was determined not to be jammed himself. He entered the job with more foreign policy experience than any of his recent predecessors, and White House officials described him as convinced the war was diverting resources and attention that were better spent elsewhere, be it improving conditions in the United States or trying to catch up to China \u2013 two goals he believes are inherently intertwined. \u201cWe went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago. That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021,\u201d he said from the Treaty Room on Wednesday. \u201cRather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that are in front of us.\u201d On Thursday the issue in front of him was Russia, a country he appears intent on holding accountable for its hacking operations and election interference while also preventing what one official described as a situation where escalating actions \u201cspin out of control.\u201d As a candidate, Biden accused his predecessor of appearing weak on Russia, declaring President Donald Trump \u201cPutin\u2019s puppy\u201d during a debate in September and harshly criticizing him for failing to address intelligence that Russia had placed bounties on the heads of American troops in Afghanistan. On Thursday, administration officials revealed the US intelligence community had only \u201clow to moderate confidence\u201d in the information about the bounties, and that a major package of sanctions would not include steps to punish for Moscow over the issue. The issue of the bounties underscored the ways in which the war in Afghanistan had come to color other areas of US foreign policy in ways Biden is now attempting to change. The package of sanctions announced Thursday was meant to cut off lending to the Russian government as punishment for its advanced hacking operation that targeted American federal agencies. The US also said it was expelling Russian diplomats from the embassy in Washington and joining with European partners to apply sanctions related to Russia\u2019s occupation of Crimea \u2013 a situation that has flared up again as Russian troops mass on the border with Ukraine. The top general of US European Command said the possibility of an invasion of Ukraine in the next few weeks is \u201clow to medium\u201d when asked during a congressional hearing on Thursday. Gen. Tod Wolters said Russia has a \u201cvery large ground domain force that has moved to the western military district and the southern military district in the vicinity of Crimea and the Donbass\u201d region of Ukraine. Wolters did note that supply lines have \u201cplateaued.\u201d At the same time, Biden has reiterated his invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin for summit talks, seeking \u201ca relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable,\u201d according to one senior administration official. \u201cWe do not seek, we do not desire, a downward spiral,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe think we can and should avoid that.\u201d Still, there are limits to Biden\u2019s ability to punish Russia through sanctions, and White House officials have said \u201cunseen\u201d steps to respond to the hacking could prove more decisive. Putin has yet to respond yet to Biden\u2019s summit invite. If Russia amounts to a diminished former Cold War adversary whose disruption of cyber networks has proved deeply destabilizing, another country \u2013 China \u2013 represents a rising power whose economy and military could overtake the US in the coming decades. The US will have to cooperate to some degree with each; Biden has already quickly renegotiated the New START nuclear treaty with Russia and hopes to work with China on climate change, including when his special envoy on the issue, John Kerry, pays a visit to Beijing soon. He\u2019ll be the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit China to date. Both China and Russia have seized on perceived weaknesses inside the United States as evidence the country is waning in power, including the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and the pandemic-prompted economic downturn. They have defended their own human rights abuses \u2013 including the detention of Uyghur Muslims in the western Xinjiang province \u2013 by pointing to US treatment of minorities, both historic and present-day. Biden, and by extension his national security team, have made improving those factors central to their foreign policy. The President has framed his push to revamp American infrastructure \u2013 with its expansive definition that includes broadband internet and home health workers \u2013 as central to the country\u2019s attempt at competing with China. The President dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan this week, a show of support for the self-ruling island as China grows increasingly aggressive in its posture. The group, composed of former Sen. Chris Dodd and former senior State Department officials Richard Armitage and James Steinberg, arrived Wednesday. Visits by high-ranking US officials have rankled Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory. And on Friday Biden will nudge a top regional ally, Japan, to join him in more aggressively confronting Beijing for its regional aggression and human rights abuses. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is the first foreign leader to make an in-person visit to the White House during Biden\u2019s term, a signal of the importance Biden and his top national security advisers place on reinvigorating American alliances in a region they view as increasingly fundamental to American interests. Japan has historically been more wary of direct confrontation with China, a country with which it is deeply interconnected. But Biden has made competition with China a central component of his agenda and believes he needs American allies on board. He\u2019ll welcome South Korea\u2019s President to the White House at the end of May, and has recently revived the so-called Quad alliance of Japan, India, the United States and Australia as a means for dealing with regional issues. Officials said the decision to draw down troops in Afghanistan will free up the time and resources to focus on Asia that senior American officials had spent previously plodding forward in the war. China\u2019s aggression in the region \u2013 including increasing tensions around Taiwan and in disputed areas of the South China Sea \u2013 has occupied more and more military attention over the past decade, even as the Afghanistan conflict wore on. Beijing has dramatically scaled up its influence in far-flung regions as the US focused on a war stretching decades. Biden has framed the challenge as beyond simply out-competing China on new technology or prevailing in maritime disputes; he has described instead \u201ca battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies\u201d as his overarching challenge. \u201cOne of our challenges is that in the world environment the United States faces today, we have an aggressive, ascendant China and Russia. China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. They were pressing Hong Kong. There are human rights violations all over the world,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of Biden\u2019s closest allies in the Senate, said on Thursday. \u201cAnd keeping thousands of American troops in Afghanistan for another decade was a cost that President Biden looked at and concluded was too high a cost to pay.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration targeted Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions Thursday, punishing Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d in Crimea. The announcement is one of a series of dramatic foreign policy steps that President Joe Biden has taken this week, along with the decision to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan and send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan to express support for its democracy and security, in what may signal a turn toward a tougher, more pragmatic global posture for the US. Thursday\u2019s sanctions come a day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking for the US and its NATO allies, expressed deep concerns about Russia\u2019s military build-up along the border with Ukraine, and two days after the US intelligence community said in an annual report that Russia \u201cpresents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.\u201d Six key takeaways from Biden's Russia sanctions announcement Biden is expected to speak on the sanctions on Thursday afternoon Washington time. As part of Thursday\u2019s announcement, the US formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as the force behind the SolarWinds hack that affected the federal government and wide swaths of the private sector. The White House also said that it is expelling 10 Russian diplomats in Washington, including \u201crepresentatives of Russian intelligence services,\u201d for the cyber hack and the election meddling. US officials made clear that while the President would prefer not to, he was poised to take further action if needed. For its part, the Kremlin summoned the US ambassador to Russia to the foreign ministry for what it described as a \u201cdifficult\u201d conversation and said its response to the US measures will come shortly. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day\u201d that Biden was aiming to strike a balance and \u201cprovide a significant and credible response, but not escalate the situation.\u201d Biden, who spoke to President Vladimir Putin by phone on Tuesday to preview the sanctions, \u201cmade no bones about the fact we will be taking actions this week, but he also indicated that he wants to get to that stability in this relationship, and he believes that if President Putin is prepared to do that as well, we can find a course ahead that does not lead to a cycle of confrontation,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe believe that altogether, both the actions we are taking today and that broader diplomacy can produce a better set of outcomes for US-Russia relations,\u201d Sullivan said. Sullivan said that Biden and Putin \u201cwere direct with one another, they understood one another\u201d during the call, and that Biden proposed that he and the Russian leader hold a summit \u201cto discuss all of the issues facing our relationship.\u201d Biden believes the US and Russia can have a \u201cstable and predictable relationship\u201d and work together on issues such as arms control, Sullivan said. The administration rolled out the sanctions in an executive order in coordination with the State Department and the Treasury Department. State Department officials had called US allies to prepare them for the announcement, which covers a wide range of actions. US and other NATO members pledge support to Ukraine while walking fine line with Russia The Biden administration is barring US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia\u2019s central bank and other leading financial institutions. While US financial institutions weren\u2019t big buyers of Russian bonds, \u201cit\u2019s going to bite,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, a former Treasury official and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. By driving down bond prices, and pushing interest rates up, \u201cit will make it more expensive to keep the country running,\u201d he said. The US will also sanction six Russian tech companies that support the Russian intelligence services\u2019 cyber program, as well as 32 entities and individuals for carrying out \u201cRussian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential election,\u201d it said in a fact sheet. Another eight individuals and entities are being sanctioned for \u201cRussia\u2019s ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea.\u201d The administration also named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, known by its acronym SVR, and as APT 29, Cozy Bear and the Dukes, as the perpetrator of the hack of SolarWinds, which gave it the ability to spy on more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide, the White House said. On Thursday, the administration issued an advisory providing network defenders with specific steps they can take to identify and defend against \u201cthe SVR\u2019s malicious cyber activity.\u201d The 10 Russian diplomats who are being expelled are based in Washington, DC, and New York, and will have 30 days to leave the country, a US official familiar with the plans explained. Asked how the US chose the 10 diplomats who will be expelled, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday that those individuals \u201cwere acting with a manner inconsistent with their status in the US,\u201d and declined to provide further details. The White House said that it was not imposing punishment for reports that Russia encouraged Taliban attacks against US and coalition troops in Afghanistan because the US intelligence community has only \u201clow to moderate confidence\u201d that Russia offered bounties, the senior administration official said. The intelligence only reaches a \u201clow to moderate\u201d confidence level because the intelligence agencies relied on reporting from detainees and was collected in a \u201cdifficult operating environment\u201d in Afghanistan, the official said. Hufbauer said Thursday\u2019s steps add \u201cmore heft to the existing sanctions, but will it make any difference to the Russian government? Probably not much.\u201d He noted that \u201cthe previous sanctions did not persuade Russia to leave Crimea nor withdraw their forces from eastern Ukraine. The most we can hope for is that Russia will not go into new adventures into what the Russian government calls \u2018the near abroad.\u2019\u201d The senior administration official said further potential actions are built into the orders Biden approved, adding that the US would \u201cprefer\u201d not to use those options, but wanted to send the signal it is \u201cprepared going forward\u201d to respond if Russia takes provocative steps. Hunting the hunters: How Russian hackers targeted US cyber first responders in SolarWinds breach Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said US Ambassador John Sullivan had been summoned to the ministry following news of the sanctions and expulsions, and said the conversation would be a \u201cdifficult\u201d one. Sullivan declined to comment to journalists as he left the ministry Thursday, but Zakharova said Moscow will announce its response in the near future. \u201cOur response is inevitable, it will be worked out,\u201d Zakharova told reporters. \u201cYou will hear about it shortly, I think. Our experts are working on it right now.\u201d The US sanctions rollout has taken longer than anticipated because the White House was not satisfied with the options the State Department initially presented and wanted more expansive measures, a US official familiar with the plans said. During Biden\u2019s first week in office, the White House announced it would be undertaking an intelligence review of Russia\u2019s \u201creckless and adversarial actions\u201d in a wide variety of areas. It is unclear if Thursday\u2019s sanctions will be enough to change Russian behavior, the officials said. The Biden administration vowed early on to respond to Russia\u2019s aggressions against the US and its allies. During his first phone call with Putin in March, Biden confronted the Russian leader over a range of issues, from the recent massive cyberattack to the suspected poisoning of the country\u2019s leading opposition figure, Alexey Navalny. The Biden administration has already rolled out sanctions for Navalny\u2019s jailing and poisoning. Even as it hits back at Russia, the Biden administration has sought to keep open channels of diplomatic communication and to work with Russia when it is in the US\u2019 interest. The Biden administration recently decided to keep the Trump-appointed US ambassador on the job in Moscow for the foreseeable future, and the President has invited Putin to a climate change conference later this month as well as the summit to discuss US-Russia relations.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration slapped sweeping sanctions on Russia Thursday over Moscow\u2019s alleged interference in the 2020 election, the massive SolarWinds hack and the ongoing occupation of Crimea, signaling it is adopting a tougher posture toward the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions announcement also showed that the Biden administration is more willing to directly call out Russia\u2019s meddling in US affairs after Trump administration officials had to dance around former President Donald Trump\u2019s frequent unwillingness to criticize Moscow. Here are the key takeaways from Thursday\u2019s sanctions: The Trump administration was more than willing to issue sanctions against Russia, and did so on multiple occasions, including over the occupation of Crimea, the poisoning of an ex-spy in the United Kingdom, and even election interference. But those actions were taken while Trump himself repeatedly refused to condemn Russia\u2019s actions. He would not acknowledge Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016, bristling at the notion Russia helped his campaign, even as his top national security officials unanimously said they agreed with the intelligence community assessment that Moscow interfered. It went beyond the 2016 election, however. Last year, Trump declined to condemn Russia over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. He and his top officials downplayed Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2020 election, arguing China was a bigger threat \u2013 a claim contradicted by last month\u2019s intelligence community report on 2020 foreign election interference. President Joe Biden has been vocal in his criticisms of Putin, calling him a \u201ckiller\u201d last month and saying Moscow would \u201cpay a price\u201d for its election interference efforts. The sanctions issued Thursday back up that rhetoric. Biden informed Putin in a call this week he was imposing the sanctions, and he\u2019s seeking a \u201cstable and predictable\u201d relationship with Russia, a senior administration official said Thursday. The Russia sanctions are the Biden administration\u2019s most significant step yet in responding to the SolarWinds hacking campaign, which has compromised at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private organizations. Under Thursday\u2019s new executive order, the administration imposed sanctions on six Russian tech companies that it said have supported Russian intelligence. Russian agencies including the FSB, GRU and SVR have conducted \u201csome of the most dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks in recent history,\u201d the Treasury Department said in announcing the sanctions. US intelligence agencies on Thursday issued a technical advisory warning of the tactics used by Russian agents to compromise network security. The Biden administration also said it is exploring whether to invoke Trump\u2019s executive order on technology supply chains to introduce additional policies aimed at preventing Russian cyberattacks in the future. Russian hacking has long been a problem for the US government. The goal of Thursday\u2019s sanctions is to deter Moscow, though it remains to be seen whether they will actually have that effect. With one sentence in a 2,000-word press release, the Treasury Department perhaps did more to lay out the case for potential Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election than has happened before. The Treasury statement confirmed that Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-linked intelligence operative, provided Russian intelligence with \u201cwith sensitive information on polling and campaign strategy.\u201d He got that inside information from Trump campaign officials. While the sanctions issued Thursday were tied to Russia\u2019s 2020 election interference efforts \u2013 which the US says Kilimnik played a role in \u2013 the reference to his meddling in 2016 is perhaps the bigger revelation. It has long been suspected but never explicitly stated by the US government that Kilimnik passed internal Trump campaign data from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russian intelligence services. The announcement Thursday establishes a simple and direct channel of communication from the upper echelon of the Trump campaign to the Russian agencies that were meddling to help Trump win. During the early stages of the Russia probe, officials from both parties said this kind of covert relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russians would constitute \u201ccollusion.\u201d This revelation was a long time coming. It took years for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team to reveal that Manafort provided internal campaign information to Kilimnik. About a year later, the Senate Intelligence Committee openly called Kilimnik a Russian agent. But neither went so far as to say Kilimnik gave the information to the Russian government. Thursday\u2019s announcement closes the loop. Then-candidate Biden repeatedly criticized Trump for failing to take action after being presented intelligence that Russia had placed bounties on US troops in Afghanistan. On Thursday, a senior Biden administration official said the US intelligence community had only \u201clow to moderate confidence\u201d in the information about bounties, and said Biden was not taking action to punish Moscow on the issue. The fact that Biden declined to issue sanctions over the bounties shows is yet another example of why governing is always more complicated than campaigning, particularly when it comes to foreign policy. \u201cNot only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law, Donald Trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before Vladimir Putin,\u201d Biden said during a virtual town hall in June 2020. In a first telephone call with Putin in January, Biden raised the issue of bounties. But three months later, his administration is stopping short of punishing Moscow based on an intelligence assessment that relied on detainee information that was collected in a \u201cdifficult operating environment\u201d in Afghanistan. \u201cWe have conveyed through diplomatic and intelligence channels strong direct messages on this issue,\u201d a senior administration official said, saying that if a pattern of behavior continues \u2013 presumably with a greater degree of confidence \u2013 the US would respond. Congressional Republicans praised the Biden administration for taking action against Russia, but they were critical that the sanctions announced Thursday did not include any action to try to prevent the completion of a natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany known as Nord Stream 2. \u201cI commend the administration for these actions, but I consider them less than a half step forward. What is missing is a robust effort to actually stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,\u201d Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe lack of Nord Stream 2 sanctions today makes it even more obvious the administration, for unknown reasons, is foot-dragging on this issue.\u201d Republicans have argued that the Biden administration must impose sanctions on entities involved in the pipeline\u2019s construction under US law, but they have failed to do so. \u201cIf the Biden Administration is serious about imposing real costs on the Putin regime\u2019s efforts to undermine U.S. democratic institutions and weaken our allies and partners, then it must ensure the Russian malign influence Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is never completed,\u201d House Foreign Affairs ranking Republican Michael McCaul of Texas said in a statement Thursday. In an interview last month with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said he made clear to his German counterpart the US views the pipeline as a bad deal. \u201cIt gives Russia more of a weapon using energy as a tool of coercion,\u201d he said. Since taking office in January, Biden has focused on getting a massive Covid-19 relief package signed into law, and now is turning his attention to passing a major infrastructure package through Congress. But the sanctions are a reminder that foreign policy problems will always be looming and can snatch the focus of a presidency at a moment\u2019s notice. Blinken this week expressed concerns about Russia\u2019s military buildup along the border with Ukraine, in what\u2019s the largest massing of troops near Ukraine since 2014, when Russian forces invaded and occupied Crimea. Thursday\u2019s sanctions included punishing Russia for its ongoing occupation of Crimea, seven years later. The senior administration official said Biden intends to hold a summit with Putin in Europe over the coming months but noted the Kremlin had not responded the US invitation.

            "article_content": "House Republicans are doing their best to steer clear of embattled Rep. Matt Gaetz amid an FBI investigation into whether he broke sex trafficking laws and had sex with a 17-year-old girl. The Republican efforts to keep their distance from Gaetz also offer him a lifeline within the GOP conference, as he appears safe at the moment from facing retribution within the party unless formal charges are filed. House GOP leaders say they\u2019re waiting to see what comes of the Justice Department investigation before deciding on any action to take against Gaetz. And rank-and-file Republicans are trying to avoid answering questions or to change the subject when asked about their Florida colleague\u2019s possible legal troubles. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to speculate on rumors, but if something really formal happens from Justice we would of course react and take action,\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters Wednesday when asked if he had confidence in Gaetz. For Republicans, the allegations surrounding Gaetz amount to a major distraction as they try to push the Biden administration over the record number of unaccompanied minors at the border and the President\u2019s plans for a massive infrastructure package. As Gaetz has built up little goodwill with his colleagues, few are eager to rush to his defense even as he denies the allegations against him. CNN spoke with more than a dozen GOP lawmakers, who largely tried to avoid getting into the allegations, while noting that Gaetz has few friends in the conference willing to defend him. \u201cHe\u2019s not a team player,\u201d said one senior House GOP member, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about a colleague. \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who contributes to the caucus. Most of us don\u2019t really know him. If he did it and gets indicted, so what? A new Republican will replace him in that district and probably be a better member of Congress.\u201d In addition to the federal investigation into his conduct, the House Ethics Committee on Friday opened its own examination of whether Gaetz broke the law and House rules. Women detail drug use, sex and payments after late-night parties with Gaetz and others Gaetz returned to Washington on Tuesday as House gaveled back into session after a two-week recess. Leaving and entering the Capitol for votes, he would not address the allegations Tuesday, instead attacking CNN in response to its questions about the Justice Department investigation. Gaetz again declined to comment on Wednesday as he shuttled between committee hearings. Two GOP sources say Gaetz didn\u2019t attend the House Republican Conference\u2019s weekly meeting Wednesday morning \u2013 and there was no discussion of his conduct. It\u2019s the latest sign of House Republicans keeping their distance from Gaetz amid the swirling allegations. During the House\u2019s long vote series Wednesday, Gaetz was quietly chatting on the House floor with a handful of his GOP allies. After arriving at the vote as it started, Gaetz sat by himself for a bit until a fellow staunch defender of former President Donald Trump sat next to him: Jody Hice of Georgia. A few minutes later, Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett sat down next to him on the other side. Burchett had greeted Gaetz earlier with a fist bump. A handful of other conservatives came to greet him, including Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who had joined Trump and Gaetz in trying to overturn the election result. Perry also gave Gaetz a fist bump. Rep. Mike Kelly, another Pennsylvania Republican who had tried to throw out the electoral results, also greeted Gaetz. As the House paused to give a moment of silence to the late Rep. Alcee Hastings, Gaetz stood by the Florida delegation. Afterward, he returned to his seat, where California Rep. Doug LaMalfa was sitting next to him and chatting him up. Gaetz later moved down the down the row and engaged in a back-and-forth with Texas Rep. Pete Sessions. Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York was also seen talking to the two of them. Gaetz had what appeared to be an animated conversation with Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Judiciary Committee Republican and another Trump ally. When the investigation was first revealed two weeks ago, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said the allegations were serious and he planned to speak to Gaetz about the matter. The California Republican did not respond to questions from CNN on Tuesday evening about whether he\u2019d spoken to Gaetz, and it\u2019s unclear if that conversation has happened yet. Scalise told reporters Wednesday he had not yet spoken to Gaetz but also planned to do so. \u201cLook, I haven\u2019t talked to him to get his explanation of what\u2019s alleged, serious things alleged, obviously we want to get the facts,\u201d he said. If Gaetz is indicted, he would be removed from his committees, which is what occurred when former GOP Reps. Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California were indicted on insider training and campaign finance charges, respectively. Collins and Hunter each won reelection while under indictment before they resigned after pleading guilty to the charges against them. Both were pardoned by Trump. Embattled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is denied a meeting with Trump So far, only one Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, has called for Gaetz\u2019s resignation. Even prominent Republicans Gaetz has attacked, like House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming, have stopped short of calling for his removal from Congress. But most Republicans would rather just avoid the subject. \u201cIsn\u2019t he from Florida? I\u2019m from Colorado,\u201d GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert said in response to questions about Gaetz. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say on it, honestly,\u201d Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, one of the 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach Trump in January, told CNN. \u201cif it\u2019s true, the least of his concerns will be Congress,\u201d Gonzalez added, saying the Justice Department investigation should play out. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, said of the investigation, \u201cIf the allegations are proved to be true, through a court of law or however it\u2019s done, then I do, I do think that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d \u201cWe do have to go through the investigation. Everybody always deserves their day in court, right?\u201d Van Drew added. Gaetz showed nude photos of women he said he'd slept with to lawmakers, sources tell CNN Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, has been one of the few Republicans who have publicly defended Gaetz. He told CNN on Tuesday that he still stands by the Florida congressman. \u201cYep,\u201d Jordan said when asked if he still believes Gaetz. \u201cI\u2019ve never called for people to resign; I\u2019ve never called for people to be kicked off committees.\u201d Gaetz\u2019s home state senators, Republicans Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, have also avoided commenting on the allegations, saying they will wait to see what comes of the Justice Department investigation. \u201cI\u2019ve read about it, but I\u2019ve read what people report, I\u2019ve read what he\u2019s denied. How can anybody opine on something I don\u2019t know anything about firsthand?\u201d Rubio said. Two Republicans who face potentially tough reelection races, Reps. David Valadao of California and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, have taken steps to distance themselves from Gaetz, returning or donating his campaign contributions to them. \u201cI\u2019ve given the money back,\u201d Fitzpatrick told CNN when asked if Gaetz should resign. \u201cI\u2019m a career FBI agent. Let the process play out.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The federal government can take \u201cimmediate possession\u201d of a Texas family\u2019s land along the US-Mexico border after a years-long court battle, a federal judge has ruled \u2013 a move at odds with President Joe Biden\u2019s pledge to halt wall construction. Tuesday\u2019s ruling from Judge Micaela Alvarez of the Texas Southern District Court was a blow to the Cavazos family, who for years have been fighting to keep the land that\u2019s been passed down for generations. \u201cWe\u2019re hardworking Hispanic landowners. To my family, you can offer whatever, it\u2019s more important for them to save their land,\u201d Baudilia \u201cLilly\u201d Cavazos Rodriguez, one of three siblings, two of whom live on the property in Hidalgo County, told CNN. The acquisition process started at least by April 2018. Her sons held hands, cried and crossed the border alone Generally, the government is allowed to acquire privately owned land for public use, otherwise known as eminent domain. Border barriers built under previous administrations have largely gone up in areas where land was federally owned, but extending the wall, as former President Donald Trump pledged to, required taking privately owned land. Under the Trump administration, officials moved at a faster rate to obtain land. The federal government, which filed the motion for possession in 2020, sought \u201cto construct, install, operate, and maintain roads, fencing, vehicle barriers, security lighting, cameras, sensors, and related structures designed to help secure the United States/Mexico border within the State of Texas,\u201d according to the order. With Biden\u2019s election, Cavazos Rodriguez thought the case would be dropped. In one of his first actions as President, Biden ordered a pause on wall construction and called for a review of projects and funds. \u201cLike every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security,\u201d the proclamation reads. The Justice Department appeared surprised by the ruling and timing. In February, the Justice Department asked the Texas Southern District Court for a continuance in the Cavazos case, citing Biden\u2019s proclamation. Judge Alvarez extended the case into April. \u201cDOJ sought continuances in pending cases, including in this case, in which the government had previously filed motions for possession of land on the southwest border,\u201d a Justice Department official said in a statement to CNN. \u201cImmediately before yesterday\u2019s court hearing, which had been reset from February 16 to April 13 due to the proclamation, the judge granted the Department\u2019s motion for possession that was originally filed in 2020.\u201d Customs and Border Protection, in coordination with the US Army Corps of Engineers, suspended wall construction projects \u201cexcept for activities that are safety related,\u201d according to the agency.   Cavazos Rodriguez, who voted for Biden, said she feels betrayed with the latest ruling to seize her family\u2019s land. The roughly 70 acres belonging to the Cavazos family hold sentimental value and provide for the family\u2019s livelihood. The family rents out some of the property, serving as a source of income for her siblings. \u201c[Biden] did say, not one more foot. And then with this going on, with them taking possession, they can do whatever they want now,\u201d Cavazos Rodriguez said. Eminent domain cases can be lengthy \u2013 ranging from months to years \u2013 though they generally don\u2019t keep the agency from being able to proceed with construction. Landowners are often fighting for what is known as just compensation \u2013 what they deem a fair price for their property. \u201cThe fight against the wall in Texas is NOT OVER. 140 lawsuits are still active; the Cavazos are just one. Now this family is at the mercy of a government that is continuing the Trump-Biden border wall,\u201d the Texas Civil Rights Project, which is representing the family, said in a tweet Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "The world already seems more dangerous and complex than when Joe Biden took office less than three months ago. That\u2019s partly because America\u2019s adversaries are putting the new commander in chief to the test. The United States is being drawn into great power confrontations with China and Russia. Iran plans to enrich uranium to higher levels than ever before after an attack on one of its nuclear plants widely attributed to Israel. North Korea is back to testing ballistic missiles. And Biden\u2019s plan to end the \u201cforever war\u201d in Afghanistan by this year\u2019s 20th anniversary of 9/11 has critics warning the Taliban could crush the weak US-allied government in Kabul. The limits on a President\u2019s power meanwhile have been underscored by a violent coup in Myanmar that US sanctions and condemnation have done nothing to thwart. The building crises will dominate two days of congressional hearings beginning Wednesday involving chiefs of intelligence agencies that balked at public testimony last year to avoid humiliating ex-President Donald Trump by contradicting his conspiratorial worldview. In an Annual Threat Assessment ahead of the hearings, the espionage community added another helping of challenges to Biden\u2019s plate \u2013 predicting destabilizing cross-border migratory surges and toppled governments in the geopolitical aftershocks of the pandemic. And it said Beijing and Moscow were exploiting the discord to bolster their power. It is a daunting set of worsening problems for a President who has made no secret that his priority is defeating the virus, reviving the US economy and forging a foreign policy designed around the needs of the American worker. Recent events show that Biden will not have the luxury of a mostly domestic focus. Speeches and diplomatic blueprints from new administrations are great in theory. But US foes rarely comply with the neat assessments by Washington foreign policy planners of how they will behave. It\u2019s not unusual for there to be a sense that America\u2019s adversaries are probing a new president. Moscow\u2019s massive troop build-up on Ukraine\u2019s borders and China\u2019s probing of Taiwan\u2019s defenses may fit into this category \u2013 and isolated North Korea always seeks to get a new commander in chief\u2019s attention. Biden\u2019s hopes of reviving a nuclear deal with Iran may already be on the rocks if Tehran hardliners scupper dialogue. If an Israeli attack is to blame, the President may also have an early crisis with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sort out. This goes beyond America\u2019s adversaries hazing a new President. Biden\u2019s management of the situation will help define his legacy. China is accelerating a years-long rise and is now willing to assert its growing military might in Asia and its superpower influence elsewhere in the world. Russia, with its territorial grabs and election interference, is stepping up efforts to divide and weaken the West. Seeking to prolong his two decades in power amid simmering domestic discontent, President Vladimir Putin has a political motive to act aggressively abroad to match his quest to restore the respect the Kremlin lost with the fall of the Soviet Union. The Biden administration has made clear it understands adversaries are feeling out the new White House. An extraordinary head-to-head clash between US and Chinese officials in Alaska last month sent a clear message from Washington to Beijing that Biden wouldn\u2019t be pushed around. Since then, US and Chinese aircraft carrier task forces have steamed through the South China Sea. In addition, China sent a record 25 warplanes into Taiwan\u2019s self-declared air defense zone \u2013 in a clear message to Washington to avoid what it sees as interference in its affairs. Taiwan is seen as the most likely trigger of a conflict between the US and China and presidents are bound by law to offer the island the means of self-defense. After Washington sent the USS John McCain through the Taiwan Strait last week, Beijing said it should not \u201cplay with fire.\u201d The Biden administration has been more outspoken than its European allies on Russia\u2019s pressure on Ukraine that has prompted fears of a full scale invasion on Putin\u2019s orders, or a more subtle attempt to destabilize the pro-Western government in Kiev. A senior US defense official told CNN last week that the Pentagon was considering sending a pair of ships to the Black Sea in order to show support for Ukraine\u2019s territory integrity, in a move that would further hike tensions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 who traded diplomatic jabs with Chinese officials in Alaska \u2013 is not flinching from warnings to Russia and China likely to further exacerbate tensions. \u201cIt would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force.\u201d Blinken said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday referring to China\u2019s aggressive tactics toward Taiwan, which it considers a rebel province. In Europe on Tuesday for NATO meetings at which the US announced an increased military presence in Germany, Blinken met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleb. He had set the stage by saying on NBC that if Russia continued to escalate \u201cthe President\u2019s been clear, there\u2019ll be costs, there\u2019ll be consequences.\u201d The tough talk may be designed to counter a belief that shines through foreign policy pronouncements in both Russia and China that the US is a power in inevitable decline and has been weakened by two decades of war, financial crises, internal political strife and a poor pandemic response. It also must be seen in the context of the former President\u2019s approach to foreign policy. Trump frequently fawned over Putin and often undermined what was a comparatively tough administration approach to Russia by often seeming to act in the interests of a power that meddled in two US elections to help him. The former President was also susceptible to flattery from China\u2019s aggressive, nationalist President Xi Jinping, who he portrayed as a dear friend \u2013 at least until the eruption of the pandemic in Wuhan threatened his reelection hopes. But rhetoric only goes so far. Ultimately, China knows that it\u2019s unlikely a US president could justify a war with the Asian giant over Taiwan as a vital national interest \u2013 especially one who is more interested in getting out of wars than starting new ones. And while the US has supplied Ukraine with offensive weapons, it\u2019s inconceivable that Biden would take the US to the brink of war with nuclear-armed Russia over Ukraine, which is not even a NATO ally. The White House position on both Russia and China is that it will seek cooperation with both states where possible but that adversarial relationships are more likely along with intense economic competition with China. For instance, CNN has reported that Biden\u2019s global climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, will shortly travel to Beijing to seek common ground ahead of a UN climate summit in Scotland in November. And in an intriguing move, Biden on Tuesday called Putin and offered him a summit in a third country in the coming months \u2013 only weeks after agreeing in a television interview that the Russian leader was a \u201ckiller.\u201d Biden\u2019s offer ostensibly gives Putin what he wants \u2013 a place on a pedestal alongside the President of the United States in an echo of fabled Cold War summits among the world\u2019s two great powers. The move looks a lot like a carrot to pressure the Russian leader to avoid any actions in Ukraine \u2013 or towards imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny \u2013 that might cause Biden to withdraw an offer to meet. Biden\u2019s decision on Afghanistan seems like a foreign policy move driven by domestic considerations. Hawkish Republicans are accusing him of a dangerous retreat that could repeat Washington\u2019s 1980s neglect after it helped rebels oust Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The subsequent vacuum caused years of civil war and a failed state that fostered the fundamentalist Taliban militia and a terror haven in which al Qaeda plotted the attacks on New York and Washington. \u201cPrecipitously withdrawing US forces from Afghanistan is a grave mistake. It is retreat in the face of an enemy that has not yet been vanquished and abdication of American leadership,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said. But the Kentucky Republican\u2019s comments are not universally shared within his party, proof that fatigue with foreign wars harnessed by both Barack Obama and Trump on the way to the White House remains a powerful political force. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for example, an avowed opponent on everything that Biden does and a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate, had no problems with Biden advertising a departure date for US soldiers. \u201cBringing our troops home should not be taken as a sign that America will be any less vigilant in protecting American lives and those of our allies, but we can do so without a permanent military presence in a hostile terrain,\u201d he said. If Biden sticks to his plan, he will achieve what Obama and Trump both tried and failed to do \u2013 ending US involvement in a generation of post-September 11 wars abroad.",

            "article_content": "The fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic is poised to fracture societies worldwide, increase instability across the globe and reshape political and economic realities for years to come, the US intelligence community warned in a stark report laying out the top security concerns facing the country. \u201cThe economic fallout from the pandemic is likely to create or worsen instability in at least a few\u2014and perhaps many\u2014countries, as people grow more desperate in the face of interlocking pressures that include sustained economic downturns, job losses, and disrupted supply chains,\u201d the report warns. That dire economic picture boosts the risk of internal conflicts, surges in cross-border migration and even the collapse of national governments, officials warned. White House says pause on Johnson & Johnson vaccine 'will not have a significant impact on our vaccination plan' The report, known as the Annual Threat Assessment, is typically made public annually. But bitter wrangling between the Trump administration and Congress kept the 2020 report locked away, making Tuesday\u2019s release among the first public glimpses into the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also offers grim warnings about Russian and Chinese covert influence operations, and an early insight into Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions since President Joe Biden took office as he attempts to renegotiate an updated version of the 2015 nuclear deal that former President Donald Trump exited in 2018. The picture is not pretty. Officials warn that in addition to the obvious humanitarian concerns associated with the pandemic \u2014 like food shortages and uneven access to therapeutics \u2014 the virus is also reshaping the security calculus of nations like Russia and China, who are jockeying to exploit the crisis to increase their geopolitical influence. Both seek to gain an advantage through vaccine diplomacy. Beijing is also using its global health assistance efforts to export its surveillance tools and technologies, the report says. The report also cautions that the world cannot yet breathe a sigh of relief despite rapid progress on vaccine development. The virus will remain a threat \u201cto populations worldwide until vaccines and therapeutics are widely distributed,\u201d the report warns. And a resurgence in infections early this year \u201cmay have an even greater economic impact as struggling businesses in hard-hit sectors such as tourism and restaurants fold and governments face increasing budget strains.\u201d In a quiet echo of recent history, the 2019 Threat Assessment presciently warned of a pandemic, assessing that \u201cthe United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or largescale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.\u201d The report also issues an unequivocal warning on Russian activity, saying that Moscow \u201cpresents one of the most serious intelligence threats to the United States.\u201d It confirmes influence operations targeting the 2020 election, noting that Moscow \u201calmost certainly views US elections as an opportunity to try to undermine US global standing, sow discord inside the United States, influence US decision-making, and sway US voters.\u201d That this conclusion appeared in an annual threat assessment without fanfare demonstrates an immediate departure from the battle over public intelligence assessments under the Trump administration, when officials faced inevitable blowback from Trump whenever they made information about Russian election interference public. China, intelligence leaders warn, also \u201cpresents a growing influence threat\u201d in the United States \u2014 an assertion that may give some political cover to former Trump administration appointees who sought to portray China as the bigger counterintelligence threat during the 2020 election. Declassified documents later showed that China \u201cconsidered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election.\u201d But \u201cBeijing has been intensifying efforts to shape the political environment in the United States to promote its policy preferences, mold public discourse, pressure political figures whom Beijing believes oppose its interests, and muffle criticism of China on such issues as religious freedom and the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong,\u201d the report says. The report states that the intelligence community believes Iran is not currently taking steps it believes are necessary to build a nuclear weapon but has resumed some activities that violate the terms of the 2015 agreement signed by both countries. \u201cWe continue to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device. However, following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA agreement in May 2018, Iranian officials have abandoned some of Iran\u2019s commitments and resumed some nuclear activities that exceed the JCPOA limits,\u201d the report says. Mysterious blackout in Iran threatens to undermine nuclear talks The intelligence community report also offered a clear warning to Biden as he faces pressure not to reduce sanctions on Iran in service of a broader deal: \u201cRegime leaders probably will be reluctant to engage diplomatically in talks with the United States in the near term without sanctions or humanitarian relief or the United States rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\u201d \u201cIran remains committed to countering US pressure, although Tehran is also wary of becoming involved in a full-blown conflict,\u201d the report adds. In 2018, then-US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal, unleashing waves of crippling sanctions on Iran. A year later, Tehran began to gradually withdraw from its commitments to the nuclear deal, resuming parts of its uranium enrichment program. But Biden has vowed to return to the JCPOA. For months, Tehran and Washington have been at loggerheads about who should return to the landmark deal first \u2013 Iran says it won\u2019t curb enrichment before the US lifts all sanctions, and the US has accused Iran of intransigence. The US intelligence community is warning domestic extremists that are not connected to or inspired by foreign terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and ISIS \u201cpose an elevated threat\u201d to the US, according to the report. Domestic extremists are motivated by a range of ideologies which \u201creflects an increasingly complex threat landscape, including racially or ethnically motivated threats and antigovernment or antiauthority threats,\u201d the report says. \u201cOf these, violent extremists who espouse an often overlapping mix of white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and exclusionary cultural-nationalist beliefs have the most persistent transnational connections via often loose online communities to like-minded individuals and groups in the West. The threat from this diffuse movement has ebbed and flowed for decades but has increased since 2015,\u201d it adds. White supremacists have been responsible \u201cfor at least 26 lethal attacks that killed more than 141 people and for dozens of disrupted plots in the West since 2015,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhile these extremists often see themselves as part of a broader global movement, most attacks have been carried out by individuals or small, independent cells,\u201d it adds. \u201cAustralia, Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom consider white racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, including Neo-Nazi groups, to be the fastest growing terrorist threat they face.\u201d Last month, CNN reported that the summary of a new joint US intelligence assessment said \u201cnarratives of fraud in the recent general election\u201d and \u201cthe emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol\u201d will \u201calmost certainly\u201d spur domestic extremists to try to engage in additional acts of violence this year That summary was released on the same day that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers domestic violent extremism is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the US \u2013 a clear reminder that federal officials remain very concerned about the potential for more violence in the coming months. \u201cNewer sociopolitical developments \u2013 such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conspiracy theories promoting violence \u2013 will almost certainly spur some (domestic violent extremists) to try to engage in violence this year,\u201d the unclassified summary says.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. I have not spent much time in this newsletter on the antics of Marjorie Taylor Greene or the scandal surrounding Matt Gaetz, two of the more controversial pushers of conspiracy theories currently serving in Congress. This is supposed to be about \u201cWhat Matters,\u201d and after the Trump years we all spent struggling over whether the importance of exposing dark lies to the sunlight is neutralized by the oxygen they get in exposure, it has been refreshing to pay more attention to other things. But ignoring things doesn\u2019t make them go away, and I wanted today to share a Reality Check by CNN\u2019s John Avlon that aired on \u201cNew Day.\u201d You can watch it here. Or read it below: The sickness in our politics is the result of a screwed-up incentive structure that rewards irresponsibility and conspiracy theories with fame and cash. That\u2019s just not my opinion, that\u2019s the view of former GOP Speaker John Boehner. Here\u2019s what he has to say (in his new book) about what he calls \u201cthe chaos caucus\u201d: \u201cThey didn\u2019t really want legislative victories. They wanted wedge issues and conspiracies and crusades \u2026 [They] built up their own power base thanks to fawning right-wing media and outrage-driven fundraising cash.\u201d And as if on cue, we learned that QAnon conspiracy-peddling, mass shooting-denying Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she raised $3.2 million in the first quarter of the year, despite being stripped of her committee assignments. That\u2019s a lot of lucre for someone who is into grandstanding rather than governing. Her reported 100,000 donors represent just 0.03% of Americans, but it shows that crazy has a constituency. And she\u2019s a symptom of the trend toward politician as professional troll. Take Matt Gaetz, the Trump loyalist Florida congressman being investigated for a whole host of shady and possibly illegal weaselry, including serious sex-trafficking allegations. He denies it, but we all know the playbook by now, right? Folks fall for it. Gaetz raised more than $6 million last cycle, more than twice the typical representative. Or how about one of Gaetz\u2019s very few defenders in Congress, Jim Jordan, who Boehner calls a \u201cpolitical terrorist.\u201d He raised more than $18 million last cycle. (I\u2019ll add another example to Avlon\u2019s: Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican who tried to block election results and fist-pumped at Trump supporters standing outside the Capitol on January 6, raised more than $3 million in the first three months of the year.) This is the rinse and repeat that\u2019s come to dominate Republican politics. This is where Donald Trump\u2019s big lie and his thousands of smaller ones have gotten us: defining deviancy down while elevating political grift, offering not just alternative facts but an alternative reality reinforced by right-wing media obsessed with negative partisanship. So some good people don\u2019t want to serve anymore, because the system seems to reward the worst in us. It\u2019s one reason why so many Republicans have refused to run for reelection in the Trump years through today. Listen to what a longtime adviser to Sen. Rob Portman, a guy named Corry Bliss, told the National Journal: \u201cIf you want to spend all your time going on Fox and being an a-hole, there\u2019s never been a better time to serve. \u2026 But if you want to spend all your time being thoughtful and getting [stuff] done, there\u2019s never been a worse time to serve.\u201d That\u2019s a cry for help that cuts to the heart of our democracy. Because we\u2019re living in a time when autocracies are trying to overtake democracy as the world\u2019s leading form of government. And every unhinged, obstructionist conspiracy theorist who gets elected is an exhibit in their case. Republicans will try to deflect away from this political gangrene with all kinds of whataboutism. But unless they clearly condemn it, they will own the rot that is consuming their party and our republic. I\u2019ll add some of my own thoughts to Avlon\u2019s here. I share his frustration at the growth in profile of what should be fringe lawmakers, but I think there\u2019s also a counterpoint working right now that we should consider. While it is clear from these fundraising totals that there is a reward structure for creating and then pushing a perception of persecution by these out-there politicians, and that campaign coin gives them power to organize and push their ideas even more, it\u2019s also true that the increased national profile from causing chaos comes at a cost. Yes, Greene has raised money. But she\u2019s also been stripped of committee assignments, so her ability to actually generate laws is quite limited. President Joe Biden could be the antipode to the Trump/Greene type of outrage politics. His first few months have seen some real legislative success in his ability to get a massive Covid relief bill passed. He\u2019s set and met goals for vaccines and moving kids toward getting back into school. The country may have already been on pace to achieve those goals, but the lesson from these early months is that Biden hopes to find success simply by being much quieter than Trump, tamping down on drama rather than creating it and getting out of the way of the machine of government he believes can work. (And I understand that he faces a growing border crisis and tough decisions on other subjects in the near future). Biden has more reason to be frustrated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnnell, who is forming a GOP blockage against Biden\u2019s agenda, than Trump, who blames McConnell for not buying in to his imagined election fraud. And yet it\u2019s Trump who was bad-mouthing McConnell from Florida over the weekend, at an event for donors, naturally. Biden\u2019s got a real headache in Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, who won\u2019t agree to change Senate rules and do an end-run around Republican obstruction. But rather than trying to browbeat Manchin into submission, Biden appears, according to The New York Times, to be making a go of crafting infrastructure legislation that 10 Republicans could support. Then, if they follow McConnell\u2019s orders and reject it anyway, Manchin may have new reason to join Democrats in moving forward in a less partisan way. This will be the test of Biden\u2019s administration that could change the reward structure Avlon writes about: He must prove that either the bipartisanship he promised in his inaugural address is possible or convince voters that Republicans are so focused on defeating him that legislating is impossible.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration recently decided to keep the Trump-appointed US ambassador on the job in Moscow for the foreseeable future, two senior administration officials told CNN, demonstrating a willingness to nurture areas of stability in the US-Russia relationship after it got off to a tumultuous start. John Sullivan has been on the job for almost a year and a half. He is viewed by administration officials as a steady hand as the administration ramps up the pressure on Russia for taking actions to undermine the US and democratic values broadly. President Joe Biden is still deciding on other ambassadorial posts, and the White House said Monday the President had not decided on the \u201cvast majority\u201d of positions. The Biden administration has already made it clear that they will break from President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to Russia. Trump largely sought to flatter Russian President Vladimir Putin and famously said he believed Putin that Russia did not seek to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election, despite a finding from US intelligence agencies that it did. Ukraine's President heads to the trenches as Russia masses its troops The White House signaled that it would approach Russia on a case-by-case basis early in the administration when they extended a key arms control treaty with Russia, New START, and also ordered an intelligence review of Russian misdeeds. Keeping an ambassador in Moscow who already knows the players, as well as inviting Putin to the climate change conference later this month, signals that the administration remains open to diplomacy and working with Russia where is it possible. Biden invited dozens of leaders to the summit, though the Kremlin said when the list was announced it would need some time to confirm Putin\u2019s participation. The Biden administration \u201cdecided the professionalism that John Sullivan has brought to the job is valued at a time of important political transition in the US and US-Russia reactions, in both standing up to Russia\u2019s bellicose efforts near Ukraine as well as exploring possible engagement on climate, security and other issues,\u201d said John Tefft, the former US ambassador to Russia. \u201cThese transitions can often take a long time which works to our detriment in terms of having a consistent foreign policy.\u201d These moves come as Biden is currently weighing a package of sanctions and other moves in response to a US intelligence review of Russia\u2019s malign actions, including election interference and the Solarwinds breach. US considering sending warships to Black Sea amid Russia-Ukraine tensions Senior administration officials have met over the last week to discuss the potential response, which the White House has also said would include an \u201cunseen\u201d component. Complicating the deliberations, however, has been Russia\u2019s massing of troops along Ukraine\u2019s eastern border, ratcheting up tensions with the US. Officials now are weighing how the potential new sanctions and other punishments might provoke further escalation. Last month US-Russia relations grew more tense when Biden said he believed Putin is a \u201ckiller.\u201d After that the Kremlin pulled their ambassador from Washington and brought him back to Moscow for discussions on the US-Russia relationship. It is unclear when he will return to Washington. And as the Biden team works on crafting and rolling out their Russia policy they are doing so without key players in place. Though Victoria Nuland, Biden\u2019s under secretary for political affairs nominee who has extensive experience working on Russia, is expected to have her confirmation hearing this week, congressional aides told CNN.",

            "article_content": "In a fiery defense of his reputation Friday night, embattled Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz showed how former President Donald Trump\u2019s brash, defiant politics now serve as the template for survival for the most unwelcome figures in a Republican Party that\u2019s out of power in Washington and desperately trying to reposition for 2022. He followed in the footsteps of the former President, blaming \u201ccancel culture\u201d for his troubles, fashioning himself as a crusader for the principles that Trump espoused and vowing that he was \u201cbuilt for the battle\u201d while addressing the \u201cSave America Summit\u201d held by Women for America First at Trump National Doral in Miami. Gaetz is facing a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations and on Friday, the House Ethics Committee said it was opening an investigation into allegations surrounding him. His Friday evening performance \u2013 his first public appearance since news of the federal investigation broke last week \u2013 was yet another distraction for the Republican Party as top GOP leaders and donors descend on nearby Palm Beach this weekend for their spring meeting, which is a chance to regroup and reshape their message after losing control of the White House and US Senate and are still relegated to the minority in the US House. 'He really jumped on the Trump train': How a brash Matt Gaetz climbed the ranks in Trump's Washington The Florida congressman has strongly denied all allegations, and no charges have been brought against him. But few GOP members of Congress have rushed to defend him. At the same time, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a longtime critic of Trump, is the only congressional Republican who has called on Gaetz to resign. Despite Gaetz\u2019s loyalty to Trump, the former President has largely stayed away from the controversy in public, only weighing in after The New York Times, CNN and others reported this week that Gaetz sought a preemptive pardon. A Gaetz spokesperson denied to the Times the pardon request was related to the Justice Department investigation. After the news broke, Trump issued a brief statement. \u201cCongressman Matt Gaetz has never asked me for a pardon,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt must also be remembered that he has totally denied the accusations against him.\u201d At a time when the GOP is trying to regain its footing to fight President Joe Biden\u2019s increasingly liberal agenda and deal with the corporate blowback to legislation like the restrictive new voting law passed by the Republican-controlled legislature in Georgia, Gaetz has distracted from that work by taking a page from Trump\u2019s playbook, often characterized by the refusal to apologize and an eagerness to blame others even when that logic makes no sense. Gaetz framed his problems Friday as a product of his willingness to stand up to leaders of both parties and to \u201cthe swamp\u201d in Washington, DC. \u201cLet me assure you, I have not yet begun to fight,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cI\u2019m built for the battle, and I\u2019m not going anywhere. The smears against me range from distortions of my personal life, to wild \u2013 and I mean wild \u2013 conspiracy theories.\u201d Why the next 7 days will be critical for Matt Gaetz Positioning himself as a champion for Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, he added that he wouldn\u2019t be intimidated by \u201clying media\u201d and again said he was a victim of extortion \u2013 a claim he trotted out on Fox News last week after the investigation became public. Standing in front of the Trump club, he used many of the same phrases that the former President adopted when both his personal and professional conduct has been under scrutiny. \u201cI may be a canceled man in some corners. I may even be a wanted man by the deep state,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cBut I hear the millions of Americans who feel forgotten, canceled, ignored, marginalized and targeted. I draw confidence knowing the silent majority is growing louder by the day in this great country.\u201d Gaetz is just one member of the GOP \u2013 but his jaw-dropping speech was yet another example of how the Republican Party is still in the thrall of Trump, unable to move beyond his tactics and obsessions as they strategize about how to win in 2022. As they meet this weekend to craft the message for 2022 and 2024, it is striking how much the party is still fighting the last battle \u2013 defined by its embrace of Trump\u2019s false conspiracy theories about voting and the 2020 election, which have morphed into the hundreds of bills in state legislatures that would make voting harder. Those efforts are sure to come up Saturday night when Trump will serve as the marquee speaker at a Mar-a-Lago event as part of the Republican National Committee\u2019s spring meeting. After Trump\u2019s tumultuous tenure in the White House and his role in inciting the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, there are clear warning signs that the GOP message is failing to resonate or even break through as the party shapes its agenda headed into the midterm elections. President Joe Biden has maintained strong approval ratings and his Covid relief package proved popular with voters despite solid opposition from congressional Republicans. In polling in the first quarter of 2021, Gallup also found that an average of 49% of US adults now identify with the Democratic Party or said they were independents who lean toward that party, compared with 40% who said they were Republican or Republican leaners. That was the largest gap since the end of 2012; Democrats\u2019 advantage has typically been between 4 to 6 percentage points. While Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, criticized Trump\u2019s conduct in the run up to the insurrection, there is little indication the party is showing less tolerance for the conspiracy-filled politics that have served as the model for visible GOP figures like Gaetz and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The House Ethics Committee\u2019s announcement that it was looking into potential misconduct by Gaetz added another layer of jeopardy to his situation. \u201cThe Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, in violation of House Rules, laws, or other standards of conduct,\u201d Ethics Chairman Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, and ranking Republican member Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican, said in a joint statement Friday. In response, Gaetz\u2019s office told CNN that the \u201callegations are blatantly false and have not been validated by a single human being willing to put their name behind them.\u201d CNN has previously reported that federal investigators have been examining allegations that Gaetz had sex with an underage girl who was 17 at the time and with other women who were provided drugs and money in violation of sex trafficking and prostitution laws. Investigators are also trying to determine whether Gaetz was provided travel and women in exchange for political favors as part of a broader probe, people familiar with the investigation tell CNN. The House Ethics Committee alluded to a CNN report last week that Gaetz allegedly showed off to other lawmakers photos and videos of nude women he said he had slept with, including while on the House floor. Multiple sources, including two people directly shown the material, said Gaetz displayed the images of women on his phone and talked about having sex with them. But in classic Trumpian fashion, Gaetz distracted from those allegations Friday evening, devoting much of his speech to his efforts to spot the potential of women on his staff as he said he elevated them to more prominent roles. On Saturday, Gaetz\u2019s office released a lengthy statement attacking Georgia Democrats over the corporate backlash to the new law, which misspelled their names, and hitting Biden for his handling of the border crisis. It didn\u2019t mention the allegations against the congressman. It was, yet again, a master class in deflection, one likely to impress the former President, who still holds sway over a party trying to chart its course without him in the White House. This story has been updated with a statement from Gaetz\u2019s office.",

            "article_content": "Top US national security officials have spoken with their Ukrainian counterparts, and America\u2019s top general held a call Wednesday with his Russian opposite number amid concern over Russian military activity in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including what the US deemed a violation of a ceasefire by Moscow that led to the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers last week. \u201cRussia\u2019s destabilizing actions undermine the de-escalation intentions that had been achieved through [last year\u2019s agreement],\u201d chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. \u201cAdditionally, we are aware of Ukrainian military reports concerning Russian troop movements on Ukraine\u2019s borders.\u201d Secretary of State Tony Blinken reaffirmed the \u201cunwavering support\u201d of the United States for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity in the face of \u201cRussia\u2019s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea,\u201d according to a readout of his call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba Wednesday. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley also spoke to the top Ukrainian general Wednesday, while national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart at the beginning of the week. NATO scrambles jets 10 times to track Russian military planes across Europe The Pentagon had grown increasingly concerned after military intelligence reports assessed that some 4,000 heavily armed Russian forces had been observed moving in Crimea, according to a US defense official. \u201cIt was not totally clear what they were up to,\u201d the official said, adding that the US now believes on further assessment it may have been part of a Russian military exercise. Part of that assessment was based on calls with Ukrainian officials who also viewed the Russian activity as an exercise. If so, the movement of so many Russian military personnel was a large exercise and may be a deliberate message from the Kremlin to the Biden administration about Russia\u2019s strength in the region and its ability to challenge US allies, the official said. This comes as NATO countries on Monday scrambled jets 10 times to track an unusually high level of Russian military flights over a large area of Europe including the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. NATO jets wound up conducting six intercepts in a six-hour period. The Biden administration is taking a tougher approach to Russia, and Ukraine is only the latest source of tension between the two adversaries. The White House unveiled a raft of sanctions against Russian officials and entities at the beginning of the month over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. President Joe Biden then warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would \u201cpay a price\u201d for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US elections and went on to call Putin a \u201ckiller.\u201d Meanwhile, the administration is expected to impose more sanctions on Russia over election interference and the SolarWinds cyberattack. Classified US military war game set to take place as concerns about threats posed by China and Russia increase On Wednesday, Milley spoke with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. While the topics the two generals discussed have not been made public, behind the scenes the Defense Department has been concerned for the last several days about the build-up of Russian troops and equipment along the Ukraine border. The Defense Department recently raised the so-called \u201cwatch condition level\u201d on that region to gather updated intelligence assessments on Russian activity and intentions, while monitoring any potential threats. The New York Times was first to report that development. Russia blamed Ukraine for renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that Russia was concerned about \u201cUkraine\u2019s provocations,\u201d but he said he hoped it would not escalate to fighting. But Ukraine warned of a series of Russian violations of the ceasefire, including two incidents of mortar fire and large-caliber machine gun fire that led to the death of the four Ukrainian soldiers last Friday. On Tuesday, Ukraine accused Russia of violating the ceasefire seven times, prompting the country\u2019s parliament to call for an increase in political and economic pressure on Moscow.",

Then, as an afterthought, he offered this: \u201cI just wanted to say, it\u2019s an honor to be here, it\u2019s an honor to have you at Mar-a-Lago, you are a great and beautiful couple.\u201d The former President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen!!!! There he goes! Trump\u2019s wedding toast called to mind nothing so much as an over-the-hill baseball player hocking signed memorabilia at a trade show in the Catskills \u2013 a sort of why-the-heck-is-he-doing-that moment that has become the rule rather than the exception in the early days of his post-presidency. Another example: As part of his newly launched post-presidential website (45office.com), Trump is offering personalized greetings for \u201cyour special occasion.\u201d Just fill out the web form and wait six-ish weeks! Also, important note: \u201cDue to the volume of greeting requests President and Mrs. Trump receive, we will not provide status updates.\u201d Amazing! THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! If Trump prided himself on breaking all norms and conventions of being president (\u201cMy use of social media is not Presidential - it\u2019s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL,\u201d he tweeted in 2017), the first few months of his time as a former president suggest he remains committed to acting like no man who has held the office before. Aside from the wedding toast and the special occasion greetings, Trump is also using a series of fiery statements attacking a variety of public figures to keep busy. On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the highly respected director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was Trump\u2019s chosen target. Aside from making a series of untrue attacks about Fauci\u2019s role in the development of the vaccine, Trump also saw fit to add this: \u201c[Fauci], who said he was an athlete in college but couldn\u2019t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a \u2018roller,\u2019\u201d in reference to the doctor throwing out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals 2020 season. (This is the sort of drivel Trump once tweeted out with regularity. That option is no longer available to him as he has been permanently removed from Twitter.) He\u2019s also taken the time to dabble in politics \u2013 mostly to settle scores against Republicans he believes wronged him over his final days in office. In early March, Trump released a statement blasting Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. \u201cShe represents her state badly and her country even worse,\u201d Trump told Politico. \u201cI do not know where other people will be next year, but I know where I will be \u2013 in Alaska campaigning against a disloyal and very bad Senator.\u201d Later in the month, while hosting a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, Trump pitted the four Republicans seeking the Ohio Senate nomination against one another in a scene that evoked \u2013 whether intentionally or not \u2013 the boardroom from his reality TV days. And, of course, he\u2019s stoked chatter about his own possible future presidential candidacy. \u201cWho knows? Who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time, OK?\u201d Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd in February. \u201cFor a third time.\u201d (Important side note: Trump lost the 2020 election.) Taken as a whole, the post-presidential actions of the 45th president have been weird, outsized, graceless and self-serving. Or put more simply, Trumpian.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration announced the suspension of all diplomatic trade engagement with Myanmar on Monday following a weekend of violence against pro-democracy protesters and the deadliest day since military seized power in a February 1 coup. The suspension of government-to-government engagement under the 2013 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) \u201cwill remain in effect until the return of a democratically elected government,\u201d a statement from the office of United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said. Under that agreement the US cooperated with Myanmar on trade and investment to support the country\u2019s integration into the global economy. More than 100 civilians, including children, were killed in demonstrations protesting the military coup across Myanmar on Saturday, sparking international condemnation. President Joe Biden called the violence \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cabsolutely outrageous.\u201d Anguish in Myanmar after weekend of 'outrageous' bloodshed \u201cBased on the reporting that I got, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily,\u201d Biden told reporters Sunday in Delaware as he headed back to Washington. Asked what the US response would be to the reported atrocities, Biden said, \u201cWe\u2019re working on that now.\u201d The diplomatic trade suspension announced Monday will be effective \u201cimmediately.\u201d \u201cThe United States supports the people of Burma in their efforts to restore a democratically elected government, which has been the foundation of Burma\u2019s economic growth and reform,\u201d Tai said in a statement, using another name for Myanmar. Tai continued, \u201cThe United States strongly condemns the Burmese security forces\u2019 brutal violence against civilians. The killing of peaceful protestors, students, workers, labor leaders, medics, and children has shocked the conscience of the international community. These actions are a direct assault on the country\u2019s transition to democracy and the efforts of the Burmese people to achieve a peaceful and prosperous future.\u201d The Karen National Union (KNU), the armed ethnic group that controls the southeastern region in Myanmar, told CNN that more airstrikes were conducted by Myanmar\u2019s ruling military Sunday after military jets killed at least two members of the KNU militia Saturday in a bombing raid near the border with Thailand and many civilians fled across the border. The US State Department has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the airstrikes. US and allies sanction Myanmar's military for violent repression of protesters Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions against members of Myanmar\u2019s military, designating Myanmar\u2019s chief of police, Than Hlaing, and its Bureau of Special Operations commander, Lt. Gen. Aung Soe, as well as two army units \u201cfor being responsible for or complicit in or having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by people in Burma,\u201d a statement from Blinken said. The military seized power after claiming that November 8 elections, which were decisively won by political leader Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party, the National League for Democracy, had been marred by fraud. After the country\u2019s election commission disputed that claim, the military replaced the commission. The coup marks a return to military rule, which stifled Myanmar for decades before a slim democratic opening began around 2010. As citizens of the country have taken to the streets to defend their election system with strikes and protests, the military has responded with increasing violence and efforts to stifle communications. Internet access has been restricted, journalists have been arrested and some newspapers have been barred from publishing. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story and headline incorrectly described the action taken by the US. The US is suspending diplomatic trade engagement with Myanmar established under the 2013 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement. CNN\u2019s Nicole Gaouette, Ivan Watson and DJ Judd contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. With some wind in his sails from the massively popular Covid relief package, President Joe Biden\u2019s next big legislative push \u2013 a sweeping infrastructure plan \u2013 is set to bring a far more challenging bipartisan test in the coming weeks. The \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d infrastructure proposal that White House aides are putting together would be segmented into two separate parts \u2013 one focused on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second focused on what\u2019s being termed the \u201ccare economy\u201d with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues. In full, it would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the \u201cjobs\u201d agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his campaign for president, with a suite of potential tax increases on corporations and the wealthy as options to finance any longer-term spending in the final proposal. That\u2019s where things get tricky. As CNN\u2019s John Harwood writes, the plan contains some fat political targets. Republicans deride as \u201cwelfare\u201d some of the tax credits it directs to help families climb the economic ladder. They skewer alternative energy investments and regulations to combat climate change as costly and radical. As Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell summarized it: \u201cA so-called infrastructure proposal that may actually be a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.\u201d But Biden is determined to find Republican support. The President plans to pursue bipartisan support, according to his advisers. He\u2019s already held multiple bipartisan Oval Office meetings on the issue. During a meeting with labor leaders in February, Biden repeatedly stressed that he thought there was a path for bipartisanship on the issue, according to an attendee. There\u2019s still a backup plan. Officials are also planning for congressional Democrats to move concurrently with a budget procedure that would allow any package to pass with a simple majority in the US Senate. The nuts and bolts. The infrastructure proposal would focus heavily on money for roads, bridges and rails, and would include hundreds of billions in spending for climate-related measures, as well as climate-related research and development. It also would include $100 billion for education infrastructure. The domestic economy piece of the plan would include key Biden campaign priorities such as universal pre-K, significant spending on childcare, care-giving and proposals designed to try and address portions of the workforce hit hardest by the pandemic economy. The debate will kick off in earnest soon. While the planning remains fluid, officials are tentatively eyeing Biden\u2019s joint address to Congress \u2013 likely to be scheduled in April \u2013 as a moment where the key thematic elements of the package are made clear. How SCOTUS laid the path for Georgia\u2019s election law. The voter restrictions were dashed into law by Republicans shaken over recent election losses and lies about fraud from former President Donald Trump, yet the measures also developed against a backdrop of US Supreme Court decisions hollowing out federal voting rights protection. Biden calls it \u2018Jim Crow in the 21st century.\u2019 The President labeled the election law \u201cJim Crow in the 21st century\u201d and \u201can atrocity,\u201d saying the Justice Department is \u201ctaking a look\u201d at the measure. \u2018We\u2019ve got to work on the infrastructure of our democracy\u2019 Democratic Georgia Sen. Ralph Warnock told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that everyone has a decision to make: \u201cAre we going to stand on the side of truth and righteousness and justice? Are we going to stand up on the right side of history? This is a defining moment in the American nation and all of us have a role to play.\u201d Attorney for arrested Georgia state representative speaks out. An attorney for Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon vowed that the Democrat will contest the charges she faces after being arrested Thursday for knocking on Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s office door while he signed a sweeping elections bill into law. Will this backfire on Georgia Republicans? CNN\u2019s John Blake writes that the election law may prove to be a clumsy political miscalculation. There\u2019s growing evidence to suggest that voter restriction laws sometimes backfire against their proponents. By attacking voting rights Georgia Republicans have abandoned a GOP political strategy that helped them win close elections. And they have angered a powerful bloc of Black voters in Georgia who have already mobilized against them. The crisis at the US-Mexico border isn\u2019t going to subside anytime soon. While the Biden administration begins to get a handle on the coronavirus pandemic, internal government estimates obtained by CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez underscore a border crisis still in its infancy: Remember, border arrivals typically rise in the spring, but the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation and further limited the capacity along the border to process migrants. To compare, in May 2019, at the height of that crisis, 11,475 unaccompanied kids were arrested by US Border Patrol. In June 2014, during the peak surge of children at the border, 10,620 unaccompanied children were arrested by US Border Patrol. There are several factors at play this time, including deteriorating conditions in Latin America, pent-up demand to enter the US and a perceived relaxation of enforcement under Biden that are driving migrants to the border at what appears to be an accelerated pace. As we mentioned last week, the US doesn\u2019t have to just accept another surge in coronavirus cases. The medical cavalry is here and rolling out fast. But the combination of relaxed mitigation measures, increased travel, and a dangerous variant is proving to be a formidable challenge. Put simply, the race between vaccines and variants is a close one. Take it from CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky who described this perilous moment in the pandemic at the White House last week: Where are we are vaccinations? So far roughly 15.5% of the US population is fully vaccinated as of Sunday evening \u2013 meaning not enough Americans are yet protected to suppress the spread of the virus through herd immunity. But soon, supply won\u2019t be the issue. Some experts fear that the upcoming challenge won\u2019t be a short supply of vaccine \u2013 but getting enough people vaccinated. \u201cWe have a lot of vaccine, we\u2019ll have more over the next month,\u201d Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThe challenge is to get the shots into arms and then to convince the hesitant to get the shots.\u201d B.1.1.7 is spreading fast. So far, the CDC has reported more than 8,300 cases of the variant in the US \u2013 and the agency has previously said the number only represents cases that have been found with the help of genetic sequencing. Keep these links handy. CNN is tracking vaccine distribution in the US and in countries across the globe. The bottom line is still the same. What can help fight another Covid-19 surge, according to experts, are the measures that have been proven to work: face masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and regularly washing hands. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked six of the doctors who have run point on the pandemic response to provide their insights on what the US could have done differently in the new documentary, \u201cCOVID WAR: The Pandemic Doctors Speak Out,\u201d which airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. In the documentary, Birx gives Gupta her gut-wrenching answer when asked how much of an impact it would have made if the US had paused earlier and followed through with the safety measures that were proven to slow the spread. \u201cI look at it this way. The first time we have an excuse,\u201d Birx says. \u201cThere were about a hundred thousand deaths that came from that original surge. All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially.\u201d Watch Sunday evening at 9 p.m. ET on CNN or stream on CNNgo. That\u2019s how Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, characterized his former boss\u2019 recent attempt to whitewash the history of the January 6 Capitol riot. Mulvaney, who stepped down as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Northern Ireland after the insurrection, offered a pointed rebuke to Trump\u2019s comments that his supporters were \u201chugging and kissing\u201d police officers and posed \u201czero threat,\u201d despite widespread violence. \u201cI was surprised to hear the President say that. Clearly there were people who were behaving themselves, and then there were people who absolutely were not, but to come out and say that everyone was fine and there was no risk, that\u2019s just manifestly false \u2013 people died, other people were severely injured,\u201d Mulvaney told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on \u201cNewsroom.\u201d Read more here.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s not often that a freshman member of Congress \u2013 in office barely two months \u2013 gets a shout out from the House Speaker during a congressional signing ceremony for a major piece of legislation. But that\u2019s what happened to Rep. Nikema Williams. Speaker Nancy Pelosi even said that in some ways Williams made passing the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, the first Biden administration priority, possible. Williams is not only a new House member, she is also the chairwoman of the Georgia Democratic Party, and was a key player in helping the formerly red state elect not only a Democratic president, but two senators whose victories flipped control of the US Senate to Democrats. Still, Williams joked in an interview that when she got the email from Pelosi\u2019s office inviting her to the \u201cenrollment\u201d \u2013 the official name for the process of key lawmakers signing legislation before it goes to the president \u2013 she had to look it up. \u201cI was like, \u2018yes!\u2019 But then I had to go to Google because I didn\u2019t know what an enrollment ceremony was,\u201d she said with a laugh. The learning curve on becoming fluent in Washington speak may be steep at the start, but Williams is finding her footing fast \u2013 especially since Republicans back home in Georgia passed a new law limiting access to voting last week. \u201cI\u2019m the first Black woman to ever be our state party chair in Georgia. And when I talked (about winning) leading up to the election, people were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cute. They think they\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u201d Williams said about Republicans underestimating her and colleagues like Stacey Abrams, a voting rights advocate whose efforts helped Democrats\u2019 recent success in the state. \u201cRepublicans are pushing back and they\u2019re upset that we were able to win. And so they\u2019re going to do everything in their power right now to restrict access to people who mainly look like me from voting,\u201d said Williams. Her mission now is to use her seat in Congress to work with Democratic leaders to put national voting protections in place. \u201cI had a colleague who came up to me and he said, \u2018Nikema, I don\u2019t understand why you want to do this.\u2019 Like, \u2018You understand that this will federalize our elections and we shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019 And I said, \u2018We absolutely should. If it were not for the federal government, I wouldn\u2019t even have the right to vote in this country.\u2019 So the right to vote should be standardized across the board. It shouldn\u2019t matter what state you live in or which county you live in in the state. You should have the same access to the ballot,\u201d she said. Williams is not only the first Black woman to chair the Georgia Democratic Party, she is also the first Black woman to represent Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District \u2013 the seat held by civil rights icon John Lewis until his death last summer. \u201cCongressman Lewis often said, each generation has an obligation to move us one step closer. So it\u2019s my turn to pick up the mantle,\u201d Williams said. Lewis was Williams\u2019 mentor, friend and shopping buddy (they hit the sale rack at Dillard\u2019s in Atlanta as often as they could). She even met her husband, Leslie Small, who had worked for the civil right icon, thanks to Lewis sending him on an errand to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Georgia headquarters in 2008 where Williams was working. Adorning the wall behind her congressional desk is a mural made by a constituent with pictures of her and Lewis. In big letters is one of Lewis\u2019 most famous sayings, that people should \u201cget into good trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d \u201cBeing in this seat, I feel just \u2013 he already set the path and we know exactly what it is we should be doing and it\u2019s up to us to live up to it,\u201d she said wistfully. Her Atlanta congressional district is steeped in history beyond Lewis. Another civil rights leader, Andrew Young, also held the seat. Williams represents iconic landmarks like the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Martin Luther King, Jr. preached. \u201cWhile all seats have the same weighted vote here in the United States Congress, this is a very special seat and a very special district. I don\u2019t take it lightly,\u201d Williams said. Williams says the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, three days after she was sworn in, was a vivid reminder of her challenge, especially as one of just 24 Black women in a Congress of 535. \u201cTo see that Confederate flag going through the rotunda at the Capitol was like someone was trying to send a reminder that no matter how far we get in this country \u2013 trying to put us in our place,\u201d she recalled. She said she is convinced that the twin Senate victories she helped make happen in Georgia played a big part in the attack. \u201cI think that it was a direct result of the power that they saw themselves losing in states like Georgia. And losing not only the presidency, but those two Senate seats, I think they just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and refused to understand that other people can turn out to vote and have access to the same power that they have,\u201d she added. Here's why voting rights activists say Georgia's new election law targets Black voters She said Georgia\u2019s new restrictive voting law is about race and power, pure and simple. \u201cWe might not be telling people that they have to count the number of jelly beans in a jar, but we are absolutely still looking for the same result,\u201d she said, referring to an infamous test racist poll workers used to use to ban Black voters before federal civil rights laws were passed in the 1960s. \u201cWe played by their rules,\u201d Williams said of the recent elections in the state that Democrats won. \u201cAnd now they want to change the rules. And it\u2019s unfortunate that we have people in 2021 who are still trying to restrict people\u2019s access to the ballot,\u201d she added. Like Lewis, Williams grew up in rural Alabama, in a small town called Smiths Station not far from the Georgia border. \u201cI never imagined, just from my upbringings, that I will be here in the United States Congress. I literally grew up in a home with no indoor plumbing and no running water,\u201d Williams said. The 42-year-old said that was unusual for someone her age growing up in the 1980s and 1990s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that that wasn\u2019t the norm at the time. And I was raised by my grandparents who didn\u2019t even have a high school education, but they never made me feel like anything was out of reach and always pushed me to do my very best, and there are a lot of people that looked out for me and gave me opportunities,\u201d she recalled. She said government assistance was key to her family\u2019s survival. \u201cLiterally once a month we drove to Opelika and we got food stamps and we got the government assistance, and so when I hear people here in the United States Congress talk about cutting those programs or those programs not being needed, I think about how much of an impact it had on me and us just being able to make it,\u201d she said. Political activism is in her DNA. Some of her most vivid memories are of her grandparents, aunts and uncles helping to get out the vote. \u201cI remember them working at the polls on Election Days and the leftover little cards that they would bring, where you have to register if you were a Democrat or Republican. And I would play school with those when they were brought home,\u201d she said. During her freshman year in high school, Williams was surprised to open her history book and see a picture of her great aunt, Autherine Lucy. \u201cI remember coming come and I was like, \u2018Ma, Auntie Autherine is in my history book.\u2019 I knew she had done something but not really paid attention to it.\u201d Lucy was the first Black student admitted to the University of Alabama. Williams was arrested during a protest in 2018, but it was not civil rights-era civil disobedience. She was a state senator, and went to check out a protest in the Georgia state capitol. When police told the crowd to disperse, she did not think they were talking about her, since she was a legislator in the building for a special session. \u201cLegislators \u2013 we\u2019re not even allowed to be arrested in our Constitution, and that day they took me to jail in zip ties and booked me in the county jail. I was told that I needed to remove my clothes so that they could strip search me and make sure that I wasn\u2019t hiding anything in my vagina cavity,\u201d Williams said. Asked whether she thinks a White man would have been arrested like that, Williams said she knows he wouldn\u2019t, because one of her White male colleagues was standing with her when she got arrested. He was not. \u201cI feel like they were trying to silence me to kind of put me in my place at that point,\u201d she said. But it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt just gave me more resolve and a bigger platform to do more and to push further to make sure that our voices are heard and that we don\u2019t back down,\u201d she said. In 2016, Williams was the one who got to announce Georgia\u2019s delegates for Hillary Clinton during the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. She did it while holding her then-baby boy Carter. \u201cBeing able to cast those votes for Hillary Clinton \u2013 the first woman to have the nomination for a major party in this country \u2013 meant a lot, especially holding my soon-to-be one-year-old, just for women in this country knowing that we don\u2019t have to put our families aside to move forward in our careers,\u201d Williams said. Now that she is in Washington, that balance is a lot trickier since Carter, now five years old, is more than 600 miles away in Atlanta with Williams\u2019 husband. They are able to connect the way most working parents do \u2013 by FaceTime. The day we were with Williams, her son called to tell her he \u201crocked it\u201d on a math test at school and that he was excited for a big Karate belt test he had that afternoon. But Carter has already seen more of the world than mathematics and martial arts. Rep. Nikema Williams: I'm not safe at home or in Washington \u201cHe\u2019s quite precocious for a 5-year-old, but he\u2019s been around. I take him to events with me and he\u2019s a part of everything, and we don\u2019t separate our lives. And so we\u2019ve had conversations with him about how some people are treated differently in this country,\u201d Williams said. Since the January 6 attack on the Capitol, they have had 24-hour security at home because of threats against Williams, both as the state party chair and now as a member of Congress, which was tough to explain to a 5-year-old. \u201cI remember the first day going through the carpool line, and there\u2019s this extra car behind us. And they asked our security who he was here to pick up. And we had to explain to the teachers that we have security with us, and they\u2019ll be coming with us to the pickup line every day,\u201d she recalled. But explaining what Carter can do with his future comes easier. When he saw a television show about Jackie Robinson, Williams told her son what she says she will say \u2013 and fight for \u2013 for the rest of his life. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mommy, did you know that people didn\u2019t want him to play baseball just because of his skin?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, what about me? I\u2019m the same color as him. Can I play baseball?\u2019\u201d Williams recalled. Williams said she responded: \u201c\u2018You can do anything in this world that you want to do.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden offered his most expansive explanation yet of his own presidency on Thursday, presenting himself, at least for now, as a problem solver operating above the bitter divides of Washington politics. In his first formal news conference, Biden sketched his goals and reflected on the mission he was assigned by American voters in the middle of the worst domestic crisis in decades when he won a resounding victory last fall amid the pandemic. He touted the passage of his massive Covid relief bill, but leaned on his characteristic empathy to connect with people who aren\u2019t yet celebrating. \u201cThere are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Biden said. On the issue that is consuming the Beltway, he signaled that he may well set off an extreme political showdown by seeking changes to Senate rules to drive the Democratic agenda into law. But the President also made clear that any such move will only happen when he is ready. Key takeaways from Biden's first White House news conference His timetable \u2013 which gives him room to seek bipartisan solutions on other issues first \u2013 may dash liberal hopes that abolishing the Senate filibuster, which Republicans will use to try to stifle his presidency, is imminent. The filibuster conundrum became even more central Thursday after Georgia passed a new law suppressing minority and Democratic votes that may only be reversed by a huge voting rights bill waiting in the Senate. While his $1.9 trillion Covid rescue bill delighted progressives, Biden also made clear that he knows that his own coalition is broader than just liberal Democrats clamoring for sweeping left-wing lawmaking. The President laid out a theory as to why he was elected last November \u2013 to stop the pandemic and to act as a pragmatic, non-divisive fixer of address America\u2019s problems. With that in mind, he signaled his next agenda items will be infrastructure and jobs bills on which he seeks GOP votes. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of timing. As you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents better than me have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Biden told masked reporters in the East Room of the White House. The President gave the distinct impression that he was seeking to enact as much of his agenda as possible through traditional means,  even in a 50-50 Senate with a shaky Democratic coalition, before trying the nuclear option of killing the filibuster \u2013 the custom requiring 60 votes for major legislation. \u201cSuccessful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first,\u201d Biden said, hinting at his preference for incremental change despite saying that he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster \u201cwas a relic of the Jim Crow era.\u201d Speed read Biden's news conference Biden is operating in an environment where several moderate Democrats, whom he cannot afford to alienate with such a narrow Senate majority, are opposed to abolishing the filibuster entirely and are uneasy with aspects of the massive voting rights bill already sent by the House to the Senate. Biden\u2019s caution isn\u2019t just about him trying to live up to his own calls for unity and bipartisan solutions, which he believes helped him to defeat a President who was unable to martial the power of the US government to tackle the great crisis of the age. It also reflects the political reality that a more aggressive approach, which would falter without building support from the public first, could also split his party. Biden, however, also left a strong impression, that ultimately, and if necessary, he would be willing to contemplate the removal of the filibuster, a step that would ignite unrestrained partisan warfare. Agreeing with Obama that the rule is a remnant of institutionalized racism, he described GOP efforts to curtail access to the ballot in multiple states, which will disproportionately affect Black Americans, as \u201csick\u201d and \u201cpernicious.\u201d When the President was asked whether he was concerned that his party might lose control of the House and Senate in 2022 if Democrats aren\u2019t able to pass federal voting rights legislation, he said his bigger concerns was about the motives of those who are trying to scale back those rights. \u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,\u201d he said. Georgia's new law suppressing the vote is a victory for Trump Given the strength of that reaction, Biden\u2019s comment on the possibility of ditching the filibuster \u2013 his most forward-leaning yet \u2013 took on extra significance. \u201cIf we have to, if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he said. On the same afternoon that Biden was speaking, Georgia\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature passed a sweeping bill that would vastly limit access to the ballot, including curtailing the use of drop boxes and making it a misdemeanor to give food or water to voters waiting in line at the polls. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the bill into law on Thursday evening. The legislation is one of dozens of bills to make voting more difficult that have been introduced in more than 40 states following GOP losses in the 2020 presidential race and US Senate contests. The GOP efforts to limit voting in Georgia have been among the most closely watched because former President Donald Trump went to great lengths to overturn the election results in that state as he propagated lies that the election was stolen from him. Biden said in the coming months, he plans to devote his energy to figuring out how to pass the US House legislation, known as the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which would counter some of the restrictive state measures that he said he believes many Republican voters will oppose. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic \u2013 what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt cannot be sustained. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law.\u201d Remarkably, given the fact that the US is still averaging 1,000 deaths and more than 50,000 new Covid-19 cases a day, Biden was not asked a single question about the pandemic. In a way, that was a signal of his success in tackling the defining issue of the first year of his presidency \u2013 as he doubled his vaccination goal for his first 100 days after already bypassing 100 million shots in arms. Reporters were more interested in the new challenges facing Biden \u2013 like the influx of child migrants over the southern border and the stalemate over firearms reform after yet another string of mass shootings. The President said he would fix those problems but needed time, as he stuck to his script. \u201cWhen I took office, I decided that \u2013 it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is I got elected to solve problems,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was Covid-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans.\u201d Biden\u2019s effort to portray himself as a reasonable problem solver dedicated to practical solutions also extended to his point-by-point description about how his administration is trying to handle the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border. His team has rejected efforts by reporters to portray the recent surge in border crossings as a crisis. And on Thursday, Biden repeatedly faulted Trump and the prior administration for dismantling the systems that he said would have allowed the government to handle the increase in migrants, particularly of unaccompanied minors. He seemed amused by a reporter\u2019s suggestion that more migrants are coming across the border now because he is viewed as a more benevolent leader than his predecessor. Rejecting that explanation, he insisted that the current pattern tracks with the increase in migrants that was occurring before the pandemic in 2019. Fact-checking Biden's first news conference as president \u201cIt happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March,\u201d Biden said, adding that those months are the time when migrants can travel \u201cwith the least likelihood of dying on the way\u201d in the heat of the desert. But interviews that CNN has conducted with people who recently migrated across the border have demonstrated that there is a perception that Biden\u2019s administration will be more lenient than the Trump administration \u2013 and the desperate conditions in some parts of Latin America are clearly contributing to what appears to be an increase in migrants trying to enter the United States. Still, Biden pointed to the endemic problems in migrants\u2019 home countries that lead them to leave, including hunger, natural disasters, poverty and gang violence, and said Trump helped trigger the current situation by cutting the more than $700 million aid plan that he helped negotiate as vice president, which sent money into Central America, including to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, to address what he called the root causes of migration to the US. (Trump did say he was eliminating the aid to Northern Triangle countries in March 2019. But the State Department restored some of the funding that he planned to cut in October 2019). Trump \u201cdismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and has\u2026 continued to be a problem for a long time,\u201d Biden said, blaming the Trump administration for not providing adequate funding to the Department of Health and Human Services that would allow them to quickly transfer unaccompanied minors out of Customs and Border Protection facilities \u201cwhere they should not be,\u201d Biden added. Biden said his administration is now focused on trying to rebuild the system so it can handle the rising number of migrants. But he insisted that the \u201coverwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back.\u201d He said that includes the \u201cvast majority\u201d of families that are attempting to enter this country, as the US tries to work out an agreement with Mexico to take more of them back. But that was not the case in February, the last month for which full data is available. Published Customs and Border Protection data for February shows that 7,915 migrants who were part of a \u201cfamily unit\u201d on the southwest border were expelled under the Title 42 pandemic expulsion policy \u2013 only about 41% of the 19,246 family-unit members who were in \u201cencounters\u201d with US officers that month. Biden said the administration is also acting more quickly to try to contact the family members of minors under the age of 18, who often arrive with a phone number of a relative in the United States. Under the new system, he said, officials will attempt to call that number within 24 hours to begin a verification process to safely unite the child with relatives in an effort to reduce the population of children in CBP custody as quickly as possible. Even though Biden has said he is committed to transparency and leveling with the American people, he would not immediately commit to allowing journalists access to the overcrowded Border Patrol facilities that are housing children in jail-like conditions. \u201cI will commit to transparency as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now,\u201d he said, alluding to the plans to move children to more suitable conditions. \u201cThis is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.\u201d When pressed on when that would be, Biden did not have an answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know, to be clear,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s call for an assault weapons ban and a wave of other gun control measures adds a daunting new policy challenge to a progressive agenda that is already shaping up as the most ambitious by a Democratic president for decades. The President has already passed a $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan that reflects the reality that his administration will be mostly defined by his ability to conquer the pandemic that has killed more than half a million Americans. What comes next could be even bigger, as CNN reported on Monday that the White House is already preparing a $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal, the Democratic-led House has sent the Senate a massive election bill and the President also envisages big climate change legislation. Biden eulogized the victims of the mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket at the White House on Tuesday at a hastily arranged event, and took the chance to add more to his administration\u2019s already-full plate. \u201cI don\u2019t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common-sense steps that will save the lives in the future, and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a senator. It passed. It was the law for the longest time. And it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again.\u201d The remarks before Biden headed off to Ohio to tout his Covid rescue plan and mark Obamacare\u2019s 11th anniversary reflected the sudden crises that erupt and can disrupt the best-laid plans of any President. The mass shooting in Colorado \u2013 the seventh in seven days in the United States, by CNN\u2019s count \u2013 came while his administration struggles to control a flood of child migrants at the border, which his team won\u2019t call a crisis, amid a foreign policy showdown between Biden and two major nuclear powers, Russia and China. How the current US-Mexico border crisis compares with the peak of the Trump era in 2019 But White House senior adviser Cedric Richmond told CNN on Tuesday night that the President would seek to mobilize public opinion to change the political dynamics in Washington. \u201cI think that the will of the people \u2026 they will create the demand. We will help lead that and we will help to pass it,\u201d Richmond told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThe President feels very strongly that he is not going to sit back and watch people get mowed down in the streets without trying.\u201d Biden later told reporters that he hadn\u2019t started counting votes in the Senate when he was asked about the daunting prospects for gun control legislation. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said later that the President\u2019s opposition to abolishing the filibuster \u2013 a procedural rule requiring a 60-vote majority to pass legislation in the Senate, which had scuppered previous efforts on firearms \u2013 had not changed in light of the new guns debate. \u201cHe believes that we should work with Democrats and Republicans to get work done for the American people, including common-sense gun safety measures,\u201d Psaki said. Biden would not allow obstruction to thwart his work for Americans, she vowed, but added: \u201cHis preference and priority is working with members of both parties.\u201d Such a position, however, almost guarantees that the latest shooting \u2013 along with last week\u2019s massacre in Georgia, which killed eight people at Asian-owned spas \u2013 will not produce meaningful new laws, given GOP opposition. And it\u2019s not even clear that Biden can get the entire Democratic caucus on board. The most moderate member, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said Tuesday that the House-passed bills on firearms went too far. While gun control groups detect a shift in opposition to new curbs on dangerous weapons in many states and in local political races, there\u2019s little sign of a significant shift in the Washington dynamic. Manchin was a key player in a previous effort to pass moderately tightened background checks into law in 2013 in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, which killed 20 elementary schoolers and six adults in Connecticut. But the limited compromise Manchin brokered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania didn\u2019t survive the GOP filibuster in a drama Biden watched take place as vice president.   Given the obstacles to passing new firearms laws, the most that progressives may be able to hope for is that if the legislation is blocked in the Senate it will add to the pile of bills \u2013 which will likely include sweeping voting rights and climate change legislation \u2013 that convinces even skeptics like Biden that his presidential legacy demands removing the filibuster. But Manchin might also stand in the way again, since he opposes such a fundamental change to the Senate\u2019s way of doing \u2013 or not doing \u2013 business, reflecting the power of a single senator in a 50-50 chamber. The doubtful prospects for gun control legislation don\u2019t just show the harsh relative political choices that presidents must make every day, they also underscore the complicated equation set up by the voters of a divided nation in the last election. Democrats control the presidency as well as both the House and the Senate, by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris being able to cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation that doesn\u2019t have a bipartisan majority. But the characteristics of the US political system and the reality of the filibuster \u2013 which was often used by White conservatives in the past to stall civil rights bills \u2013 mean a party with a thin majority can find it difficult to enact major changes. And the relative power of the minority, especially in a 50-50 Senate, is far greater than that of the political opposition in most parliamentary systems. Biden would be far from the first modern president to seek gun control and fall short. Former President Barack Obama, who was traumatized by the Sandy Hook massacre, attracted criticism for not dedicating his entire White House to passing gun control in early 2013. And even former President Donald Trump, who was strongly backed by the National Rifle Association, called for change after mass killings in Texas, Ohio and Florida \u2013 though he never made much effort to follow through. The idea that Republicans will join in any bipartisan effort now to address the root causes of gun violence that would be acceptable to Democrats \u2013 for instance, by slowing gun purchases or limiting access to the deadliest weapons \u2013 did not last even a day after the Colorado killings. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater,\u201d Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled to discuss gun violence, which was lent more poignant relevance by the latest tragedy. Cruz was half right \u2013 though he proved Tuesday to be one of the worst offenders in gun politics grandstanding \u2013 arguing that it was Democrats, not Republicans, who blocked serious revisions after the Sandy Hook massacre. Cruz did push a bill that he wrote with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that would boost reporting from agencies and law enforcement institutions to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Critics of the Texas senator dispute his claims that it could have stopped several of the mass killings of recent years and see it as a smokescreen to give Republicans cover in order to avoid voting for legislation that would have a greater effect. Another Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, produced the most eye-popping argument of the day, drawing an analogy between mass killers and those who drive under the influence. \u201cI think what many folks on my side of the aisle are saying is that the answer is not to get rid of all sober drivers,\u201d said Kennedy, who in 2018 told CNN after the Parkland, Florida, high school rampage that \u201cidiot control\u201d \u2013 not gun control \u2013 was needed. His comments served to underscore the gulf in ambition between Democrats who are pushing for laws that make horrific events like the one in Colorado less likely to happen and Republicans who believe wider ownership of guns, not more restrictions, would make Americans safer.",

            "article_content": "With their drive to erect new obstacles to voting, particularly across the Sun Belt, Republicans are stacking sandbags against a rising tide of demographic change. In many of the states where Republicans are advancing the most severe restrictions \u2013 including Georgia, Arizona and Texas \u2013 shifts in the electorate\u2019s composition are eroding decades of virtually uncontested GOP dominance. In each of those states \u2013 and others such as North Carolina, South Carolina and, in a slightly different way, Florida \u2013 the GOP still holds a statewide advantage primarily because of its strong performance among older, non-college-educated and non-urban White voters. But in almost all those states, the Republican edge is ebbing amid two powerful demographic currents: an improving Democratic performance among white-collar voters in and around the states\u2019 rapidly growing major cities, and the aging into the electorate of younger generations defined by kaleidoscopic racial diversity.   That latter shift, in particular, represents an existential long-term danger to Republican control of Sun Belt states where they have held the upper hand for years: Kids of color now compose a clear majority of the under 18 population in Arizona, Texas, Georgia and Florida, and nearly half in the Carolinas, according to an analysis by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. In Texas alone, local experts estimate that about 200,000 citizen Latinos will turn 18 and thus eligible to vote each year through at least 2028. Many analysts agree that the restrictions on voting proliferating in such states \u2013 and the prospect that many of them will also impose severe partisan gerrymanders before the 2022 elections \u2013 represent a race-against-time effort by Republicans to entrench their political advantage before it is eroded, or washed away entirely, by that approaching surge of demographic change. \u201cThey see the wave of demography coming and they are just trying to hold up a wall and keep it from smashing them in,\u201d says Frey. \u201cIt\u2019s the last bastion of their dominance, and they are doing everything they can.\u201d Why the effects of Republican efforts to limit voting aren't clear Frey argues that such obstacles can suppress the influence of these emerging generations for only so long before their numbers eventually tilt the political balance of power in these states. But many political professionals agree that the voter restrictions now under consideration, and the gerrymandering plans gathering just behind them, in multiple Republican-controlled Sun Belt states can push back that tipping point by years \u2013 or maybe entirely through the 2020s. Which is why many Democrats say that congressional action to establish a national floor of voting rights through the omnibus bill known as HR 1 may be their only chance to break the self-reinforcing cycle of Republican control and constraints on voting that now confront them across the Sun Belt states experiencing the most profound demographic changes. \u201cI hate to say this, but because Democrats control absolutely no lever of power in Texas, it\u2019s really going to come down to what we can do at the national level in the Senate,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, the 2018 Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, told me. \u201cAnd that all obviously comes down to the filibuster.\u201d The Republican drive to restrict access to the ballot box after the 2020 election is not confined to states experiencing rapid demographic change: It\u2019s a virtually nationwide campaign that is also advancing in preponderantly White states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and Montana. But it is in the quickly changing Sun Belt states that the generational and racial implications of the confrontation are posed most starkly. The political equation is not exactly identical across the Sun Belt states where Republicans are pushing voter restrictions. For instance, Republicans have shown much more strength among Latino voters (mostly from central and South America) in South Florida and multi-generation Mexican American families in South Texas than they have with Latinos in Arizona, say, or Georgia. And though Democrats are gaining, in some cases rapidly, Republicans also maintain more residual strength among suburban college-educated Whites in Texas, Georgia and South Carolina than they do in most other states. But across the key Sun Belt states, the broad political story does overlap in significant ways. All of them are defined by a struggle for political influence between racially diverse Democrat-leaning younger generations and preponderantly White Republican-leaning older ones  \u2013 what Frey calls \u201cthe cultural generation gap\u201d and I\u2019ve described as the collision between \u201cthe brown and the gray.\u201d They are staring down the freight train of change and they are very afraid of it, and they are trying to put down every single roadblock they can think of. Randy Perez, program director, Voting Rights Lab Whites still make up the dominant share of the senior population in all these states: about 4 in 5 in Arizona; roughly 3 in 4 in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina; about 7 in 10 in Georgia and more than 6 in 10 in Texas, according to Frey\u2019s analysis of census data. Whites also represent most of the near-senior populations in these states (though typically by somewhat smaller margins). These older White voters across the Sun Belt typically provide Republicans with lopsided margins: Among Whites 45 and older, Donald Trump in last November\u2019s election carried 74% in Georgia, 69% in Texas and 55% in Arizona, according to exit poll data analyzed by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. These older populations will also diversify over time, Frey notes, but only \u201cat a slow pace.\u201d Even as late as 2030, he projects, Whites will still compose nearly three-fourths of seniors in Arizona and South Carolina, two-thirds in North Carolina and Florida, more than three-fifths in Georgia and about 55% in Texas. Among young people, the story is almost entirely inverted. In most Sun Belt states \u2013 including Arizona, Texas, Georgia and Florida \u2013 most people under age 18 are already kids of color, and in many of the others \u2013 including the Carolinas \u2013 they are at least 45% of the youth population. Those trends will only accelerate into this decade. In fact, in each of those six states, not only has the share of White kids declined since 2010, so has the absolute number. Frey\u2019s calculations of the change are stark: Since 2010, Georgia has lost about 90,000 White kids and added 103,000 kids of color; Arizona has lost almost 47,000 White kids and added more than 58,000 kids of color; North Carolina has lost 76,000 of the former and added over 95,000 of the latter. Even fast-growing Texas has about 16,000 fewer White kids today than in 2010; over that same period, it\u2019s added about 550,000 kids of color. The result is that in each of those states, the pool of eligible young voters will tilt further toward people of color through the years ahead. The nonpartisan States of Change project, for which Frey is an analyst, has projected that by 2028 non-Whites will rise to become a clear majority (55% to 61%) of the 18- to 29-year-old eligible voter population in Florida, Georgia and Arizona. In Texas, where people of color already make up more than three-fifths of the eligible young adult population, that number will rise to fully two-thirds in 2028, the group forecasts. And while political strategists caution that Democrats can\u2019t count on the lockstep loyalty of those emerging generations, they still lean heavily in the party\u2019s direction: Among people of color 45 or younger, Biden carried 77% in Georgia, 66% in Texas and 60% in Arizona, according to Agiesta\u2019s analysis of the exit polls. To civil rights organizers, and groups that work on registering voters across these states, this year\u2019s eruption of GOP proposals that would make it more difficult to vote represents a frenzied attempt to cement the party\u2019s advantages before these potential voters enter the electorate. \u201cThey are staring down the freight train of change and they are very afraid of it, and they are trying to put down every single roadblock they can think of,\u201d says Randy Perez, program director at the Voting Rights Lab, a voting rights advocacy group in Arizona. In Arizona, between 800,000 and 1 million eligible voters are unregistered, more than three-fourths of them people of color and close to three-fifths under age 45, according to analysis by Chris Brill, data director for One Arizona, a coalition of low-income and minority advocacy groups there. As with many things, the scale of this battle is biggest in Texas \u2013 as are the stakes in its outcome. One comprehensive recent academic study rated Texas as the most difficult state in which to vote or even register to vote. These systems, especially voter registration, are purposefully, intentionally designed to disenfranchise those groups. The system is working as it is intended and designed. H. Drew Galloway, executive director, MOVE Texas Texas has not only rejected automatic registration, which registers voters whenever they come in contact with a government agency, and same-day registration, which allows voters to register when they show up at the polls, but is one of only 11 states that do not allow residents to register online. It closes registration 30 days before an election and requires anyone who registers other voters to attend a county-run class (usually offered only one day a month) and obtain a certification that can be used in that county alone. H. Drew Galloway, executive director of MOVE Texas, a group that focuses on registering young people, recalls that in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign he was signing up voters on a college campus near the northern border of Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. \u201cI had this student in line and he was eager to register to vote. He started filling out the form and name, address, and he stopped and said, \u2018Nope I live in Guadalupe County,\u2019 which is the next county over,\u201d Galloway told me. \u201cIn order to register voters in Guadalupe County I have to go to Guadalupe County and take the exact same class and I hadn\u2019t done that, so I had to explain to him I can\u2019t register you to vote, I can give you this mail-in form, but it\u2019s got to be postmarked today by like 5 o\u2019clock. And he looked at me and said I have to be at work in 30 minutes and walked off.\u201d Let\u2019s not be coy with this: When Texas changes, the whole electoral map resets. This is the last stronghold of power for conservatism, and if it goes, they would have to rewrite their whole playback, their whole everything, so they are going to hold on and push back as hard as they can in the state of Texas. Crystal Zerme\u00f1o, director of electoral strategy, Texas Organizing Project The requirement to register solely through written forms is especially burdensome both for low-income people, who may lack access to a printer, and young people, who change their addresses more frequently, notes Crystal Zerme\u00f1o, director of electoral strategy at the Texas Organizing Project, another group that registers voters in the state. Her group estimates that as many as 3 million eligible Texans are unregistered, with the numbers tilted toward young people and racial minorities. Both Zerme\u00f1o and Galloway say huge corps of unregistered voters is a feature, not a bug, in the Texas electoral system. \u201cThese systems, especially voter registration, are purposefully, intentionally designed to disenfranchise those groups,\u201d Galloway says. \u201cThe system is working as it is intended and designed.\u201d Even amid all these barriers, Texas Republicans are moving toward adding more. With the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, they are advancing bills in the state Legislature that would ban many of the innovations that Harris County \u2013 which includes Houston \u2013 and other big urban counties used to expand turnout during early voting last fall (including extended hours and drive-through voting), further limit access to voting by mail and shift authority for overseeing elections from the counties (the largest of which Democrats generally control) to the state government (where Republicans now dominate). Also included in the bills: heightened penalties for volunteers if new voters make mistakes in their voter applications, a measure Galloway says will further discourage activists from participating in voter registration drives for fear of legal liability. While acknowledging they can\u2019t prove fraud occurred in last November\u2019s elections, Republicans are justifying the measures as a response to the belief among many GOP voters that it happened. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t know how many or if any elections in the state of Texas in 2020 were altered because of voter fraud,\u201d Abbott has said. \u201cWhat I can tell you is \u2026 any voter fraud that takes place sow seeds of distrust in the election process.\u201d That circular logic means state Republicans are using the fact that many GOP voters believe the discredited claims of fraud from former President Donald Trump and his allies as the pretext for new restrictions on the right to vote. The bills \u201care specifically targeting voters of color and young voters, all on this ridiculous disguise of \u2018election integrity,\u2019 \u201d Zerme\u00f1o says. The magnitude of the existing and proposed barriers to voting in Texas may reflect both the sense of urgency there among Republicans as Democrats have grown more competitive over the past decade but also the stakes for the national GOP in holding the state, the foundation of its national Electoral College strategy. \u201cLet\u2019s not be coy with this: When Texas changes, the whole electoral map resets,\u201d Zerme\u00f1o says. \u201cThis is the last stronghold of power for conservatism, and if it goes, they would have to rewrite their whole playback, their whole everything, so they are going to hold on and push back as hard as they can in the state of Texas.\u201d Texas GOP rolls out series of bills to restrict voting With the Republican-controlled state Legislature likely to approve new voter restrictions this year \u2013 and follow that with gerrymanders meant to lock in Republican control of the Legislature\u2019s chambers and the state congressional delegation \u2013 many Texas activists believe the only way to break the cycle of suppression and control is with national legislation establishing a floor of voting rights in every state. HR 1 \u2013 the sweeping voting rights bill that passed the US House but faces an uncertain future against an inevitable Senate Republican filibuster \u2013 would require every state to offer automatic, same-day and online registration, as well as on-demand absentee balloting and 15 guaranteed days of early voting. Such standards would drill big holes in the dams Texas Republicans have built against the state\u2019s swelling tide of demographic change. \u201cThe absolute best way for us to fix this problem is for HR 1 to be passed,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cHR 1 is going to help other states across the board, but it is going to revolutionize Texas.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee that fewer restrictions on registration and voting in Texas would dye the state blue; Republicans still have deep wells of support there, especially beyond its major population centers. But even a more competitive and small-d democratic Texas would scramble the electoral map for both parties \u2013 and provide a powerful new opportunity for the diverse younger generations aging into the electorate to influence the nation\u2019s political direction.

The months since the 2020 election have brought a high-stakes fight to the critical battleground state of Georgia, where GOP lawmakers are driving to enact sweeping restrictions on voting. How sweeping? Read this report from CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Kelly Mena on an omnibus bill that a key House committee is expected to take up Monday that would: Despite last-minute alterations to the package to preserve more weekend early voting, \u201cthis bill continues to be nothing but voter suppression,\u201d said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. He also added: \u201cThe recent changes are nothing more than putting a little makeup and cologne on Jim Crow.\u201d The coming days will be crucial. The state\u2019s GOP-controlled General Assembly has only five legislative workdays left on its calendar before it adjourns March 31. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate say they plan to finalize changes to election bills in the days ahead. It\u2019s not just Georgia. Despite the absence of any widespread security issues with voting nationwide, GOP lawmakers in battleground states across the country have pushed for additional voting restrictions. As of February, state legislators in 43 states had introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Democrats in Congress are looking to pushback. Senate Democrats last week introduced the election and voting rights package passed by the House earlier this month, one that, if passed, would counteract Republican efforts at the state level to curb access to the ballot box. The legislation, though, is likely to hit a roadblock in the Senate, where it\u2019s not clear there would be enough Republican support to overcome a filibuster. Voter suppression isn\u2019t anything new. On the latest CNN Political Briefing podcast, CNN Race and Equality senior writer Nicquel Terry Ellis explains the effects of these current proposals and how they fit the historical pattern of voter suppression in America. Crisis at the border. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas declined to provide a timeline for when the Biden administration will open new facilities capable of handling the surge of unaccompanied children at the southern border. Korean American congresswomen fight back against bias. GOP Reps. Young Kim and Michelle Steel eagerly joined other Asian American lawmakers as witnesses in a House Judiciary Committee hearing intended to put the spotlight on discrimination, which took on more urgency in the wake of the mass shootings of Asian Americans in Atlanta. SCOTUS watch. The owner of a strawberry nursery in California is taking a union case to the Supreme Court, arguing against a 1975 California law that allows organizers to gain access to the property of agricultural employers during limited time frames to speak to workers about union membership. Republicans clash on insurrection. Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership, argued on Sunday that Americans don\u2019t need \u201calternative versions\u201d of what occurred the day of the US Capitol insurrection, pushing back on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s comments that mischaracterize the riot and its participants. Fencing around Capitol comes down. The outer fencing put up to protect the US Capitol following the insurrection has started to come down, allowing the public to regain access to the iconic building\u2019s grounds again. \u2018Women Have to Interrupt.\u2019 On this week\u2019s Politically Sound podcast, Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sits down with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash to discuss being the only woman in the room, putting women\u2019s rights at the heart of US foreign policy, and her thoughts on the January 6 insurrection. We\u2019ve been watching CNN\u2019s Divided We Stand series about Abraham Lincoln. The final episode, about the aftermath of his assassination, shows how he turned from a divisive president into a universally beloved martyr and it argues that we do him and ourselves a disservice by not understanding his flaws. Missed the series? Public health experts for months have framed the US vaccination campaign as a race between widespread inoculation and the concerting variants that have cropped up around the world. The good news is our vaccine distribution pipeline has improved considerably, to the tune of about 2.4 million doses per day. The bad news? A highly contagious variant is spreading fast, too. \u201cThis is crunch time,\u201d Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThis is going to be our most difficult period right now in terms of seeing who wins out.\u201d The most formidable variant right now is B.1.1.7, which was first spotted in the UK and has been rapidly spreading across the US in recent weeks. The variant is not only more easily transmitted, but it also appears to be more deadly. And The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates it will become the dominant variant of the virus in the US by the end of this month or early April. Take it from Dr. Anthony Fauci: Now, the good news. We don\u2019t have to accept another surge. The three vaccines that have so far won emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration appear to protect people well against B.1.1.7. And our total inoculation numbers are starting to really add up. About 81 million people have had at least one dose of a vaccine, a figure that is going up significantly every day. In addition, about 29 million people have tested positive for the virus and recovered, and tens of millions more have had Covid-19 without a positive test and have some natural immunity. The result is a clear roadmap to avoid another surge, and finally turn the corner on this pandemic. \u201cThe way we can counter 1.1.7, which is a growing threat in our country, is to do two things,\u201d Fauci explained. \u201cTo get as many people vaccinated as quickly and as expeditiously as possible with the vaccine that we know works against this variant and, finally, to implement the public health measures that we talk about all the time \u2026 masking, physical distancing, and avoiding congregant settings, particularly indoors.\u201d One of the disturbing trends in the US inoculation effort has been the way White Americans have received a disproportionate percentage of vaccinations compared with Black and Hispanic Americans. A lot of politicians have claimed this is because of vaccine hesitancy from people of color. But, as CNN\u2019s Harry Enten writes, a look at the polling data suggests that this may not be the case. Take the recent CBS News/YouGov poll for example: Now look at our last CNN poll, which found that just 11% of people of color say they have tried to schedule vaccinations and have failed. It\u2019s 9% for Whites. Compare that with the 36% of people of color who say they want a vaccine and haven\u2019t tried to get one. Just 25% of White people indicated they want to get the vaccine and have not tried to get one. As Harry puts it: Politicians might be wise to shift their focus away from putting the onus on communities of color for not getting vaccinated. They should try to ensure easier access to the vaccine and make sure these communities know that they can get it.",

            "article_content": "This week, as congressional Democrats and President Joe Biden passed and signed into a law a popular economic relief package, Republicans had a different priority in mind: the supposed \u201ccancellation\u201d of children\u2019s author Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss Enterprises removed a number of Dr. Seuss books that the organization thought to be racist from the market. Republicans spoke out against the move, and Democrats blasted the GOP in return. The Republican game plan, however, is part of a larger movement of Republicans ramping up critiques of \u201ccancel culture\u201d, which, as an article from Pew Trusts points out, is seen by the GOP \u201cas the latest iteration of political correctness\u201d. They do it for a simple reason: It\u2019s one of their best political plays. While Democrats may mock them, the fear of cancel culture and political correctness isn\u2019t something that just animates the GOP\u2019s base. It\u2019s the rare issue that does so without alienating voters in the middle. We can see this well in the 2020 American National Elections Studies\u2019 pre-election survey. This academic survey asks questions on a bunch of topics. This includes a question about political correctness, which, if anything, is a less extreme version of cancel culture. Respondents were asked whether they thought people needed to change the way they talked to be with the times or whether this movement had gone too far and people were too easily offended. People being too easily offended won by a 53% to 46% margin over people needing to change the way they talked. Keep in mind, the voters in this sample claimed they had either voted or would vote for Biden over Donald Trump by a 53% to 42% margin. This just gives you an idea of how much more popular the opposition to cancel culture and political correctness is than the baseline Republican presidential performance. Perhaps more intriguing for the GOP is why political correctness is more popular than the party itself: the age gap on the question, while existent, was quite small. Among those younger than 30, the two options were split 50% to 50%. Among those age 65 and older, too easily offended won by a 52% to 47% margin. It was the people who fall between those two age brackets who chose the too easily offended option (54% to 46%). Now compare that to how respondents said they had or would vote in the presidential contest by age. Those younger than 30 favored Biden over Trump by 30 points, which means the cancel culture position was something that attracted youth support at a far higher level than Trump. Voters between the ages of 30 and 64 said they were for Biden over Trump by a 9-point margin. For those over the age of 64, Biden led Trump by 4 points. What we see is that there was the greatest separation between respondent choices on the cancel culture question and the presidential race, the lower down on the age ladder you go. This means that it\u2019s not only the case that opposition to political correctness and cancel culture won\u2019t age out of the electorate, but it\u2019s something that could conceivably win Republicans a lot more youth support than their baseline. The fact that the GOP\u2019s position on cancel culture and political correctness is clearly more popular with Americans than a position you might associate with the left is unusual. On most of the big issues, the Republican position is less popular. Take a look at these issues. On abortion, the pro abortion rights position (i.e. abortion shouldn\u2019t always be illegal or be just for cases of rape, incest or health of the mother) beat out the anti-abortion position (i.e. abortion should always be illegal or be just for cases of rape, incest or health of the mother) by a 61% to 35% margin. On whether the government should spend more and provide more services or spend less and provide fewer services, more spending and a bigger government won by a 23 point margin. That\u2019s in-line with recent polls showing the coronavirus relief package quite popular. On building a border wall with Mexico, opposition was 10 points higher than support. When it came to the protests against police brutality last year, the conservative position wasn\u2019t popular. When asked what the best way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting, 48% of respondents said it was more important to address racism and police violence compared to 32% who said it was more important to use all force to maintain law and order. Even on whether the protests were mostly peaceful or violent, Americans were 2 points more likely to say peaceful than violent. In other words, the Republicans really do seem to be making a smart political play. Of course, it may be their only political play.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Adam Kinzinger wants to save the Republican Party from Donald Trump. His first challenge: Convincing the party it needs to be saved. \u201cThat, I think, is the question,\u201d said Kinzinger, who is beginning his sixth term as an Illinois congressman. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t want to be changed, that\u2019s a decision Republicans get to make. If that\u2019s the case long-term, I think we will lose elections and will be a regional party that won\u2019t compete on the national stage.\u201d As he settles into his role as one of the fiercest Republican critics of the former president, Kinzinger is embracing the political risks he\u2019s facing by openly confronting Trump and his loyal base of supporters. It\u2019s the latest front in the simmering GOP civil war that threatens to divide the party. He knows that his outspokenness could cost him his congressional seat. He\u2019s already drawing a handful of potential GOP primary rivals who are making plans to challenge him, even as he faces a new district boundaries before 2022. He insists the risks were a price worth paying. \u201cIt could be a kamikaze mission,\u201d said Kinzinger, 43, who joined the Air Force after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and still flies as a pilot in the National Guard. \u201cBut it could be the thing that saves the Republican Party.\u201d The first step to rebuilding the Republican Party, he said, is extracting it from the grips of Trump and what he sees as an ideology not rooted in conservatism, but in relentless fear and divisiveness. \u201cAny time in the history of the party, there have been competing visions \u2013 except for now,\u201d Kinzinger said in a hometown interview here at River Hawk Brewing, where patrons seem far more interested in happy hour than talking politics. \u201cIt\u2019s just been Donald Trump\u2019s vision and nobody else has said anything else. We have a right and a responsibility to offer competing visions to Republicans.\u201d The Republican Party is at a crossroads, yet it\u2019s still Trump country in this stretch of Illinois, where flags are still spotted waving in support of the former President. More than four months after the election, the Trump signs still on display in some front yards make clear that not all Republicans are searching for a new vision for the party. Elected to Congress a decade ago with the rise of the Tea Party, Kinzinger is now at odds \u2013 and increasingly out of step \u2013 with the driving movement of his party. He backed Trump in November, he said, a vote that he began to regret after Trump intensified his false claims that the election was fraudulent. By January 6, when the US Capitol was attacked and Kinzinger was among the members of Congress whose life was threatened, his regret had immensely deepened. \u201cKnowing what I know now?\u201d Kinsinger said. \u201cIf I could go back in time, I wouldn\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Of the 17 Republicans who supported impeachment in the House and Senate, Kinzinger stands alone as trying to use that vote as a rallying cry to persuade others to join him in turning the page from the Trump era. He is the face of a new super PAC, Americans Keeping Country First, which his allies formed to help other Republicans stand against Trump in the midterm elections. So far, his phone isn\u2019t exactly ringing off the hook. Yet he insists the journey is not as lonely as it may appear. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people on board. They\u2019re not just super public \u2013 especially in my business,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cI think a lot of folks are waiting to see where it goes. I don\u2019t blame them.\u201d Here in the sprawling Illinois 16th Congressional District, which stretches across 14 counties from the Wisconsin border, far beyond the western Chicago suburbs and back towards the Indiana line, Kinzinger outperformed Trump by 8 percentage points last fall. Illinois is poised to lose at least one congressional seat when district lines are redrawn later this year, raising the question of whether Kinzinger is going to be squeezed by state Republicans who have voiced their displeasure at his criticism of Trump. But even as he undoubtedly loses support among loyal Trump followers, he could be gaining a new look from other more moderate voters if his district is redrawn to include more of the suburbs near Chicago. The calculation of his re-election, he insists, is not why he\u2019s waging a very public fight for the future of the Republican Party. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t survive long in this job, the reality is, I will have been part of history,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cLike in warfare, until you\u2019re willing to put your life on the line \u2013 when you\u2019re willing to put your job on the line, then you\u2019re free.\u201d He paused for a moment, before adding: \u201cI think I\u2019ll survive. But if I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m at peace. But only in that understanding can you actually operate in truth.\u201d His congressional district includes the town of Dixon, the boyhood home of former President Ronald Reagan, who inspired a young Kinzinger. \u201cThat optimistic, powerful, moral clarity that he had,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of stuff that I think Americans are desperate for.\u201d Conversations with people in downtown Dixon on a recent morning were mixed. One business owner said he was furious at Kinzinger, whom he called \u201ca showoff.\u201d He declined to be identified because he said he feared it would hurt his business. A half-block away, another business owner took the opposite view and praised the congressman for standing up to Trump. He, too, feared being named because he said too many of his customers are diehard Trump admirers. Interviews with voters across the district, including here in his hometown about an hour southwest of Chicago, made clear that Kinzinger is making a name for himself \u2013 in ways good and bad. \u201cWhen he went along with the impeachment of Trump, I thought, what is this guy thinking?\u201d said Dick Tyler, a retiree who was having a late-afternoon beer, who voted for Trump. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad there is somebody like an Adam Kinzinger who has the courage to speak out. I know it\u2019s from his heart.\u201d Some people here described his vote \u2013 and his criticism of Trump \u2013 as brave. Others question out loud whether it was politically calculated. \u201cI was a little surprised with Kinzinger,\u201d said Jeff Phelps, as he left breakfast the other morning. \u201cI feel like you should be loyal to your party.\u201d His wife, Angie, added: \u201cI believe he\u2019s looking out for political gain for himself.\u201d Rick Cunningham, a science teacher who typically votes Republican, said he was proud that Kinzinger stood up to Trump and wishes more Republicans would follow suit. \u201cHe did what needed to be done. He took a stand for the Republican Party,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think anybody deserves to have 100 percent allegiance. There\u2019s got to be accountability for what Trump has done.\u201d A divide has emerged here among Republican officials, too. The LaSalle County Republican Party voted last month to censure Kinzinger, following a long list of local GOP organizations seeking to rein in their members of Congress who supported impeachment. \u201cIf Adam wants to be a Republican, then act and talk like one be a team player,\u201d Larry Smith, the county GOP chairman, said in an interview. \u201cI think he\u2019s seriously misjudged the nature of his district and the state in general.\u201d Yet in neighboring Grundy County, party chairman Aren Hansen and his committee rejected an attempt to rebuke the congressman. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anywhere as a party in Illinois if we have a party purity test at every turn. It\u2019s okay to disagree,\u201d Hansen said in an interview at the bar he owns, Honest Abe\u2019s Tap & Grill, which decorated to pay homage to one of the state\u2019s favorite Republican sons, Abraham Lincoln. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with his impeachment vote, but I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Yet Trump loyalties here \u2013 and in red districts and states across the country \u2013 run deep. And many Republicans don\u2019t believe their party is broken at all, a challenge that Kinzinger and others are confronting. \u201cI think part of saving the Republican Party is just being really clear about what the Republican Party has become,\u201d Kinzinger said, noting the legacies of Reagan and Lincoln in his state of Illinois. \u201cWe have such a great history, I think, but now we\u2019re off the rails.\u201d",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. \u201cNeanderthal thinking\u201d was President Joe Biden\u2019s unusually direct description of the decision by governors in Texas and Mississippi to prematurely end mask restrictions. The moves by the Republicans, Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas and Tate Reeves in Mississippi, came the day after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director pleaded with Americans and policymakers not to let up as infection rates fall and vaccination rates rise. \u201cI hope everybody\u2019s realized by now, these masks make a difference. We are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we\u2019re able to get vaccines in people\u2019s arms,\u201d Biden said when asked about the decisions by Abbott and Reeves. \u201cThe last thing \u2013 the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything\u2019s fine, take off your mask, forget it. It still matters,\u201d Biden told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office. What Abbott really meant was: An Abbott spokeswoman clarified Wednesday that the governor was not saying, by ending the mask mandate, that Texans should not wear masks. \u201cThe Governor was clear in telling Texans that COVID hasn\u2019t ended,\u201d his spokeswoman said. \u201cWe must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans.\u201d What medical advice did Abbott get? The truth may be more political maneuvering than Neanderthal thinking, which is more sinister. There are smart people in Texas who know better. The governor just didn\u2019t talk to them. That Abbott, still reeling from the power and water shortages that called his leadership into question last week, reportedly didn\u2019t consult his state\u2019s chief medical officer before ending the mask mandate makes it hard to see the decision as anything but political. Let their people go. Sen. John Cornyn rejected Biden\u2019s criticism and said Texans are ready to throw off the yoke of government intervention, if mask mandates can be considered onerous. \u201cAt some point, the government needs to quit making arbitrary rules that do not have any demonstrable connection with the public health,\u201d the Texas Republican said. Dude. Arbitrary? Recent CDC data suggests the most effective masking is double masking, or knotted masking, not optional masking. Here\u2019s their mask guidance. Read it. The list of people and corporations disagreeing with the end of mask mandates is long. Don\u2019t leave your mask at home yet. As CNN Business reports, masks won\u2019t exactly be going away. \u201cLeading US grocery chains, pharmacies, retailers and auto manufacturers, including Target (TGT),\u00a0Kroger\u00a0(KR),\u00a0CVS\u00a0(CVS),\u00a0Walgreens\u00a0(WBA), Best Buy (BBY), Macy\u2019s\u00a0(M)\u00a0JCPenney\u00a0(JCP),\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(TM),\u00a0GM\u00a0(GM) and others, say they will continue to require mask wearing at their stores and facilities by both employees and customers.\u201d \u201cThere are exceptions, however, and some business advocates are concerned that the end of these states\u2019 mask mandates will create new challenges for companies and their workers.\u201d Opening too soon. While it\u2019s easy to roll your eye at Abbott ending all restrictions and allowing businesses to open at will, it\u2019s also completely legitimate to wonder where the right place is. Texas will allow all businesses of any type to open 100%.\u00a0In many other places in the country, any sort of indoor dining and exercise is prohibited. Taking so long to open. In my neighborhood in Virginia, parents are looking at the possibility of sending their kids to in-person public school for the first time in a year after the governor issued an order requiring schools to open by March 15. Arizona\u2019s governor issued a similar order Wednesday. The details border on farce. It appears my two elementary schoolers will go to school two days a week, but they\u2019ll be getting virtual instruction there either from teachers not returning in person or teachers in different rooms. My middle schooler\u2019s teachers are split in half between those returning and those staying virtual. He may get some in-person instruction, but since the school district is hewing strictly to the CDC\u2019s guidance on 6 feet of separation for children, he may be getting instruction from a teacher streaming from a different room in the school. It won\u2019t be the grand return to school any of the 40% of students who opted for in-person instruction might have envisioned. Vaccine priorities. Virginia has been vaccinating teachers for weeks, although many in our district are not returning. I was flabbergasted to see Wednesday that Texas announced it would prioritize teachers only after the governor announced the end of restrictions on businesses. Texas reality vs. Virginia reality. I went to CNN\u2019s superstar Dallas-based national correspondent Ed Lavandera to ask not only about Abbott\u2019s move, but also what he\u2019s seen in his travels this year. Our conversation is below. WHAT MATTERS: What\u2019s going to be the practical effect of this order by Gov. Abbott on Texans and Texas businesses? LAVANDERA: The governor\u2019s executive order ends all the restrictions and operating limits placed on businesses during the coronavirus pandemic starting on Wednesday, March 10. Gov. Greg Abbott is essentially shifting the burden and responsibility of enforcing medical guidelines over social distancing and mask wearing. Businesses will now be allowed to operate at full capacity but can still require employees and customers to follow public health safety measures, like mask wearing. The governor has made clear in the last year that local jurisdictions at the county and city level do not have the authority to issue stricter public health measures, which has caused tension between many city leaders and the governor. However, the latest executive order does say counties can tighten business restrictions, in a limited capacity, if the hospitalization rate reaches a specific threshold. (If the number of Covid-19 patients in a hospital region reaches more than 15% of total capacity for seven straight days, then the restrictions can be implemented.) A big question mark moving forward is how will the public respond? When Abbott started reopening the state last spring and issued the mask mandate last summer, there was great confusion over enforcement and many businesses were put in a tough place. We\u2019ll be watching closely to see how businesses that choose to require masks will deal with customers who refuse to wear them. WHAT MATTERS: The view from here in Washington is that Texas is a state rapidly changing from deep red to purple. Do those changes factor into how Texans have viewed Covid restrictions and mask requirements? LAVANDERA: The pandemic has exposed the growing divide between the Democratic leadership in the most populated cities in Texas (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin) and the conservative Republican officials fully in control of state government. Texas is a rapidly growing state that\u2019s seen its population explode to roughly 29 million. The myth is that these new transplants are making the state more liberal, but in my conversations with political observers that\u2019s a questionable theory. It\u2019s not a purple state, yet. When you drive around the state, as I have extensively for the last year, there is a clear divide in how politics has clouded perceptions of the medical guidelines during this pandemic. Gov. Abbott is leaning heavily into the idea that government should not be telling businesses and people how to do things. That sentiment plays well with a large segment of the population. The governor said during the reopening announcement that \u201cTexans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting Covid.\u201d That\u2019s quite a statement in a state that has seen 2.6 million cases and 44,000 deaths. But the governor\u2019s decision has left many local leaders, especially in the state\u2019s biggest cities, dumbfounded by his push to ease pandemic restrictions so soon. WHAT MATTERS: There are reports Abbott didn\u2019t consult all of his medical advisers, which only amplifies the feeling that this is a political decision by a governor already struggling after the power and water fiasco. LAVANDERA: The way Gov. Abbott rolled out this decision is a revealing window into the political forces at play. Instead of calling a news conference in Austin and taking questions from reporters on the intricacies of how this reopening would roll out, Gov. Abbott announced the reopening of the Texas economy at a restaurant in the West Texas town of Lubbock surrounded by a political friendly crowd. He took no questions. Gov. Abbott faces a difficult political reality. On the left, Democrats have been inspired by big gains at the local level and the surprising performance by Beto O\u2019Rourke in the 2018 Senate race against Ted Cruz. (Although that excitement has been tempered to some extent by Donald Trump\u2019s performance in the 2020 presidential election.) Those big city leaders have pushed for more government-led efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. And on the right, Gov. Abbott has received a great deal of heat and pushback from the most right-wing, Trump-like elements of the Republican Party in Texas. These are the conservative voices that have opposed the governor\u2019s pandemic restrictions on businesses and lampooned mask wearing. Gov. Abbott finds himself in the middle of those political winds and there is talk that a more conservative figure could challenge him in the 2022 gubernatorial primary. An old Texas progressive activist named Jim Hightower once wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\u201d No politician wants to be the armadillo. We won\u2019t know the toll these restrictions will have on US communities for some time. States are looking at extreme revenue shortfalls, which could affect funding for schools, roads and all sorts of projects for years. The first year of the pandemic was not as devastating on state coffers as expected, probably because of federal aid to businesses and the unemployed. Now Democrats want to keep the spigot of federal money running, although what they can pass through the Senate remains very much in question. Republicans, now in the minority at the federal level, are looking to move on from Covid. Fewer will get checks with Senate bill. Democrats in the Senate and the White House have agreed to a more narrowly targeted set of stimulus checks and will cut out couples making more than $160,000 and individuals making more than $80,000 per year. Those additional families would have gotten partial payments under the House plan. People need health insurance. There have been hundreds of thousands of sign-ups for Obamacare exchanges during a special enrollment period ordered by Biden. Pence was targeted by rioters! But he\u2019s not rejecting the big lie. Pence pushes false election fraud claims in denouncing Democratic reform bill First look\u00a0 \u2013 The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022. Writes CNN\u2019s Simone Pathe: This cycle, only one senator is running for reelection in a state carried by the opposite party\u2019s 2020 presidential candidate: GOP Sen. Ron Johnson. His Wisconsin seat is the third most likely to flip, but the two-term senator is the most vulnerable Republican incumbent. Unsatisfactory \u2013 Lawmakers raise concerns over reports of National Guard troops being served \u2018raw, moldy food\u2019 at Capitol New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologizes again. He had spent a week away from cameras. This is going to be hard to achieve. Biden\u2019s energy secretary vows to \u2018leave no worker behind\u2019 in the clean energy revolution Why is the National Guard still camped out at the Capitol? Conspiracy theorists think March 4 is the real Inauguration Day \u2013 it was, until the 20th Amendment changed things. There\u2019s chatter online that has authorities concerned.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump delivered his first major post-presidential speech on Sunday, an address to the Conservative Political Action Conference laden with falsehoods and attacks on his fellow Republicans \u2013 suggesting absolutely nothing has changed since he ceased being president on January 20. I went through the speech and pulled out the lines you need to see. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cDo you miss me yet? Do you miss me?\u201d At root, Trump wants to be loved. Forever. And away we go! 2. \u201cI stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we\u2019ve begun together, we went through a journey like nobody else. There\u2019s never been a journey like it.\u201d Never been a journey that incredible? Um, these two dogs and a cat would disagree. 3. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of winning.\u201d During Trump\u2019s four years, Republicans lost the House majority, the Senate majority and the White House. 4. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting new parties. You know, they kept saying, he\u2019s going to start a brand new party. We have the Republican Party. It\u2019s going to unite and be stronger than ever before. I am not starting a new party.\u201d Some news! Trump says he won\u2019t start a Trump-centric third party! Of course, if you think he might not change his mind about that, well, you must have missed the last four years. 5. \u201cLet\u2019s start a new party and let\u2019s divide our vote so that you can never win. No, we\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d He\u2019s right. A third party led by Trump would doom Republicans. 6. \u201cMr. McLaughlin just gave me numbers that nobody\u2019s ever heard of before, more popular than anybody. That\u2019s all of us. It\u2019s all of us.\u201d OK, so Trump\u2019s pollster \u2013 John McLaughlin \u2013 gave him numbers before coming on stage that said he was \u201cmore popular than anybody\u201d? Like, in the universe? 7. \u201cI came here and he was giving me 95%, 97%, 92%.\u201d 97% what? Approval? Also, is it 92 or 97? Or 95? 8. \u201cHis campaign was all lies.\u201d Fact check: Trump delivers lie-filled CPAC speech Trump, ironically, is talking about Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign here. 9. \u201cHe wants windmills, the windmills \u2026 the windmills that don\u2019t work when you need \u2018em.\u201d Trump has been consistent about very few things in his life. His hatred of windmills is one of them. 10. \u201cWe had built almost 500 miles of great border wall that helped us with these numbers because once it\u2019s up \u2013 you know, they used to say, \u2018A wall doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d The total amount of new wall built on our southern border by Trump? About 80 miles, according to the BBC. 11. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, considering that the Democrats\u2019 No. 1 priority was to make sure that the wall would never, ever get built, would never, ever happen, would never get financed. We got it financed.\u201d [narrator voice] Mexico didn\u2019t pay for it. 12. \u201cCovid-19, or as I call it, the China virus.\u201d The CPAC crowd cheered and applauded after this. Which tells you everything you need to know. 13. \u201cActually, as you know, they just lost the White House. But it\u2019s one of those things.\u201d Biden won 306 electoral votes. He also beat Trump in the popular vote by more than 7 million. So, yeah. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 14. \u201cBut who knows? Who knows? I may even decide to beat them for a third time, OK? For a third time.\u201d Well, he didn\u2019t beat \u201cthem\u201d twice. Also, a Trump 2024 candidacy would be hard to stop for Republicans and a very likely general election loss. 15. \u201cThey are not giving us their best and their finest. Remember I said that. I said that a long time ago when I made the first remarks, when I came down the escalator with our great future first lady.\u201d Remember when Republicans insisted that Trump was disqualified after he said that Mexico was sending people \u201cbringing drugs \u2026 bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d? Yeah, now he is touting that he was right. 16. \u201cWho loves you as much as I love you?\u201d I\u2019m the man who loves you \u2013 Donald Trump, basically 17. \u201cWe have to stand tall as the party for law-abiding Americans, and others, when they are in our country.\u201d \u201cWe love you. You are very special.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump to violent rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6. 18. \u201cSome say it\u2019s the greatest thing to happen in hundreds of years, hundreds of years. Two vaccines produced in record time with numerous others on the way, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that was approved just yesterday.\u201d Donald Trump is taking credit for the production of the Covid-19 vaccine. And, no, he is (still) not an epidemiologist or a virologist or, um, a medical doctor at all. 19. \u201cWhat the Trump administration has done with vaccines has, in many respects, perhaps saved large portions of the world, not only our country but large portions of the world.\u201d Well, modesty has never been a Trump trait \u2026 20. \u201cJoe Biden is only implementing the plan that we put in place.\u201d Trump said his administration would distribute 40 million Covid-19 vaccines before he left office. He, um, didn\u2019t do it. 21.\u201dBy the time I left that magnificent house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, almost 20 million Americans had already been vaccinated.\u201d Except that he said 40 million would be vaccinated. And, as The Washington Post noted, Trump\u2019s administration didn\u2019t even deliver 20 million vaccines until January 7. 22. \u201cYour Second Amendment is in far bigger trouble than you know. And for four years, I fought like hell to save your Second Amendment, and we saved it 100%.\u201d Biden has called for an end to the gun show loophole and a ban on assault weapons. Which does not suggest the 2nd Amendment is about to be abolished. 23. \u201cI will tell you something and I said, had we had a fair election, the results would have been much different.\u201d There is zero evidence that the 2020 election was fraudulent or stolen. None. 24. \u201cWe went to CPAC, remember last, I said we are going to watch the President, well, Alice, the wind isn\u2019t blowing, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have any electricity. Remember we would \u2013 we would kid. But I wasn\u2019t actually kidding. It\u2019s such an expensive form of energy. It\u2019s so bad for the environment. It kills the birds. It destroys the landscapes.\u201d He really, really hates windmills. Here\u2019s why. 25. \u201cWe won the election twice. I mean, you know, think about it \u2026\u201d I thought about it. Trump still lost to Biden in 2020. 26. \u201cThat\u2019s why the party is growing so rapidly and is becoming a different party.\u201d \u201cSpurred By The Capitol Riot, Thousands Of Republicans Drop Out Of GOP\u201d \u2013 NPR, 2/1/2021 27. \u201cMany people have asked what is \u2018Trumpism\u2019 \u2026 What it means is great deals, great trade deals, great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, our money, like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made. And we ended it.\u201d So, if I look up \u201cTrumpism\u201d in the dictionary, this then is the definition: \u201cGreat deals, great trade deals, great ones, not deals where we give away everything, our jobs, our money, like the USMCA replacement of the horrible NAFTA. NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made, probably the worst trade deal ever made. And we ended it.\u201d Er, OK? 28. \u201cIt means no riots in the streets. It means law enforcement.\u201d Uh\u2026 29. \u201cOn top of all that, we have even created the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military in nearly 75 years.\u201d Mars Awaits! 30. \u201cThe mission of the Democrat Party is to promote socialism.\u201d \u201cI beat the socialist. That\u2019s how I got elected. That\u2019s how I got the nomination. Do I look like a socialist? Look at my career \u2014 my whole career. I am not a socialist.\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden, September 2020. 31. \u201cWe started hearing \u2018we love you\u2019 and I asked somebody, you know, because we really liked Ronald Reagan, right? We had others. But I said, did anybody ever say that to Ronald Reagan or to any of our great? And to the best of all of these political professionals\u2019 knowledge and pollsters, nobody has ever heard that chant before, Matt. So, it\u2019s an honor.\u201d Trump is saying here that his are the first rallies where people yelled and chanted \u201cI love you.\u201d Yes, seriously. 32. \u201cWhen you think about it, we love you, you are saying that about \u2013 I hate to say it. Am I a politician? I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m a politician.\u201d Trump unleashes new threat to American democracy [confused face emoji] 33. \u201cWe believe in law and order. And we believe that the men and women of law enforcement are heroes who truly deserve our absolute support.\u201d Quick reminder: Trump told rioters who beat and taunted Capitol Police officers on January 6 that he loved them and that they were very special. 34. \u201cWe can never let this or other abuses of the 2020 election be repeated or happen again. Can never let that happen again.\u201d Again, zero evidence of any widespread fraud in the 2020 election. None. 35. \u201cRepublicans should be the party of honest elections that can give everyone confidence in the future of our country.\u201d \u201cSo look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, in a January phone call with Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. 36. \u201cThis election was rigged. And the Supreme Court and other courts didn\u2019t want to do anything about it.\u201d The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority and three justices appointed by Trump? That one? Man, rigged! 37. \u201cAnd the only people that should be allowed to vote by mail are people that can be proven to be either very sick or out of the country or military where they can\u2019t do it. One day.\u201d Trump cast a ballot via mail in the 2020 election. And he was not \u201cvery sick or out of the country or military where they can\u2019t do it.\u201d 38. \u201cYou know, we have a little problem adjusting in Detroit. We seem to have more votes than we have people \u2013 a lot more votes, an election-changing number.\u201d Nope! 39. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a number where you \u2013 no, these are election-changing numbers. In Pennsylvania, they had hundreds of thousands of more votes than they had people voting.\u201d Also, nope! 40. \u201cWe cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country.\u201d Wait, aren\u2019t Democrats \u201cfellow Americans\u201d too? 41. \u201cThe Democrats don\u2019t have grandstanders like Mitt Romney, little Ben Sasse, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Toomey \u2013 and in the House, Tom Rice, South Carolina, Adam Kinzinger, Dan Newhouse, Anthony Gonzalez, that\u2019s another beauty, Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Peter Meijer, John Katko, David Valadao, and of course, the warmonger, a person that loves seeing our troops fighting, Liz Cheney. How about that?\u201d Oh no, he\u2019s not bitter. Just listing off all the Republicans who voted for his impeachment. All good! Water under the bridge! 42. \u201cWhen you look at the crowds outside that want your seats so badly, they will take your seat in two seconds. They want your seat. Congratulations.\u201d Trump takes a pause from bashing Republicans to note that anyone who leaves in the audience is immediately replaced by someone else. Because he is so popular. I mean, this guy invented people yelling \u201cI love you\u201d at political rallies! 43. \u201c[Mitch McConnell] asked for my endorsement \u2013 brought him from one point down to 20 points up. And he won his race in the great state \u2013 and, actually, the great Commonwealth of Kentucky.\u201d Patently false. 44. \u201cBecause of my efforts campaigning, we had huge gains in the House. And I helped keep many senators in their seats \u2013 and they will admit it \u2013 so that it\u2019s now 50-50, instead of Republicans being down anywhere from eight to 10 seats.\u201d Worth noting: Republicans lost the House majority in 2018. And the Senate majority in 2020. 45. \u201cI got more votes \u2013 I got more \u2013 and which is me \u2013 when I say \u2018I,\u2019 I\u2019m talking about we. We \u2013 we got more votes than any incumbent, any incumbent president in the history of our country, almost 75 million votes.\u201d Trump got 74,222,960 votes. Which is a lot! But not as many as the 81,283,361 Biden got. 46. \u201cWell, we won the second. We did much better. It\u2019s, sort of, strange, right?\u201d [narrator voice] He didn\u2019t. 47. \u201cThanks to my coattails, Democrats failed to flip a single state legislature \u2013 think of it \u2013 or a legislative chamber.\u201d Coattails are a thing that happens when you win. Trump did not win. 48. \u201cWhen you talk about \u2013 they probably have them going because they also care about ratings, but when they talk about election, they turn off the cameras. You know why? It\u2019s a very sore subject, OK? They don\u2019t like that subject.\u201d So, if the media turn off their cameras when Trump talks about the 2020 election, how do we have so much footage of this speech? It\u2019s a miracle! 49. \u201cHistory will show that this was the moment when we could have given up, when we could have despaired, but instead, we chose to keep on pushing forward. The greater the challenge and tougher the task, the more determined we must be to pull through to triumph. We have to have triumph. We have to have victory.\u201d Certainly sounds like he isn\u2019t going to quietly recede into the background\u2026 50. \u201cAnd then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be. I wonder who that will be. Who, who, who will that be, I wonder?\u201d Yeah, this feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump will speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, next Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter, while former Vice President Mike Pence declined an invitation to speak at the conference, two sources told CNN. One source said organizers still hope to change Pence\u2019s mind about attending, while another source said Pence is planning to stay under the radar for the next six months. Politico first reported that Pence declined the invitation. The divergence between the two former leaders, which comes as the GOP is grappling with its future in the wake of the Trump presidency, follows tensions between Trump and Pence surrounding the January 6 riot at the US Capitol and Pence\u2019s role certifying the results of the election for President Joe Biden. \u201cWe accept Joe Biden is the duly elected president of the United States,\u201d former Pence chief of staff Marc Short told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on \u201cNewsroom\u201d Saturday evening, despite Pence playing a role in perpetuating baseless election fraud theories that Trump repeatedly pushed ahead of the attack on the Capitol. Unlike Trump, Pence attended Biden\u2019s inauguration in Washington, DC, last month \u2013 after skipping Trump\u2019s farewell ceremony. Short said Saturday that Trump and Pence \u201cdeparted amicably\u201d and that they\u2019ve spoken since. The source familiar with Trump\u2019s plans to attend CPAC, who is also familiar with the former President\u2019s speech, told CNN on Saturday that \u201che\u2019ll be talking about the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\u201d \u201cAlso look for the 45th President to take on President Biden\u2019s disastrous amnesty and border policies,\u201d the source added. The speaking engagement would mark Trump\u2019s first public appearance following his departure from the White House last month and comes as senior Republicans are split over how to treat the former President, with his loyalists paying him visits recently in Florida. One of Trump\u2019s campaign managers, Brad Parscale, met with the former President at his club in Mar-a-Lago this week for a lengthy meeting, according to a source familiar. Utah Sen. Mike Lee is holding a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago Saturday night, according to another source familiar, a potential sign of more visits to come. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, met privately with Trump on Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago, CNN reported, the day before Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed never to do so. The simmering feud between Trump and McConnell has escalated in recent days, raising questions about whether the two can ever work together for the future of the GOP. Trump went after McConnell in a lengthy statement released Tuesday night after McConnell harshly criticized the former President from the Senate floor last Saturday and in an op-ed on Monday in the Wall Street Journal, despite voting to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial. In his Tuesday statement, Trump vowed to endorse candidates in Senate primaries who espouse his world view \u2013 something that could lead to a clash with McConnell\u2019s preferred candidates as the seven-term senator pushes Republicans whom he believes stand the best chance of winning in next year\u2019s midterm elections. That tension underscores the divide among top Republicans over how to navigate the party post-Trump. Unlike McConnell, House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy went down to South Florida after the January 6 attack on the Capitol to meet with Trump and later proclaim unity with him in trying to take back the House in 2022. But McCarthy leads a conference where a majority of members are strongly supportive of Trump \u2013 unlike Senate Republicans, who are split over the former President and where some top leaders are eager to move past him and focus instead on uniting the party around ideas, not a person. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Kaitlan Collins and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Republican congresswoman who triggered a surprise call for witnesses in the waning hours of former President Donald Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial has logged a decade in Congress \u2013 at times breaking from her party and standing up to Trump. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state on Saturday was at the center of House impeachment managers\u2019 push to call witnesses in the Senate proceedings, following revelations that she had kept \u201ccopious notes\u201d about a call between Trump and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy on the day of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Herrera Beutler and other Republicans briefed on the conversation had confirmed to CNN that Trump commented the would-be insurrectionists cared more about the election results than McCarthy. The congresswoman was ready to testify had she been called to, according to her spokesman, but House managers and Trump\u2019s legal team ultimately agreed to insert a statement from the congresswoman into the trial record, rather than pushing for a deposition. Despite causing a stir in Saturday\u2019s proceedings, the moderate Republican congresswoman has kept a relatively low profile during her time on Capitol Hill. Six takeaways from Trump's impeachment trial Herrera Beutler has served Washington\u2019s 3rd Congressional District since 2011 and has held onto her seat for the past decade, being reelected to a sixth term in 2020. She worked as a staffer for Washington GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and she also served in Washington\u2019s state House for about three years before being elected to Congress at the age of 31. As a young mother and one of the few women in the Republican conference \u2013 and one of the even fewer Republican women of color in Congress \u2013 Herrera Beutler has championed maternal care and children health care issues and co-founded the Maternity Care Caucus, focused on pushing legislation to help mothers. She sponsored two pieces of legislation \u2013 both signed into law \u2013 to prevent maternal mortalities and provide children with \u201cmedically complex\u201d conditions on Medicaid with improved access to care and treatments. Another measure she backed required the Transportation Security Administration to better accommodate parents traveling with breast milk and feeding equipment. Shortly after her reelection in 2012 to a second term in Congress, Herrera Beutler announced she was pregnant with her first child, who had been diagnosed with a fatal condition. Her daughter Abigail was the first baby to survive childbirth with no kidneys. How Rep. Herrera Beutler saved her baby Though Herrera Beutler had largely voted in line with Trump\u2019s priorities, she did occasionally break with the former President and the GOP. In 2017, despite supporting the repeal of Obamacare, she opposed the Republican\u2019s health care bill because, she said, the \u201cdifficulties this bill would create for millions of children\u201d who rely on Medicaid for health care \u201cwere left unaddressed.\u201d She was one of 13 House Republicans who rebuked Trump\u2019s declaration in 2019 of a national emergency to build his border wall, according to Roll Call. And in 2016 she publicly denounced Trump over lewd comments revealed in the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video and said she would instead write in former House Speaker Paul Ryan. Still, she told the Seattle Times that she would support Trump in 2020, citing his tax cuts and other economic policies. Just a week after the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill, Herrera Beutler was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. The congresswoman faced backlash in her home state for her vote. On Saturday, Democratic senators along with five Republicans voted to allow witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, with the House impeachment managers seeking to call Herrera Beutler as a witness. But shortly after, the Senate reversed course, and Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, read Herrera Beutler\u2019s statement into the trial record. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing intense backlash for indicating support for political violence and pushing wild conspiracy theories and extreme anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments before she was elected to Congress. The House voted Thursday evening to remove Greene from her committee assignments. On Wednesday, GOP House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republican Conference declined to take action against the freshman Republican for her violent endorsements and incendiary comments. A CNN KFile review of both newly-uncovered and previously reported comments highlight the fringe nature of what Greene shared on and offline. House to vote on removing Marjorie Taylor Greene from committee assignments Greene defended herself ahead of the House vote in a floor speech Thursday as she tried to distance herself from her past conspiracy comments. After Greene saw \u201cthings in the news that didn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d she said she \u201cstumbled across\u201d QAnon at the end of 2017. She became \u201cvery interested\u201d in the theory and began posting about it on Facebook because she \u201cwas upset about things\u201d and felt she could not trust the government. \u201cThe problem with that is, though, is I was allowed to believe things that weren\u2019t true, and I would ask questions about them and talk about them, and that is absolutely what I regret,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if it weren\u2019t for the Facebook posts and comments that I liked in 2018, I wouldn\u2019t be standing here today and you couldn\u2019t point a finger and accuse me of anything wrong,\u201d continued Greene, who went on to blame the media, including CNN, for her comments. Here are some of the most extreme things Greene has done: As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians \u2013 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry \u2013 and FBI agents in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress. Greene created a White House petition to impeach Pelosi for \u201ctreason\u201d after Pelosi did not vote to fund former President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall in 2019. In newly found posts from 2019, she also wrote a \u201cpress release\u201d and a previously unreported blog post promoting the petition and suggested that Pelosi could be executed for treason. In other newly-uncovered tweets and posts, Greene also liked a call to put Pelosi to death. In one tweet, she said she hoped Pelosi would lose her memory sitting in prison. Greene, in a statement, did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,\u201d Greene said in a statement last week. CNN previously reported that Greene posted on her candidate Facebook page in September 2020 an image of herself holding a gun alongside images of Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. The caption encouraged going on the \u201coffense against these socialists\u201d and was interpreted by observers as a threat against the politicians. The Facebook post was taken down for violating its policies. Greene\u2019s campaign told CNN in an emailed statement in September 2020 that those who think the picture incites violence \u201care paranoid and ridiculous.\u201d In other videos from 2019 and 2020, respectively, Greene encouraged protesters \u201cto flood the Capitol\u201d and endorsed political violence to defend freedom. \u201cThe only way you get your freedoms back is it\u2019s earned with the price of blood,\u201d she said in the video from 2020. While she was a congresswoman-elect and a sitting congresswoman this January, Greene fanned the flames of the Capitol insurrection by encouraging the big lie that Trump, and not Joe Biden, won the election and objected to the election certification process. Greene later denounced the violence at the Capitol but falsely blamed it on \u201cBLM/Antifa violence\u201d in a statement. Before she ran for Congress, Greene embraced violent, fringe conspiracies. Chief among them was the QAnon conspiracy theory \u2013 a discredited conspiracy that pits former President Trump in an imagined battle against a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child-abusing Democrats and celebrities \u2013 though in August 2020 she tried to distance herself from QAnon and claimed that \u201cit doesn\u2019t represent me.\u201d One of the most disturbing violent conspiracies Greene engaged with in May 2018 is the \u201cFrazzledrip\u201d conspiracy, which exists deep within conspiracy rabbit hole. The conspiracy baselessly contends that Hillary Clinton and former Clinton aide Huma Abedin were videotaped sexually assaulting a child and then ripping off the child\u2019s face to wear as a mask in a Satanic blood sacrifice. The theory then alleges that Clinton ordered an assassination hit against the police officer who found the footage, named \u201cFrazzledrip,\u201d according to reporting from Media Matters. Greene also peddled in 2017 the debunked \u201cClinton Kill List\u201d or \u201cClinton Body Count\u201d conspiracy, which alleges the Clintons have assassinated their associates. She spread false conspiracies the Clintons were involved in sextrafficking and peddled the cruel conspiracy that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was not killed during an attempted robbery but murdered by Democratic actors. CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported that Greene in 2017 peddled the \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy, a debunked conspiracy alleging that Clinton and other Democratic Party leaders were running a human-trafficking and pedophilia ring out of a pizzeria in Washington, DC. In a blog post, she suggested that the White supremacist rally held in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, that killed one woman was an \u201cinside job\u201d to \u201cfurther the agenda of the elites.\u201d Greene also endorsed 9/11 trutherism conspiracies and falsely claimed there was no evidence a plane crashed into the Pentagon, according to reporting from Media Matters. After facing backlash from her plane comments, Greene said in August 2020, \u201cSome people claimed a missile hit the Pentagon. I now know that is not correct. The problem is our government lies to us so much to protect the Deep State, it\u2019s hard sometimes to know what is real and what is not.\u201d In her floor speech on Thursday, Greene said, \u201c9/11 absolutely happened. I remember that day, crying all day long, watching it on the news. And it\u2019s a tragedy for anyone to say it didn\u2019t happen. So that I definitely want to tell you all, I do not believe it\u2019s fake.\u201d While Greene peddled violent conspiracy theories online, she often speculated if real-world violent events were part of a deeper conspiracy and were actually false flag operations, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups. In 2018, she questioned whether the Parkland shooting that killed 17 people was a planned event and called Parkland survivor and activist David Hogg a \u201cpaid actor.\u201d In a recently surfaced video from March 2019, Greene follows Hogg as he walks toward the US Capitol and can be heard making false and baseless claims as she asks him a series of questions related to gun rights and how he was able to meet with senators. Hogg continues to walk without addressing Greene. At the end of the video, Greene calls Hogg a \u201ccoward\u201d and claimed Hogg\u2019s activism was funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is often the subject of far-right conspiracy theories, and other liberals. \u201cHe can\u2019t say one word because he can\u2019t defend his stance,\u201d she said. In another video, she mocked Hogg as an \u201cidiot\u201d who \u201conly talks when he is scripted.\u201d Greene also supported Facebook comments from 2018 that alleged the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed six adults and 20 children was a \u201cstaged\u201d event. She mused on Facebook whether the 2017 Las Vegas massacre \u2013 the deadliest mass shooting event in the United States that killed 58 people \u2013 was part of a massive conspiracy to enact gun control, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution report. Greene walked back her comments to the AJC and said she was only expressing bewilderment. In a statement posted on Twitter following intense backlash to some of her comments, Greene acknowledged that 17 people died in the Parkland shooting and blamed \u201cgun free\u201d zones at schools for the tragedy. After live bombs were sent to Democratic politicians and CNN in October 2018, Greene repeatedly liked and agreed with multiple comments that the terrorist act was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by Democrats. In one little-remembered Facebook post from September 2018, Greene claimed that the mythical figure \u201cQ\u201d \u2013 whom Greene had previously called a \u201cpatriot\u201d \u2013warned of false flags for school shootings. She then questioned if a shooting at Kennesaw State University in Georgia that killed one person was \u201ca failed op? What about hearing voices? Mental illness? Demon possession? Or military grade intelligence developed weapons like Voice of God technology,\u201d which refers to a government-controlled device implanted in a person\u2019s head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, but I do believe all three of those exist,\u201d she wrote. Greene made similar unreported comments about the \u201cVoice of God\u201d conspiracy on Twitter in 2018. In her floor speech Thursday, Greene affirmed that \u201cschool shootings are absolutely real and every child that is lost, those families mourn it.\u201d On and offline, Greene frequently engaged with extreme anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Some of the targets of her comments included her future colleagues in the House of Representatives, like Tlaib and Omar, and Obama, who Greene falsely said is Muslim. \u201cThese are women that really would like to see Sharia in America,\u201d Greene said in one since-deleted Facebook video, captured by CNN. Sharia refers to Islamic law, which is interpreted from the religious text of the Quran, and encompasses marriage, divorce, inheritance and punishments for criminal offenses. \u201cAnd as an American woman, as a business owner, as a mother, I have two daughters \u2013 I never want to see Sharia in America. And so I really want to go talk to these ladies and ask them what they are thinking and why they\u2019re serving in our American government. They really should go back to the Middle East if they support Sharia. So let\u2019s go talk to them. Definitely want to go talk to them.\u201d In a 2018 Facebook comment, captured by CNN, Greene responded \u201ctruth,\u201d to a comment comparing Obama to terrorist Osama bin Laden. The comment came in response to a post where Greene said the Obama presidency was \u201cflooding our country and government with Muslims that don\u2019t like our American ways!!!!!\u201d In another video from 2019, saved by CNN\u2019s KFile, Greene spoke about going into Omar\u2019s and Tlaib\u2019s offices and saying all Muslims want to take away women\u2019s rights. \u201cDid you see the part where we went into Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib\u2019s office?\u201d Greene said. \u201cI was like, so are you going to make me live under Sharia law? And I\u2019m an American woman. Are you going to take away my equal rights?\u201d \u201cThey would in a heartbeat,\u201d responds another rally participant. \u201cYeah,\u201d Greene responded. \u201cThey all, all, all Muslims. That\u2019s the goal of Islam. The goal of Islam is Sharia, and they want to conquer. They want to conquer America and we\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d Greene directed anti-Muslim rhetoric at the American Muslim Women Political Action Committee in 2018. \u201cWtf is their mission??? To make sure every women is dominated by Islam, is covered in sheets, loses our freedoms, and has to have our vaginas mutilated???,\u201d she wrote in 2018 on Facebook. Greene then liked a comment that the PAC was an \u201cinvasion\u201d of our government. In another instance, Greene liked a comment saying \u201cWe don\u2019t need gun control! We need Muslim control!\u201d In 2018, she liked a tweet from an account that pushes anti-Semitic conspiracies suggesting intelligence services for the nation of Israel killed President John F. Kennedy. In another post from 2018, Greene wrote a theory that the deadly wildfires in California that year were caused by a laser from space, possibly controlled by the Rothschild investment bank. The Rothschilds are frequent targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Greene has also called Soros, the Democratic donor and philanthropist, a \u201cNazi\u201d and peddled a conspiracy that Soros is a Jew who \u201cturned in his own people over to the Nazis\u201d; Soros is a Holocaust survivor. This story has been updated to reflect the House\u2019s vote to remove Greene from her committee assignments.",

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden was ticking through a litany of grievances with his Russian counterpart on Tuesday, it wasn\u2019t only his tone that made for a departure from his predecessor. Even his location marked a major difference: Instead of speaking with foreign leaders this week from his third-floor private residence, as President Donald Trump often did to avoid prying ears, Biden made the call from the Oval Office, talking points in hand and advisers listening in. Entering a global scene upended by ego-driven tumult, Biden is hoping to return American diplomacy to a state of normalcy. His conversations with roughly a half-dozen leaders this week have hewed heavily toward amiable chats after four years of strain, with touchier topics left for later. French President Emmanuel Macron eschewed his translator to speak in English. German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered a quick invitation for a visit before she retires in the fall.     Even Biden\u2019s one interaction with a global adversary, Russian President Vladimir Putin, appeared predictable and businesslike, according to those briefed on it, unlike the often-surprising and sometimes secret conversations Trump carried out with the same person over the past four years. Putin himself seemed to fully anticipate the onslaught, according to a senior administration official, including Biden\u2019s warning that new sanctions may be in the offing. \u201cHe knew exactly what was coming,\u201d the official said of Putin\u2019s reaction to Biden\u2019s laundry list of contentious issues, from hacking to Ukraine to the poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, whose release from detention Biden demanded. Biden\u2019s call with Putin was kept buttoned-up before, during and after it happened, with security and preparation measures harkening back to the pre-Trump era, according to officials. The President\u2019s tough talk on a range of issues signaled the abrupt readoption of long-standing US policies had fallen fell by the wayside over the past four years. It also hinted at a renewed emphasis on protocol in the early days of the Biden administration, an extension of his concerted effort to restore a sense of normalcy to the presidency. Blinken to State Dept. staff: 'It's a new day for America; it's a new day for the world' Each of Biden\u2019s calls with world leaders this week has hewed to the same plan, according to officials familiar with the calls who described them to CNN. Unlike his predecessor, virtually all of Biden\u2019s calls have happened in the Oval Office. Trump liked to phone his counterparts from the Treaty Room of the residence, with only one or two senior aides in attendance as others were patched in from the Situation Room or sensitive facilities. For Biden, there were briefing binders and talking points, calls-before-the-call and a note-taker standing ready. When the prescribed hour arrived and the line was connected, an operator in the White House Situation Room patched it through to the Oval Office. A red light started to blink on one of the two black telephones positioned on the Resolute Desk. An aide tapped it and announced: \u201cYou are now on speakerphone with President Biden.\u201d Sitting in the Oval Office with a black pen in hand and a carefully crafted script in front of him, Biden has mostly been calling just to break the ice. His talks have so far lacked the freewheeling banter and open hostility that became a hallmark of Trump\u2019s early calls with foreign leaders \u2013 and in the past colored some of Biden\u2019s own interactions with his international interlocutors. While Trump restricted the number of officials allowed to listen in on his phone calls, Biden has not, a person familiar with the process said. Aides with specific expertise in the countries or officials focused on an issue set being discussed on the call listened in or were provided with transcripts following the calls. These officials are empowered to do their jobs as usual, the person told CNN. The return to a relatively predictable manner of interacting with foreign leaders comes as a relief to officials across the government, some of whom viewed Trump\u2019s unpredictable encounters with heads of state a potential national security threat. When he did place calls from the West Wing during the earliest days of his presidency, Trump was often surrounded by political advisers such as Steve Bannon. A now-infamous photo of his first phone call with Putin showed Bannon along with chief of staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, press secretary Sean Spicer and national security adviser Michael Flynn huddled around Trump\u2019s desk, littered with papers and folders and a glass of Diet Coke. With Putin and most other leaders, Trump discarded the talking points that had been planned for him by officials, choosing instead to let the conversation go wherever he happened to take it. At the end of his administration, he sharply limited access to transcripts of his phone calls after the contents of his July 2019 conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President prompted his first impeachment proceedings. At least for now, Biden is adopting an entirely different approach. \u201cWhat strikes me with all the calls President Biden has had is they are very intentional. They are done for a purpose \u2013 you understand what the goal is, you understand what the outcome is; it\u2019s part of a broader strategy,\u201d Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN. \u201cWhat the President does is tightly integrated with his team and with the intentions and strategies of the US government,\u201d Alterman said. \u201cAnd President Trump was not a fan of that system.\u201d Putin presents a Russia-sized foreign-policy headache for Biden That is not to say Biden won\u2019t surprise his team with frank or candid remarks to counterparts down the road. During a lengthy career as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as vice president, Biden often made unguarded observations to foreign leaders, including when he told Putin in 2011 that he didn\u2019t believe the Russian leader had a soul. Biden has demonstrated a preference for developing personal relationships with leaders rather than learning about them from a stack of briefing books. As vice president, he teased President Barack Obama \u2013 who was hesitant to develop close friendships with many foreign leaders \u2013 for viewing international relations through an impersonal lens. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know the other man or woman\u2019s soul, and who they are, and make sure they know you,\u201d he once said he told Obama. He has befuddled some leaders with citations from Irish poetry that lost their meaning when passed through a translator. And he has offered blunt assessments of American policy that haven\u2019t always been received well in foreign capitals, such as when he told Afghanistan\u2019s President in 2009 that Pakistan was \u201c50 times more important\u201d to the United States than his country. But at least in his opening days as President, Biden has sought to instill a dose of normality to his outreach with foreign leaders. Even Biden\u2019s conversation with Putin on Tuesday seemed by the book, despite the litany of sticking points between Washington and Moscow that administration officials say he raised. While the topics were decidedly unfriendly, the tone was businesslike, according to one person familiar with the call. The two men agreed to quickly re-up the New START nuclear treaty, a sign of emergent diplomacy even amid the strife. They did not speak for very long. The call was designed \u201cto establish some basic policy views early on,\u201d according to one administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the conversation. Tuesday\u2019s call came at Moscow\u2019s request, according to a person familiar with the matter, who said Biden wanted to confer with leaders in Europe and his advisers before getting on the phone with Putin. The Kremlin requested the call shortly after Biden took office last week, which is standard for foreign leaders who are hoping to speak with the new president. So preordained was the trajectory of Biden\u2019s call that Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, already had a list of expected topics at hand when questioned about the call during her briefing on Tuesday, even though it had only just concluded. That is in sharp contrast to Trump, who often entered his calls having not prepared or rushed his team through preliminary briefings. Even shortened lists of talking points, condensed to one page of bullet points, were frequently discarded, included when Trump ignored all-caps advice written by his advisers to \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d Putin on winning his 2018 election. Trump also seemed \u201cconfused\u201d over the status of Crimea and other issues related to Russia, one official said, explaining Biden\u2019s goal in speaking with Putin as \u201clet\u2019s clear things up early on so there isn\u2019t any mixed messages floating around out there \u2013 not that Putin believes otherwise.\u201d Putin\u2019s phone call purposely followed a conversation the same day between Biden and the NATO secretary-general, which the White House recorded and posted clips of online. In it, Biden is seen voicing ardent support for the defense bloc, which Trump was reluctant to do because he believed other countries weren\u2019t paying their fair share. Biden has been speaking to one or two leaders per day since last Friday, moving eastward around the globe for mostly friendly conversations. He and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wasted little time discussing the contested Keystone XL pipeline, though did not dwell on that rare area of disagreement. Biden didn\u2019t broach the subject of Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, according to readouts and people familiar with the call. Instead, the men wanted to discuss some broader issues and decided to save the hot-button subject for a later date. Some French officials had wondered whether Biden would break tradition and call Macron before speaking with his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, perhaps signaling solidarity with the post-Brexit European Union. But Biden stuck to the standard order instead, speaking first with the Prime Minister and then with Macron and Merkel, indicating a steadfast view on US-UK relations. On Wednesday, Biden spoke with Japan\u2019s Prime Minister and is expected to speak shortly with South Korea\u2019s President. It remains to be seen when he will call China\u2019s Xi Jinping, a consequential conversation that Biden aides have been anticipating for several weeks.",

            "article_content": "While Donald Trump\u2019s first campaign for president was all about change, his argument for re-election was based on the premise that he had delivered on his initial promises and would continue to do so. The campaign slogan \u201cPromises made, promises kept,\u201d became Trump\u2019s rallying cry. To be sure, Trump delivered on a number of initial campaign promises. He cut regulations, lowered taxes, withdrew from the Trans Pacific Partnership, pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement and appointed hundreds of conservative justices. But in many cases, the reality behind the talking points and slogans fell short of what was actually promised. Here\u2019s a look back at how some of the most notable promises Trump made during his campaigns and throughout his time in office stack up against reality. Building a wall on the US border with Mexico (and getting Mexico to pay for it) was one of Trump\u2019s flagship promises from his first campaign, though the specific parameters of the wall evolved over time, from 1,000 miles to over 500 miles. Throughout his presidency, Trump acted as if this was one accomplishment he had successfully crossed off the list, continuing to tout the hundreds of miles of wall his administration had built. But the figures he threw out, as recently as in his recorded farewell video, were misleading and didn\u2019t live up to what he initially promised. As of January 8, 2021, 453 miles of border barriers were built under the Trump administration, just 47 of which were erected where no barriers had existed before. Of the other 406 miles: 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers, 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers and 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government considered dilapidated or outdated. While these replacement barriers are not insignificant, it\u2019s worth noting that Trump did not build a new wall. Furthermore, during the campaign, Trump insisted that Americans would not pay for the wall or any new barriers his administration constructed. According to Trump, Mexico would pay for the wall, but both the former and current Mexican president have refused to do so (the former President was more explicit while the current President, who has been less critical of Trump and has just avoided the topic). In the end, the US government spent billions in federal funds on the wall. Since January 2017, approximately $15 billion has been allocated to construct both new and replacement structures for the border wall through a combination of Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense funding combined with the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, according to a January 2021 report from Customs and Border Protection. As the coronavirus pandemic dominated the final year of Trump\u2019s presidency, he made a series of promises regarding a vaccine. Trump repeatedly stated the US would have a vaccine by the end of 2020. While experts were skeptical, the Trump administration\u2019s accelerated vaccine development initiative, Operation Warp Speed, did result in a vaccine approved for distribution before the end of the year. The Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s vaccine in mid-December and to Moderna\u2019s vaccine about a week later. But while Trump exceeded expectations in terms of the vaccine production timeline, his administration struggled to fulfill his promises regarding vaccine distribution. In October, Trump promised 100 million doses of the vaccine delivered before the end of the year. Though Trump administration officials later reduced the goal to 20 million Americans vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of December 2020, neither promise was ultimately fulfilled. Several states have blamed the federal government for the failure to meet the vaccination goals, complaining that the Trump administration initially provided fewer doses than previously promised. And with no federal mandate for how to administer the vaccines, eligibility for receiving the vaccine varied from state to state, likely causing an uneven distribution. As of December 31, 2020, fewer than 13 million vaccines had been distributed. In countless rallies and other speeches, Trump claimed he and his administration would always protect people with pre-existing conditions. This is one promise CNN was able to fact check even before the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, as the Trump administration and Republicans repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump also never issued a plan to protect those with pre-existing conditions, despite repeatedly promising to do so. During his first campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a health care law often referred to as Obamacare. After the passage of the 2017 Republican tax bill which addressed a provision of the law, Trump began to claim victory. But despite his insistence to the contrary, Obamacare did not end under Trump\u2019s administration, essentially or otherwise. In the 2017 tax bill, Republicans effectively eliminated the individual mandate, a key part of Obamacare, by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0. But other provisions of the law remained. The bill did not eliminate Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. While Trump continued to take other steps to weaken Obamacare, much of it still exists. Trump initially pledged to eliminate the US debt in eight years. He later scaled down the promise to just reducing a portion of the then-$19 trillion dollar debt. Though he didn\u2019t specify the extent of the new goal, under Trump the debt and deficit only got worse. According to the latest report from the Government Accountability Office, the federal debt was at $26.9 trillion as of September 30, 2020. The GAO attributed the increase between 2019 and 2020 to the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 pandemic response, but the national debt was rising even before the pandemic. By the end of 2019, the federal debt was at $22.7 trillion, more than three trillion more than right before Trump took office. One of Trump\u2019s flagship campaign promises was to revive US manufacturing and in his final State of the Union address, he claimed to have succeeded in \u201crestoring our Nation\u2019s manufacturing.\u201d Manufacturing employment did increase during the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, but ultimately, any gains were gone by the end of his presidency, leaving the status of US manufacturing no better than when he took office. Between January 2017 and the end of 2020, there was a net decrease in manufacturing employment. While some of the decrease could likely be attributed to the pandemic, America\u2019s manufacturing sector was in a downturn even before that, as CNN reported in August 2019 that the sector shrunk for the first time since September 2009. During his first presidential campaign, Trump set a goal of \u201c4% economic growth\u201d nationally, despite skepticism from economists. While Trump heavily leaned on his economic accomplishments throughout his time in office, annual GDP growth since 2017 never reached 4%, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The quarterly GDP growth rate did hit 4% once, in the 4th quarter of 2020, though economists say that wasn\u2019t enough to make up for the year\u2019s historically awful second quarter. 2020 also marked the first year US GDP declined since 2009. Average GDP growth did increase slightly under Trump, to 2.5% during his first three years. That\u2019s well below the 4% Trump had promised but a bit better than the 2.4% average growth rate during the last three years of Obama\u2019s time in office. But as of the 3rd quarter of his fourth year in office, the GDP growth under Trump was less than under the last five presidents before him at the same time in their presidencies, due in large part to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a candidate, Trump pledged to narrow America\u2019s trade deficit, especially with China. Although progress was made, Trump wasn\u2019t entirely successful. In 2019, the goods trade deficit with China fell to its lowest level since 2014. The overall US trade deficit also shrank in 2019, but it remained higher than when Trump took office. The gap was further exacerbated by the pandemic, with the trade deficit increasing nearly every month between April and August 2020. In November 2020, the trade deficit reached its highest level since 2006. At different times throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump said he was going to \u201cbring back\u201d coal and \u201cput the miners back to work.\u201d In 2016, the US produced more than 728 million tons of coal, according to the annual report from the Energy Information Administration. While the Trump administration made some policy moves to try to help the coal industry, production levels have not increased under the Trump administration. The most recent available report indicates the US produced 706 million tons of coal in 2019, its lowest level since 1978, when there was a major strike. According to a 2019 report from the International Energy Agency, the decrease in US coal production is in part the result of a shift toward cleaner renewables and cheaper natural gas. \u201cCheap and abundant natural gas combined with the climate policies of many states will continue to squeeze coal out of the electricity market,\u201d the report claims. A November 2020 report from S&P Global Market Intelligence also shows a decrease in coal jobs since the start of the Trump administration. Furthermore, the 3rd quarter of 2020 marked a new low in average coal mine employment according to the S&P analysis. At a 2016 campaign rally, Trump said, \u201cMy first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There\u2019s no more gun-free zones.\u201d He later doubled-down on the promise, telling the media he was going to do something to end gun free zones. Not only did he not sign any legislation banning gun-free zones on his first day in office, but this was never accomplished. Though House Republicans proposed bills to repeal the Crime Control Act of 1990 which made it a crime to possess a gun within school grounds, these efforts were unsuccessful. In 2016, Trump called for enacting a five-year ban \u201con all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service.\u201d Within his first week, Trump signed the \u201cEthics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees\u201d executive order. While on the surface that may have seemed like a promise kept, the order contained a loophole. The order only required appointees to pledge that they will not \u201cengage in lobbying activities with respect\u201d to the executive agency they were appointed to serve, language which could theoretically have permitted officials to lobby on other issues not directly related to their role less than five years after they stopped working for the federal government.  Additionally, days before his presidency came to an end, Trump revoked the rule, ostensibly allowing his former administration officials to begin lobbying when they left government if they so choose. In 2015, shortly after announcing his run for President, Trump said if elected he would \u201crarely leave the White House because there\u2019s so much work to be done.\u201d He also criticized Obama for \u201call of the time [he] spent on the golf course, often flying to Hawaii in a big, fully loaded 747, to play.\u201d And yet, Trump left the White House repeatedly while he was president, often to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida or at his golf courses across the nation. In 2019 alone he spent 1 in 5 days at a golf club, per CNN\u2019s count. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story oversimplified what Republicans did to the individual mandate in 2017. They effectively eliminated it by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019 before being elected to Congress, a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from Greene\u2019s Facebook page shows. Greene, who represents Georgia\u2019s 14th Congressional District, frequently posted far-right extremist and debunked conspiracy theories on her page, including the baseless QAnon conspiracy which casts former President Donald Trump in an imagined battle against a sinister cabal of Democrats and celebrities who abuse children. In one post, from January 2019, Greene liked a comment that said \u201ca bullet to the head would be quicker\u201d to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In other posts, Greene liked comments about executing FBI agents who, in her eyes, were part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d working against Trump. In one Facebook post from April 2018, Greene wrote conspiratorially about the Iran Deal, one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy achievements. A commenter asked Greene, \u201cNow do we get to hang them ?? Meaning H & O ???,\u201d referring to Obama and Hillary Clinton. Greene replied, \u201cStage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.\u201d After CNN reached out to Greene, her personal Twitter account posted a statement in which she did not deny that she liked posts and replied to comments but claimed that many people have run her Facebook page. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had teams of people manage my pages. Many posts have been liked. Many posts have been shared. Some did not represent my views. Especially the ones that CNN is about to spread across the internet,\u201d she wrote. Greene did not specify whether she or a member of her team were behind the posts reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. CNN reached out to Pelosi\u2019s office for comment multiple times but did not receive a response. Though her tenure in Congress has only lasted a few weeks, Greene is already facing calls to leave the House for her role in fanning the flames of the Capitol insurrection earlier this month after she objected to the election certification process and falsely insisted that Trump would remain president. After Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez called on Greene to be expelled from the House for her role in the insurrection, Greene condemned the violence at the Capitol and falsely accused \u201cAntifa/BLM terrorism\u201d and Democratic politicians of stoking the insurrection. \u201cI fully condemn ALL violence. The Antifa/BLM terrorism funded on ActBlue rests with Democrat accomplices like @CoriBush @Ilhan @KamalaHarris @AOC @timkaine & many more\u2026 Those who stoke insurrection & spread conspiracies have blood on their hands. They must be expelled,\u201d she tweeted. Parkland families call for Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation after posts surface showing she agreed shooting was a 'false flag' Last week Greene faced calls to resign from the survivors of the Parkland shooting survivors after Media Matters reported she agreed with comments calling the 2018 shooting a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, which refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups. CNN\u2019s KFile found additional comments from Greene where she called David Hogg, a survivor and activist, \u201c#littleHitler\u201d and spread a conspiracy that he was a \u201cbought and paid little pawn\u201d and actor. Before she ran for Congress in 2020, Greene created a White House petition in January 2019 to impeach the House speaker for \u201ccrimes of treason,\u201d citing Pelosi\u2019s support of so-called sanctuary policies that \u201care serving illegals and not United States citizens\u201d and because Pelosi did not support Trump\u2019s border wall. In one speech, promoting the petition, Greene suggested Pelosi could be executed for treason. \u201cShe\u2019s a traitor to our country, she\u2019s guilty of treason,\u201d Greene says in the video, which she posted on Facebook at the time. \u201cShe took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That\u2019s what treason is. And by our law representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government. And it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason.\u201d In another Facebook Live broadcast from inside Pelosi\u2019s office on February 22, 2019, Greene suggested the House speaker will \u201csuffer death or she\u2019ll be in prison\u201d for her \u201ctreason.\u201d Notably, Greene never mentions a trial. In another broadcast from later that day, she suggested California Rep. Maxine Waters was \u201cjust as guilty of treason as Nancy Pelosi.\u201d In the comments of her Facebook posts, often promoting the petition, Greene liked a comment that said \u201cthrough removal or death, doesn\u2019t matter, as long as she goes,\u201d referring to Pelosi, and another that encouraged Greene to \u201cbeat Pelosi\u2019s ass.\u201d The petition for Pelosi\u2019s impeachment and removal for treason amassed over 420,000 signatures as of January 2021. On social media, Greene portrays herself as an opponent to political violence and casts Democrats as the real instigators of political violence, either real or imaginary, who get away with threatening calls for violence. \u201cDo any of you remember a day when talking about assassinating the President resulted in getting arrested? As in arrested in real life, not FB [Facebook] jail. When was that? Pre-2016 I think, right??? But if you are a conservative that\u2019s a different story!\u201d wrote Greene in 2019. While Greene notes in Facebook posts that she disavows and denounces violence, within the comment sections of Greene\u2019s Facebook page, commenters frequently cheer for politicians to be executed by hanging or firing squad. Elsewhere on her Facebook page, Greene liked comments that advocated to \u201carrest\u201d Obama and former Secretary of State John Kerry and one comment that said, \u201cHANG that bitch,\u201d referring to either Obama or Kerry or possibly both of them. She also liked a comment that urged for \u201ccivil war 2.0\u201d to begin. Greene, who has embraced and spread the baseless conspiracy theory about a \u201cdeep state\u201d working to usurp Trump\u2019s agenda, suggested in Facebook posts that FBI agents disloyal to Trump were traitors. She liked a comment that said, \u201cTrump already said there were some great ones working with FBI but some have fallen and quite frankly need to be hung for TREASON!\u201d Another she liked said, \u201cThese Traitors need to be put to death as an example of what will no longer be tolerated in our country!!!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate GOP leaders are bracing for more retirements within their ranks, as a handful of senior Republicans decline to commit to running again \u2013 following four tumultuous years in the Trump era and facing a polarized political climate ahead. Three Republican senators have already decided to retire in 2022, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, whose announcement on Monday stunned his colleagues and ignited an all-out scramble in both parties to line up candidates to fill the crucial seat. But in interviews with CNN, several other GOP senators sidestepped questions about their political futures or made clear they were truly undecided about running again, including Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Richard Shelby of Alabama. Thune, 60, said he would make his announcement \u201cat some point in the future\u201d while brushing aside questions about his thinking. Johnson, 65, said he didn\u2019t think he had to decide \u201cfor a while.\u201d Grassley, 87, said he would make his announcement in \u201cseveral months.\u201d Shelby, 86, said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d The party out of power typically gains seats in a president\u2019s first midterm election, but Republicans will have to defend 20 of their Senate seats in 2022, while Democrats only have to defend 14 seats. And the retirements of Portman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey have given Democrats greater hope of winning those seats and retaining their slim Senate majority. The Republicans\u2019 decisions have sparked primaries that could cost millions and bruise whoever emerges as the party\u2019s nominees against the Democrats. Republicans and Democrats see promise and uncertainty in Ohio's open Senate race The three retirements were somewhat of a surprise since Portman, Burr and Toomey hover around the Senate\u2019s average age of about 62 years old. Yet they\u2019ve bemoaned the Senate as an increasingly divided institution without the willpower to break the partisan gridlock. As of now, there are no Democratic senators who have decided to step aside, though that could quickly change. Johnson\u2019s choice is the most crucial in terms of the future control of the Senate, since his swing state went for Biden in 2020 by less than a point. The Wisconsin senator said he would \u201cwork hard\u201d to \u201cmake it possible for either myself or somebody else to keep that seat in Republican hands.\u201d When asked why he would stay in the Senate, Johnson said \u201cto be a firewall\u201d against Democratic control of Washington. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this place,\u201d Johnson said of the Senate. \u201cI think this place is horribly dysfunctional.\u201d Other Republican senators from competitive states sounded like they would run again, even though some wouldn\u2019t say so explicitly. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, said that he has not made an \u201cofficial announcement.\u201d \u201cWhen I do, that\u2019s when the campaign will officially start,\u201d he added. And as she entered the Senate subway in the Capitol, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m running.\u201d Utah Sen. Mitt Romney then interjected, \u201cfor now,\u201d and smiled. A number of other senators from deep red states have not announced their new campaigns, but told CNN that they intend to run, including GOP Sens. Mike Crapo of Idaho, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Boozman of Arkansas. \u201cI am running for the border first, and reelection second,\u201d said Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy. While Republicans are uncertain which of their members may be the next to call it quits, the decision by Portman caught many off-guard. \u201cHe\u2019s a big loss, a big loss for the caucus, really for the country,\u201d Thune said of Portman. Primaries for North Carolina's 2022 US Senate seat are already heating up as another Democrat gets in The Ohio Republican also had a unique connection to his state, winning his last race in 2016 by 20 points against former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. \u201cI was surprised,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN of Portman\u2019s decision. When asked if the NRSC would get involved in the primary, Scott said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know that people have in the past, so we\u2019ll see. It will be a new experience.\u201d Scott has personally urged each of his incumbents to run again but said that Republicans would keep the US Senate seat in Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s another race that we\u2019ll raise the money for and win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re off and running. We\u2019re talking to candidates, we\u2019re recruiting candidates, we\u2019re raising money.\u201d But Democrats said the GOP retirements would be a boon to their chances of keeping the Senate. \u201cWith Ohio now joining Pennsylvania and North Carolina as another open seat liability in a major battleground state, Republicans are confronting messy and divisive primaries and a 2022 map that keeps getting harder to defend,\u201d said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss. Aspiring senators are now mulling their options and jockeying for donors. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he raised more than $1 million in two weeks since announcing he\u2019d consider a bid. In North Carolina, former GOP Rep. Mark Walker, and Democrats Jeff Jackson and Erica Smith, have already announced Senate campaigns, while others, including Lara Trump, former President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, ponder launching theirs. Lara Trump eyes Senate bid in North Carolina: 'It would be an incredible thing' Within hours of Portman\u2019s announcement came speculation that Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a close ally and vocal defender of Trump, would run. Other possible GOP candidates include: J.D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d Josh Mandel, who dropped out of the 2018 GOP primary race to challenge Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Jon Husted, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also seriously eying a Senate bid, along with at least four other Republican members of Congress: Rep. Steve Stivers, Brad Wenstrup, Mike Turner and Warren Davidson. Rep. Tim Ryan is among the Democrats ruminating a run. The Senate is currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes, giving Democrats control of the chamber. Two of the most competitive Senate seats in 2022 could be in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, which are held by Republicans Toomey and Burr. But two new Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Raphael Warnock will have to defend seats in Arizona and Georgia, which have only recently trended blue. Republicans recognize that their work will be cut out for them if more of their colleagues step aside. \u201cIt certainly creates more focus on candidate recruitment,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who is running for reelection in South Carolina next year. Retirements, he said, amount to a \u201closs of institutional knowledge on our side that\u2019s impossible to replace.\u201d \u201cBut finding interesting, fascinating and exciting candidates will be our task,\u201d Scott said.

            "article_content": "Less than two weeks removed from her vote to impeach then President Trump, Wyoming Rep, Liz Cheney (R) faces an effort to oust her from party leadership in Washington, a series of censure motions in the state and a primary challenger from a prominent conservative state legislator. Heck, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is even headed to Wyoming to campaign against her. So, how much trouble is Cheney in? I reached out to Nick Reynolds, a political reporter at the Casper Star-Tribune, for that answer \u2013 and more! Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Before Liz Cheney started speaking out against Trump, what was the consensus view of her in the state? Reynolds: I would certainly say mixed. The activist wing of the Wyoming Republican Party hasn\u2019t seen eye-to-eye with Cheney in the last few years, and at one point last year, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul came to Wyoming to assist a Republican lawmaker, Rep. Tyler Lindholm, with a piece of legislation many saw as a rebuke to Cheney\u2019s stances on foreign policy. On the other hand, Cheney has amassed an incredible amount of power in a very short amount of time, which has had some huge benefits for Wyoming. In the last four years, she has not faced a serious primary challenge and for the most part, has been a pretty effective voice for Wyoming interests even while serving in the minority. Being in Congress isn\u2019t just about passing bills, but about the details of your amendments, your ability to grease the wheels with federal agencies, and your ability to work with the other party. Power comes in handy there, and I think people recognize that. But some of her positions do conflict with the interests of the state\u2019s conservative establishment, including her occasional pushes back against former President Donald Trump, who is incredibly popular here. That, as we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks, has resulted in quite a lot of blowback from the conservative base. It\u2019s a pretty unusual development given some of her past positions that have conflicted with Trump. Her criticism of the former president for his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria barely moved the needle here, and she was a very early critic of Trump when she came out against his decision to withdraw from NATO in 2017. At the same time, she\u2019s also voted with Trump very closely throughout her career, and has supported key initiatives he pushed for, including funding for the border wall. Beyond her foreign policy stances, her conservative credentials have never really been in question. Cillizza: She ruffled feathers (at least in the DC world) when she launched a short-lived primary campaign against Mike Enzi. Did that impact her in Wyoming at all? Reynolds: The Cheneys were a household name in Wyoming well before the congresswoman\u2019s first campaign. The football field at the local high school bears her father\u2019s name. There is a building downtown named after him as well. A young Liz Cheney attended middle school a few blocks from my apartment here in Casper. But the perception of her being an outsider was a persistent one in that first campaign, and wasn\u2019t helped by some of the gaffes she made on the campaign trail \u2013 including improperly applying for a resident fishing license. When I inherited my desk when I started here, I found a \u201cCheney for Virginia\u201d bumper sticker in the top drawer of my desk scattered among the rest of the political memorabilia from past campaigns reporters have collected over the years. It was a legitimate campaign issue then, and people still use it against her, even though she\u2019s owned property in Teton County for the better part of a decade. For what it\u2019s worth, it certainly didn\u2019t hurt Foster Friess when he ran for governor in 2018: it\u2019s a pretty open fact that he splits his time between his properties in Jackson Hole and Scottsdale, Arizona, and I rarely heard that brought up on the campaign trail then. Enzi, up to that point, had followed the traditional progression of federal candidates follow in Wyoming politics. Like his predecessor, Al Simpson, Enzi had earned his stripes. He was a mayor for a while, served some time in the Wyoming Legislature, and had a proven record as a policymaker in Wyoming. It was also a different time. Enzi\u2019s first campaign was probably the first time we had serious money coming in from out-of-state, but in 2014, politics here was still extremely local. The city of Milwaukee has more residents than Wyoming, meaning to be successful, you needed deep-seated relationships with community leaders in small towns all across the state. Not everybody can do that. Cheney didn\u2019t make those mistakes in 2016. Most importantly, she also had a lot of money to back her up, helping her to defeat people like Leland Christensen (a long-time state legislator who currently works for Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming) and Tim Stubson, a Casper attorney who served close to a decade in the Wyoming legislature. The fact that there has been no serious primary challenge the last few years says a lot. But of course, not many people can match her fundraising capability\u2026 something I wrote about for the Star-Tribune the weekend after her vote. Cillizza: How closely was Cheney\u2019s vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment followed in Wyoming? And was there a consensus as to why she did it? Reynolds: Cheney\u2019s impeachment vote has been THE story in Wyoming. As I write this, three county Republican parties have voted to censure her, and numerous people have already filed to run against her. At the same time, a large number of very influential people in Wyoming politics \u2013 attorneys, former governors, you name it \u2013 have risen to support her as well. Shortly after her impeachment vote, former Wyoming Governors Matt Mead (a Republican) and Mike Sullivan (a Democrat) signed onto on op-ed in the Star-Tribune supporting her efforts to push back against Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Petroleum Association of Wyoming, one of the state\u2019s most powerful industry groups in the state, has also put out a statement supporting her on Monday, saying Cheney\u2019s voice \u201ccarries tremendous weight for all of Wyoming\u201d in Congress. For a state with just three representatives in Washington, that\u2019s a big deal. As far as a consensus as to why she did it, I really can\u2019t say. There is open speculation that she is considering a higher office \u2013 something she denied as a motivation for her vote when talking to the Wyoming press corps the day of the vote. And from what I\u2019ve seen from Washington DC, it seems like the conference remains rather divided on what its future is. Given Trump\u2019s performance here, Cheney is probably very well aware that her vote would have caused some of this blowback \u2013 something I think is worth remembering when she called her vote a \u201cvote of conscience.\u201d You don\u2019t make a decision like that lightly. Cillizza: A GOP state senator has already announced he will primary Cheney in 2022. How serious is that challenge? Reynolds: State Sen. Anthony Bouchard is already pretty well-known in Wyoming politics. Prior to his time in the Wyoming legislature, he was the founder of a no-compromise gun rights group called Wyoming Gun Owners (which is now run by conservative activist Aaron Dorr) that was very active in helping to oust a number of moderate Republicans in the state house in last year\u2019s primaries. That group is currently involved in a legal battle with the Wyoming Secretary of State after the office said it would require them to release their donors. After two consecutive defeats for a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives, Bouchard later rode that reputation to a narrow victory in one of the state\u2019s few gerrymandered Republican districts in 2016 and, this year, scored a massive, 30-point victory over one of the best-funded Democratic state house campaigns in Wyoming history. Whether the people who dislike Cheney are simply a vocal minority or a sign of a credible grassroots effort to replace her remains to be seen. In Cheney\u2019s crowded 2016 primary election, the standard bearer of the Wyoming GOP\u2019s conservative wing at the time, Darin Smith (who is also floating a primary challenge, per Wyoming Public Radio), only managed about 15% of the vote, and in this year\u2019s Republican primaries, the winner of the Wyoming GOP\u2019s straw poll, Bryan Miller, barely broke 10% of the electorate in a Senate primary loss to Lummis. But there is some potential for growth. If you look at the state\u2019s six-way 2018 Republican primary for governor, eventual winner Mark Gordon won with only about one-third of the total vote, while the two runners-up \u2013  Friess and current Wyoming Republican Party National Committeewoman Harriet Hageman \u2013 combined for nearly 48% of the vote. Both of those candidates were much more conservative than Gordon. The best chance for the party\u2019s right wing lies with them being able to produce a single, credible candidate with a strong ability to fundraise. Bouchard has sought to use the Internet and conservative media outlets to raise his own profile nationally and expand that donor base in an effort to even the odds. However, it\u2019s really hard to say whether the 2018 primary elections really inform how many voters would go against Cheney. She still has a very conservative voting record, and still has two years to prove her credentials against a Democratic trifecta in the Oval, the House and the Senate. Wyoming also has very loose restrictions on voter registration, leading to a large amount of crossover voting in those primary races as well. While it wasn\u2019t significant enough to impact the final result in Gordon\u2019s favor in 2018, a contentious enough election could compel some more liberal-minded Wyoming voters to stay in the Republican Party and support Cheney in 2022. And the dynamics of each campaign are completely different from one another. But we\u2019ll see. In the past few years, we\u2019ve also seen candidates like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Lauren Boebert come out of nowhere to upend more establishment campaigns in their districts. It\u2019d be na\u00efve for anyone to say it couldn\u2019t happen here. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIn January 2023, Liz Cheney will be _____________.\u201d Now, explain. Reynolds: I don\u2019t think I can. It\u2019s going to be an exciting two years, and I\u2019m looking forward to covering it.",

            "article_content": "As his first full week in the White House begins, Joe Biden already faces critical early tests of a presidency premised on political compromise and uniting Washington to fight the pandemic. The President\u2019s team Sunday appealed for two things that may ultimately be elusive: time to stand up an aggressive attempt to finally turn around the Covid-19 nightmare and Republican buy-in for his $1.9 trillion economic relief plan. In the week ahead, Biden is expected to unleash a new blitz of executive actions to deliver momentum to his new administration \u2013 on Monday, for instance, removing the ban on transgender people serving in the military. Biden is planning a busy week of executive action. Here's what you need to know The President plans to move aggressively later in the week, taking steps to boost US workers, address racial inequality and combat climate change. But true, lasting change and the nation\u2019s hopes of finally overcoming the pandemic will rely on Biden\u2019s ability to leverage years of experience to forge common ground in the scorched earth of the capital. The task gets tougher by the day, partly due to the unprecedented challenge of former President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, which will begin in two weeks. The Republican Party is tearing itself apart in the post-Trump era, narrowing political space for GOP lawmakers who might think about helping a new Democratic President in a time of crisis. And on the Sunday talk shows, there appeared to be much less appetite for compromise among rival lawmakers than in the Oval Office. It\u2019s a tough reality that Biden, who follows a President who often ignored the coronavirus crisis, is already parrying questions about whether his vow to deliver 100 million vaccine doses in 100 days is sufficiently ambitious. But it\u2019s a measure of the desperation in the country, with normal life an increasingly distant memory, amid worrying new warnings about more infectious and possibly more deadly viral strains. Biden urges patience as frustration grows over vaccine supply Xavier Becerra, Biden\u2019s nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary, on Sunday addressed tension between the President\u2019s push for urgent action to fight Covid-19 and the fact it will take months for improvements to show. \u201cI believe President Biden is making it very clear, the plane is in a nosedive, and we have got to pull it up. And you aren\u2019t going to do that overnight. But we\u2019re going to pull it up,\u201d Becerra said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on a day when the US death toll of the out-of-control disaster approached 420,000. Speaking to Dana Bash, Becerra was unable to answer the question everyone wants to know: how much longer will it be until sufficient supplies of vaccines bring the days of social distancing to an end? Already, hopes of deliverance for the country by early summer look premature. White House chief of staff Ron Klain defended Biden\u2019s 100 million target \u2014 which means only 50 million people will be fully vaccinated, given the two-dose regimen, during the period in question \u2014 as \u201ca very bold and ambitious goal.\u201d And he tried to clear up confusion of the administration\u2019s own making after the government\u2019s top infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, contradicted claims by anonymous White House sources that the new administration had to start from \u201cscratch\u201d on a vaccine distribution plan after being left nothing by Trump. \u201cAs everyone in America has seen \u2014 the way in which people get vaccine is chaotic, it\u2019s very limited,\u201d Klain told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Stepping up the White House effort to swiftly pass the pandemic rescue bill, Brian Deese, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, hosted a call with as many as 16 senators Sunday afternoon. Eight Democrats and eight Republicans were invited in a core group of power players who will be crucial to Biden\u2019s ambitions of bipartisan action on many fronts. There was strong agreement on the need to push hard on money for vaccine distribution, Jared Bernstein, a member of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on \u201cNewsroom\u201d Sunday. Biden's opening with Republicans is narrow but real \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everybody is going to agree on every detail,\u201d Bernstein said, before billing Biden \u2014 who served in the Senate for more than three decades \u2014 as the key cog in the process in the coming days. \u201cJoe Biden has a long history with working on those types of negotiations.\u201d The extent of the new President\u2019s task was made clear when Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the GOP senators seen as open to compromise, appeared to raise questions about the speed and the size of the economic rescue bid. \u201cHow has the first $900 billion we just passed a couple weeks ago, how has that been distributed? Most of it hasn\u2019t yet,\u201d Romney said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t borrow hundreds of billions, actually trillions of dollars from the Chinese for things that are not absolutely necessary. This is a time to act with prudence and care.\u201d GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said in a statement on Sunday evening that she, too, had reservations about the Biden plan and wanted it to be better targeted. \u201cIt seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope,\u201d Collins said.   Given the urgency of the situation, Democrats are already prepping a plan to use a rare and controversial procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the package if Republicans try to block it or water it down. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told donors on a Thursday Zoom call that she was ready to pass the bill in two weeks using the tactic, a source told CNN. The problem with using reconciliation to pass the bill with narrow Democratic majorities is that it could scupper Biden\u2019s hopes of a bipartisan plan and set back his longer-term plans for defusing the poison in Washington. But the search for support from Republicans could also force the new President to dilute his ambitions for the Covid-relief measure and make it less successful \u2014 a serious consideration at the start of a presidency that will be defined by his capacity to end the pandemic and restore the economy. The willingness of some Republicans to demonstrate good faith to Biden\u2019s overtures is also in question. Several top members of Congress have already accused him of trashing his own calls for unity in his inaugural address by taking executive orders like rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting construction of Trump\u2019s border wall. Such objections, however, reflect a disregard for the results of the election. Biden won a clear victory in the Electoral College and amassed seven million more votes than Trump, so he can claim a mandate for his early actions. The mood between the parties is hardly being improved by an increasingly tense spat between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, over how the 50-50 chamber will operate. Biden\u2019s aspirations are challenged by an extraordinary confluence of political forces boiling in his first few days in office, all of which were in evidence on a clarifying weekend that predicted the year\u2019s political themes. Why Biden's bipartisanship hope is probably already lost House Democrats will deliver the sole article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Monday, alleging incitement of insurrection. That will set off a ceremonial process that will culminate in the trial beginning the week of February 8. The more time that passes, the less likely it seems that there will be 17 Republican senators ready to supply the two-thirds majority needed to convict the former President and ban him from future public office. \u201cI think the trial is stupid. I think it\u2019s counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it\u2019s like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Rubio is one of the Republicans who faces a new twist of an old dilemma about Trump. Are their political interests best served by voting to punish the former President for inciting an insurrection against Congress and an attempt to steal the election? Or is Trump\u2019s power in the party still so strong that they invite a backlash by convicting the former President? Rubio is up for reelection in 2022 and is already having to deal with questions about whether he fears a primary challenge from the ex-President\u2019s daughter, Ivanka. Romney told CNN that he believed Trump\u2019s behavior inciting a mob was an impeachable offense. But GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because he believed it was unconstitutional to try a former President who was impeached \u2013 an emerging argument among GOP lawmakers. But one of the Democratic House impeachment managers, Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Trump must play a price for actions that have no parallel in American history. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime. And we must move forward,\u201d said Dean.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden spent his first week in office trying to convince the nation to see themselves not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in defeating the pandemic. Then on Friday night, the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump got a formal date on the calendar, complicating every bipartisan goal on the new President\u2019s agenda. After four exhausting years of Trump that left this country deeply divided and democracy hanging by a thread, the nation breathed easier when Trump decamped Wednesday to Mar-a-Lago, his slashing vitriol silenced by a permanent suspension on Twitter. Next month\u2019s trial will bring the outcast former President back to center stage, giving him yet another chance to claim that he is a victim in a never-ending partisan witch hunt and handing him a platform to rally his supporters at a time when he might have otherwise had none.   Biden is caught in an almost impossible vise as the nation reengages in the most polarizing kind of proceeding that exists in Washington. He has insisted that Trump must be held accountable for the attempted insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, but he has been notably cool to the prospect of impeachment as he tries to unravel Trump\u2019s legacy with more than two dozen executive orders in his first three days in office, while simultaneously working the phones to build broader legislative consensus. The looming trial \u2013 which has the potential to inflame partisan divisions just as quickly as Biden was trying to squelch them \u2013 offers no visible upside to a President who was elected on his promise to bring the warring parties of Washington together and forge compromise in a Capitol that has been defined by strife. The hopes that Biden could bring a different tone to Washington \u2013 which were so bright on Inauguration Day \u2013 were complicated by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement that the House would deliver the impeachment article charging Trump with \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d to the Senate on Monday evening. Senators will be sworn in for the trial the next day, according to the calendar outlined by Schumer, with trial arguments slated to start on February 9. McConnell privately says he wants Trump gone as Republicans quietly lobby him to convict The delay in the trial\u2019s start will be helpful to Biden because only two of his Cabinet nominees have been approved by the Senate so far \u2013 a much slower pace than his predecessors. Biden underscored that point Friday when asked whether he favored Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s timeline for a mid-February impeachment trial. \u201cThe more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises, the better,\u201d Biden replied at the end of a White House event about executive actions on the economy. Prospects of convicting Trump erode as GOP grows vocal against Senate impeachment proceedings Biden has been circumspect on whether he believes there is any point to holding a Senate impeachment trial for a President who has already left office, answering virtually every question by stating that he will leave the timing and mechanics of a trial up to Senate leaders. White House press secretary Jen Psaki crisply shut down questions about Biden\u2019s more substantive views on impeachment \u2013 and whether Trump should be barred from holding federal office in the future \u2013 by pointing out that the President ousted Trump from the White House through the electoral process. \u201cHe ran against him because he thought he was unfit to serve, and he\u2019s no longer here because President Biden beat him,\u201d Psaki said during the White House news briefing Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the steps \u2013 the accountability steps \u2013 to Congress to determine.\u201d The question of the futility of an impeachment trial at this point is even more salient now given that the Senate looks increasingly unlikely to convict Trump, according to reporting by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Ted Barrett and Jeremy Herb. Convicting Trump would require 17 Republican senators to vote with the 50 Democrats in the Senate, a tall order on any legislative matter, let alone one as fraught as this one. Though there is disagreement among rank-and-file Republicans about how Trump should be punished for his role in the riot \u2013 with conviction dangling the possibility that Trump could be barred from holding federal office in the future \u2014 many Republicans are now also questioning whether it is constitutional to try a president who has already left office. The argument about constitutionality is serving as a useful dodge for GOP senators who are wary of Trump\u2019s punishing instincts \u2013 allowing them to avoid alienating his base voters, while potentially getting them off the hook with more moderate constituents who were angered by Trump\u2019s role in the Capitol riot, seeded by the blizzard of lies he told about the November election results. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the vote will be, but I think the chance of two-thirds is nil,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CNN. White House wants Democrats to be patient on stimulus talks as Biden pushes for bipartisan path, officials say Through almost all of his other actions this week, Biden signaled that he was trying to move Americans beyond the Trump era, not just in policy but also in tone. Swearing in his new employees, Biden told them that if he heard them disrespecting or talking down to another colleague, he would fire them on the spot \u2014 underscoring that he believes everyone deserves to be treated with the dignity and decency that has been \u201cmissing in a big way the past four years.\u201d Aside from that comment, when given the chance to take a shot at Trump, he has generally avoided it \u2013 describing the letter the former President left him, for example, as \u201cgenerous.\u201d Biden alienated some Republicans this week by seeking to undo some of Trump\u2019s most controversial policies through executive actions \u2013 halting construction of the wall at the US-Mexico border, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, rejoining the Paris climate accord and rescinding Trump\u2019s ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. But the new President also placed great emphasis on actions he was taking that could garner support from both parties: measures to speed up vaccine distribution like invoking the Defense Production Act to produce more supplies like needles or specialized syringes that could extract more vaccine from each vial; plans to accelerate the reopening of schools; an extension of moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures; and policies aimed at curbing food insecurity in the midst of the pandemic, which has been a concern for both Democrats and Republicans. Biden signs orders to get checks and food aid to low-income Americans -- plus a federal pay raise Pointing to the road ahead as he outlined some of the economy-focused executive actions that he was taking on Friday, Biden underscored that there were constraints on what he could do alone with the stroke of his pen \u2013 and made another urgent plea to members of Congress to come to the negotiating table on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. With the US Senate divided 50-50, Schumer and McConnell are still wrangling over a power-sharing agreement in the Senate that will determine the number of seats each party controls the chamber\u2019s committees. Talks have stalled over McConnell\u2019s demand that Schumer preserve the filibuster. While Biden is already facing significant resistance among Republicans about the cost of the package, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese warned that Americans may tumble into an even deeper medical crisis and \u201ceconomic hole\u201d without it. Biden noted that another 900,000 Americans have joined the ranks of the unemployed, according to economic data this week, while many families are still being forced to drive up to food banks just to feed their children. In an argument for his legislative package attuned to Republican concerns, he said there is a \u201cgrowing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy,\u201d and that it is \u201ca smart fiscal investment\u201d that will help America retain its competitive edge around the world. (He noted at one point that Trump\u2019s former economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, has spoken in favor of the proposal that he has outlined). \u201cThis almost doesn\u2019t have a partisan piece to it,\u201d Biden said plaintively. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the people of this country just want to stand by and watch their friends and their neighbors, coworkers, fellow Americans go hungry, lose their homes, or lose their sense of dignity and hope and respect,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Democrats or Republicans are going hungry and losing jobs; I believe Americans are going hungry and losing their jobs.\u201d \u201cWe have the tools to fix it.\u201d But Biden still has a great deal of persuading to do as he tries to drum up the political will for another bipartisan piece of legislation using those tools. As he reaches out, there are signs that the two camps are retreating back to their familiar corners \u2013 with impeachment standing as the biggest obstacle in the new President\u2019s way.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been two weeks since a violent mob \u2013 egged on by ex-President Donald Trump and a complicit Republican Party \u2013 stormed the US Capitol amid formal counting of the Electoral College vote to confirm Joe Biden had won the White House. And Josh Hawley still isn\u2019t sorry. Hawley, a freshman Republican senator from Missouri, was the leading voice inside the Senate to formally object to the Electoral College results in several states, including Arizona and Pennsylvania \u2013 despite zero evidence in either state of any sort of wrongdoing or malfeasance related to the votes. (Hawley\u2019s support for the objections ensured that there would be a debate over each state\u2019s electoral votes and a vote on each.) While Trump was quite clearly the spark that lit the fire that led to January 6, Hawley was one of the main gatherers of the tinder that turned it into a raging inferno. There have been a series of consequences as a result of Hawley\u2019s aiding and abetting of the false idea that the election was somehow stolen. His book \u2013 \u201cThe Tyranny of Big Tech\u201d \u2013 was dropped by Simon & Schuster, who cited \u201c[Hawley\u2019s] s role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom\u201d as the reason. Senate Democrats have moved against Hawley and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, filing an ethics complaint on Thursday against both men aimed at prompting an investigation into their roles in the incitement and encouragement of the January 6 riot. The Missouri senator\u2019s response to all of the blowback? Bring it on! Hawley called the Simon & Schuster decision \u201cOrwellian\u201d and promised to \u201cfight this cancel culture with everything I have.\u201d Of the ethics complaint, Hawley accused his Senate Democratic colleagues of \u201cbrazenly trying to silence dissent.\u201d In an appearance on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show on Fox News Thursday night, Hawley dismissed Biden\u2019s talk of unity in his inauguration speech. \u201cWe hear a lot of talk now about unity, but sadly, I think they don\u2019t want unity, they want control and they want you to have the same opinions, voice the same opinions, toe the party line, and if you don\u2019t, then they\u2019re willing to use every power at their disposal to shut you down,\u201d Hawley told Carlson. And, it\u2019s not just his words. It\u2019s his actions, too. Hawley was one of only two votes against the confirmation of Lloyd Austin as defense secretary on Friday. (Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee was the other.) And earlier this week, Hawley blocked speedy consideration of Alejandro Mayorkas as Biden\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security over concerns about how the southern border will be policed by the new administration. (Biden issued an executive order shortly after taking over as president that halts construction of the border wall, a Trump pet project.) If you\u2019ve paid any attention at all to Republican politics over (at least) the last four years, none of this should surprise you. At the core of Donald Trump\u2019s life (and political) philosophy is the idea that you should never, ever apologize because it shows weakness to your enemies. Instead, you should double down on any perceived mistakes you\u2019ve committed and insist to anyone willing to listen that you were either a) right all along or b) will be proved right in the long run. Hawley, who would love to be the heir to the Trump coalition come 2024, has clearly taken that lesson to heart. Rather than apologizing for his role in convincing the GOP base that the election was fraudulent, he\u2019s turned the entire debacle into a fight against, in Hawley\u2019s own words, the \u201cwoke mob.\u201d That may well be good politics for him in a Republican Party whose base still pledges near-total fealty to Trump. But it\u2019s something well short of what actual leadership looks like.",

            "article_content": "Have you seen Joe Biden\u2019s tweet??!?! Yes, the President of the United States was up and tweeting at 7:45 Friday morning! And man, what a tweet! It was 30-second video clip from Biden\u2019s inaugural address on Wednesday, in which the 46th president said that \u201cwith unity we can do great things, important things.\u201d With unity, we can do great things. pic.twitter.com/BMCgyZkdH1 He really tweeted that! DANG! This is, of course, a joke. Biden did sent the tweet above. But it\u2019s decidedly non-controversial. It\u2019s the sort of thing we used to describe as \u201cpresidential\u201d behavior. Which brings me to this: The single most radical thing that Biden has done in his first 48 hours of being president is act totally and completely normally. He\u2019s signed a series of executive orders rolling back measures put in place by former President Donald Trump. He delivered a speech outlining the specific steps his administration would take to address the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He attended a briefing \u2013 alongside Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 with his Covid-19 team. His press secretary, Jen Psaki, held press conferences on Wednesday and Thursday in which she answered questions from reporters. Cabinet nominees like Pete Buttigieg took part in their confirmation hearings before the Senate. The Senate haggled over Biden\u2019s proposed coronavirus stimulus package. It was all so damn normal. That it feels different speaks to the utter radicalization that Trump brought to, literally, every aspect of the presidency. Trump seemed bound and determined to undo absolutely every aspect of what it had meant previously to be president. \u201cMy use of social media is not Presidential - it\u2019s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL,\u201d he tweeted less than six months into his first term. \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d Trump embraced the abnormality of his vision for the presidency as proof that he was, in essence, freaking out the squares. The fact that he abdicated the moral leadership that past presidents innately understood to be the core of the job was evidence that he was fighting for the people not the powerful, or something. His lies \u2013 about everything from who was going today for the border wall to who won the 2020 election \u2013 and the resistance they engendered among media fact-checkers in his mind were the necessary response to an establishment that was against him. His off-the-wall-tweets were his way around the media bias that threatened to suffocate conservative thought. He had a reason and a rationalization for everything. (Trump is an Olympic-level rationalizer.) It\u2019s only in the light of the utter normality that Biden has projected over these last two days that you can really see just how not-normal every last bit of the Trump presidency actually was. And how it was all just so totally exhausting. The tweets, the statements, the threats, the bullying, the policy reversals, the tweets (again) \u2013 it all made the country feel like it was sprinting on a treadmill that just kept going incrementally faster. Or that we were all trapped on a bus that was hurtling through the country, unable to slow down. (Come to think of it, that would make a good movie plot!) That is not a good way to run a country \u2013 or to live in one. The biggest change \u2013 at least for me \u2013 in the earliest days of the Biden administration, then, is the quiet. If Trump was constantly moving, chattering, tweeting and cajoling, Biden aims to present the exact opposite image to the public \u2013 of a man who knows what he is doing and is doing so methodically and carefully. Who knew the normal could feel so radical?",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump made false claims from the first hours of his term to the last. Trump repeated some of his favorite falsehoods in both his farewell video address, which was released on Tuesday, and in his final speech on Wednesday morning at Joint Base Andrews. One more time, here is a fact check roundup. In the video address, Trump said he appointed \u201cnearly 300 federal judges.\u201d In his final speech, similarly, Trump said he got \u201calmost 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices.\u201d He added in the speech: \u201cThat\u2019s a record-setting number.\u201d Facts First: Trump was incorrect, both with his number and with his claim to have set a record. He got 234 total judges confirmed to the Supreme Court, district courts and appeals courts, according to figures from Brookings Institution visiting fellow Russell Wheeler; even if you round generously, that doesn\u2019t qualify as almost 300. And President Jimmy Carter appointed 261 total judges, according to Wheeler \u2013 39% of the judgeships available at the time compared to Trump\u2019s 27%. Trump claimed in the video address, for more than the 160th time as President, that he is the one responsible for the creation of the Veterans Choice health care program: \u201cWe passed VA Choice.\u201d (He made a less explicit version of the claim in his final speech.) Facts First: Trump was wrong again. Former President Barack Obama signed the Veterans Choice program into law in 2014. What Trump signed was a 2018 law, the VA MISSION Act, that modified and expanded the eligibility criteria of the Choice program. The 2014 law Obama signed, which allowed certain veterans to be covered by the government for health care provided by doctors outside the VA system, was a bipartisan initiative spearheaded by two senators Trump repeatedly criticized, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the late John McCain of Arizona. We\u2019ve called Trump\u2019s claim that he got Veterans Choice one of his 15 most notable lies in office. Trump claimed in the video address: \u201cWe also unlocked our energy resources and became the world\u2019s No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas by far.\u201d Facts First: While US energy production did indeed increase under Trump, Trump does not deserve credit for the US reaching the number-one spot in overall energy production. The US actually became the world\u2019s top total producer of oil and natural gas under President Barack Obama in 2012, according to data published by the government\u2019s Energy Information Administration. It was crude oil in particular in which the US became the world\u2019s top producer during Trump\u2019s tenure. \u201cThe United States has been the world\u2019s top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world\u2019s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia\u2019s,\u201d the Energy Information Administration says. Trump claimed in the video address that, under him, the US had built \u201cmore than 450 miles of powerful new wall.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. It is true that more than 450 miles of border barriers were built under Trump \u2013 453 miles as of January 8, 2021, according to official US Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez. However, just 47 of these 453 miles were erected where no barriers had existed before. Of the other 406 miles: 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government describes as dilapidated or outdated; 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers; 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers. We shouldn\u2019t dismiss the significance of even replacement barriers, since many of the Trump-era barriers are significantly bigger, more expensive and more controversial than the barriers they replaced. But it\u2019s worth noting that Trump did not put 450 miles of barriers on terrain that previously had no defenses whatsoever. Trump claimed in his final speech that \u201cwe just got 75 million votes,\u201d a record for a sitting president. Facts First: This is another little exaggeration. Trump received 74.2 million votes in the 2020 election, which does not round to 75 million. Trump\u2019s total is indeed a record for a sitting president, but Trump also did not acknowledge that Joe Biden got over 7 million more votes than he did. - Tara Subramaniam Trump boasted in the video address that he \u201cachieved record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women\u2026\u201d Facts First: There are two inaccuracies here. First, the unemployment rate for women never hit a record low under Trump. (Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was among the lowest in US history but not the very lowest.) Second, the unemployment rates for all of these groups are no longer anywhere near record levels; Trump\u2019s boast ignores the fact that unemployment rates skyrocketed early in the pandemic and remain elevated today. The December 2020 unemployment rate for African Americans was 9.9%. That is well above the 8.0% of Trump\u2019s first full month in office, February 2017, and the record 5.2% of August 2019. The December 2020 unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans was 9.3%. That is well above the 5.6% of February 2017 and the record 4.0% of September 2019. The December 2020 unemployment rate for women was 6.7%. That is well above the 4.6% of February 2017 and the record 2.7% of May 1953. The December 2020 unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 5.8%. (This rate is not seasonally adjusted; the rates for the other groups in this fact check are seasonally adjusted.) That is well above the 3.5% of February 2017 and the record 2.0% of May 2018. In his final speech, Trump boasted about his record on jobs, saying that we \u201chave such good \u2013 and have had \u2013 such good job numbers. The job numbers have been absolutely incredible.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhen we started, had we not been hit by the pandemic, we would have had numbers that would never have been seen \u2013 already our numbers are the best ever.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s grammar makes this claim a little hard to fact check \u2013 he seemed to go back and forth from boasting about the past to boasting about the present \u2013 but he obviously does not \u201calready\u201d have the best jobs record of any president. In fact, thanks to the steep job losses of the pandemic era, he leaves office with the US at about 3 million fewer jobs than when he took office. No other president in the post-World War II era, the period for which we have good official data, has had a negative jobs record. Trump\u2019s record on jobs creation lagged behind that of several other presidents even before the pandemic. Trump claimed in both the farewell video and his final speech to have passed the largest tax cuts in US history. Facts First: Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts were not the largest in American history. There have been bigger tax cuts whether you measure in inflation-adjusted dollars or as a share of the national economy. Tax cuts in 1981, 2010, and 2013 were larger, both in inflation-adjusted dollars or as a share of the economy. As a share of the economy, there were even others that were bigger, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think tank focused on fiscal policies. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017 under Trump, provided for cuts that are among the largest in nominal terms, but even then they are still smaller than tax cuts passed in 2013. - Katie Lobosco",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump pardoned his former chief strategist Steve Bannon in a last-minute decision made only hours before he is scheduled to depart the White House for a final time. Trump told people that after much deliberation, he had decided to pardon Bannon as one of his final acts in office. \u201cPresident Trump granted a full pardon to Stephen Bannon. Prosecutors pursued Mr. Bannon with charges related to fraud stemming from his involvement in a political project,\u201d the statement from White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany read. \u201cMr. Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.\u201d Bannon faces a federal case that began in August when New York federal prosecutors charged him and three others with defrauding donors of more than a million dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump\u2019s border wall. Bannon\u2019s pardon would follow a frantic scramble during the President\u2019s final hours in office as attorneys and top aides debated his inclusion on Trump\u2019s outgoing clemency list. Despite their falling out in recent years, Trump was eager to pardon his former aide after recently reconnecting with him as he helped fan Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories about the election.   It was a far cry from when Trump exiled Bannon from his inner circle after he was quoted in a book trashing the President\u2019s children, claiming that Donald Trump Jr. had been \u201ctreasonous\u201d by meeting with a Russian attorney and labeling Ivanka Trump \u201cdumb as a brick.\u201d Those statements from Bannon drove Trump to issue a lengthy statement saying he had \u201clost his mind.\u201d \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,\u201d Trump said at the time. Things shifted in recent months as Bannon attempted to breach Trump\u2019s inner circle once again by offering advice before the election and pushing his false theories after Trump had lost. One concern that had stalled debate over the pardon was Bannon\u2019s possible connection to the riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol earlier this month, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\u201d Bannon promised listeners of his podcast \u2013 \u201cWar Room\u201d \u2013 on January 5, the day before the deadly siege on the Capitol. The day after Bannon\u2019s comments, Trump urged supporters to go to the Capitol because the election \u201cwas stolen from you, from me and from the country.\u201d The pardon would bring a quick end to his criminal case, which began in August when New York federal prosecutors charged him and three others with defrauding donors of more than a million dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump\u2019s border wall. Bannon\u2019s pardon would trigger relief from a series of charges brought against him by New York federal prosecutors, which carried the risk of jail time. Bannon had been released on $5 million bond in August, secured by $1.75 million in cash or real property. As part of his bail conditions, he was prohibited from travel on private airplanes, yachts or boats without permission from the court. The four men were accused of allegedly using hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to an online crowdfunding campaign called We Build the Wall for personal expenses, among other things. Bannon and another defendant, Brian Kolfage, allegedly promised donors that the campaign, which raised more than $25 million, was \u201ca volunteer organization\u201d and that \u201c100% of the funds raised \u2026 will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose,\u201d according to the indictment.   Instead, according to prosecutors, Bannon, through a nonprofit under his control, allegedly used more than $1 million from We Build the Wall to \u201csecretly\u201d pay Kolfage and cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bannon\u2019s personal expenses. Through his counsel, Bannon pleaded not guilty, and he dismissed the charges after his initial court appearance as a \u201cfiasco\u201d intended to \u201cstop people who want to build the wall.\u201d Trump said at the time that he felt \u201cvery badly\u201d for Bannon, who had been an enormously influential voice inside the White House before he was ousted by the President in August 2017. A senior Trump adviser told CNN that Trump and Bannon had communicated in recent weeks. While some advisers believed it was decided last weekend that Bannon was not getting a pardon, Trump continued to raise it into Tuesday night. Throughout the day, Trump had continued to contemplate pardons that aides believed were settled, including for his former strategist \u2013 something he continued to go back and forth on into Tuesday night, sources told CNN. Ultimately, Trump sided with Bannon. Trump's last-minute pardons include Bannon, Lil Wayne and scores of others Bannon had helped run Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and was credited as a driving force behind Trump\u2019s populist appeal, nationalist ideology and controversial policies. Before joining the campaign, Bannon was the executive chairman of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that traffics in incendiary headlines. He returned to Breitbart after leaving the White House, but left again in 2018. Since Trump\u2019s election defeat, the President has leaned further into his expansive pardon powers \u2013 granting pardons to his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, longtime ally Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, among others. Among Trump\u2019s pardons earlier in his term were those for former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, right-wing commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza and financier Michael Milken.

            "article_content": "A president\u2019s most valuable commodity is time and Donald Trump is out of it. With a day remaining in his term, Trump was still consumed with grievance over Republicans he believes abandoned him and insistent to people around him that he actually won the election he lost. On Tuesday, the once-loyal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor that the insurrectionist mob was \u201cprovoked\u201d by Trump. McConnell touted that Congress did its duty despite the violence on January 6, certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\u201d said McConnell. The President, meanwhile, has been in a foul mood for several days and has lost interest in the performative parts of the presidency he once relished, a source he\u2019s spoken with in recent days told CNN. While he was eagerly anticipating his military-style send-off from Joint Base Andrews on Inauguration morning \u2013 one of the few items that have cheered him up recently \u2013 there were already signs the crowd may be smaller than he\u2019d hoped. And a slate of actual celebrities lined up for Biden\u2019s inauguration disappointed a president who tried and often failed to secure A-list support for his own presidency. He hadn\u2019t left the White House or been seen in public for a week. On Monday evening he taped a valedictory final message from the Blue Room of the White House, ticking through several achievements that he believes should define his administration. \u201cThis week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,\u201d he said in the video, which was released online Tuesday afternoon by the White House. \u201cWe did what we came here to do \u2013 and so much more.\u201d That sentiment was something Trump\u2019s advisers were hoping he would voice in his final weeks in office. In the video, Trump described his accomplishments and said he worked arduously for the American people. He framed his presidency as one that championed the forgotten and made no apologies for his brazen approach to politics. \u201cI did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not seek the path that would get the least criticism.\u201d \u201cAmerica is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree,\u201d he went on. He touted having not started any new foreign wars and adopting a tough stance on China. And he took credit for a resurgent US economy, even though it has slowed during the coronavirus pandemic, which he termed the \u201cChina virus.\u201d His only mention of the 400,000 American lives lost to the virus was to say he grieved them and pledged \u201cin their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all.\u201d The speech made no mention of Biden by name, but did allude to the violence at the Capitol earlier this month. \u201cAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans.  It can never be tolerated,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.\u201d Trump recorded the message late Monday with a skeleton staff. Unlike most of his predecessors in the television era, a live prime-time farewell address attempting to burnish what has become a badly tarnished legacy is no longer in the cards. On his last full day as president, Trump was expected to issue a final raft of pardons and commutations and could sign new executive orders, according to White House officials. He was taking exit meetings with aides, posing for photos in the Oval Office, keeping tabs on his carefully planned departure ceremony and receiving briefings from the Secret Service on security for an inauguration he does not plan on attending. His schedule was empty except for the notice he dictated himself weeks ago asserting he\u2019d \u201cwork from early in the morning until late in the evening\u201d and \u201cmake many calls and have many meetings.\u201d His vice president was scheduled to convene a final meeting of the coronavirus task force. For Trump, there has been relatively little reminiscing about the past four years, according to people who have spoken to him. Although he often waxed nostalgic about his 2016 presidential campaign, the years he was actually president have inspired less fond memories. Instead, Trump has appeared embittered at those he believe deprived him a second term, from the \u201cdeep state\u201d to ruthless Democrats and disloyal members of his own party. On Monday, trucks from a Washington-based moving company pulled up at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s South Florida club, as his nights remaining in the White House dwindled to one. Trump to issue around 100 pardons and commutations Tuesday, sources say Ordinarily, presidents spent their final weeks in office looking to hone their legacy through exit interviews, policy speeches and the capstone farewell address, delivered in prime time for the largest possible audience. But after inciting a riot mob that stormed the US Capitol, Trump\u2019s aides have attempted to keep him away from any situation that could aggravate the situation further. That includes keeping Trump from any type of live, off-the-cuff scenario where he might reverse the carefully scripted work that went into his taped speeches last week condemning the insurrectionist violence and vowing a smooth transition. When Trump presented a final batch of Medals of Freedom this month, it occurred behind closed doors. All of his speeches have been taped by White House cameras, with aides watching closely to ensure Trump does not divert from his script. His only appearance in public has been a trip to the southern border last week. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks before his final departure from Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday, where a military-style ceremony is being planned. Invitations have gone out to Trump\u2019s friends, allies and former administration officials saying it will begin at 8 a.m. ET. Each invitee is allowed five guests; organizers hope to secure a large crowd because Trump has complained about the size of his gatherings in the past. At the moment, not even Vice President Mike Pence is not expected to attend the departure ceremony, according to two Pence sources. Logistically, the sources said it would be difficult for Pence to be there for Trump\u2019s sendoff and attend Biden\u2019s inaugural. In a sign the guest list may not have been carefully curated, Trump\u2019s former communications director turned critic, Anthony Scaramucci, was invited to the departure. He told CNN he did not plan to attend, but saw his invitation as a sign the White House was eager to bulk up the guest list. Other former officials who left the White House on rocky terms, including former chief of staff John Kelly and former White House counsel Don McGahn, also received invitations to the event but aren\u2019t planning to attend, sources told CNN. Kelly told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper he had other pressing commitments. One official familiar with the planning said organizers are anxious that a crowd will not materialize on Wednesday morning. But the official said the event would proceed anyway. While a number of potential events had been considered for Trump\u2019s final week in office celebrating his accomplishments, including on Middle East peace, regulatory reform and lowering taxes, none materialized. During his trip to the southern border to herald wall construction, Trump spoke for only 20 minutes. Aides once begged Trump to consider delivering a major speech ticking through his accomplishments, and there was even discussion about requesting a prime-time slot from television networks over the weekend, people familiar with the matter said. The talks appeared to go nowhere, and now Trump is not expected to make public remarks until the send-off ceremony at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday morning. Top Trump officials have pushed the President for two weeks to at least tape remarks touting some of his accomplishments in office. His wife, first lady Melania Trump, posted a similar video on Monday trumpeting her \u201cBe Best\u201d program and encouraging Americans to be kind to one another. But aides described Trump as seeming non-committal and disinterested in delivering the type of formal address to the nation that would provide an alternate accounting of a presidency ending in isolation and a second impeachment. How Trump's most consequential policies have changed America Advisers had hoped Trump could shift focus back to his governing record, even though many of his allies now believe his legacy is irrevocably tarred by his incitement of riots at the Capitol this month. He has focused his attention instead on his clemency powers, convening meetings on Sunday and Monday with advisers to go over a lengthy list of pending pardons and commutations that are expected on Tuesday. He has discussed pardons at length with his remaining team, enthusiastic to exercise one of the few unilateral powers of his office. The live prime-time farewell address is another presidential tradition gone by the wayside in the norm-busting Trump era. Ever since Harry Truman beamed into Americans\u2019 relatively new television sets from the Oval Office on January 15, 1953, the evening farewell address has been a fixture of a departing commander-in-chief\u2019s final days. Even Richard Nixon, the only president ever to resign, delivered a live address announcing his decision from behind the desk in the Oval Office, its iconic windows covered with blue drapes. Before the television era, the farewell address extended back to George Washington, who issued warnings against unchecked power and partisan entrenchment in a written address to the nation in 1796. Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all used the Oval Office for their farewell addresses. George H.W. Bush traveled outside of Washington to West Point for a departing address after failing to secure a second term. Barack Obama delivered his farewell speech inside McCormick Place convention center in Chicago, acknowledging in his hometown that after Trump\u2019s victory \u201cfor every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.\u201d But Trump has mostly dismissed the traditions that go along with leaving office. He has not contacted Biden and will be the first president in 150 years to boycott his successor\u2019s inauguration. Trump once marveled at the reception he received from President Barack Obama, who met with him in the Oval Office after the 2016 election and welcomed him to the White House on the morning of his inauguration. In the early days of his presidency, Trump liked to show visitors the letter Obama wrote him and left in the top drawer of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Trump would reciprocate that gesture. Aides said he hasn\u2019t written one yet. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s incoming administration plans to rescind the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office, two sources familiar with the decision tell CNN, delivering a win to an array of progressive organization and rolling back one of President Donald Trump\u2019s earliest moves. The decision was not included in a memo from incoming Biden chief of staff Ron Klain released on Saturday, but sources familiar with the move tell CNN that the Biden team intends to make the executive order one of the President-elect\u2019s first climate crisis actions.   The pipeline has long been a political hot button and Trump made it a political issue during the 2016 general election. The Keystone pipeline system current stretches more than 2,600 miles, carrying crude from Alberta, Canada, through Manitoba, Canada, and down into Texas. The Keystone XL portion, which has been protested and opposed by numerous indigenous groups, would run from Alberta to Nebraska and cut through Montana and North Dakota. The Supreme Court delivered a substantial blow to the project in 2020 when it cleared the way for several pipeline projects to be receive fast-tracked permits, but excluded the Keystone XL pipeline from that order. The decision on put a block on the cross-border pipeline was first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, citing a presentation that included \u201cRescind Keystone XL pipeline permit\u201d in the list of environmental executive actions Biden would take on his first day. The Biden transition declined to comment on the plans. A source familiar with the decision, however, said that the presentation reported by the CBC was weeks old. Trump signed executive actions at the outset of his administration that approved the Keystone XL pipeline, dispensing with plans from the Obama era to block construction.",

            "article_content": "Trying to pick the most notable lies from Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is like trying to pick the most notable pieces of junk from the town dump. There\u2019s just so much ugly garbage to sift through before you can make a decision. But I\u2019m qualified for the dirty job. I fact checked every word uttered by this President from his inauguration day in January 2017 until September 2020 \u2013 when the daily number of lies got so unmanageably high that I had to start taking a pass on some of his remarks to preserve my health. Trump got even worse after November 3. Since then, he has spent the final months of what has been a wildly dishonest presidency on a relentless and dangerous lying spree about the election he lost. As the country grapples with the deadly consequences of this deception, I\u2019ve selected the 15 Trump lies that stand out to me from his four years in power \u2013 for their importance, for their egregiousness, for their absurdity, or for what they say about the man. The most telling lie: It didn\u2019t rain on his inauguration Trump began his presidency by lying about the weather. It rained during Trump\u2019s inaugural address. Then, at a celebratory ball later that day, Trump told the crowd that the rain \u201cjust never came\u201d until he finished talking and went inside, at which point \u201cit poured.\u201d This was the first lie of Trump\u2019s presidency. Like his lies that same week about his inauguration crowd, it hinted at what would come next. The President would say things that we could see with our own eyes were not true. And he would often do this brazen lying for no apparent strategic reason. The most dangerous lie: The coronavirus was under control This was more like a family of lies than a single lie. But each one \u2013 the lie that the virus was equivalent to the flu; the lie that the situation was \u201ctotally under control\u201d; the lie that the virus was \u201cdisappearing\u201d \u2013 suggested to Americans that they didn\u2019t have to change much about their usual behavior. A year into the crisis, more than 386,000 Americans have died from the virus. We can\u2019t say with precision how the crisis would have unfolded differently if Trump had been more truthful. But it\u2019s reasonable to venture that his dishonesty led to a significant number of deaths. The most alarming lie saga: Sharpiegate Trump tweeted in 2019 that Alabama was one of the states at greater risk from Hurricane Dorian than had been initially forecast. The federal weather office in Birmingham then tweeted that, actually, Alabama would be unaffected by the storm. Not great, but fixable fast with a simple White House correction. Trump, however, is so congenitally unwilling to admit error that he embarked on an increasingly farcical campaign to prove that his incorrect Alabama tweet was actually correct, eventually showcasing a hurricane map that was crudely altered with a Sharpie. The slapstick might have been funny had White House officials not leaped into action behind the scenes to try to pressure federal weather experts into saying he was right and they were wrong. The saga proved that Trump was not some lone liar: he was backed by an entire powerful apparatus willing to fight for his fabrications. The most ridiculous subject of a lie: The Boy Scouts When I emailed the Boy Scouts of America in 2017 about Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cthe head of the Boy Scouts\u201d had called him to say that his bizarrely political address to the Scouts\u2019 National Jamboree was \u201cthe greatest speech that was ever made to them,\u201d I didn\u2019t expect a reply. One of the hardest things about fact checking Trump was that a lot of people he lied about did not think it was in their interest to be quoted publicly contradicting a vengeful president. The Boy Scouts did. A senior Scouts source \u2013 a phrase I never expected to have to type as a political reporter in Washington, DC \u2013 confirmed to me that no call ever happened. Yep, the President of the United States was lying about the Boy Scouts. The ugliest smear lie: Rep. Ilhan Omar supports al Qaeda At a White House event in 2019, Trump grossly distorted a 2013 quote from Rep. Ilhan Omar to try to get his supporters to believe that the Minnesota Democrat had expressed support for the terrorist group al Qaeda. Trump went on to deliver additional bigoted attacks against Omar in the following months. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a more vile lie for the President to tell about a Muslim official \u2013 who had already been getting death threats \u2013 than a smear that makes her sound pro-terrorist. The most boring serial lie: The trade deficit with China used to be $500 billion Trump, an incorrigible exaggerator, rarely chose to use an accurate number when he could instead use an inaccurate bigger number. So he said well over 100 times that, before his presidency, the US for years had a $500 billion annual trade deficit with China \u2013 though the actual pre-Trump deficit never even reached $400 billion. Trump made versions of the \u201c$500 billion\u201d claim so many times that it became almost physically painful for me to fact check it any more. The most entertaining lie shtick: The burly crying men who had never cried before They were almost always male. They were almost always large. They were almost always blue-collar. And, according to the President, they kept walking up to him crying tears of gratitude \u2013 even though they had almost always not previously cried for years. Trump\u2019s series of Tears Stories \u2013 which sometimes doubled as \u201cSir\u201d Stories \u2013 helped me understand his lying as a kind of performance art. The stories were oddly grandiose, like something you\u2019d hear from a two-bit foreign strongman. They were also pure shtick. Trump was like a touring stand-up comic, refining and re-using his favored dishonesty bits until they stopped working for him. The most traditional big lie: Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment to Stormy Daniels We\u2019ve established that Trump was not your traditional political liar. One of his distinguishing features is that he lied pointlessly, dissembling about trivial subjects for trivial reasons. But he also lied when he needed to. When he told reporters on Air Force One in 2018 that he did not know about a $130,000 payment to porn performer Stormy Daniels and that he did not know where his then-attorney Michael Cohen got the money for the payment, it was both audacious \u2013 Trump knew, because he had personally reimbursed Cohen \u2013 and kind of conventional: the President was lying to try to get himself out of a tawdry scandal. The biggest lie by omission: Trump ended family separation Much of Trump\u2019s lying was clumsy, half-baked. Some of it was almost art. Here\u2019s what he told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd in 2019 about his widely controversial policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border: \u201cYou know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it.\u201d Yes, Trump signed a 2018 order to end the family separation policy. What he did not mention to Todd is that what he had ended was his own policy \u2013 a plan announced by his own attorney general that had made family separation standard rather than occasional, as it had been under Obama. All of Trump\u2019s words in those two sentences to Todd were accurate in themselves. But he was lying because of what he left out. The most shameless campaign lie: Biden will destroy protections for pre-existing conditions Trump\u2019s re-election campaign was consistently and consciously dishonest, especially in its attempts to cast Joe Biden as a frightening radical.  When Trump claimed in September that Biden would destroy protections for people with pre-existing health conditions \u2013 though the Obama-Biden administration created the protections, though the protections were overwhelmingly popular, though Biden was running on preserving them, and though Trump himself had tried repeatedly to weaken them \u2013 Trump was not merely lying but turning reality upside down. The lie he fled: He got Veterans Choice Trump could have told a perfectly good factual story about the Veterans Choice health care program Obama signed into law in 2014: it wasn\u2019t good enough, so he replaced it with a more expansive program he signed into law in 2018. That\u2019s not the story he did tell \u2013 whether out of policy ignorance, a desire to erase Obama\u2019s legacy, or simply because he is a liar. Instead, he claimed over and over \u2013 more than 160 times before I lost count \u2013 that he is the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed after other presidents tried and failed for years. And why not stretch? He knew he probably wouldn\u2019t be challenged by a press corps drowning in other Trump drama. It wasn\u2019t until August 2020 that he was asked about the lie to his face. He promptly left the room. The Crazy Uncle lie award: Windmill noise causes cancer It was a problem for the country that the President was not only a conspiracy theorist himself but immersed in conspiracy culture, regularly stumbling upon ludicrous claims and then sharing them as fact. For such a fierce critic of the media\u2019s use of anonymous sources, Trump sure liked to use a lot of unnamed sources himself. His stories were full of nonsense he attributed to \u201cpeople\u201d or that he claimed \u201cthey\u201d say. One of the most bonkers \u201cthey say\u201d items: his 2019 declaration that \u201cthey say\u201d the noise from windmills \u201ccauses cancer.\u201d After Trump amplified another conspiracy lie in 2020, NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie admonished him by saying that \u201cyou\u2019re not, like, someone\u2019s crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever.\u201d Except he was, until Twitter took down his account. The most hucksterish lie: That plan was coming in two weeks Trump\u2019s big health care plan was eternally coming in \u201ctwo weeks.\u201d So were a bunch of other plans and announcements. Trump is, at his core, a huckster. Every moment of his presidency was a chance for him to sell someone on something, whether or not that something actually existed. And if they asked when they could actually see the magic elixir he said was being brewed just over there behind the curtain, he would just have to delay them until they forgot about it. My personal favorite lie: Trump was once named Michigan\u2019s Man of the Year Trump has never lived in Michigan. Why would he have been named Michigan\u2019s Man of the Year years before his presidency? He wouldn\u2019t have been. He wasn\u2019t. And yet this lie he appeared to have invented in the final week of his 2016 campaign became a staple of his 2020 campaign, repeated at Michigan rally after rally. It\u2019s so illustrative because it makes so little sense. The most depressing lie: Trump won the election Trump\u2019s long White House campaign against verifiable reality has culminated with his lie that he is the true winner of the 2020 presidential election he clearly, certifiably and fairly lost. To many of us, it\u2019s ludicrous nonsense. But to millions of deluded Americans, it\u2019s the truth. And it has now gotten people killed. The nation\u2019s truth problem, clearly, isn\u2019t just a Trump problem. With this last blizzard of deception and the Capitol insurrection it fomented, Trump has shown us, once more, just how detached from reality much of his political base has become \u2013 or always was.",

            "article_content": "When Tom Rice voted \u201cyes\u201d on the impeachment of Donald Trump over the President\u2019s role in inciting the riot that led to the storming of the US Capitol, most close congressional watchers assumed he had made a mistake. After all, there was little to indicate that the reliably conservative South Carolina Republican would join nine other colleagues in breaking with the President (and the party) to back impeaching Trump. Unlike Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyoming) and Adam Kinzinger (Illinois), Rice hadn\u2019t been an outspoken critic of Trump. And unlike Reps. John Katko (New York) and David Valadao (California), Rice doesn\u2019t represent a swing district. \u201cCompared to the often raucous members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, Rice has been more low-profile and focused on his legislative work,\u201d wrote the Almanac of American Politics of Rice, who has represented eastern South Carolina\u2019s 7th district since 2012. But Rice hadn\u2019t made a mistake or accidentally pressed the wrong button. His vote to impeach was real \u2013 and without question, the most surprising of the 10 Republicans who bucked the President. Capitol riot tears GOP apart as it seeks a return to power in 2022 Here\u2019s how Rice explained his vote: \u201cOnce the violence began, when the Capitol was under siege, when the Capitol Police were being beaten and killed, and when the Vice President and the Congress were being locked down, the President was watching and tweeted about the Vice President\u2019s lack of courage. \u201cFor hours while the riot continued, the President communicated only on Twitter and offered only weak requests for restraint \u2026 \u201c\u2026 It has been a week since so many were injured, the United States Capitol was ransacked, and six people were killed, including two police officers. Yet, the President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were \u2018perfectly appropriate.\u2019\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The combination of Trump\u2019s incitement of the crowd, his attacks on Vice President Mike Pence during the riot itself and his total lack of remorse over his role in the overrunning of the Capitol added up to be more than Rice could take. As he concluded his statement: \u201cI have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But this utter failure is inexcusable.\u201d A look back at Rice\u2019s past comments on Trump, particularly in the wake of last week\u2019s riots, provide some evidence that this move wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected. While Rice did vote in favor of the Electoral College objections raised by Republicans in Arizona and Pennsylvania, he expressed some misgivings about doing so in the wake of the Capitol violence. \u201cI am incredibly disappointed in the President,\u201d Rice told a local TV station last Wednesday. \u201cThe President needs to step up right now and say this election is over. I\u2019m tired of it. He needs to concede. He needs to say that this election is over and tell these folks to calm down.\u201d And Rice, despite representing a comfortably Republican seat, has resisted the urgings of some in the district to throw in his lot with the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 Trump\u2019s base within the House. \u201cDonald Trump was backed by an overwhelming majority in my district and in South Carolina,\u201d Rice said. \u201cAnd while I don\u2019t necessarily agree with his tactics, I agree with 95% of his policies.\u201d Perhaps the biggest previous indicator of Rice\u2019s impeachment vote comes in this quote from an interview in 2017 with the Charleston Post & Courier. \u201cPeople don\u2019t pay me for smiling,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThey pay me to get results.\u201d That\u2019s not the typical quote from a politician. And as Rice showed with his vote on Wednesday, he\u2019s no normal politician.",

            "article_content": "The House voted Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time in a swift and bipartisan condemnation of the President\u2019s role inciting last week\u2019s riot at the US Capitol. The House voted 232 to 197 to impeach Trump exactly one week after rioters forced lawmakers to flee from the very chamber in which they cast ballots in the fourth presidential impeachment in US history \u2013 and the first time a President has been impeached twice. Ten Republicans, including the House\u2019s No. 3 Republican, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, joined all Democrats to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d RELATED: How each member of the House voted on Trump\u2019s second impeachment While impeachment won\u2019t force Trump from office \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said Trump won\u2019t face his trial until after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in next week \u2013 the vote was a visceral response from lawmakers in both parties furious at Trump after a deadly pro-Trump mob overran Capitol Police, ransacked the US Capitol and put the lives of Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers in danger last week. \u201cWe know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor ahead of the vote. \u201cHe must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\u201d The speed of the vote and the Republican support underscores the fury that lawmakers feel about Trump\u2019s role inciting the rioters who overtook the Capitol, who were fueled by Trump\u2019s months of false rhetoric about the election being stolen from him. Cheney\u2019s statement was cited by impeachment supporters and detractors alike Wednesday after she charged that Trump \u201csummoned this mob, assembled the mob and lit the flame of this attack.\u201d LIVE UPDATES: House impeaches Trump after deadly Capitol riot \u201cThere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\u201d Cheney said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that Trump \u201cbears responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack on Congress by mob rioters,\u201d urging the President to accept his share of responsibility and \u201cquell the brewing unrest.\u201d McCarthy, however, argued the House should create a bipartisan commission instead of impeachment. \u201cI believe impeaching the President in such a short timeframe would be a mistake,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cNo investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held.\u201d The division within the Republican Party starkly contrasts the House Democrats\u2019 2019 impeachment of Trump, when House Republicans were united in opposition. The Republicans besides Cheney voting to impeach Trump on Wednesday were Reps. John Katko of New York, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Fred Upton of Michigan, Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, Dan Newhouse of Washington, Peter Meijer of Michigan, Tom Rice of South Carolina, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and David Valadao of California. Rice, a Republican from a conservative district who was not expected to vote for impeachment, said in a statement after the vote that it was the President\u2019s response to the riot that led him to cross the aisle. \u201cThe President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were \u2018perfectly appropriate,\u2019\u201d Rice said. \u201cI have backed this President through thick and thin for four years. I campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable,\u201d the South Carolina Republican added. In the Senate, McConnell is not planning to bring the Senate back for a trial before January 19, meaning the trial won\u2019t begin until Trump is out of office and Biden has been sworn in. The majority leader said in a statement following the vote that a trial could not be completed ahead of Biden\u2019s inauguration even if it started beforehand, and he wanted Congress and the executive branch to spend the next week focused on \u201cfacilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power.\u201d In a note to his GOP colleagues Wednesday afternoon, McConnell wrote, \u201cI have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\u201d McConnell has indicated he believes impeaching Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, sources said Tuesday. McConnell is facing a delicate balance \u2013 a number of his GOP colleagues have made clear they oppose impeachment and the Kentucky Republican famously loathes anything that divides his conference, according to a source familiar with the matter. But the source says McConnell is also keenly aware of the moment in history \u2013 and the moment for the Republican Party. McConnell\u2019s shift against Trump has been apparent for those watching him closely. He cut off contact with Trump weeks ago and has made clear he has no plans ever to speak to him again. For House Democrats, the disagreements that divided their caucus on impeachment in 2019 simply never materialized. Democrats quickly coalesced around using impeachment in the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency to serve as a proper response to the President\u2019s conduct and as a way to push for his removal from office before the end of his term, although that scenario looks unlikely. Pence sent a letter Tuesday saying he would not seek to invoke the 25th Amendment as Democrats had urged, and Trump is not considering resigning. Pelosi has brushed aside Republican efforts to take a different action, such as censure, in response to Trump\u2019s role in the riot. She named impeachment managers on Tuesday evening, a team of nine Democrats who will be led by Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, ahead of a likely trial not long after Biden is sworn in. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said late Tuesday the House would send the articles to the Senate immediately. Democrats only grew more resolute in their push to impeach Trump over the riot as more information has come out about the attack on the Capitol, including violent images of Capitol Police officers being attacked, and the death of a Capitol Police officer. Wednesday\u2019s vote occurred while thousands of National Guard troops were present every nook of the Capitol complex ahead of next week\u2019s inauguration, and they slept on the floors of the Capitol building the night before the impeachment vote. After the House vote, Trump released a video statement calling for calm as the threat of new riots \u2013 which Trump said he\u2019d been briefed on by the Secret Service \u2013 casts a pall over Washington. But he did not mention the historic impeachment that had occurred a few hours earlier. Trump has showed no contrition for his role in last week\u2019s Capitol riot, railing against impeachment on Tuesday in his first public remarks since the incident. A source close to the President said he\u2019s not considering resigning. \u201cIt\u2019s been analyzed,\u201d Trump said of his remarks last week to the crowd before the riots. \u201cPeople thought what I said was totally appropriate.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s impeachment vote will complicate the opening days of the Biden administration, both in his efforts to reach out to Republicans and because the Senate is likely to be tied up with a trial just as Biden is taking office. In a statement Wednesday evening, the President-elect noted that \u201cit was a bipartisan vote cast by members who followed the Constitution and their conscience,\u201d before turning to the pandemic. \u201cThis nation also remains in the grip of a deadly virus and a reeling economy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\u201d Biden is still awaiting word on whether the Senate will be able to do an impeachment trial alongside Cabinet confirmation hearings and Covid-19 relief legislation. Aides say Biden and his team are working behind the scenes with Senate Democrats \u2013 and House impeachment managers \u2013 to keep the impeachment trial as swift as possible, although the length remains an open question. Both Biden and Schumer have argued that the Senate will try to divide its days, so the Senate can confirm Biden\u2019s nominees and consider Covid-19 stimulus legislation while also carrying out the impeachment trial. House impeachment managers are just starting to lay out their strategy for the case they plan to bring and are wary about stepping on the first days of Biden\u2019s presidency. Several managers told CNN decisions have not been made over a key issue: Whether to seek witnesses and attempt to subpoena documents for the trial, which could prolong it. But McConnell indicating he\u2019s in no rush to bring the Senate back early into session, House managers have more time to begin their strategy sessions. Raskin told CNN that they are still assessing whether to seek witnesses. One possible witness is Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The article of impeachment references Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against the official to \u201cfind\u201d the votes necessary to overturn Biden\u2019s win in the state. Asked if Raffensperger would be called as a witness, Rep. Madeleine Dean, one of nine impeachment managers, said she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to preview\u201d the case and they were only just beginning organizational meetings. Democrats, though, seem to be wary about starting the trial on the same day Biden is sworn into office. \u201cCertainly not,\u201d Dean said when asked if it would be a good idea to start on January 20. \u201cThe President and vice president deserve (their day)\u2026 We have to restore a peaceful transfer of power which Donald Trump deliberately incited people against.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "The fateful moment when the House of Representatives on Wednesday impeaches President Donald Trump for a second time will rank among the defining moments of America\u2019s story long after the citizens enduring these harrowing, tragic days are gone. Fast-moving developments in the run-up to the vote have left Trump more politically vulnerable than he has ever been. At least a handful of House Republicans plan to vote with Democrats to impeach. In another startling sign that Trump\u2019s incitement of a mob assault on Congress has shattered rigid political alignments right at the end of his term, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he believes that impeachment will make it easier to rid the party of Trumpism. By the end of the day, Trump will be saddled with a stain he will never be able to erase, as the first President to be impeached twice after his refusal to admit his election defeat shattered assumptions on the unassailability of stable government and the previously unbroken chain of peaceful US transfers of power. Save for the fracturing of the union before the Civil War, this country\u2019s system of political checks and balances has never before been under the kind of strain imposed by an autocratic President desperate to cling to power. A sense of unfolding history is magnified by growing evidence that America is fighting for democracy itself in a struggle that will endure after Trump leaves office next week at the latest. New warnings of violence by pro-Trump extremists in 50 states and militias on the march toward Washington are instigating the most oppressive sense since 9/11 that the homeland is under threat. But this time the danger to US freedom comes not from a foreign terrorist group but radicalized Americans. McConnell believes impeachment push will help rid Trump from the GOP, but has not said if he will vote to convict The sole article of impeachment that the House is expected to pass Wednesday charging Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors is damning. Its simple clarity explains why this impeachment is no mere futile partisan ritual in the waning days of the most aberrant presidency in history. \u201cDonald John Trump, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law,\u201d the article reads It is an extraordinary mark of turbulent times and a lawless term that Trump will become the first president to be impeached twice \u2013 only 13 months after the House first resolved that his abuses of power merited removal from office. In a poetic twist, the vote will take place in the very same chamber that lawmakers fled a week ago in fear of their lives from an invading mob seeking to harm Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and to thwart the transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. In time, the events of this disorienting week will take their place alongside milestones \u2013 including the Declaration of Independence, the abolition of slavery, Pearl Harbor and the assassination of President John Kennedy \u2013 that make up America\u2019s sweeping narrative. But history is experienced in retrospect. Current events are lived forward in all their alarming intensity and are frightening because no one knows how they will end. And the country\u2019s nerves were already at a breaking point nearly a year into a once-in-a-century pandemic that has brought death and sickness and further deepened stark political divides. The formal impeachment vote in the House is far from the only barely believable twist leading up to Biden\u2019s inauguration in seven days. The horror of last week\u2019s events and their grave implications are becoming even clearer as more details emerge about the day when a sitting President incited partisans to assault another branch of government in the act of finalizing his election defeat. The idea that the rampage in which five people died was just a political outburst that got out of control was debunked Tuesday by the serious tone of a news conference held by the acting district attorney in Washington. \u201cI think people are going to be shocked with some of the egregious contact that happened within the Capitol,\u201d Michael Sherwin said, referencing \u201cmind-blowing\u201d cases and charges including sedition and conspiracy. He said that some of those charged had military backgrounds.   One federal law enforcement official said the videos and other information viewed by investigators paint a scary picture of events inside the Capitol as police and federal agents battled to save lawmakers and staff. \u201cIt was armed combat in that building,\u201d the official said. Some of the hardening of opinion among lawmakers against Trump may be attributed to briefings on those events and the pending threats to the inauguration. After emerging from an all-senators briefing on inauguration security, Sen. Chris Van Hollen raised the specter of a \u201cmillion militia march\u201d on Washington. \u201cWe have no idea how many will come. We need to be prepared,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. In another unfathomable moment on Tuesday, America\u2019s most senior military leaders warned there was no place for extremism in the ranks and that the troops must support and defend the Constitution. The statement was remarkable in itself. But that the Joint Chiefs decided it needed to be issued in the first place was one of the more frightening events of recent days. In a simultaneous political earthquake, McConnell, who tethered his now-destroyed Republican majority to the bucking bronco of Trump\u2019s presidency, made it known he was glad the President would be impeached. McConnell\u2019s unexpected move, first reported by The New York Times, came amid his disgust at the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters and in the belief that another impeachment would help Republicans purge the stain of this presidency from the party. McConnell didn\u2019t say how he would vote in a Senate trial. But his shift keeps open the long-shot chance that sufficient Republicans could join a two-thirds majority to secure the first-ever conviction in a presidential impeachment. READ: The House of Representatives' article of impeachment against Donald Trump In the House, Wyoming\u2019s Rep. Liz Cheney, a staunch conservative, announced that she would vote for Trump\u2019s impeachment, enshrining the split with her fellow members of the GOP House leadership. \u201cThere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,\u201d Cheney said. Two other Republicans, Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and John Katko of New York, also said they would vote to impeach, with a number of their GOP colleagues expected to follow suit in a vote that will echo through history, sources told CNN. In another development that exacerbated the feeling of history unspooling at a breakneck pace, Pence wrote to the House to formally refuse to join the Cabinet in invoking the 25th Amendment to declare Trump no longer able to fulfill the duties of his office. \u201cI do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution,\u201d Pence wrote, after Democratic leaders had warned that an intervention by the vice president would be the only step that could hold off Wednesday\u2019s impeachment vote. Final days bring new urgency to Trump's desire to pardon himself and his children Action inside the Capitol came as security forces poured into Washington to secure Biden\u2019s inauguration and Trump noticeably dodged an opportunity to cool tensions. While he said he never wants violence, the President used a trip to his border wall in Texas on Tuesday to reinforce the falsehoods and inflammatory language that ultimately led to his second impeachment. He branded the process \u201ca continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics\u201d and warned it was \u201ccausing tremendous anger\u201d and was \u201cdangerous\u201d for America at a \u201cvery tender time.\u201d In more ominous comments, Trump said talk of using the 25th Amendment to oust him from office bore no peril for him but could come back to haunt Biden. \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d the President warned. Trump also defended his remarks last week at a rally close to the White House that ended with his crowd marching on the Capitol. With only seven days left in office, the President\u2019s mind is also turning again to a controversial raft of pardons that would constitute yet another abuse of power. CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel, Pamela Brown and Kara Scannell reported Tuesday that the President is continuing to discuss pardons for himself and his adult children. One source said such a move was considered even more likely since last week\u2019s events, although there was concern among some aides and allies about the public perception of pardons after the deaths of five people in the riot. Such a move by the President would be seen in the United States and around the world as yet another insult to democracy. The historic damage that Trump has already inflicted upon America\u2019s reputation in this regard is incalculable. But the stakes surrounding Wednesday\u2019s vote and what will be a prolonged struggle during the Biden administration to bolster US political institutions can be seen in remarks coming out of authoritarian Russia \u2013 the American adversary that interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to help Trump. \u201cFollowing the events that unfolded after the presidential elections, it is meaningless to refer to America as the example of democracy,\u201d said Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian Parliament and a supporter of President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe are on the verge of reevaluating the standards that are being promoted by the United States of America, that is exporting its vision of democracy and political systems around the world. Those in our country who love to cite their example as leading will also have to reconsider their views.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. We\u2019re looking at a second impeachment of President Donald Trump. The process will be different this time, both for the lawmakers sitting in judgment of Trump and for the man himself. One thing we know: He\u2019ll stay in office and likely finish out his term, because it takes a Senate conviction to remove him. Get the latest impeachment coverage here. One big change. Here\u2019s a New York Times report that suggests Mitch McConnell, who protected Trump from impeachment in the Senate last time, is \u201chappy\u201d about it now. More from CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Phil Mattingly, Jim Acosta and Kaitlan Collins: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes that impeaching President Donald Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. Another person with direct knowledge told CNN there\u2019s a reason McConnell has been silent on impeachment as other Republicans have pushed back: he\u2019s furious about last week\u2019s attack on the US Capitol by the President\u2019s supporters, even more so that Trump has shown no contrition. His silence has been deliberate as he leaves open the option of supporting impeachment. Caveat. Let\u2019s see if McConnell votes to punish Trump in a trial. That\u2019s the real test. How bizarre is this? For context, CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson writes, \u201cIt took 200 years for the country to rack up its first two presidential impeachments. Trump\u2019s malfeasance has led the country down that awful, divisive path twice in just more than a year.\u201d (Reminder: Those first two were for Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.) The House timeline then: 86 days separated Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukraine\u2019s President and his impeachment by Democrats in December of 2019. There was a closed-door investigation, a public inquiry and a written report. The House timeline now: 7 days separate Trump\u2019s incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol and his likely impeachment Wednesday. There\u2019s no need for a drawn-out investigation. Trump did what he did live on TV. And then the riot happened. The House votes then: Back then the party circled around its President, who was up for reelection and had a year left in office. The House votes now: House GOP leaders are treating the vote as a matter of conscience, as Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican, put it. Cheney said late Tuesday that she will vote to impeach. Her statement is here. It\u2019s possible 10 or more Republicans could join Democrats and vote for impeachment. Related: CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes that Liz Cheney has become the conscience of the House GOP. After he\u2019s impeached, Trump will face a Senate trial, though it\u2019s not clear how quickly that will move along. But while the Ukraine trial was an all-consuming affair, now Democrats want to split the days, hoping to conduct a trial part of the day and work on business \u2013 confirming Biden Cabinet members and addressing Covid during the other part. The consequences now. The biggest difference this time is it will be a trial of a former president and if he\u2019s convicted, additional Senate votes could bar him from office in the future and end his post-presidential perks. Utah\u2019s Sen. Mitt Romney was pilloried by fellow Republicans for standing up against Trump in his Ukraine impeachment trial. He could have company this year, when the Senate holds its trial. Read more about the process and how this accelerated one will set its own special precedent. What\u2019s Trump say? The President asserted in Alamo, Texas, at an event to commemorate his effort to build a border wall that this new impeachment is connected to the old one: \u201cThe impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the U.S.A., especially at this tender time.\u201d So that\u2019s not going to quiet any of the unrest. What is the GOP penance? Trump bears responsibility for the riot, but it\u2019s clearly evolved beyond him. And GOP leaders like McConnell may be looking to purge the GOP of him. But that effort will have to be followed by action, after the GOP spent more than four years enabling Trump in pursuit of his loyal base. What might have been: Imagine if McConnell had been crosswise to Trump\u2019s efforts to block Biden before the election rather than waiting for Trump to deny the election. One wonders how things might look now. Bottom line: We\u2019re still going to be talking about Trump for a while after he leaves office January 20. The result might be some punishment for his lies and actions, but further focus on Trump will come much to the disappointment of Joe Biden, who would very much like to move on. Impeachment is the political world reckoning. There\u2019s also a reckoning in the business world. How long will pro-Trump GOP lawmakers be in the corporate penalty box? CNN\u2019s Matt Egan writes that corporate America \u2013 Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Facebook, Microsoft \u2013 is suspending political donations. Airbnb, Amazon, Verizon and CNN owner AT&T won\u2019t support the Republicans who tried to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. But in this show of severing ties to the fringe of the GOP, the true test will come when Biden sets his sights on corporate tax rates. Read more. Trump\u2019s bottom line. His personal banker (Signature Bank) and his biggest lender (Deutsche Bank) are both severing ties. Read more. The grassroots militia movement beneath Trump, which Republicans often tap into, appears to be entrenched and frighteningly beyond anyone\u2019s control. Unheeded warnings about Capitol siege. The FBI\u2019s Norfolk, Virginia, office warned of a violent \u201cwar\u201d at the US Capitol in an internal report issued a day before last week\u2019s deadly invasion, but it wasn\u2019t acted on urgently enough to prevent the domestic terrorist attack, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is leaving America in a vortex of violence, sickness and death and more internally estranged than it has been for 150 years. The disorientating end to his shocking term has the nation reeling from a Washington insurrection. The FBI warned Monday of armed protests by pro-Trump thugs in 50 states, which raise the awful prospect of a domestic insurgency. Lawmakers have been briefed about a plot to surround the US Capitol by extremists inspired by Trump\u2019s false and dangerous claims the election was stolen. Health officials fear 5,000 Americans could soon be dying every day from the pandemic Trump ignored. Hospitals are swamped and medical workers are shattered amid a faltering rollout of the vaccine supposed to end the crisis. It took 200 years for the country to rack up its first two presidential impeachments. Trump\u2019s malfeasance has led the country down that awful, divisive path twice in just more than a year. With House Democrats expected to formally impeach the President for inciting a mob assault on Congress on Wednesday, he will rely on the Republican enablers who refused to rein in his lawlessness to save him from conviction again.   Millions of Americans have bought into the delusional, poisoned fiction that an election Trump lost was stolen, and there are signs that some police and military forces have been radicalized by the grievance he stokes. The city Trump has called home for four years is being turned into an armed camp incongruous with the mood of joy and renewal that pulsates through most inaugurations. In a symbol of a democracy under siege, the people\u2019s buildings \u2013 the White House and the US Capitol \u2013 are caged behind ugly iron and cement barriers. This is the legacy President-elect Joe Biden will inherit in eight days when he swears to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution \u2013 an oath that Trump trampled when inciting the Capitol attack last week from behind a bulletproof screen while buckling the cherished US chain of peaceful transfers of power. With unintended irony, Biden\u2019s team has picked \u201cAmerica United\u201d as the inaugural theme \u2013 a motto that is now more apt in defining Biden\u2019s hoped for destination rather than the splintered land he will begin to lead. Pence and Trump finally speak after post-riot estrangement It is becoming ever more obvious that the horrific scenes on Capitol Hill on Wednesday were not a one-off. Instead, they now look part of a pattern including the White supremacist marches in Charlottesville that Trump refused to condemn, and the gassing of peaceful anti-racist protesters in the square outside the White House so he could hold an inflammatory photo-op. In a chilling new warning, the FBI revealed the possible next stage in this now nationwide wave of radicalization, saying armed protests were planned at state Capitols in all 50 states between January 16 and Inauguration Day, January 20. Even as a nationwide sweep widens for the perpetrators of last week\u2019s outrage, the bureau said new protests were planned for Washington for three days around the inauguration. There are threats of an uprising if Trump is removed by way of the 25th Amendment. The FBI said it was also tracking threats against Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In Washington, two Capitol Police officers were suspended and more are under investigation for allegedly helping the mob. Rep. Conor Lamb told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Tuesday that lawmakers had been warned about a plan by extremists to encircle Congress as well as more threats against legislators. \u201cThey were talking about 4,000 armed \u2018patriots\u2019 to surround the Capitol and prevent any Democrat from going in,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democrat said. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was shocked by the magnitude of the bureau\u2019s intelligence on possible new violence. \u201cI don\u2019t think in the entire scope of my career working counter terrorism issues for many, many years, I don\u2019t think I ever saw a bulletin go out that concerned armed protest activity in 50 states in a three- or four-day period,\u201d McCabe said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d Biden told reporters that despite the warnings, he was not afraid of taking the oath of office outside next week \u2013 but the combination of a massive security effort to protect him from Trump\u2019s supporters and social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic mean his will be the most hollowed out inauguration in years. Trump\u2019s acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf resigned on Monday, in a yet another sign that the country lacks effective government at a moment of stark danger. By contrast, senior officials from the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration worked closely together in the Situation Room on January 20, 2009, when there was concern about the authenticity of terror threat to the inauguration. So far, after a massive domestic terror attack on the citadel of US democracy, there has been no major public briefing by any major federal law enforcement agency or the White House, an omission that fosters a sense of an absent government. The current atmosphere of fear and wild political insurrection are a lesson in what happens when a figure as powerful as a President deliberately tears at America\u2019s deep racial and social fault lines as a tool of his own power. Trump\u2019s presidency revealed a new insight about the all-powerful modern presidency \u2013 the character of the person in the Oval Office chair really matters. House Democrats plan to vote Wednesday to impeach Trump Momentum towards impeachment is now all but unstoppable in the House after Pelosi rejected a suggestion from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of some kind of censure motion. McCarthy did acknowledge to Republican caucus members Monday that the President bore some responsibility for last week\u2019s insurrection, according to a person familiar with the call. But some of his other responses to the outrage \u2013 an overhaul to the electoral certification process and legislation to promote voter confidence \u2013 hinted at the insincerity of the Republican approach. With a few exceptions, Republicans \u2013 who indulged and in many cases supported Trump\u2019s blatantly false claims of electoral fraud for weeks \u2013 have responded to the uproar over last week\u2019s Capitol attack by complaining that by pushing impeachment, Democrats are fracturing national unity. It\u2019s as if the last four years never happened. There are also questions over whether Republicans understand the seriousness of last week\u2019s events. Remarks by Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt are still reverberating through the Capitol. \u201cMy personal view is that the President touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again,\u201d Blunt said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d His comment eerily recalled the rationalizations of Republicans who declined to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial after he tried to get Ukraine to interfere in the election to damage Biden. America has emerged from many dark periods since the Civil War. The country was torn by resistance to the Civil Rights movement. And the Vietnam War turned generations against one another. But the fact that millions of people now appear to deeply mistrust the electoral system that is the basis of US democracy means that the country\u2019s internal political cohesion is now being tested as it has rarely been in the last century-and-a-half. And the Republican indulgence of the President\u2019s repeated political arson has revealed a massive constitutional blind spot. When one party\u2019s lawmakers are in thrall to a strongman leader, their duty to ensure checks and balances to constrain presidential power is soon forgotten. Trump has not appeared in public for days. And the suspension of his social media accounts amid concern that he could stir up more violence mean the country has been unable to assess his mood. But the President is due to make a trip to visit the border wall that he said Mexico would pay for but instead saddled the taxpayers with the bill. White House sources said that the President is determined to spend his last full week in office touting his achievements and is expected to release another round of controversial pardons. CNN reported Monday that former Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone have advised the President not to attempt what would be yet another epic abuse of power \u2013 an attempt to pardon himself. The virus is meanwhile running rampant. Eleven states and Washington, DC, just recorded their highest 7-day average of new cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. For the first time, the country is averaging over 3,000 deaths from the pandemic per day. Trump\u2019s outgoing head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Dr. Robert Redfield warned in a recent interview with McClatchy newspapers that the pandemic would get worse for the rest of January and parts of February and that the country could see 5,000 deaths a day. And hopes that the nation could soon turn a corner are being tempered by the glitches in the vaccine roll out. Just as with the early stages of the crisis, poor coordination between federal and local and state authorities and the overall lack of a broader distribution plan are hampering the effort. Like everything else, it will be up to Biden to fix it.",

The more new video we see of the storming of the Capitol by Trump-inspired rioters, the more aggravating it becomes. Specifically, the violent dragging of a Capitol Police officer from his perch into the mob to be beaten is incredible and sickening. The Capitol Police officer distracting charging rioters from the Senate floor is heroic and affirming. More to come in all 50 states. CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen reports: The FBI has received information indicating \u201carmed protests\u201d are being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington, DC in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration on January 20, according to an internal bulletin obtained by CNN. \u201cArmed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from 16 January through at least 20 January, and at the US Capitol from 17 January through 20 January,\u201d it says. The bulletin, which was circulated after rioters stormed the US Capitol last week, also suggests there are threats of an \u201cuprising\u201d if President Donald Trump is removed via the 25th Amendment before Inauguration Day. Justice moves slowly. Nearly a week later, I am struck by the slow roll of accountability. The FBI and Department of Justice have promised accountability and the FBI has asked for the public\u2019s help identifying the rioter who brought a massive Confederate flag into the building, among many others. Hundreds could ultimately be charged, but we have not seen charges for crimes against the nation, like insurrection. At least not yet. Perhaps these more consequential charges will follow. Related: Arrests so far A leaderless country. Trump, without Twitter, is silent. Vice President Mike Pence, who will apparently not try to invoke the 25th Amendment, is running out the clock. They finally spoke Monday. Rather than focus on any of these pressing issues, Trump is going Tuesday to Alamo, Texas \u2013 not to be confused with The Alamo \u2013 to talk about the border wall as his last stand. Trump\u2019s Cabinet continues to shrink. Chad Wolf, the acting Homeland Security secretary, resigned Monday, a little more than a week before the inauguration his agency is meant to secure. After years of bad leadership from Trump, we\u2019re learning what it\u2019s like to have no leadership at all \u2013 and during a deadly pandemic killing thousands every day, a botched vaccine rollout and an attempt to overthrow the next government. Finger-pointing is in full effect. Steven Sund, the Capitol Police chief who resigned after his fortress was overrun, told The Washington Post the House and Senate sergeants-at arms, who have also both resigned, didn\u2019t want the optics of a standoff in place beforehand. Jake Tapper pressed National Guard Chief Gen. Daniel Hokanson about the allegation. He tried to explain why it took hours to mobilize the troops. This gets awkward. Watch it. Nobody seems to agree on what happened. The Pentagon argued Friday night in a timeline that DC and Capitol Police didn\u2019t request enough backup beforehand and specifically didn\u2019t want armed National Guardsmen involved. The result was thousands of rioters swarming 1,400 Capitol Police officers and Sund said he thinks pipe bombs were set nearby to distract officers as the main assault force approached the West Front. \u201cAs soon as they hit the fence line, the fight was on,\u201d Sund said. \u201cViolent confrontations from the start. They came with riot helmets, gas masks, shields, pepper spray, fireworks, climbing gear \u2014 climbing gear! \u2014 explosives, metal pipes, baseball bats. I have never seen anything like it in 30 years of events in Washington.\u201d This story of the Pentagon version vs. the Capitol and DC police is going to continue. One thing is for sure: This city is going to be crawling with thousands of armed police and National Guardsmen on Inauguration Day. DC\u2019s mayor wants you to stay away. I spent a good portion of the day distracted by the calls to invoke the 14th Amendment against lawmakers, and potentially Trump, for their roles inciting the insurrection. Enacted in the wake of the Civil War to impose national standards of rights \u2013 natural-born citizenship, equal protection under the laws \u2013 the amendment also prohibits people who have taken an oath to protect the Constitution from serving in office after they\u2019ve engaged in \u201cinsurrection or rebellion\u201d against the country. There\u2019s an effort, led by freshman Rep. Cori Bush, to apply it against sitting members of Congress, like Rep. Mo Brooks, who spoke at Trump\u2019s rally, or even Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, the senators who gave objections to the Electoral College life in the Senate. It could be invoked against Trump if he tried to run again. It would be a novel use of the amendment, Indiana University law professor Gerard Magliocca told me. He, conveniently, has just written a paper on the amnesty from the 14th Amendment that Congress ultimately gave Confederates after the Civil War. He said we can\u2019t entirely separate that from what happened last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally remote from what just happened. There weren\u2019t even people with Confederate flags that entered the Capitol during the Civil War. So there is a kind of comparison you could make \u2013 this (the 14th Amendment) is an outgrowth of the Civil War and now you see the emblems of the Civil War being used in this event on Wednesday.\u201d Read the full story here. Here\u2019s the argument from Frank Bowman and Brian Kalt, the overall impeachment historical experts, in The Washington Post, that Trump can and maybe should be impeached after he leaves office, which is technically called a \u201clate impeachment.\u201d \u201cThe two most important reasons to pursue a late impeachment are, first, to deter presidents\u2019 misbehavior during their waning days in office, and second, to permanently remove them from public life if their conduct suggests they would pose a continuing danger to the country if they ever returned to a position of national authority.\u201d Reminder: The House can impeach the President with a simple majority. The Senate has a much higher bar to remove him from office. It would take an additional Senate vote or votes to bar him from future office and remove his pension, as Daniel Dale writes. Even an impeached and banned Trump could have some power, writes CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten. He\u2019s still got all that money he\u2019s been raising off the fiction of election fraud. And he could continue to do so in the future. Toxic Trump. Trump\u2019s avenues to bring in cash are being limited by the backlash to his behavior, writes CNN Business\u2019 Chris Isidore. He\u2019s lost a major golf tournament. It\u2019s not clear if banks will lend him money. And that\u2019s just the beginning.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is set to torment America up to and even beyond his final hours in power with Democrats moving inexorably towards making him the first President to be impeached twice after he incited a mob assault on Congress. The horror of last week\u2019s attack on the citadel of US democracy is only growing as frightening new details emerge of the chaos and anarchy inside the US Capitol and fears mount of more violence by radicalized Trump supporters and right-wing extremists in the run-up to Joe Biden being inaugurated as the 46th president next week. Trump\u2019s actions have again put the nation on the traumatic path of impeachment \u2013 an always contentious process that leaves its own bitter legacy of political pain. Before Trump came to Washington, only two Presidents had been impeached in the near two-and-a-half century history of the United States. He is now staring at the shameful distinction of being impeached by the House of Representatives twice in just over a year \u2013 a sequence that will leave a deep scar in Washington for a generation \u2013 not least because despite his aberrant behavior, Trump retains strong support among Republican lawmakers because of his near mystical hold on the party\u2019s populist base. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democrats will first implore Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the President unable to fulfill his duties. If, as expected, Pence and the Cabinet balk at that step, Democrats will again unleash the inexorable machinery of impeachment less than a year after Trump\u2019s previous acquittal of high crimes and misdemeanors in a Senate trial. Democrats introduced a resolution to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection on Monday morning. The single charge points to Trump\u2019s repeated false claims that he won the election and his speech to the crowd on January 6 before pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol. It also cited Trump\u2019s call with the Georgia Republican secretary of state where the President urged him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes for Trump to win the state.   But the compressed calendar as Trump enters his last nine days in office \u2013 and the reticence of Republicans in the Senate, who are faced one again with a loyalty test they have always failed when choosing between Trump\u2019s base and the Constitution \u2013 seems certain to thwart Democratic efforts to quickly eject Trump from power. This means the drama surrounding Trump\u2019s fate, and the possibility of another Senate trial, could outlast his presidency and his turbulent term could cast a toxic shadow over President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s first days in office. The aftershocks of the breaching of the US Capitol are being exacerbated by disturbing new accounts and footage of alarming scenes inside the insurrection that suggested an even worse tragedy was only narrowly averted. But it was also an eerily quiet weekend. For the first time in years, Americans were spared the extreme rhetoric and tantrums of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed after the social media platform muzzled the President over fears of more violence. As he begins his last full week in office, Trump is scheming to reclaim his megaphone with plans for a trip to visit his border wall \u2014 a concept that was one of the earliest precursors of his divisive presidency. The White House is also readying a new attempt to rein in big social media firms that have purged Trump after his inflammatory posts. And Trump is expected to unleash new and controversial pardons that may further test the rule of law before his time is up. The day America realized how dangerous Donald Trump is Critical mass is building in the House behind the Democratic drive to impeach Trump over his extraordinary assault on the US political system last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to seek unanimous consent Monday morning for a resolution calling on Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Trump is no longer fit to carry out his duties. In the almost certain event the gambit fails, she will call the House back for a full vote on Tuesday. Should Pence not act within 24 hours, Democrats will embark on the historic path towards a second impeachment. \u201cIn protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to her Democratic colleagues. \u201cAs the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.\u201d Democrats are justifying the unprecedented push for a second impeachment on the grounds that after his most flagrant abuse of power yet, Trump presents a stark danger to the country and the world and must be removed immediately. Another motivating factor is that a conviction in a Senate trial would likely bar Trump from ever seeking public office again. They parry critiques that such a late-term impeachment would be academic by arguing that Trump\u2019s crime against the Constitution cannot go unpunished. Trump's final days put the country at a dangerous crossroad But the complications of the timeline threaten to undercut the impeachment push. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a memo that the unlikelihood of securing unanimous consent to break a Senate recess meant that, practically, the earliest date a Senate trial could begin would be January 20, the day Biden takes the oath of office and control of the chamber will switch after Democrats won to Georgia runoffs last week. While it may seem strange that Senate rules would take precedence over a moment of rare national peril, this would mean Democrats would spend the start of a new presidency burning days or even weeks seeking to convict a President who has already left office. That scenario would not only complicate Biden\u2019s hopes of quickly turning Trump\u2019s poisoned page in US history, it would slow a desperately needed economic relief package and an effort by the new White House to muster a national fight against a pandemic that is worsening by the hour amid fears of a new more transmissible mutant strain of the coronavirus and the Trump team\u2019s misfiring vaccine rollout. House Majority Whip James Clyburn suggested a workaround for that contingency on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, when he said Pelosi may not immediately transmit one or more articles of impeachment to the Senate to trigger the process of a trial.   \u201cIt just so happens that if it didn\u2019t go over there for 100 days, it could \u2013 let\u2019s give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running, and maybe we\u2019ll send the articles sometime after that,\u201d the South Carolina Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. This approach would satisfy the imperative Democrats feel to inflict serious costs on the President for his shocking conduct. But it would undercut their rationale that the peril posed by Trump is so acute that he must be removed now with only a week or so left in the White House. It also seems doubtful that the passage of three months would make it any more likely that sufficient Senate Republicans would join Democrats in building the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump. And a trial, possibly featuring the President\u2019s unmoored attorney Rudy Giuliani, would give Trump the opportunity to emerge from effective internal exile in Florida and corral the GOP behind him in what might turn into a circus. Still, the strength of Democratic outrage is such that it may be impossible for Pelosi or Biden to hold off an impeachment vote \u2014 even if it would cause logistical and political problems down the line. There is no sign that Pence, despite being the target of pro-Trump rioters who chanted that he should be executed, is ready to lead an attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment. Sources have told CNN, however, that he is holding the option in reserve in case the President \u2014 from whom he is now estranged \u2014 resorted to more extreme action. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta reported that Pence and his aides are hoping to provide a bridge to the Biden administration and to offer the incoming team as much help as possible in dealing with the pandemic. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reported Sunday that Biden\u2019s team is working to find a middle ground to avoid the early days of his presidency being bogged down by another Trump impeachment. While Biden is not standing in the House\u2019s way, his team is also floating a possible censure of the President by Congress, through the impeachment train seems to be steaming off down the tracks. There is more backing within the House Democratic caucus for impeaching Trump now than there was in 2019, Pelosi has told her members. Among Republicans, Trump\u2019s malevolent behavior last week is further dividing the party. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who has the luxury of criticizing Trump since he is not seeking another term, said the best solution would be for the President to resign.   \u201cI think at this point, with just a few days left, it\u2019s the best path forward, the best way to get this person in the rearview mirror for us that could happen immediately. I\u2019m not optimistic it will,\u201d Toomey said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Toomey said he thought that Trump had committed impeachable offenses but was unsure if a viable process to convict him was possible. The Pennsylvania senator said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his colleagues like Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas needed to resort to soul searching after supporting Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d that he won the election. \u201cThat\u2019s going to \u2026 haunt them for a very long time,\u201d Toomey said. Many other Republicans were silent on Trump\u2019s behavior, as a flurry of conservative commentators appeared more concerned at a sudden loss of Twitter followers. It was unclear whether the departures were the result of purges against extremists by social media firms or if Trump supporters quit platforms in solidarity with their banned leader. While many Democratic senators have expressed support for an attempt to remove Trump, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia cautioned that judicial rather than political punishments were the correct response to Trump\u2019s insurrection. \u201cJoe Biden, first thing he needs to do, put his people in, get them confirmed. That should be the first thing we\u2019re doing the first week. And then get people vaccinated, and then get people back to work and get businesses opened up,\u201d Manchin said on \u201cState of the Union. \u201cHe\u2019s got an awful lot on his plate right now. And I\u2019m not sure that the impeachment route is the way that he can put that back together.\u201d Maneuvering on Capitol Hill unfolded against a backdrop of regular arrests as the FBI and local law enforcement officials tracked down the brazen perpetrators of an assault that resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer. An Iowa man named Doug Jensen, for instance, who allegedly led a mob after a Black police officer in the Capitol, is among many now facing federal charges. Shocking new details, meanwhile, emerged of the narrow escape some lawmakers had from the onrushing mob. And stories are still coming out about threats and violence perpetrated against journalists in the chaos. Trump, however, is showing no sign of repentance. He only ordered the flag on top of the White House to half-staff to honor slain Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick on Sunday after a barrage of media criticism. Another officer who was in the fray on Wednesday, Howard Liebengood, died while off duty and was also honored. The cause of his death has not be released.",

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that he was stunned at the storming of the US Capitol by pro-Trump forces last week because he hadn\u2019t thought that people took the President \u201cliterally.\u201d \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see that,\u201d Mulvaney told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd. What? Or, more appropriately, WHAT? What evidence could Mulvaney possibly have that President Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters didn\u2019t take every word out of the President\u2019s mouth literally? Because the four-year bullying campaign by his backers of politicians who disagreed with him suggested that Trump\u2019s supporters took him literally. As did the white supremacist march on Charlottesville, Virginia, that left a counter-protester dead. And the fact that hate crimes have risen 20% during the course of Trump\u2019s presidency. In fact, any inspection \u2013 close or otherwise \u2013 of how Trump\u2019s supporters have responded to his pleadings and urgings over the past four years would lead you to the exact opposite conclusion that Mulvaney attempted to draw on Sunday: The most hardcore Trump backers have always taken him literally. Always. It\u2019s the Republican political class \u2013 populated by the likes of Mulvaney \u2013 that has spent Trump\u2019s term deluding themselves that no one really takes Trump seriously because a) who could? and b) it soothed their consciences as they enabled and abetted Trump\u2019s worst instincts out of fear of what would happen to them if they didn\u2019t. The justification went something like this: Yeah, what Trump is saying is dangerous and crazy. But no one believes he means what he says. So, no harm, no foul! Right? Right?!?! THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That has never been anything more than a weak \u2013 and easily debunked \u2013 excuse for not standing up to Trump\u2019s erratic and irresponsible behavior. That whistle-past-the-graveyard attitude is typified by this now-infamous quote from an anonymous Republican official to The Washington Post in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. \u201cWhat is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?\u201d the official asked. \u201cNo one seriously thinks the results will change. He went golfing this weekend. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20. He\u2019s tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he\u2019ll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he\u2019ll leave.\u201d \u201cNo one seriously thinks the results will change.\u201d Nope! Lots and lots of people \u2013 fed Trump\u2019s lies over the past four years and without any significant push-back to them by Republicans who knew better \u2013 100% believed that not only had the election been stolen from them but that their only recourse when faced with such a titanic steal was violent insurrection. So, when the President of the United States told a large group of supporters last Wednesday that \u201cif you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore,\u201d moments after encouraging them to march to the Capitol building, well, they did what he said. They fought like hell, in their minds, to save the country they love. As Ezra Klein put it in a terrific New York Times column on Trump\u2019s supporters: \u201cThey did not experience this as performative grievance; they experienced it as a profound assault.\u201d This wasn\u2019t new. Trump\u2019s supporters had been taking him literally since he first began running for president. They really thought he was going to build a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d wall along our southern border and make Mexico pay for it. And that Ted Cruz\u2019s father might just be involved in the JFK assassination. And that every prominent Democrat should be tried (and convicted) for their roles in the Russia counterintelligence investigation. What happened at the Capitol last Wednesday, then, wasn\u2019t the first time Trump\u2019s base took him literally. It was the culmination of having taken him literally the entire duration of his presidency. Mulvaney and Trump\u2019s other most prominent enablers can try to comfort themselves with this who-could-have-seen-this-coming junk. But the truth is that anyone who wasn\u2019t purposely ignoring what was right in front of their faces saw what happened last Wednesday at the Capitol coming. Including Donald Trump himself.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is preparing to lean into his fight with Twitter and other social media platforms this week, a Trump adviser said, using his permanent suspension from Twitter as an opportunity to shift the narrative away from the insurrection on Capitol Hill earlier in the week. While the President was outraged by Twitter banning him on Friday night, some aides have encouraged him to seize on the ban as an opportunity to reignite arguments of anti-conservative bias on social media and to frame the ban as an attack on his supporters. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about President Trump, but this is literally about the 75 million Americans\u201d who supported him, the adviser said. Twitter takes Trump's special power away as his isolation grows Trump and his Republican allies have long accused social media companies of bias against conservatives, often making false allegations that social media platforms secretly \u201cshadow ban\u201d prominent Republicans. Several conservative lawmakers have already seized on Twitter\u2019s decision to ban the President and suspend other accounts associated with his false claims about the election and incitement to violence. But while a fight with social media companies is likely to help galvanize the Trump base, it is unlikely to shift the conversation away from Trump\u2019s role in inciting the riots on Capitol Hill last week. Trump is still facing the threat of more resignations from within his administration and Democrats are readying an article of impeachment against the President, with some Republican lawmakers openly considering supporting those efforts. While the President and his aides would have preferred he not be banned on Twitter, the ban did give him a perfect foil to use as a distraction at a time when he is losing support from Republicans. \u201cBig Tech and Capitol Hill Democrats seem to have the magic ability to galvanize the Republican base in a way that only they know how to do,\u201d this adviser said. As CNN has previously reported, Trump is also expected to issue a raft of pardons, travel to the border wall and sign some executive orders in his final days in office. How and when he folds his attacks on social media companies is still being worked out. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said he would not attend his successor\u2019s swearing-in, a day after his top aides cajoled him into releasing a video conceding he would soon be departing office. \u201cTo all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\u201d Trump tweeted, making formal what many had long assumed: that Trump would eschew the traditional step of personally demonstrating the peaceful hand-off of power to President-elect Joe Biden. He\u2019ll be the first outgoing president to skip his replacement\u2019s inauguration in more than 150 years. It came as Trump faces an uncertain final stretch in office. His top aides delivered a blunt warning to him Thursday as he sat sullenly in the West Wing and watched as his Republican allies, Cabinet secretaries and former senior staffers criticized or denounced him one by one. His daughter Ivanka Trump, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, chief of staff Mark Meadows and others told Trump there was a real chance he would be removed from office \u2013 whether by his own Cabinet or lawmakers \u2013 if he did not more forcefully denounce the actions of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol the day before. Trump did not initially want to issue a video decrying the loyalists whose actions he largely supported \u2013 and whom he said he \u201cloved\u201d a day earlier \u2013 but he told aides to prepare a speech and then he would decide. Once he read over the brief script they had prepared, Trump agreed to record it Thursday evening \u2013 a relief to the senior staff, though concerns lingered he could backtrack during his final days in office given his actual position has remained unchanged: that he lost the election unfairly. Several Cabinet secretaries informally discuss invoking 25th Amendment but Pence 'highly unlikely' to pursue The next morning, Trump was back to offering a starkly different message on his Twitter account, which has been restored after the social media firm suspended him. His announcement he would not attend Biden\u2019s inauguration did not come as a surprise, though Trump had been polling people recently about whether he should go and seemed open, at least to some, to appearing. It puts him even further at odds with Vice President Mike Pence, who has expressed a willingness to attend the ceremony if invited. Traditionally, the outgoing president welcomes the incoming one to the White House in the morning before riding together in the same vehicle to the Capitol building for the swearing in. Trump himself rode with then-President Barack Obama to his own inauguration four year ago. In 1869, the last time a still-living president boycotted his successor\u2019s swearing-in, incoming President Ulysses S. Grant refused to share a carriage with his predecessor Andrew Johnson. Johnson said he would remain behind at the White House. Three former American presidents do plan to be in attendance for the inauguration, officials say: Bill Clinton, Obama and George W. Bush have all made plans to be in Washington for the official transfer of power. Speaking later in the day, Biden said Trump made the right choice and said his decision to forgo attendance at the inauguration was one of the few things they could agree on. \u201cHe\u2019s been an embarrassment to the country,\u201d Biden said during remarks in Wilmington, Delaware. Three White House advisers told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Friday that Trump has no intention of resigning. \u201cNone,\u201d one adviser said of the chances of a resignation. \u201cZero,\u201d said another, adding: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong.\u201d With a traditional departure from Washington now off the table, Trump must also decide soon when and how he wants to leave the White House. At this point, Trump is expected to go to his Mar-a-Lago members-only resort in Palm Beach, Florida, after leaving the White House for the final time, despite his displeasure at recent renovations to his private apartment there. It is possible he leaves for Florida on January 19, the day before the Inauguration, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump\u2019s reluctance to demonstrate the peaceful hand-off of power, despite declaring there would be an \u201corderly transition\u201d this week, came as he contends with the political and legal fallout of inciting rioters who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday. Even after denouncing the violence in his video on Thursday evening, the next morning he lent voice to his supporters, who he said would not go quietly. \u201cThe 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\u201d He made no mention of a Capitol Police officer who died overnight from injuries sustained while engaging rioters. Having now conceded he will no longer serve a second term, Trump has begun contemplating how he will spend his final days in the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. It\u2019s won\u2019t necessarily be a placid stretch. Democrats appear to be rushing to impeach him for a second time. While talk of removing him from office through the Constitution is deflating, Trump\u2019s administration is still shedding officials who are resigning in protest, including the secretaries of transportation and education. One of Trump\u2019s closest confidantes and top aides, Hope Hicks, is also discussing resigning from her role before the President leaves office, according to two people familiar with her thinking. She has told people if she does, she would leave within the next 48 hours. It\u2019s not clear she has made a final decision. On Friday, word emerged Cipollone is also considering resigning, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Since the election, he had considered resigning multiple times but has been urged to stay for the good of the country by members of the Senate and the Cabinet. Despite being at loggerheads with Trump in recent weeks, he has been influential behind the scenes this week in encouraging Trump to be more forceful in his statements. \u201cHe\u2019s there out of a sense of duty,\u201d one source said. His services could be required in Trump\u2019s final days as furious Democrats quickly build momentum to move on impeachment, potentially as soon as the middle of next week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team ran through their options Thursday night and the overwhelming sentiment was impeachment was the way forward, according to multiple sources. The process is unlikely to resemble the drawn-out proceedings of Trump\u2019s first impeachment; instead, Democratic officials said they expected it to move rapidly. A simple majority is enough to impeach the President. If the House does, it would make Trump the first President to be impeached twice. Some Republican sources have even told CNN they want Trump removed before January 20, and two GOP members have told CNN they would consider voting for impeachment if the articles of impeachment seem reasonable. So concerned are Democrats at the potential for destruction in Trump\u2019s final days that Pelosi said Friday she\u2019d discussed \u201cavailable precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike\u201d during a phone call with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley. Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues during a call Friday that she has gotten assurances there are safeguards in place in the event the President wants to launch a nuclear weapon, according to sources on the call. Still, with Trump ending, for now, his false bid to overturn the results of the election, hope among advisers is that he will focus, finally, on his post-presidency. Aides still have a long list of executive actions they are hoping he will sign in his waning days, including one teed up on buy-American provisions. There is talk of a trip next week to view progress on the border wall, one of Trump\u2019s proudest achievements. And a raft of pardons, including potentially for himself and his family, are expected in the coming days.   Aides are still discussing a farewell address or interview, but acknowledge the video Trump released Thursday saying a \u201cnew administration will be inaugurated on January 20\u201d is as close to a concession he will get. \u201cMy focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,\u201d he said, speaking in monotone and reading from a teleprompter. \u201cThis moment calls for healing and reconciliation.\u201d Trump\u2019s highly scripted video acknowledging he will be leaving the White House is the tone his advisers hope he will stick with as he leaves office. Thursday\u2019s video was staid, taped indoors and appeared heavily edited. Trump demonstrated little emotion as he admitted his time as president was nearing its end. Earlier in the day, Trump called off a visit to Camp David scheduled for this weekend, according to a source familiar with the planning, which would likely have been his final time at the presidential retreat. He had been planning to go before the riots but decided Thursday, amid questions about resignations and Cabinet defections, to remain in Washington. Other \u201clasts\u201d are still up in the air, such as his final flight aboard Air Force One. As he contested the results of the election, Trump refused to engage in discussions about how he wanted to spend his final days in the White House, or what he wanted to do afterward. Officials are eager those conservations can now begin, hopeful to spend some time focusing on Trump\u2019s \u201clegacy,\u201d even though many inside the building believe it will be irrevocably tarred by his behavior that led to this week\u2019s riots. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The lies have always had victims. And the liar has never much seemed to care. If Muslim Americans had to live in fear because Donald Trump wanted to rile up his rally crowds with fictional stories about Muslim disloyalty, so be it. If Americans had to get sick and die because Trump thought his campaign would benefit from deceiving them about the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, so be it. And if, because Trump wouldn\u2019t admit he lost a fair election, police officers had to face an angry mob, elected officials had to take cover in gas masks, the international reputation of the United States had to be damaged, blue-collar workers had to pick up the pieces of a damaged Capitol, and four people had to die \u2013 well, to borrow a phrase from one of Trump\u2019s Wednesday tweets, \u201cthese are the things and events that happen.\u201d Trump did not create the broken information ecosystem that led the country toward the Wednesday calamity. It was clear prior to his presidency that years of baloney from radio talkers, Fox News hosts, chain emailers, message board posters and social media personalities had poisoned the political brains of millions of Republican voters. But in the four years I\u2019ve been debunking his lies, the man who launched his Republican career on a racist lie about President Barack Obama has made the problem so much worse. He has lied with astonishing frequency in office, making presidential dishonesty such a normal occurrence that it has usually not been treated as news. He has done so while steering his supporters away from truth-telling information sources and toward the least trustworthy outlets, actively fostering a climate in which his lies get rewarded and reinforced. And, critically, he has made the endorsement of his lies a central requirement for belonging in his coalition. Before Trump, you could be a Republican in good standing if you did not accept bonkers claims that the Clintons had dozens of their opponents murdered. To Trump, you are a \u201cRINO,\u201d Republican In Name Only, if you question his bonkers claims about election fraud. Trump repeated those claims in the Wednesday rally speech that preceded the mayhem at the Capitol. Media outlets fairly reported that he had incited the mob. I\u2019m not the President\u2019s psychiatrist, but I\u2019ve read every word he has uttered since his inauguration, so I feel qualified to say this: Trump generally does not lie out of a desire to wreck things. He lies out of a need to make himself look and feel successful, superior and beloved. The possibility of wreckage is a consequence he can\u2019t be bothered to contemplate. When the lying is about his wealth, his golf game or how much Oprah used to like him, the subjects are so trivial that the palpable desperation behind the deception can border on amusing. But the subject of his current desperate lying is democracy itself, and his thirst for the affirmation he couldn\u2019t earn at the ballot box is in irreconcilable conflict with the interests of the country. Whether or not he eases off in the wake of the Capitol crisis \u2013 and don\u2019t bet on it \u2013 all Americans are his victims today.",

            "article_content": "The chaotic federal response to the Trump rally Wednesday, which was overwhelmed by rioters who stormed the US Capitol, stood in sharp contrast to the heavily-armed presence of thousands of federal authorities during summer protests in Washington, DC, following the police killing of George Floyd. Mobs broke through police barricades and rampaged through the Capitol, vandalizing offices and prompting the evacuation of lawmakers just after 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. By dusk, the building was still not secured and a woman had been shot dead. \u201cEverything. Everything went wrong,\u201d one Capitol Police officer on the scene said. The law enforcement response that allowed a typically heavily secured federal landmark to fall under attack, with rioters breaking through windows and into lawmakers\u2019 offices and gathering places, came from a hesitant federal bureaucracy after early assurances from DC and Capitol law enforcement agencies. Agencies that had law enforcement that could help Wednesday waited to be asked. \u201cIt was a mess. Nobody was communicating. No one knew what we were supposed to be doing there,\u201d said one federal law enforcement officer who was dispatched to the Capitol. The primary law enforcement agency tasked with protecting the historic building was the Capitol Police. Spokespeople for the agency have not responded to multiple inquiries from CNN throughout the day. Justice Department officials were in charge of coordinating the federal agencies and US National Guard response ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s rally near the Washington Monument. Some organizers publicly said they planned to conduct a \u201cwild\u201d march to Capitol Hill as the joint session of Congress met to certify President-elect Joe Biden as the next president. But agencies were waiting to be asked by other authorities to help \u2013 even as Trump\u2019s election protest unraveled. US Secret Service was the first federal agency deployed when the US Capitol Police asked for assistance from local and federal law enforcement, a USSS official told CNN. When Capitol Police put out the call for assistance, USSS sent additional uniformed division and special agents to Capitol Hill to assist. \u201cLaw enforcement failed to understand what the likelihood of this threat was,\u201d CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow, a former USSS agent, said of the day\u2019s events, though \u201cno one should be surprised that this was attempted,\u201d given Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s comments at the rally earlier in the day that this should be a \u201ctrial by combat.\u201d \u201cThere should have been a wall of law enforcement,\u201d Wackrow said. Department of Homeland Security spokesman Alexei Woltornist said the agency was running a \u201cvirtual situation room\u201d to track communication between agencies, but was \u201cnot tracking any active threats.\u201d US Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement agency under the Department of Homeland Security, had dozens of personnel prepared if needed. Federal Protective Service and Secret Service officers were also sent to the Capitol. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf is on a diplomatic trip in the Middle East this week but making arrangements to return. The Interior Department\u2019s US Park Police, which oversees the National Mall and other grounds in the Capitol, also got called in to help. As for the Justice Department, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen deployed more than 300 agents and officers from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the US Marshals Service, to assist the Capitol Police. But the Capitol Police had already lost control. Some of those deployments came almost an hour after the mob put the Capitol into lockdown. Rosen did not issue a public statement condemning the violence until roughly four hours after the riots began. A longtime DC local police leader, from the Metropolitan Police Department, told CNN, \u201cThere is no denying that Capitol Police was extremely overwhelmed today \u2026 I\u2019ve never seen the Capitol under siege like that.\u201d \u201cBy the time the Capitol Police asked for help, the crowd was already inside the building,\u201d another federal law enforcement official said. The Capitol Police reports to leaders of Congress and is separate from law enforcement agencies that are part of the executive branch, the official said. That separation of powers would add to the careful bureaucratic negotiation. In another divide, the Capitol Police operate separately from DC\u2019s metropolitan police force, which began enforcing a citywide curfew at 6 p.m. ET. The first job of the arriving officers Wednesday afternoon was to protect lawmakers and staff who were told to shelter in offices. But the last-minute deployment, with protesters already inside the building, presented special challenges. FBI and ATF agents \u2013 whose normal job is to be investigators, not to do riot control \u2013 were sent into the Capitol to try to secure the building and eventually to try to clear protesters. After criticism from Washington, DC, municipal officials over the heavy-handed response during the summer Black Lives Matter protests, federal authorities had a visibly lighter presence for the Trump rally. Two federal law enforcement officials said Capitol Police assured Justice officials that they were prepared for the rally, particularly since the Capitol grounds are already barricaded in preparation for the Inauguration ceremonies in two weeks. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser had also written to Rosen and other federal officials demanding that federal agencies not deploy a heavy presence to the city, as they did during the summer, and assuring that Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police, along with a small detachment of National Guard service members, were ready for the day\u2019s protests. \u201cThe District of Columbia government is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel,\u201d Bowser wrote, \u201cand discourages any additional deployment without immediate notification to, and consultation with MPD if such plans are underway.\u201d That quickly changed when the crowds surged into the Capitol. \u201cI think you know the very significant perimeters we established around DC streets, and we\u2019re right there to support them and now to enter the building to make sure we have control and maintain control,\u201d Bowser said on CNN Wednesday afternoon. Nearby police departments, including from Fairfax County in Virginia and Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties in Maryland, were sending backup of hundreds of officers as the afternoon progressed. Forces from Prince George\u2019s County were in the city and still waiting for direction from the city police late into the afternoon, according to their spokesman, though that was more response than the force had been asked to provide during the Black Lives Matters summer protests, when they were not brought into the city. National guardsmen were summoned Wednesday from multiple states and began to arrive, after the domestic terrorism began. It was a sharp contrast to how quickly Trump had brought in National Guard and other law enforcement under the executive branch to clear the park in front of the White House of largely peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters this summer. After the harsh disbursement of that crowd, Trump walked across the park and took a photo in front of a church. \u201cWe\u2019ve going to need the full light of day, the opportunity to have oversight and review to know exactly what occurred,\u201d DC Attorney General Karl Racine told CNN Wednesday night, adding that it should be compared to the use of force in Lafayette Square seven months ago. \u201cI have to think that it wasn\u2019t unintentional. That it wasn\u2019t careless or reckless\u201d to leave the Capitol overwhelmed, Racine said. One source told CNN Wednesday night Trump had initially resisted deploying the National Guard, and Vice President Mike Pence encouraged the Joint Chiefs Chair to do so more quickly. Inside the Capitol building as evening fell, officers were still going door to door, searching office by office, checking every closet to make sure the building was secure. Several police officers had been treated for injuries, a little more than a dozen people had been arrested, pipe bombs found at political party headquarters were safely detonated, and the shooting of a woman on the Capitol grounds who died Wednesday afternoon was under investigation.

As part of their preparations, police posted signs around the district warning of the illegality of gun possession during protests as Trump tweeted his support for the protesters, saying, \u201cOur Country has had enough, they won\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d and \u201cWe Hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security, which has staffed a \u201cVirtual Situation Room\u201d to help communication between different agencies, is \u201cnot currently tracking any active threats,\u201d spokesman Alexei Woltornist said. Trump traveled a short distance from the White House to the rally Wednesday morning. About 20 aides were outside awaiting Trump\u2019s departure, audibly shouting \u201cSave our country\u201d as he boarded his SUV. Trump gave a fist bump and appeared to blow a kiss. GOP challenges Arizona electoral votes, the first of several expected objections to Biden's 2020 win Trump addressed a large, tightly packed and largely maskless crowd of supporters on the Ellipse. His remarks got off to an inauspicious start as Trump\u2019s microphone appeared to be turned off as he began speaking. \u201cWe can\u2019t hear you!\u201d members of the audience were heard shouting on the video feed, though he appeared unaware and kept speaking. Moments later, audio was restored, and Trump was railing against the media. Trump\u2019s speech included calls for his vice president to step outside his constitutional bounds and overturn the results of the election. \u201cHope Mike is going to do the right thing,\u201d Trump said at a rally on the Ellipse. \u201cIf Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.\u201d Pence released a letter he wrote to congress Wednesday just after noon, saying he wouldn\u2019t object to Biden\u2019s victory. A large glass barrier shielded Trump from the crowd, similar to when he spoke in front of the Lincoln Memorial on the Fourth of July 2019. Ahead of Trump\u2019s speech, Rudy Giuliani was addressing the rally on the Ellipse, baselessly repeating claims that voting machines were \u201ccrooked,\u201d and continuing to insist that Pence can do something today to change the election\u2019s outcome, which he does not have power to do. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. \u201cLet\u2019s have trial by combat!\u201d Giuliani told the enthusiastic crowd. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District is \u201cabsolutely prepared\u201d for protests and announced that that at least ten people were arrested overnight related to the protests. At least one person was arrested for carrying an unlicensed gun and six people were charged with assault, including one for assaulting a police officer. \u201cWe had several arrests related to that activity, but not a single one of them was a DC resident,\u201d she said. Authorities \u2013 a mix that includes local police, National Guard and federal uniformed officers \u2013 had already arrested several people ahead of demonstrations including the leader of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that Trump directly addressed during an autumn debate to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d The Proud Boys\u2019 leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on charges related to a protest last month and ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week\u2019s protests. Pence breaks with Trump on Electoral College role In the days leading up to Wednesday\u2019s planned march, police posted signs declaring areas where they expect protesters gun-free zones between Monday and Thursday. \u201cALL firearms prohibited within 1000 feet of this sign,\u201d they read, taped to light poles. Protesters dressed in pro-Trump regalia gathered Tuesday across the city while others posted photos of their travel to Wednesday\u2019s rally on social media. Several speakers on Tuesday led the crowds in chants of \u201cfour more years,\u201d even as Trump has all but exhausted legal avenues for turning the tide against Biden. One after another, speakers put forth claims that the election was stolen, imploring people to \u201cfight\u201d for victory on Wednesday.\u202fTrump\u2019s loss has been reaffirmed by courts and state election officials dozens of times since the election. Tuesday\u2019s speakers included Trump adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress, obstruction and threatening a witness before being pardoned by the President. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the media\u2019s crystal ball\u201d on the election results and the finalization of the Electoral College count by Congress on Wednesday, said Dustin Stockton, one of the march organizers. But, he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear that Wednesday will be historic.\u201d \u201c(Trump) still has cards to play that he hasn\u2019t played,\u201d Stockton said.\u202f\u201cWe won\u2019t stop fighting until the President does.\u201d A DC police spokesman, Sean Hickman, would not comment on police staffing for the demonstrations or say whether they\u2019d attempt to keep pro-Trump supporters separate from counterprotesters. It\u2019s also not clear how aggressive police will be in enforcing the district\u2019s gun laws. \u201cAs with any known, large demonstration, we will continue to monitor and assess each activity, and plan accordingly with our local and federal law enforcement partners,\u201d Hickman said. Federal agencies over the summer created confusion during protests by sending agents into demonstrations in unmarked vehicles and without names, agencies or other identifiers on uniforms. Congress passed a law requiring federal agents to wear some unique identifier on their clothing while working protests. A letter Tuesday from DC Mayor Muriel Bowser to the Department of Justice regarding the upcoming protests noted problems police had encountered when armed officers working for federal agencies staffed protests without identification over the summer, including in Lafayette Park. This \u201ccaused confusion among residents and visitors and could become a national security threat with no way for MPD and federal law enforcement to decipher armed groups,\u201d Bowser wrote. Armed and unidentifiable federal agents dressed in camouflage arrested protesters in Portland, Oregon, over the summer and took them away in unmarked vehicles. Federal officials later identified them as agents of the US Customs and Border Protection, but they weren\u2019t wearing name badges or agency identifiers. Around the same time, Trump branded anti-racism protesters in the country as \u201cterrorists,\u201d\u202fand promised to\u202f\u201csurge\u201d paramilitary-style units\u202finto other cities. Outrage over the tactics led to Congress passing the law requiring identifying marks on federal agents working protests. US Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, also wrote to federal officials Monday reminding them of this new law. \u201cMembers of the armed forces and federal law enforcement personnel responding to civil disturbances are now required to visibly display both their name or an individual identifier, and the name of the armed force, or federal entity by which they are employed,\u201d he wrote. The US Bureau of Prisons sent 100 \u201cspecially trained officers\u201d to the Department of Justice in DC to supplement department facility security, Justin Long, a spokesman for that agency, said Tuesday. They\u2019ll function as a \u201creserve\u201d for other Justice Department security teams. Mark Morgan, the senior official performing the duties of the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said Tuesday that the agency has not been asked to deploy agents but added that it has a \u201cmodest, quick reactionary force that will be on standby just in case our assistance is requested.\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, the senior official performing the duties of the Homeland Security deputy secretary, said the agency is \u201cprepared to surge personnel, as needed.\u201d \u201cSecret Service is at the heart of a lot of this stuff. They have a long history. \u2026 And we\u2019re coordinating, not just the Service coordinating, but to the extent the Federal Protective Service, which is protecting literally dozens of locations around the city, has any need for backup, we\u2019re prepared for that,\u201d Cuccinelli said. \u201cObviously, we hope all these different protests go off peacefully, but we are prepared to surge personnel, as needed, where needed across the district in coordination with DOJ and then local authorities, as well, are so intimately involved.\u201d Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller on Monday approved a request from the District of Columbia to deploy a limited number of DC National Guard forces to support the Metropolitan Police Department and fire department. The guardsmen will not be armed and be mostly assisting with traffic control. Expected at the rallies are members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group seen often in black and yellow at Trump rallies and who sometimes engage in street fights with far-left protesters. Affiliates of the group have also shown apparent ties to Stone, including at his criminal trial in late 2019. This comes about a month after a Proud Boys protest ended with stabbings and the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church. Tarrio was arrested Monday and charged in connection with the burning of the banner and ordered released from police custody on Tuesday. The judge ordered him to stay out of the District of Columbia except for his own court appearances until further notice, according to court records. Tarrio had two high-capacity gun magazines when police arrested him, according to authorities, and he was also charged with possession of a high-capacity feeding device. Tarrio did not return CNN\u2019s calls or texts Monday. He took responsibility for burning the banner last month, writing in a post on the social media website Parler that \u201cagainst the wishes of my attorney I am here today to admit that I am the person responsible for the burning of this sign.\u201d He also posted on social media that Proud Boys members would be \u201cincognito\u201d for this week\u2019s protests. Tuesday\u2019s protesters chanted \u201cEnrique\u201d in support of Tarrio. A few speakers also went on anti-mask rants, one of them saying masks worn to prevent the spread of coronavirus are a means of \u201ccontrol\u201d for officials \u201ctrying to take your freedom away.\u201d A vast majority of the several hundred people at Freedom Plaza were not wearing masks throughout the afternoon and evening. Founded in 2016, the Proud Boys group lists among\u202fits central tenets a belief\u202fin \u201cclosed borders\u201d and the aim of \u201creinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism.\u201d In online statements, it\u2019s claimed it has used violence only in self-defense. Members are often seen carrying firearms and bats and donning protective gear. The group\u2019s ideology has been labeled \u201cmisogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigration\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump appeared zeroed-in on the vice president\u2019s role in certifying the 2020 presidential election results as a potential Hail Mary during a rally meant for a pair of Georgia GOP Senate candidates on Monday night, saying that he hoped Mike Pence would \u201ccome through for us.\u201d Pence holds a largely ceremonial role when Congress affirms the Electoral College vote electing Joe Biden on Wednesday. \u201cI hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you,\u201d Trump admitted. \u201cI hope that our great vice president \u2013 our great vice president, comes through for us. He\u2019s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn\u2019t come through, I won\u2019t like him as much.\u201d But Trump, who was seen in the Oval Office with the vice president shortly before departing for Georgia, wouldn\u2019t say exactly what he wants Pence to do, given that his role in certifying electors is largely ceremonial. Trump laughed it off and added: \u201cNah, Mike is a great guy he\u2019s a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot.\u201d \u201cBut he\u2019s gonna have a lot to say about it,\u201d the President added. \u201cAnd he you know one thing with him, you\u2019re gonna get straight shots \u2013 he\u2019s gonna call it straight.\u201d Though the rally was for Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Trump focused heavily on the 2020 presidential election, alleging once again, without basis, that it was rigged. There no evidence of widespread voter fraud and Trump\u2019s legal team has repeatedly been unable to back up his outlandish claims in court. There were 18 attempted calls from the White House to GA secretary of state's office, sources say Trump used relatively little time actually touting the two Republican Senate candidates, but called Perdue \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and Loeffler a \u201cfantastic champion.\u201d \u201cKelly is a staunch defender of our incredible military. I\u2019m so proud of our military. She supports the wall, and she always stands with the heroes of law enforcement, ICE and Border Patrol,\u201d he said. Trump also briefly brought Republican House Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a QAnon promoter, to the stage. And in noting that Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who is expected to put out a statement and may argue against Congress overturning the results, was in the audience, the President said: \u201cMike Lee is here too, but I\u2019m a little angry at him today.\u201d The President\u2019s presence at the Dalton, Georgia, rally would normally be a welcome sight for Republicans just one day before the runoffs \u2013 races that will determine which party controls the Senate. A big crowd for the President is expected and there is evidence that Trump\u2019s presence will help turn out GOP voters. But ahead of the rally, some Republicans were rightly convinced the President, who unsuccessfully pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes that would tilt the balance in Trump\u2019s favor in a call publicized on Sunday, would spend far more time focused on his baseless electoral fraud claims as opposed to rallying his supporters to vote for Loeffler and Perdue. Amid the flurry of baseless claims made at the rally, Trump railed against Raffensperger and Georgia\u2019s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, saying they weren\u2019t real Republicans and that he would campaign against their reelection. Public statements and private observations by sources familiar with the situation suggest that Trump is fixated with the issues he laid out on the Raffensperger call. Trump repeatedly pushed for the call with the Georgia secretary of state, two sources familiar said. And between Election Day and Saturday\u2019s phone call, there were 18 attempted calls from the White House to Raffensperger\u2019s office, a source with knowledge and a Georgia state official confirmed to CNN. The existence of the phone call and the number of attempted calls were first reported by The Washington Post. On Monday, Raffensperger told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that this was his first call on the matter with Trump personally, and several senior White House officials were unaware the call happened until Trump tweeted about it. \u201cThe President\u2019s ability to exceed expectations when it comes to how unhelpful he\u2019ll be remains undefeated,\u201d one GOP operative working on the runoff told CNN. It is a worry shared on the ground in Georgia. Local Republican leaders have quarreled with Trump over the administration of the election in November but share the President\u2019s desire to see Loeffler and Perdue elected. \u201cThat phone call did absolutely nothing to help, you know, drive turnout for Republicans here in Georgia, for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue,\u201d Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who will not join Trump\u2019s rally Monday night, told CNN. \u201cI was disappointed and quite honestly, I can\u2019t imagine anyone on that staff encouraging that call or not giving him the advice to hang up and move on to the next subject.\u201d After the call was publicized, many Georgia Republicans had given up all hope that Trump\u2019s visit on Monday night will be a positive contribution to that effort. \u201cNo one has any rational reason to believe it will go well,\u201d said one Georgia Republican. \u201cThe likelihood of a total, complete, absolute sh*t show is off the charts. If disaster is avoided, it will be sheer dumb luck.\u201d On the phone call with Raffensperger, Trump cited the anticipated crowd for the rally Monday night in Dalton as evidence that he actually won the election in November. He warned the secretary of state that he planned on bringing up his grievances at the event. \u201cThe people of Georgia are angry, and these numbers are gonna be repeated on Monday night along with others that we\u2019re gonna have by that time, which are much more substantial even, and the people of Georgia are angry,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s last visit to Georgia was less than ideal \u2013 he spent most of the rally airing grievances about the November vote. That included playing lengthy video segments from conservative outlets such as Newsmax, which peddled completely false stories about alleged fraud. When Perdue and Loeffler were brought on stage they were drowned out by calls of \u201cstop the steal\u2019 and \u201cstand up for Trump\u201d. Similarly, at one point, the crowd at Monday night\u2019s rally loudly and repeatedly chanted \u201cfight for Trump\u201d toward the top of the President\u2019s remarks. The Trump campaign promised the President\u2019s visit Monday would be a help to the GOP ticket. \u201cKeeping a Republican majority in the Senate has been a priority for the President from the beginning,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director. The universal opinion of Republicans is that the frenzy over the call Trump made to Raffensperger guarantees that any hope of Trump delivering a simple, get-out-the-vote message directed at his passionate supporters without the added distractions of election fraud are gone.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Leopoldo L\u00f3pez is a Venezuelan politician and opposition leader who was imprisoned on charges of inciting anti-government protests. He is a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative\u2019s Frontlines of Freedom project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. For many people, freedom is an abstract concept. It\u2019s like breathing; you don\u2019t think about it until you are gasping for air. The same thing happens with democracy. Too many voters take it for granted, until the moment they realize it\u2019s entirely possible to have an election without democracy \u2013 just like in Cuba, Russia, Iran, and my home country of Venezuela. This became painfully clear to me while I was imprisoned for political opposition to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s dictatorship. In a 2x2 meter cell with a lock the size of a brick, I learned what freedom was when I didn\u2019t have it. The Venezuela I was born into in the 1970s was considered the envy of the Americas: a country with a strong economy capable of providing prosperity and opportunities to almost everybody. Venezuelan leaders had successfully built this regime of freedom after the downfall of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s military dictatorship in 1958. Between the 1960s and 1990s, Venezuela was \u201cthe democratic exception\u201d in Latin America, a title that every Venezuelan carried with pride. My country had some of the best public services of the region during that time \u2013 including a prestigious network of schools and universities and a health care system that helped eradicate malaria in parts of the country in 1961, as certified by the World Health Organization (WHO), a status Venezuela has since lost. This was an era when many Europeans and Latin Americans alike wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for a better life. The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracy Now, 22 years after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s presidency began and nearly a decade after Maduro seized power in what I believe was a fraudulent 2013 presidential election, Venezuela is undergoing the worst multilayered crisis in the continent. Poverty, violence, starvation, and shortages of crucial supplies are the new normal. A 2016 survey found that almost three-quarters of the population involuntarily lost an average of 19 pounds, with emergency rooms overwhelmed by cases of severely malnourished children. Hospitals lack the equipment and medicine they need to function, leaving families across the country at risk of dying without access to treatment \u2013 a situation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 6 million Venezuelans have fled the country, many for fear of persecution or lack of economic opportunities. How did we turn from being an island of democracy to a broken dictatorship? I think the answer is twofold: First, we suffered an erosion of the essential elements of democracy. After becoming president in 1999, within a year, Ch\u00e1vez changed the national constitution and called for a \u201cmega-election\u201d that saw him inaugurated for a six-year term. He changed the political structure of the country; packed the Supreme Court; took control over the National Electoral Council; and labeled critical members of the free press as \u201cenemies of the homeland.\u201d Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me Second, this democratic erosion was met with an immoral neutrality from democracies around the world. When we the Venezuelans were losing our freedoms, too many people in the region believed that our problem was not also their own. I witnessed this tragedy from my position as a local politician. After studying abroad in the US in the early 1990s, I returned to Venezuela and ran for public office in 2000. I was elected and reelected as mayor of Chacao, a powerful municipality in Caracas that is home to almost 80,000 people. For eight years, we proved that it was possible to serve democratically in a country being led in the opposite direction. That changed in 2008, when I was disqualified from running for governor of Caracas city, despite two consecutive successful terms as mayor of Chacao and over 70% popular support. Under Ch\u00e1vez, the National Comptroller banned my participation in any electoral process on charges of corruption and financial impropriety \u2013 a ban that went into effect before I was even formally charged with these false accusations. With no place to look for justice within my country, I took my case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and I won. In response, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s regime formally withdrew Venezuela from the inter-American system and, naturally, dismissed the ruling in my favor. Unable to serve, I visited towns and cities across the country, from the Colombian border to the Atlantic coast. I wanted to prove that it wasn\u2019t necessary to be an elected authority to serve our people. What I saw on that journey were Venezuelans who were more than ready to fight for freedom and democracy. That experience led me, along with other democratic leaders, to establish the political party Voluntad Popular, a national movement steeped in grassroots activism. When Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, Maduro, rose to power in 2013, I asked our movement, \u201cAre we living in a democracy, or a dictatorship?\u201d We agreed on the latter. Inspired by nonviolent resistance from around the world, including the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring, and US civil rights movements, we chose to peacefully protest Maduro\u2019s regime. The Venezuelan government\u2019s response to our demonstrations was ruthless, and strikingly similar to what we have seen reported from the streets of countries around the world, from Belarus to Nicaragua: police brutality against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests and torture of opposition leaders, protesters sent into exile and some killed, as the UN has documented. In February 2014, Maduro ordered my arrest and that of other Voluntad Popular members. Despite international criticism that I was arbitrarily detained, I was prosecuted and sentenced to nearly 14 years after a trial controlled by the dictatorship \u2013 proceedings the UN criticized for lack of transparency and violation of due process. I spent more than three years in a military prison, where I endured physical and psychological torture. When my wife and other supporters shared what was happening to me, Maduro\u2019s government denied the abuse.  Many ask why Maduro is still in power, despite massive and ongoing protests. The truth is that he\u2019s in power because he\u2019s a dictator, and his regime\u2019s response has been the same as others: repression and incarceration, the dictator\u2019s recipe to hold on to power. Perhaps we need to understand that authoritarianism is a global phenomenon. Dictators, in fact, understand this very well. They form political allegiances to protect each other internationally and have developed a transnational repression policy in order to persecute those who oppose them. This is a global problem, and its solution should be global as well. To achieve democratic change in Venezuela, we must be part of a larger, globally organized effort. This idea is what convinced me to risk my life to escape from my country last year to resettle in Spain: A desire to be part of an international front that would help not only the people of Venezuela, but all those who live under authoritarian regimes.",

Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The lessons from Tuesday\u2019s elections are still being revealed and absorbed. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s victory in Virginia \u2013 which would\u2019ve been surprising two months ago when Terry McAuliffe was considered the narrow favorite \u2013 suggests there is a way for Republicans to campaign and win without former President Donald Trump. After Tuesday\u2019s election, it\u2019s clear voters will respond to a candidate talking about issues that affect everyday families, and who lays out a positive vision to move forward. But Trump still hangs over the GOP like a sword of Damocles, as seen by Youngkin\u2019s resistance to campaigning with him. Trump\u2019s willingness to play in primaries \u2013 or, as we saw in Georgia, runoffs \u2013 can tank Republicans he doesn\u2019t like. It is part of his DNA, and it hasn\u2019t changed. On the other side, Democrats\u2019 takeaways from last week\u2019s loss appear to be that Congress needed to pass the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d legislation to show results that they can run on, while also pushing back on the increasingly leftward tilt and \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of their progressive wing. \u201cSome of these people need to go to a \u2018woke\u2019 detox center or something,\u201d longtime Democratic operative James Carville cautioned his party. Indeed, when Rev. Al Sharpton says the progressives have gone too far, it\u2019s something Democrats should consider. All of this is true. Youngkin\u2019s campaign does point to a successful, if tenuous, path out of Trump\u2019s shadow \u2013 one that focuses on issues everyday Virginians experience, from the grocery tax to school closures, instead of Trump. Virginia voters, from the Trump base of the GOP to the suburban White women Democrats lost in droves, rejected a Democratic Party they see as not producing positive results and which continues to move further and further left. But all of this misses the point. The hurricane that's 12 months away There is one overarching reason Democrats had a tough Tuesday night and will potentially have a tough 2022. Many are missing the blindingly obvious forest while studying each individual leaf on each tree: President Joe Biden is not popular. An NBC News poll late last month showed Biden at 42% approval, with 54% disapproving of his job as President as compared to 39% in April. Exit polling in Virginia showed most voters disapproved of Biden. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in late October shows a mere 26% of the public feel America is headed in the right direction, compared with 60% \u2013 a spread of 34 points \u2013 who believe we are on the wrong track. This manifests itself on issues. The same NBC News poll last month showed Republicans with big advantages on issues ranging from the border and national security to the economy and, as the poll put it, \u201cgetting things done.\u201d That\u2019s damning for Biden and the Democrats, and it explains why Democratic voter enthusiasm just wasn\u2019t there last week. Efforts to diagnose Democrats' biggest problem are off the mark With much being made of Tuesday and the upcoming 2022 midterms echoing 2009 and 2010, it\u2019s important to remember that in the wake of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration and sky-high popularity the GOP was left for political dead. A May 2009 cover of TIME magazine declared Republicans an \u201cendangered species.\u201d But as Obama\u2019s popularity dimmed, GOP hopes rose. I ran communications for the Republican National Committee in 2010. Our \u201cmagic number\u201d for Obama was 46, meaning if his approval was below that, we believed we would take back the House of Representatives. Above that and we just didn\u2019t know. Our job, daily, was to do whatever we could to keep him at or below 46. Ultimately, he was at 45 the week of the 2010 midterms, and the GOP had a wave election. Biden\u2019s numbers are obviously well below that, and he doesn\u2019t possess Obama\u2019s oratorical or political gifts. Still, regardless of whether he signs the now passed $1 trillion infrastructure bill, Biden does have some good news: 531,000 jobs added in October with strong past month revisions, and the announcement of an experimental Pfizer antiviral pill that according to studies reduces death and hospitalization from Covid-19.  Given how many issues from last week\u2019s elections were Covid-related \u2013 school closures, jobs, inflation, supply chain \u2013 this is a lifeline Biden and Democrats desperately need. The other lesson from Tuesday\u2019s election is that we simply do not know where Biden will be yet. Some saw a GOP takeover in the House and Senate as inevitable even before last Tuesday night. One colleague told me the week before the elections that it was \u201cin the bag.\u201d But nothing is ever guaranteed in politics, and a year is a very long time. As we absorb the results of Virginia\u2019s race, Republicans should not be measuring curtains but focusing on their task of building the House where the curtains will hang.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Steve Bannon has had his hand in a lot of things. He served in the US Navy for seven years before he went on to join the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the right-wing media outlet Breitbart, the 2016 Trump campaign and the White House \u2013 until former President Donald Trump fired him in 2017. In the 1990s, as part of a new investment bank named after him, Bannon even wound up with an ownership stake in \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d gaining a sliver of the show\u2019s gargantuan royalties. Following his stint as a White House strategist, Bannon ran into legal trouble when he joined an organization that raised millions for the stated purpose of building a wall along the southern US border; federal prosecutors charged him and three others with defrauding the donors. But Trump ended up pardoning Bannon in his last hours as president. Now the Justice Department has another chance to consider Bannon\u2019s fate. Attorney General Merrick Garland will decide whether to prosecute Bannon after the House voted Thursday to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress. Bannon has refused to cooperate with the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, citing Trump\u2019s controversial claim of \u201cexecutive privilege.\u201d As Frida Ghitis noted, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney asked why Trump and Bannon are hiding behind such a dubious shield. \u201cIn Cheney\u2019s analysis, the executive privilege claim by Bannon and Trump, seems \u2018to reveal one thing: They suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6th.\u2019 Cheney\u2019s piercing words\u2026are a reminder that it\u2019s crucial to find out what exactly Trump\u2019s role was during the events of that day. And Bannon very likely knows a lot about that.\u201d Ghitis observed that Bannon said on his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast January 5: \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d As Democrats look back at the events of January, they\u2019re also looking ahead to the midterm elections next year \u2013 and the 2024 presidential race, in which Trump, at this very early stage, is the apparent frontrunner for the GOP nomination. \u201cWant to save our democracy from Trumpism? One approach is to follow the blueprint that led to last week\u2019s surprising defeat of Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who\u2019s also known as the Czech Donald Trump,\u201d wrote Dean Obeidallah. \u201cHow did the people of the Czech Republic edge out Babis? Through various political parties putting their ideological differences aside to form an alliance with one goal: getting him out of office. That meant a more conservative party had to team up with an anti-establishment party that supported gay marriage and other progressive causes they actually opposed.\u201d One man lives on \u201cAlmost Heaven,\u201d a 65-foot boat docked on the Potomac, the other in a 132-room mansion on Pennsylvania Avenue. They both go by the very generic name of Joe, the often-used placeholder \u2013 think of Joe Six-Pack, Joe Schmoe, Joe Blow and Joe College. But neither is a Joe Average. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is a \u201cfriend\u201d to the other, Joe Biden, the President said during a CNN town hall Thursday. Yet it is Manchin \u2013 and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema \u2013 who are virtually dictating the shape of Biden\u2019s central domestic policy, determining which social programs and tax increases will live or die. As the most powerful man in the world observed, when your party controls only half of the 100 seats in the US Senate, \u201cand you have 50 Democrats, every one is a president.\u201d Manchin and Sinema \u201care using their leverage to force huge concessions from the Biden administration,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer.  Proposals for free community college, expansive child tax credits, paid leave and broader Medicare benefits are on the chopping block. Sinema is singlehandedly blocking Biden\u2019s plan for higher tax rates on high earners and corporations. And there\u2019s another way the two senators are wielding power \u2013 their support for the Senate filibuster means there\u2019s no way Democrats can pass their high-priority voting rights bill. \u201cManchin and Sinema will soon face a choice of historic consequences,\u201d wrote Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen. \u201cThey can decide to protect the right to vote by supporting a change to the filibuster rules to allow the Freedom to Vote Act to pass by a majority vote. Or they can join with Senate Republicans to block voting rights legislation by a filibuster, potentially denying millions of Americans the ability to vote and take our democracy to the brink and beyond.\u201d It\u2019s Sinema\u2019s moment, wrote Elaine Godfrey in the Atlantic. \u201cThe wig-wearing triathlete senator from Arizona has quickly become one of the most hated figures in present-day American politics. She\u2019s blocking her own party\u2019s agenda; she\u2019s shutting down questions from reporters; she\u2019s schmoozing with lobbyists and jetting off to Europe.\u201d Progressives in her state are enraged, but \u201cSinema does not seem rattled by any of it \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear that she should be. Unseating her would be difficult.\u201d A lot of the coverage of Biden\u2019s social spending bill has focused on its $3.5 trillion price tag, noted Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, but \u201cone factor is too often left out of the ongoing negotiations and press coverage: its impact on the American people\u2026 We must address the plight of everyday Americans and commit to righting the historical wrongs that continue to plague our cities today.\u201d After Biden\u2019s town hall, Republican strategist Scott Jennings called it \u201codd\u201d that Biden \u201cwas sort of negotiating his budget reconciliation package on live TV. Did he say anything about any aspect of it that would have convinced Senators Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema to change their opinion and vote in favor of the bill?\u201d Frida Ghitis observed that the Biden we saw in Baltimore \u201cwas the man who won the presidential election, a skilled politician, experienced at facing the voters, humane, caring, advocating plans that most Americans support.\u201d \u201cStill, if he expected the performance to boost his sagging fortunes, it\u2019s unlikely that it will. That\u2019s not just because right-wing media will disparage his performance mercilessly, but because Americans will wait to see if he can produce results. Biden\u2019s approval ratings are unlikely to reverse course before his big legislative proposals become law.\u201d For more: Arick Wierson: The Minneapolis \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 ballot question should alarm Democrats nationwide When President Barack Obama was trying to decide what to do about the US troops in Afghanistan in 2009, and some in the Pentagon were calling for a military surge, his chief strategist David Axelrod got a call from \u201cone of America\u2019s most celebrated military leaders.\u201d Colin Powell, who had broken ranks with his party and given a vital endorsement to Obama\u2019s presidential candidacy, wanted to make sure the president controlled the decision-making process. \u201c\u2018Just remember that he\u2019s the commander in chief, and they ain\u2019t,\u2019 Powell told me. \u2018They want more troops. They\u2019ll always want more troops. History has shown that this is not always the right answer. My advice is that you take your time,\u2019\u201d Axelrod recalled. The retired four-star general died Monday, of complications from Covid-19. Powell \u201cwas one of the most fascinating figures in America\u2019s contemporary political history,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cRepresenting a kind of voice which has faded from his party, Powell described himself as \u2018a Republican of a more moderate mold,\u2019 one of the voices who urged the Party of Lincoln not to become the Party of Trump.\u201d Powell was the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a hero of the first Gulf War and the first Black person to become secretary of state. But he will also be remembered for something Powell himself called a \u201cblot\u201d on his record: his 2003 United Nations testimony in support of war against Iraq\u2019s dictator Saddam Hussein, wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cThe case fell apart following the American occupation of Iraq, which revealed that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein didn\u2019t have an active weapons of destruction program, nor was Hussein allied to al Qaeda \u2013 as Powell had asserted at the UN.\u201d Behind the scenes, Powell was a skeptic about going to war against Saddam. But nearly two thirds of Americans trusted Powell on the issue, compared to less than a quarter who trusted President George W. Bush. So Bush asked Powell to argue for war at the UN, Bergen noted. \u201cPowell rebounded from this low point by emerging as the GOP conscience on matters of race and democracy,\u201d wrote Peniel Joseph. \u201cAs the former party of Abraham Lincoln lurched ever rightward in the 21st century, Powell endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden last year\u2026 The Harlem-born, Bronx-raised son of Jamaican immigrants and a self-described \u2018problem solver,\u2019 Powell turned 35 years of service in the United States military into his own version of the American Dream.\u201d In the face of serious health challenges, Powell remained upbeat. In 2003, he announced he was being treated for prostate cancer, and in 2019, he revealed his diagnosis of multiple myeloma at an event benefitting the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, recalled Kathy Giusti, herself a cancer survivor and founder of the organization. Cancer patients, she noted, \u201cmay have a weak response to the Covid-19 vaccine, or no response at all.\u201d \u201cAs our nation reflects on his legacy as a civil servant and military leader,\u201d Giusti wrote, \u201c\u2026we also understand how cancer can put even the strongest among us at the highest of risk.\u201d In the mid-1990s, Powell was considered a top candidate for the GOP presidential nomination. This week, columnists David Von Drehle and Bret Stephens speculated about what might have been had Powell run for president and denied Bill Clinton a second term. \u201cIf Clinton had had no second term, there would have been no partisan impeachment,\u201d Von Drehle wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cThe Republican Robespierre, then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, would have been neutered as party leader with the pacifying Powell in his place\u2026 And if the last years of the 1990s and first years of this century were less bitterly divisive and dispiriting, would the United States have rolled the dice in 2016 on a reality TV star wielding a social media wedge?\u201d Bret Stephens ended his column in the New York Times this way: \u201cGeneral Powell, you should\u2019ve run in \u201996. Rest in peace.\u201d  Trump\u2019s farewell to Powell was of a piece with his response to the death of another war hero, Sen. John McCain. As SE Cupp noted, Trump trashed the general for \u201cbig mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction.\u201d He also took the opportunity to complain that the media was treating Powell \u201cso beautifully\u201d and accused him of \u201calways being the first to attack other Republicans.\u201d And then incongruously, Trump said, \u201cbut anyway, may he rest in peace!\u201d Trump has teamed up with a special purpose acquisition company to raise funds for a new media venture, now that he has been banned by Twitter and Facebook. Cupp noted that Trump\u2019s last media foray, a blog on his website, didn\u2019t last long. \u201cThe blog lived a mere 29 days, attracting fewer visitors than the pet-adoption service Petfinder and the recipe site Delish, according to the Washington Post. It was, in a word, pathetic. But anyway, may it rest in peace!\u201d Facebook, the embattled social network, has \u201ca new public relations strategy: changing its name,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo, citing a report by The Verge. The reason? \u201cThe public has lost faith in Facebook. And rightly so. For all the family photos shared or funny videos consumed that the company has made possible, \u2018Facebook\u2019 is now also a name associated in recent years with misinformation, privacy violations, the spread of hate and autocracy.\u201d To really overcome its problems, Alaimo argued, the company needs to change a different name \u2013 that of its CEO. \u201cThe fact that the company continues to deny that it has let us down is a big part of the problem here. And the person in charge of Facebook through all of this has been, of course, founder Mark Zuckerberg.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he lacks the moral inclination or the capacity to solve these problems. Either way, he\u2019s got to go. The company should announce a new chief executive with all possible haste.\u201d Fox News host Tucker Carlson lashed out at Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for taking paternity leave to spend time with his newborn twins. \u201cCarlson was perhaps the most insulting of the right-wing commentators who taunted Buttigieg for taking time off with his husband and new children,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas, \u201cbut he was far from alone. In addition to the obvious homophobia in some of these attacks, their toxic perpetuation of the antiquated idea that time to bond with and care for one\u2019s children is something \u2018only\u2019 women should do only amplifies how right Buttigieg is that the United States remains pitifully out of step with the rest of the world on this issue.\u201d On Friday, the US Supreme Court declined for the second time to block the controversial Texas law that bans abortions beyond about six weeks, but scheduled accelerated oral arguments on it. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying women who need care \u201care entitled to relief now.\u201d \u201cI cannot capture the totality of this harm in these pages,\u201d said Sotomayor. \u201cThe impact is catastrophic.\u201d Dr. Amna Dermish, an OB-GYN who provides abortions in Texas, wrote for CNN Opinion, \u201cEvery day working under this cruel law has been heartbreaking and unjust. One of my patients \u2013 who I had to turn away because she was more than six weeks pregnant \u2013 curled up and started to cry uncontrollably. All I could do was hold her hand.\u201d Jennifer Tucker: Now that guns can kill hundreds in minutes, Supreme Court should rethink the rights question Jill Filipovic: A woman is raped and onlookers record it: the story beyond the outrage Kara Alaimo: Justice Sonia Sotomayor deals with \u2018manterruptions,\u2019 too. Here\u2019s how we can stop them Robert Klitzman: How the Covid-19 booster shots could make the vaccination gap worse Jorge Contreras: Don\u2019t let gene patents make a comeback AND\u2026 \u201cSuccession,\u201d the HBO drama series focusing on fear and loathing in a family that controls a worldwide media empire, returned for a third season to much critical acclaim. No one in it is particularly likable and some are particularly awful, though their conniving can be very entertaining to watch. As Nicole Hemmer wrote, the show is \u201cpart of the waning age of antiheroes, those fundamentally amoral, craven and power-hungry protagonists who have been at the center of prestige television for at least two decades now. And while antiheroes have dominated some of 21st-century television\u2019s best shows thus far, from \u2018The Wire\u2019 and \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 to \u2018Mad Men\u2019 and \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 that era is giving way to shows whose protagonists are flawed and complicated \u2013 but still fundamentally good.\u201d Think \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d Kendall Roy\u2019s rebellion against his media-mogul father Logan Roy had potential to give \u201cSuccession\u201d uplift, Hemmer observed, but \u201crather than transforming into a heroic whistleblower, Kendall remains the same preening, power-hungry, PR-obsessed character he always was, eager to seize control of his father\u2019s company with little concern for the people around him.\u201d Speaking of conflict, the top show on Netflix worldwide and. until recently, in the US is \u201cSquid Game,\u201d a Korean drama. \u201cSquid Game\u201d is violent, emotional, and even comedic at times, but there are reasons beyond its shock value that make this drama so compelling, and for American viewers in particular,\u201d wrote Airielle Lowe, a senior at Howard University, editor-in-chief of the student publication The Liberato and an intern for CNN Opinion. \u201cThough the plot comes across as a gross exaggeration of some dystopian future, \u2018Squid Game\u2019 reminds us of the unfair and unpredictable nature of life \u2026Most viewers of \u2018Squid Game\u2019 likely can\u2019t picture themselves actually participating in the drama\u2019s deadly scenarios, and I can\u2019t either. But we empathize with the debt, loneliness and poverty that await these characters, and how their desperation to improve their conditions leaves them feeling like they have nothing to lose.\u201d",

He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. With the decision last week to delay a promised vote on the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, this unfolding spectacle proves a point I have been making for years: The political center of America is underrepresented in the United States Congress, especially in the House of Representatives. Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress routinely acquiesce to dogmatic progressives and uncompromising conservatives, respectively, because those members have large numbers in their caucuses, remain strongly unified and are not afraid to take political hostages. Progressive Democrats in the House mimicked the take-no-prisoners, hardball tactics of Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus to block the infrastructure legislation. Simply stated, the progressives are holding the bipartisan infrastructure bill hostage until there is an agreement and vote on the massive reconciliation bill with a price tag as high as $3.5 trillion. Further, progressives threatened to vote down the bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2013 legislation they ostensibly support on substance \u2013 until their demands on reconciliation were met and satisfied. It\u2019s all about \u201cleverage\u201d and progressives said this out loud. If the infrastructure bill passed into law, House moderates would no longer feel pressure to vote for the bloated reconciliation bill that has no chance of becoming law thanks to opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. In this internecine battle among congressional Democrats, President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sided with progressives over moderates. Pelosi did this by delaying the vote last Thursday, a move that played to what progressives had been demanding. Betrayal is too kind a word to describe this humiliation visited upon House moderates. Democratic House moderates are justifiably enraged and apoplectic. They were thrown under the bus. After all, moderates in good faith negotiated an agreement in August with the Speaker that facilitated a (legal) quid pro quo.  Moderates would support the House budget resolution, necessary to initiate the reconciliation process, in exchange for a vote before September 27 on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mitch McConnell blinked Pretty simple \u2013 and now that deal has been trashed. Moderates trusted their leaders to honor this agreement and they were shamefully pushed aside by those same leaders to appease the progressives. Unlike progressives, moderates cannot return to their districts and claim \u201cleverage\u201d as a reason for opposing an infrastructure bill. Reality for moderates, where re-election is not a sure thing, does not allow them to publicly oppose a popular jobs bill to protect their procedural options. Voters in swing districts would leverage moderate members out of their seats for such brazen behavior. Now that the Democratic leadership reneged on the deal and threw all in with the progressives, my advice to House Democratic moderates is simply to walk away from reconciliation negotiations until the infrastructure bill becomes law. It\u2019s time to deploy the same hardball tactics of the far left. Hold your breath and wait for your leaders to turn blue. What\u2019s so astonishing in this whole debate is the presumption that all congressional Democrats support this expansive, big spending agenda. Yes, progressives support it. Maybe I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear moderate, swing district congressional Democratic candidates in their 2020 campaigns tell their constituents they wanted to spend trillions of dollars, outside of Covid-19 relief, in support of a massive expansion of the federal government\u2019s role in our lives. Sure, Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders advocated for this agenda, but he lost the Democratic presidential primary. Democrats have completely misread Biden\u2019s 2020 election mandate. The 2020 election was a repudiation of President Donald Trump, and it was not an endorsement of a big spending agenda. Full stop. In fact, Republicans, other than Trump, did very well in the 2020 election. Not one Republican member of the US House who sought re-election lost. In fact, they picked up seats and some Democratic incumbents were defeated. Swing voters put Biden over the top and simultaneously wanted a check on the left wing of the Democratic Party by voting for down ballot Republican candidates, who exceeded expectations by any measure. This Nobel Prize is a game-changer If this $3.5 trillion reconciliation proposal and its key components are as popular as Democrats tell us, then why not take this agenda to the voters in the 2022 midterm? As Manchin stated so clearly last week during a press briefing on the reconciliation package, if progressives want a favorable vote on the reconciliation package, they\u2019ll need their constituents to \u201celect more liberals.\u201d Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson had large congressional majorities to enact their landmark platforms: The New Deal and Great Society, respectively. President Biden has the slimmest of majorities in both the House and Senate. Believe it or not, Americans cast their votes for names on a ballot, not a party slate like in many parliamentary systems. The progressives and far right need a reminder that America\u2019s founders rejected a parliamentary system of government even though at times Congress behaves as if we became one. Not all Democrats and Republicans are monolithic and doctrinaire in their approach to governing. Diverse opinions on policy exist within political parties and that is healthy for democracy. No doubt voters would like childcare options expanded, quality early childhood education provided, funding to fight back climate change and affordable access to health care for those who need it, but not on the scale proposed. What\u2019s more, these issues are not being dealt with in a vacuum.  After nearly $6 trillion in Covid spending, inflationary pressures, mayhem at the southern border, an ignominious surrender of Afghanistan to the Taliban and turbulence in Chinese financial markets as a result of the Evergrande debt crisis, now is the time for prudence and caution. Bludgeoned moderates understand this. Too bad there aren\u2019t more of them in Congress to push back.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Geoff Duncan, a Republican, is the 12th lieutenant governor of Georgia. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. Houston, we\u2019ve got a problem. A diplomatic spat with one of our oldest and closest allies. A legislative agenda stalled in a debate over the size of infrastructure packages on Capitol Hill and bumping up against major deadlines. A genuine crisis at the southern border. A confusing federal reaction to a global pandemic. Call it a crisis of credibility or capability, but any way you slice it, it is chaos \u2013 and that is precisely what President Joe Biden pledged to be the antidote for in his campaign. In fact, many of the criticisms lobbed at the administration of former President Donald Trump apply equally to his successor, whose presidency is at a moment of peril. Political opportunities abound for the out-of-power Republican Party to regain their congressional majorities next year. History tells us next year\u2019s midterm elections will likely punish the party in charge. In 1994, President Bill Clinton\u2019s party lost 54 seats in the first midterm elections. In 2010, President Barack Obama\u2019s Democrats dropped over 60 seats. Then, in 2014, Republicans seized the Senate to gain full control of Congress. And in 2018, Democrats regained control of the House while Republicans clung to a Senate majority. Thanks to the unfortunate results of January\u2019s runoff US Senate elections in my home state of Georgia, Democrats run all three branches of government. With power comes responsibility, and the party in charge has failed that test. But my Republican Party is not out of the woods either. This weekend, former President Trump is hosting a rally in my neck of the woods. If the legendary Southern rocker Charlie Daniels were still with us today, his hit song could be re-written as, \u201cA president went down to Georgia, he was looking for a party\u2019s soul to steal.\u201d Nearly a year after the election, Georgia is still very much on the former President\u2019s mind. He continues to be painfully comfortable peddling his baseless conspiracy theories of widespread election fraud. Last week, he fired off a disjointed and juvenile letter to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to \u201cdecertify\u201d the results of the election. Never mind that none of the countless recounts and audits, including the one in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, which was leaked Thursday night, has uncovered evidence of the purported fraud. Neither did Trump\u2019s legal team. His hand-picked attorney general, William Barr, declared \u201cwe have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d The growing rift between Biden and Macron Conservatives have every right to be upset that Trump blew an easy lay-up in losing a winnable election to President Biden. Unfortunately, our greatest fears have been confirmed about Biden\u2019s policy proposals. I do not blame conservatives who stand strong with the Trump administration\u2019s agenda. His four years in office were some of the most consequential in American history. Tax cuts, health care regulations rolled back, including the individual mandate, and a US Supreme Court stocked with a trio of conservative legal justices. These types of policies are near and dear to the heart of conservatives across the board, even those wary of Trump\u2019s personality. But if we are all being honest with one another, Trump did not lose because of voter fraud or his conservative policies. Biden is sitting in the White House today because voters grew tired of Trump\u2019s erratic behavior, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The upcoming elections cannot be a discussion about the past, unless we want to continue losing. Republican candidates cannot win general elections around the country if they exert all of their energy in the primary on a litmus test around unfounded election conspiracy theories. When Trump comes to Georgia this weekend, expect him to re-package his \u201cgreatest hits\u201d and once again hijack our great state for his own selfish agenda. It might make for good theater, but it is setting back the conservative movement. If we keep it up, we are looking at another four years of President Biden calling the shots.  Under Biden and a Democratic controlled Senate and House, the United States is a global laughingstock. We have handed Afghanistan back to the Taliban with an abrupt and messy withdrawal of our troops after a two-decade conflict, and caused our oldest ally to recall their ambassador. Just as the Republican Party cannot withstand re-litigating the losing battles of the past, America cannot afford another four years of Biden and crew. There is no limit to the damage they can inflict. The stakes are high for both entities. Let\u2019s hope that common sense and cooler heads prevail for the sake of this generation and the next.",

Against all odds, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau managed to beat a Covid-19 vaccination benchmark that even his counterpart to the south, US President Joe Biden, was unable to meet. After initially bungling its Covid-19 vaccine rollout, falling behind many other developed nations, including the United States, over the weekend Canada moved ahead of its southern neighbor in per-capita vaccinations. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) vaccine tracker, as of mid-day Tuesday, 50.8% of Canadians were fully vaccinated.  By comparison, just 48.6% of Americans have taken their full dose of vaccines, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the difference for people given at least one dose is even greater: 69.7% and 56.1% respectively). That beats a benchmark set by Trudeau and federal officials, who said in late November that the majority of Canadians would not be expected to be vaccinated until September or even as late as December 2021. Meanwhile, a levelling off of inoculations south of the Canadian border meant that the US fell short of Biden\u2019s goal of having 70% of adults get at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot by July 4, and the spread of the Delta variant in the US is leading to a sharp increase in hospitalizations and deaths nationwide, particularly in states with high numbers of unvaccinated people. Justin Trudeau: We can smash one of the defining inequalities of our time While the Trudeau government should avoid the temptation to take a victory lap, it arrived just in time to deliver political dividends for Trudeau as he prepares for an expected reelection campaign. It also allowed Ottawa on Monday to jump ahead of the US and announce a long-anticipated opening of the US-Canada border on August 9, when fully-vaccinated US citizens and permanent residents will be allowed into Canada. Public Security Minister Bill Blair said Monday in a press briefing that during a recent call with US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the US had not yet indicated that it would approve a reciprocal opening of the border to Canadians. (The border, which usually sees nearly 200,000 people cross in either direction each day, was closed for the first time ever to non-essential travelers and traffic in March 2020 due to Covid-19.) How did Canada, which badly bungled its initial vaccine roll-out and largely avoided  extreme measures, like the ones seen in the US, such as using pop stars and financial incentives such as guns, trucks and cash to help boost demand, manage to pull ahead of the United States? To start, Canada was spared the politicization of vaccines and of the rejection of such widely-accepted public health protocols as mask-wearing and social distancing that was seen in the United States. \u201cOf course we have our share of libertarians and anti-vaxxers. But they are a small minority. Canadians huddle close to the center and it serves them well. Getting the jab is part of that,\u201d Colin Robertson, vice president and fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute told me. In Canada for the most part, scientists and experts \u2013 some of whom became mini celebrities on television \u2013 were given the lead in dictating policy and that gave Canada a leg up over othercountries. And there are only 13 provincial and territorial leaders in Canada, compared to 50 governors in the US, which made it easier for Ottawa to battle the virus in a coordinated manner. \u201cOne thing the data show us is the extent to which politics does not drive the decision to be vaccinated in Canada relative to the US,\u201d Shachi Kurl, president of polling organization Angus Reid Institute, told me. Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go But nothing seemed to have focused the minds of Canadians more than the possibility of further lockdowns. The federal and provincial governments tactic of turning up the heat with the threat of rollbacks on openings resembled the playbook of other jurisdictions such as Singapore where case numbers were kept low. Late last year in the Southeast Asian city state, authorities said lockdown restrictions may not be relaxed if at least 70% of Singaporeans didn\u2019t use some form of approved tracing technology. Initially, Canada faced great difficulty procuring Covid-19 vaccines, and Trudeau warned citizens to expect to fall behind other developed countries, including the US. The delay in vaccination - which was partially blamed on the country not having its own its own domestic pharmaceutical production facilities - allowed an incredibly punishing third wave, resulting in Toronto, Canada\u2019s biggest city, having one of the world\u2019s longest lockdowns \u2013 more than 360 days \u2013 according to BBC News. To date, more than 1.4 million Canadians have been infected by Covid-19 and 26,466 have died. By late 2020, Canada had reportedly secured enough Covid-19 vaccines for every citizen to be vaccinated five times over, but the country still lagged in actually getting those doses out to the public because of delivery delays. By the time spring rolled around, Canadians were spoiled for choice, given the luxury of opting for the messenger RNA (mRNA) or vector vaccines \u2013 or an exotic combination of both technologies.  Expect Trudeau to leverage the vaccine success to the hilt when he hits the hustings. Tainted by several political scandals from his past two terms in office and still fresh memories of punishing lockdowns and seniors dying by the hundreds in care homes, clawing back his parliamentary majority will require political spin on the level not yet seen in a Canadian election. But as other elected leaders worldwide have discovered, if there is one thing the Covid-19 virus is extremely adept at it is exploiting the smallest cracks in our defenses. Taking a victory lap too early and rolling back public health measures for political gain \u2013 especially when, as Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has been warning that the country is still confronting struggles with vaccine hesitancy among its citizens \u2013 can bring literally deadly consequences.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. It looks like former President Donald Trump was willing to go even further than we knew in his war against leaks. According to the New York Times, prosecutors in the Justice Department obtained, via subpoena from Apple, information from the accounts of at least two members of the House Intelligence Committee\u2013Representatives Adam Schiff of California and Eric Swalwell of California\u2013 and also looked into the metadata of their aides and family members (including at least one minor). The administration was consumed with discovering the sources of leaks that the media was reporting on about contacts between associates of Trump and Russia. This story comes on top of recent revelations that this spring, the Justice Department notified reporters at CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times that records had been seized in different investigations. Trump\u2019s Justice Department had pursued what appears to be a national security leak investigation that aimed to sweep up tens of thousands of a CNN reporter\u2019s email logs, as well as phone records, from 2017. CNN lawyer on gag order: I don't know what the government wanted These new reports are another reminder of the extreme exercise of presidential power that took place under Trump. Although it is easy to dismiss his four years in office as defined by a lot of loud Twitter noise and vicious political invective, this period also witnessed the aggressive deployment of presidential authority, sometimes conducted in secret, and in ways that threatened our fragile balance of power and the rights of American citizens. The unfolding story about the Justice Department follows on many other well documented instances of abuse of power between 2017 and 2021. During Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment the world witnessed the former president\u2019s willingness to use foreign aid as leverage for obtaining \u201cdirt\u201d about a political opponent. Trump repeatedly used his Twitter bully pulpit to go after institutions\u2014such as the media\u2014and specific political opponents who were causing him trouble, even ultimately inciting a mob that attacked Congress and attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of presidential power,  based on fraudulent claims of a stolen election. His invocation of national emergency powers to obtain funding for a border wall, despite bipartisan congressional opposition to spending money on this project, showed that he would let few things stand in his way.  And in more familiar fashion, Trump turned to executive power to roll back initiatives meant to stop climate change, as well as workplace regulations and more that had been put into place by Democratic administrations. Here's the biggest problem Justice Department watchdog faces How has this all happened? The former president was a product of two long-term trends that converged during his administration. The first has been the ongoing expansion of presidential power. Over the course of the twentieth century, the power, staff and regulatory authority accorded the president has vastly expanded. During the Cold War and then in the \u201cwar against terror,\u201d the growth of the national security apparatus  handed the inhabitant of the Oval Office unprecedented resources with which to take action without congressional oversight. Even the elevation of the bully pulpit in the 20th century meant that the president, through his words, could affect public opinion in dramatic fashion. The second trend was the triumph of smash-mouth partisanship within the GOP, creating a mentality at the highest levels of leadership that it was now permissible to do whatever was necessary to maintain power. This was a style that started to take hold with Congressman Newt Gingrich in the 1980s, accelerated with the Tea Party in the 2010s and culminated with the Trump presidency. It placed partisanship above the needs of governance or the health of political institutions. There was no longer a need for elected officials to balance all three responsibilities, according to this logic: every process and procedure could be weaponized when necessary. If a president wanted to have his branch of government investigate members of another branch, for example, then so be it. As dramatic as this new story of the seizure of records from journalists and members of Congress story might be, it flows out of a basic dynamic that was well-established under the Trump presidency. So far it seems that President Joe Biden, at least from what we know, is trying to pull back on his form of presidential power. He wants to be less Richard Nixon and more Jimmy Carter, someone who understands and respects the need to operate within boundaries, even if doing so comes at certain political costs. But the bigger forces at work in this story all remain at play. Presidential power has reached levels that are not healthy for the nation. It is too easy for that power to be abused. In an age of intense political polarization, congressional oversight is unlikely. The partisanship-without-guardrails of former President Trump remains the guiding force for the GOP\u2014as was evident when Senator Mitch McConnell decided to kill the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.  And if Trump decides to run again in 2024, voters should understand that this is the kind of power they would be legitimizing for another four years.  He might be anti-establishment and he might be the politician who says what he thinks, but he is also a president who can be fearsomely Nixonian. Too much presidential power is a dangerous thing. We have learned about this so many times over the decades. As in previous instances, the question remains\u2014will American voters do anything about it, insisting to their representatives that the commander-in-chief be held accountable, or will they just wait for the abuse of power to happen again?",

View more opinion on CNN. Imagine you\u2019re returning home from a trip aboard a normal, peaceful flight. You\u2019re almost at your destination, but just before the plane crosses the border, the pilot announces without explanation that he\u2019s diverting to an unplanned location. The plane abruptly turns. and suddenly a military fighter jet is escorting your aircraft to an \u201cemergency landing.\u201d Now imagine the military plane belongs to a country ruled by a dictator, and you\u2019re a journalist and pro-democracy activist in exile who has been critically documenting the dictator\u2019s tyranny. It sounds like a movie thriller, but it\u2019s the harrowing ordeal described by passengers of the Ryanair Athens-to-Vilnius flight on Sunday.  And it did not end well for journalist Roman Protasevich. The plane was forced to land on orders of President Alexander Lukashenko, the long-time dictator of Belarus, whose security forces immediately arrested Protasevich. This cannot stand. Recent years have seen so many autocrats brazenly violating once-accepted norms \u2013 assassinating government critics on foreign soil, murdering journalists, seizing other country\u2019s territory \u2013 that some may lose sight of how unacceptable, how intolerable this behavior is. After Russia\u2019s theft of Crimea, Saudi Arabia\u2019s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and most recently \u2013 just hours after Protasevich\u2019s arrest \u2013 the detention Monday in Myanmar of American journalist Danny Fenster, these affronts to the global community and to international security may seem nearly routine. That is precisely why they must be stopped. Lukashenko\u2019s latest stunt shamelessly violates every rule of civil aviation, every norm of civilized behavior. The international community needs to impose hard-hitting sanctions. Other authoritarian rulers are watching closely. Failure to act forcefully will not only tempt them to stretch their crackdowns beyond their borders, anticipating only mild consequences, but it will make travel much more dangerous for everyone.   It will particularly endanger journalists who make dictators uncomfortable, and put their lives at risk no matter where they are or where they go. The dictator Lukashenko personally ordered a MiG-29 fighter jet to scramble toward the passenger jet, according to his office. Belarussian authorities deceptively claim they had reports of a bomb, and say they informed the pilot who, according to Belarussian Major-General Andrey Gurtsevich, was the one who made the decision to fly to Minsk, the Belarussian capital. The fighter jet, Gurtsevich said, was there to \u201cassist.\u201d Lithuanian FM: US help 'really needed' That\u2019s not what the Ryanair crew says. According to a statement from the airline, Belarus informed the crew of a \u201cpotential security threat,\u201d and they were \u201cinstructed to divert to the nearest airport, Minsk.\u201d In fact, a look at the flight map undercuts the Belarussian military claims.  With the plane closer to Vilnius than to Minsk, it is obvious that it would have made more sense to complete the flight to Vilnius than to take the longer route into Lukashenko\u2019s country. Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said that among the 171 passengers on the flight, he believed there were several members of the Belarussian KGB. O\u2019Leary accused Belarus of \u201cstate-sponsored piracy.\u201d In Ireland, the home base of Ryanair, government officials also alluded to secret service agents. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the agents were \u201cclearly linked to the Belarussian regime.\u201d About half a dozen passengers didn\u2019t board the plane for Vilnius when it finally resumed its flight several hours after the incident, he said. It\u2019s early, but all signs point to an outlaw operation by an outlaw regime. Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, is where many leaders of the pro-democracy opposition to Lukashenko are now based, having fled his brutal crackdown after last year\u2019s all-but-certainly stolen elections. Lukashenko, one of the world\u2019s longest-ruling dictators, has been in power for 26 years. Like other tyrants, he likes to pretend he rules legitimately, so he held elections last fall. Big mistake. Belarussians turned out en masse to support the opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. She had become the candidate after Lukashenko imprisoned her husband, the original opposition candidate. Lukashenko had already removed other potential opposition candidates. When Lukashenko claimed he had won the election, a claim rejected by credible observers, massive protests, led by three charismatic women, filled the streets. A throwback to Soviet days, Lukashenko came as close as ever to losing power. He received support from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who undoubtedly feared that success by pro-democracy forces in neighboring Belarus could embolden the already-restive opposition to his decades\u2019-long rule in Russia. As the crackdown worsened, opposition leaders fled for their lives. Lithuania offered support. Protasevich, who had started a channel over the Telegram app that helped pro-democracy protest organizers, was put by the regime on a terrorism list and charged with inciting public disorder. According to passengers on the RyanAir flight, as soon as the pilot announced the plane was headed to the Belarusian capital, a visibly anxious Protasevich reached for his overhead luggage, pulled out his laptop and handed it to his girlfriend. He was forcibly arrested on the tarmac by security forces. His girlfriend was also detained. World leaders condemn arrest of Belarusian opposition activist US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken condemned the forced diversion of the aircraft as a \u201cshocking act,\u201d calling for the immediate release of Protasevich. Other international condemnation was swift. European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen called the incident an \u201cunacceptable hijacking\u201d and, \u201coutrageous and illegal behavior.\u201d Former European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted that \u201cLukashenko has become a threat not only to the citizens of his country, but also to international security. His act of state terrorism requires an immediate and decisive response from all European governments and institutions.\u201d Indeed, reaction around the world has brought the expected incensed diplomatic language, but what matters is the tangible consequences. Several airlines have announced they are avoiding Belarus air space. The United Kingdom\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority has suspended permits for Belarussian carriers. And the UK Transport secretary has told airlines to avoid flying over Belarus \u201cto keep passengers safe.\u201d The chairs of foreign affairs committees in the legislatures of the United States, the UK, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Czechia, called on Belarus to be expelled from the International Civil Aviation Organization, and for all flights to, from and over Belarus to be suspended.  Following the calls for action and for an investigation, the ICAO, a UN agency, scheduled a meeting for Thursday.  Late Monday, European Union leaders agreed to bar EU airlines from flying over Belarus, an extraordinarily fast move by a body known for plodding slowly because of the requirement that it reach consensus among its 27 members. That makes this even more significant. The moves could \u2013 and should \u2013 be only the beginning of meaningful sanctions to punish Lukashenko and signal to other tyrants who might find inspiration in his behavior that the penalties will be severe for this most outrageous affront against every norm of international coexistence.",

The opinions expressed here are her own. View more opinion at CNN. Congresswoman Liz Cheney is a profile in courage. The former number three in GOP leadership is steadfast in her embrace of the Constitution over \u201cthe big lie.\u201d She is an intelligent, fierce, staunch defender of the Constitution and Republican values. She knows what it means to be a true conservative. She is unafraid to stand up to former President Donald Trump and made a career-defining vote for his impeachment based on his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. I agree with Cheney on what she espouses: the 2020 elections were free and fair, President Joe Biden won, former President Donald Trump lost, the insurrection was an affront to our Constitution and Trump holds culpability for the confrontation. I agree with her statement on Tuesday that, \u201cRemaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar.\u201d And, I agree with the GOP vote to remove her as conference chair. Both views can be held at the same time. There\u2019s an old saying: \u201cNobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.\u201d Through her words and actions, Cheney demonstrated she did not care to serve in leadership as conference chair. She didn\u2019t care to do the job she was chosen to do. As a member of leadership, you have to sacrifice your autonomy for the good of the conference. Wednesday\u2019s voice vote to extract Cheney is a far cry from the show of colleague support just three months ago.  In February, 145 GOP members voted to keep Cheney in her position as conference chair, 61 voted to remove her. Trump is the root of why GOP will sacrifice Cheney for Stefanik Her GOP colleagues tell me that she dodged a bullet then, but she didn\u2019t change course. Cheney did not hit the reset button. Instead, she misread the vote and became mistakenly emboldened in her endeavors. Many say her downfall is the result of her continuing to air grievances against Trump and undermining colleagues. The conference chair serves at the pleasure of colleagues. There is an implicit requirement of the position to foster party unity and drive a cohesive message. In other words to unite the conference, not divide it. The vote to remove Cheney should not be viewed as a way to curry favor with the former president, rather taking steps to appoint a leader to push back on the Biden policies. The chair should call out the failed leadership of the Biden administration: a disappointing April jobs report, 6.1% unemployment, the crisis at the border, failure to obtain bipartisan support on major legislation. Bravo, Liz Cheney The chair should focus on firing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and winning back the House in 2022. The chair should focus on the future, not the past. No longer bound by the shackles of leadership, Cheney can focus her energy on speaking truth to power, calling out the white lies and red herrings, providing the full story behind the half truths. With her platform as an outspoken member of Congress, Cheney can dedicate her time to debunking the deceit and calling out the danger Trump \u201ccontinues to provoke with his language.\u201d She has the freedom and announced her commitment to fight to make sure \u201cthe former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office.\u201d  As a Republican, I view Cheney\u2019s long-term goal of accountability as courageous and the party\u2019s short term goal of unity as critical. It\u2019s time for the GOP to appoint a committee chair who will not use the platform for anything other than promoting the conference message. It appears Rep. Elise Stefanik is the heir apparent. While more moderate in her votes, she is more measured in her view: defeating the Democrats, not dividing Republicans.",

He set the pattern in January, days before he took office, by outlining a huge Covid relief package amounting to $1.9 trillion and then topped it last month with a proposal for a $2 trillion infrastructure bill. On Wednesday he made another consequential gamble by announcing he would pull all US troops out of Afghanistan, a decision his predecessors were tempted to make, but didn\u2019t. Along with new tensions with Russia and China, Biden is facing leadership challenges in the wake of the mass shooting in Indianapolis, police violence in Minnesota, Chicago and elsewhere and the stubbornly high rate of Covid-19 cases. The White House revealed that he would speak to a joint session of Congress on April 28 \u2013 ratcheting up the stakes of the prime-time presidential ritual by scheduling it just two days before his 100th day in office, a milestone that shapes perceptions of new presidents. When Biden goes to the Capitol that was overrun by rioters enraged that he, and not Donald Trump would be certified as the winner of the 2020 election \u2013 and when he enters the House chamber that had to be defended at gunpoint on that chaotic January 6 \u2013 it will be a defining moment, either an opportunity to show that he is indeed \u201cbuilding back better\u201d or a demonstration that he is becoming overwhelmed by mushrooming crises. Biden is pressing \u201cthe accelerator to speed away from most of Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d Frida Ghitis wrote of his budget proposal. He is \u201ceager to undo not just the wounds from the pandemic but also the damage of the Trump years at home and abroad,\u201d and to shore up the US \u201cdiplomatic muscle without weakening its military one. In that combination, there\u2019s something for the left and for the right to dislike.\u201d Responding to the killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, at the hands of a police officer who said she mistook her gun for a Taser, Biden called out the \u201ctrauma that Black America experiences every day,\u201d and said, \u201cthere is no justification for violence,\u201d Peniel E. Joseph noted. \u201cBy not being more specific and leaving the impression that it was only protesters\u2019 violence that was unjustified, these laudatory words missed one profound mark: police violence scars American communities from the Twin Cities and surrounding suburbs to the east and west coasts. It is right to ask for peace, but that demand must be extended beyond sporadic instances of looting to explicitly include the police, as well,\u201d Joseph wrote. Biden \u201chas his hands full advancing a major infrastructure package and waging the battle against Covid-19, but this administration can\u2019t put off civil rights until later,\u201d Julian Zelizer argued. \u201cThe urgency of doing something now is fierce, lives are at stake every day and the President, who went so far as to repudiate white supremacy in his inaugural address, has to use the power of his office to take meaningful action.\u201d America needs a truth and racial healing process, wrote former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu. \u201cThe misperception that racism is individual \u2013 rather than systemic as well \u2013 is one of our nation\u2019s most persistent and counterproductive myths. Institutionalized racism pervades nearly every system in the nation, including financial, educational, health, housing, criminal justice and voting\u201d, he observed.\u00a0South Africa\u2019s \u201cTruth and Reconciliation Commission\u201d is a model that dozens of countries have followed, he noted.  Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill added fuel to an economic recovery featuring surging retail sales and an improving jobs picture. \u201cAlthough an unfortunate minority of Americans have been devastated by the pandemic, most U.S. households are better off financially today than they were before COVID reached our shores,\u201d wrote Eric Levitz, in New York Magazine. \u201cThe combination of multiple rounds of stimulus checks and a pandemic-induced contraction in consumption opportunities has enabled Americans to pay off old credit-card debts and stockpile savings.\u201d On the right, Biden is being accused of talking a good game about bipartisanship while opting to push legislation through without securing any GOP votes. \u201cUntil Biden came along, every single covid-19 relief bill was approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses,\u201d Marc A. Thiessen pointed out in the Washington Post. \u201cThe president has turned unity into division by using covid relief as a pretext to pass all sorts of liberal spending projects that have nothing to do with the pandemic\u2026Now, Biden is trying to do the same thing when it comes to infrastructure.\u201d Less than a month after two passenger jets commandeered by hijackers brought down New York\u2019s World Trade Center, with a third hitting the Pentagon and another crashing into a field in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, US forces began an attack that would soon topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had harbored Osama bin Laden\u2019s terror campaign. This week, Biden declared an end to America\u2019s longest war, saying the last US troops would withdraw from Afghanistan starting May 1. All will be home by the 20th anniversary of 9/11. The decision \u201csets the stage for a predictable disaster,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cYes, al Qaeda is a mere shadow of what it was on 9/11. That\u2019s because for the past two decades, the US and its allies have prevented Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for al Qaeda and allied groups. It\u2019s a policy that has worked. Now, that sound policy is being abandoned\u2026The pullout of US and NATO troops will likely enable the Taliban to take over much of the country.\u201d Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who served in the Army for 37 years, observed that \u201cmany of those who wear or have worn the uniform will be upset with the President\u2019s action, feeling betrayed because they were not allowed to \u2018finish the job\u2019 in which they have invested so much. They will pour themselves a bourbon, and like so many soldiers in so many past wars, they will ask themselves: What was it all for?\u201d Of Biden\u2019s decision, Hertling wrote, \u201cI\u2019m convinced this wasn\u2019t an easy call for him or his team, but in my opinion it was time to do so.\u201d Three Afghan women \u2013 Habiba Sarabi, Fawzia Koofi and Sharifa Zurmati \u2013 who are part of the government team negotiating with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, wrote that since the US went to war with the Taliban, \u201cWe have been able to make unprecedented progress toward democracy and human rights, all while improving the quality of life for Afghan women. Over the last two decades, the risk that an Afghan woman will die in childbirth has plummeted, while the life expectancy of an average Afghan woman has increased by almost 10 years. Meanwhile, the percentage of Afghan girls who attend secondary school has grown more than sixfold.\u201d They added: \u201cThe Islamic Republic and the Taliban should engage meaningfully at the negotiating table, since there is no going back. For the Afghan people and the Afghan women, the only way is forward.\u201d For more on Biden and foreign policy: Lanhee J. Chen: The choice no president ever wants to make David A. Andelman: President Joe Biden is making a major mistake on Afghanistan Michael Bociurkiw: Putin is massing troops at the Ukraine border and testing Biden\u2019s mettle US health officials recommended pausing the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this week to allow time for investigation of blood clots among a very small number of vaccine recipients. \u201cIt is essential that the FDA and CDC demonstrate to the public that they are taking seriously any risk, even the most minuscule, and continuously evaluating vaccine safety and efficacy honestly, rigorously, and transparently,\u201d wrote Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder. \u201cDismissing any risk could fuel greater mistrust.\u201d She added: \u201cMore than 180 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been administered in this country to date, according to CDC data, and we have not seen blood clots associated with either of those vaccines.\u201d In Michigan, the Covid surge continued, with no clear understanding of why, wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. The likeliest explanation: \u201ca very transmissible viral variant is spreading one step ahead of the vaccination among those newly eligible for it, with some contribution from a premature, partial return to normal life\u2026 Michigan after all was called out repeatedly by former President Donald Trump last spring as a state that needed to be liberated from Covid-19 restrictions, as if the Democratic governor, not the pandemic, was the enemy.\u201d For more on Covid: Anushay Hossain: J&J vaccine pause prompts a needed discussion of women\u2019s health Sara Novic: I was fortunate to get my vaccination, but the hurdles are too great for many other Deaf people We asked readers to let us know what they\u2019re most eagerly anticipating doing after lockdown. Jhodie-Ann Williams curated the responses, noting, \u201cThe country beginning to open up and vaccinations becoming more widely available is bittersweet. Thoughts of friends, loved ones \u2013 and even the millions who were strangers \u2013 who died of Covid-19 before they could see this day, are not lost.\u201d \u201cThere is excitement to finally experience things like holding a new grandchild in your arms, boarding a plane, putting on lipstick \u2013 you know, that others will be able to see \u2013 and going to a baseball game.\u201d \u201cWhen the pandemic is over, I want to see my children and grandchild again,\u201d wrote one California reader, Renee Aubuchon. \u201cWe have lost a year of hugs and dinners, of doing things together, being with each other that we will never get back. How precious, how incredibly sweet, it will be to see them again. I also want to walk along the beach, in a forest again\u2026\u201d When the pandemic ends, could we be in for another \u201cRoaring 20s\u201d? The 1920s were a decade lived in the shadow of \u201cthe last massive pandemic, which occurred alongside a devastating war,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. \u201cThe end of these twin crises unleashed a decade of exuberance and experimentation \u2013 and a decade of growing inequality and deepening conservatism.\u201d Today, she noted, \u201cthere is such a hunger for joy and community and a sense of being fully alive; if we can feed that both with sequins and serious political change, then the 2020s might be a decade of growing opportunity and equality, rather than an era of excess, barreling toward collapse.\u201d If the 1920s indeed occupy a big share of mind in the present decade, wrote Gene Seymour, Ernest Hemingway, the writer whose early novels broke through in that era, could \u201creturn to the spotlight.\u201d A new PBS documentary series by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick makes the case for paying attention to Hemingway, despite the many ways his life and work may be out of sync with our time. \u201cThe Hemingway style \u2013 clipped, allusive, laconic and hard-boiled \u2013 helped give American writing its rhythm and tone as much as blues and jazz helped give American music its global identity. Hemingway\u2019s style, in language and in life, reads like a metaphor for what it means to be an American, for better and for worse.\u201d Issac Bailey is a journalist based in South Carolina, \u201ca Black man who has never personally had a nasty run-in with the police. I should have no trouble with them. But I fear them, and I know they fear me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve bathed our culture in so many guns that it is reasonable to wonder who is carrying one and what they plan to do with it. It\u2019s not crazy for cops to assume a gun is present in every vehicle they stop, just as it\u2019s not crazy for Black men to think they might become the next hashtag during a traffic stop because a cop was having a bad day or can\u2019t tell the difference between a Taser and Glock. We\u2019ve sprung a trap on ourselves and can\u2019t see our way out.\u201d In Minneapolis, ex-officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial is coming to a close, with the nation watching. Paul Callan noted the array of police witnesses testifying against Chauvin and the medical experts \u201cwith sterling credentials\u201d who testified \u201cthat Chauvin and other officers used excessive force, substantially contributing to Floyd\u2019s death.\u201d Against that, Callan noted, \u201cthe defense argues that Floyd\u2019s heart trouble and his refusal to remain in the police car after his arrest were the main reasons for his death.\u201d But the flaw in the argument is that \u201cthe restraint used by Chauvin does not have to be the sole cause of death to support a murder or manslaughter conviction under Minnesota law. The prosecutor need only prove that Chauvin\u2019s actions were a \u2018substantial causal factor.\u2019\u201d Paul Begala recalled this week his favorite ride at the Fort Bend County Fair \u2013 the Tilt-a-Whirl. \u201cYou sit in a car that rolls and spins around an undulating track, moving in at least three different ways at once,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe ride is a blast. When you get off it, it\u2019s hard to walk. You get the sensation that the ground is spinning and heaving. But it\u2019s not. It was the chaotic ride that made the ordinary seems disorienting. Someone who\u2019s clearly been on the Trump Tilt-a-Whirl too long is Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. The poor man is staggering about, wondering why the earth is spinning.\u201d Cornyn tweeted a lament Monday that Biden is limiting his own tweets and interviews and scripting his comments. \u201cDoes Cornyn really miss the last four years of presidential Twitter? Does he not remember the insanity and toxicity that former President Donald Trump unleashed every day on social media? Does Cornyn really think it\u2019s a problem that the current President is being\u2026steady, stable, normal and grounded?\u201d Nikki Haley, a Republican who sharply criticized Trump after the Capitol riot, now is saying she would support him if he ran again in 2024. \u201cShe\u2019s again taking the coward\u2019s approach,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic, \u201cspeaking out when she believes the risk is low, and then refusing to actually act when the stakes are high.\u201d With Trump taking a lower profile post-presidency, Fox News host Tucker Carlson \u201cis among the leading voices working deliberately to mainstream a set of virulently racist anti-immigrant ideas,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. \u201cHistory demands that we pay more attention, not less, because it suggests there\u2019s every reason to believe Carlson and his acolytes could succeed in normalizing hate for a wider audience.\u201d Simran Jeet Singh: Why Sikh Americans again feel targeted after the Indianapolis shootings Cornell William Brooks: The lessons of Beulah Mae Donald, the mother who took down the Klan Priya Singh: For immigrants like me, the \u2018Great Pretend\u2019 doesn\u2019t work anymore Catherine Mayer: Public sympathy is with the Queen.

Markey and Mondaire Jones: Add four justices to the Supreme Court Errol Louis: Is New York ready for a pro-Trump governor? AND\u2026 A reader\u2019s question sent John D. Sutter on a search for US cities most likely to avoid disasters caused by a changing climate. The surprising answer: places like Duluth, Minnesota. Sutter consulted Jesse Keenan, of Tulane University, who has been researching the question. \u201cThe entire Great Lakes region is poised to succeed in this way, Keenan told me. Thinking across decades and generations \u2014 not right away \u2014 that northern region could undergo a Renaissance as people flee fire, rising seas, floods, hurricanes and extreme drought. There are still climate risks in the upper Midwest, to be sure. But they are expected to be less intense than those affecting other parts of the United States.\u201d Among other climate-resilient cities: \u2013Burlington, Vermont \u2013Rochester and Buffalo, New York \u2013Pittsburgh \u2013Knoxville, Tennessee, and \u2013Asheville, North Carolina. Duluth\u2019s mayor Emily Larson told Sutter, \u201cWe are known as the San Francisco of the North.\u201d The average home price is a comparative bargain \u2013 just above $200,000, to San Francisco\u2019s $1.4 million. The average temperature in January may not be as attractive: 8 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to 49 in San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place to live. It\u2019s an extraordinary place,\u201d Larson said of Duluth. \u201cAnd we want to be that (refuge) for people.\u201d",

View more opinion on CNN. As a brand extension, the recently announced launch of the America First Policy Institute couldn\u2019t be better. The name leans on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign catchphrase and, true to form, promises something grand. And though it\u2019s built on a shaky foundation \u2013 how many real policies did the former president actually have? \u2013 its $20 million starting budget offers insiders a chance to get paid for continuing to spread Trump\u2019s populist message. Trump alumni without independent means are going to need paychecks \u2013 especially after some members of the former administration were reported to be having trouble finding jobs following the deadly Capitol riot by Trump supporters on January 6. Randall Lane, the editor of Forbes magazine, bluntly warned employers that if they hired any of Trump\u2019s \u201cfellow fabulists\u201d  the publication \u201cwill assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie.\u201d Politico also reported that former Trumpers faced \u201cbleak\u201d job prospects due to the taint of their association with him. A handful of Trump loyalists still draw federal salaries because the government provides small staffs for former presidents. And some, like former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and former White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, have been given work by Fox News. Joe Biden's audacious gambles (Kudlow is also listed as vice chair of the America First Institute\u2019s board.) However, few other major hirings have been announced and GOP/Trump insider Armstrong Williams told the Washington Post that \u201cmany, many people\u201d saw job offers rescinded after Trump incited the attack on the Capitol. Given the former president\u2019s entrepreneurial past, it\u2019s no surprise that acolytes who faced dim job prospects decided to create work for themselves. According to the institute\u2019s website, 35 of them have been named to the \u201cteam.\u201d (Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner will reportedly be part-time advisers.)  With those millions in start-up money, salaries shouldn\u2019t be a problem. And in true Trump fashion, more than half the folks named to the institute will get fancy titles such as \u201cchair\u201d of this or \u201cdirector\u201d of that. But what exactly will they be doing? According to the institute\u2019s site, it will house 15 or more \u201ccenters\u201d that will conduct research and \u201cdevelop policies that put the American people first.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Team Trump promised the same thing during his administration, but didn\u2019t get very far. Perhaps as they set to work, the institute\u2019s chairs and directors could come up with the health care plan promised by Trump and never delivered. Or a real infrastructure program to replace the one Trump apparently forgot. Come to think of it, the institute could fill its entire agenda with ideas that the former president either failed to develop or implement despite big promises. To begin there\u2019s that \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d southern border wall that Mexico was supposed to pay to construct. Trump didn\u2019t get it half-way finished and Mexico hasn\u2019t paid a penny. Then there are all those jobs Trump promised to create in manufacturing plants and coal mines. And how about the 4% annual growth in Gross Domestic Product he promised? Maybe the institute could devise policies to make that happen. GOP senator is staggering around after riding the Trump-a-Whirl too long The problem for all the thinkers who will populate the America First Institute is that greater Washington, not to mention the country overall, is already very well-served by policy experts. The Heritage Foundation, Brookings, the Kaiser Family Foundation, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Rand Corporation, Center for American Progress, and National Bureau of Economic Research, to name a few, spend hundreds of millions annually on policy research and development. They also count Nobel laureates and other global leaders in their ranks. At the American First institute one of the best-known names comes with additional controversy attached. John Ratcliffe, who served as Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence for seven months, faced questions about whether he misrepresented his credentials prior to taking the job and while in office declassified unverified Russian intelligence in an apparent attempt to help Trump politically. A few of the institute\u2019s people, like Lt. General Keith Kellogg, former national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, will bring a touch of gravitas to the operation but generally speaking the folks at Rand or Brookings likely have little to fear in terms of academic competition. Besides, some of the topic areas assigned to this team suggests a less-than-serious cast of mind. Among the institute\u2019s \u201ccenters\u201d will be one devoted to \u201cmedia accountability\u201d that will be directed by a former Trump campaign marketing officer with no apparent experience in the media. Likewise, a Center for Election Integrity will be run by a former state trial court judge who lists no election-related expertise in her biographical sketch. Election integrity and media accountability are obsessions for Trump, who is infamous for unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and countless reckless attacks on the press. Taken together, the people and the agenda of the new institute suggest that it will serve mainly as a make-work project for needy administration alumni keeping up the pretense that Trump was a successful leader. Much will have to be overlooked, including the former president\u2019s miserable response to the Covid-19 pandemic, his record of lies, and his decisive defeat in his reelection bid.  The team\u2019s commitment to maintaining the mirage of Trump\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d \u2013 even without mentioning him by name on the site \u2013 was apparent as the institute\u2019s president Brooke Rollins announced it was launching to \u201ccontinue the transformative changes\u201d of the last four years. \u201cWe keep the mission going,\u201d she declared in her pop-up video message on the site\u2019s home page. Heaven help us.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In 1983, Rep. Pat Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat, was frying eggs in a nonstick pan one morning when she had an inspiration. Frustrated by then-President Ronald Reagan, she would later declare in a speech on the House floor, \u201cHe has been perfecting the Teflon-coated presidency: He sees to it that nothing sticks to him.\u201d Actually, at least one thing definitely did stick to Reagan: Schroeder\u2019s label. And Teflon, discovered by accident in a DuPont lab in 1938, proved versatile as a political tag. President Bill Clinton, for example, was \u201cteflonish,\u201d Schroeder told CNN\u2019s Charles Bierbauer in 1997. Reagan\u2019s grandfatherly mien and Hollywood stage presence helped him weather two terms in office, though he did shoulder blame for many controversies. With President Joe Biden two-thirds of the way through his first 100 days, one emerging question is where he will ultimately land on the Teflon scale: as a president stuck with blame for the crises occurring on his watch \u2014 or one who largely manages to avoid it? At his first presidential press conference Thursday, \u201cthe President took tough questions from journalists without making any significant mistakes or verbal stumbles, defended his administration vigorously, and showed a deep and nuanced understanding of a wide range of issues \u2013 and the politics needed for results,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. In the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin observed, \u201cTry as they might to seem \u2018tough,\u2019 the media did not succeed in knocking Biden off message. Biden spoke in great detail and length to show not only his mastery of the issues but also to suck tension and conflict out of the room.\u201d All around him, difficulties abound \u2014a struggling economy he\u2019d like to push toward a big recovery, the complicated rollout of an enormous Covid-19 vaccination program, the aftermath of mass shootings \u2013 a week apart \u2013 in Colorado and metro Atlanta, a surge of unaccompanied children over the southern border. \u201cBuffeted by unanticipated events and lines of questioning \u2013 and complicated by the President\u2019s tendency to occasionally drift off point \u2013 the White House communications machine is hard to control,\u201d wrote David Axelrod before the press conference. Still, Biden enjoys approval ratings much higher than Donald Trump ever achieved \u2013 an average of 54%, according to FiveThirtyEight. The President is putting his focus on touting the benefits of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill he maneuvered through Congress without any Republican support and aiming to build on it with an infrastructure plan, possibly as big as $3 trillion, he promises to announce this coming week in Pittsburgh. But many of his initiatives, along with a measure to buck new state GOP clampdowns on voting access, may be blocked by Republicans using the Senate filibuster. Biden told reporters the \u201cfilibuster was being abused, apparently not recognizing that his own party, a minority in the US Senate for the last six years, used it quite liberally during the Trump administration,\u201d wrote Scott Jennings. \u201cIn fact, he took it a step further and said he agreed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster was \u2018a relic of the Jim Crow era.\u2019 Does he not remember his 2005 Senate speech passionately defending the filibuster?\u201d Yet many agree with Obama in connecting the filibuster to Jim Crow. In Salon, Amanda Marcotte wrote that Republicans are depending on the filibuster to keep any bill \u201cto secure voter rights\u201d from passage in the Senate.  \u201cAfter Donald Trump, the GOP understands their party exists because of racism and white grievance. Rather than try to moderate those views and appeal to more diverse voters, they instead are laser-focused on trying to prevent people of color from exercising their right to vote.\u201d As Nicole Hemmer pointed out, \u201cJim Crow, a name derived from racist minstrel shows that would come to stand in for the entire segregationist regime of the South, emerged in the late 19th century as a series of anti-Black laws: laws that stripped Black men of the right to vote, segregated public spaces, barred Black people from certain types of jobs.\u201d Stacey Abrams has called Georgia\u2019s new voter restrictions law \u201ca redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie.\u201d But Hemmer noted that Jim Crow \u201cnever really went away.\u201d Jim Crow \u201cmarches hand in hand with both state violence and mob violence, as we were once again reminded during the insurrection at the Capitol. In fact, it\u2019s precisely because Jim Crow has always been clothed in respectability during the day and worn a hood at night that we should be on alert when we see a Jim Crow-like figure in a business suit, because if history is any indication, that\u2019s not the only way we\u2019ll see him before all is said and done.\u201d A man carrying a semiautomatic weapon killed 10 people at a Boulder, Colorado supermarket Monday. As SE Cupp noted, it \u201cwas the seventh mass shooting in seven days. That is a nauseating number. It\u2019s also a wake-up call. The Boulder shooting, which followed the Atlanta spa shooting, is an awful reminder that we have not come close to solving our gun violence problem in this country.\u201d To do so, she argued, the US should have comprehensive background checks of gun buyers, an improved database of criminals, more studies of gun violence and safety and better ways to stop people with mental health issues from acquiring guns. \u201cCongress and the President should pass common-sense gun control laws, complete with stringent background checks, and an assault weapon ban that would reduce the likelihood of mass shootings and gun violence,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph. \u201cOur public schools and institutions of higher education should be leading a national, data-driven conversation about gun violence as a national public health crisis.\u201d In the metro Atlanta region, families are grieving the loss of eight people, six of them Asian American women, in last week\u2019s shooting at three spas. The killings, Pawan Dhingra wrote, came after \u201cmonths of mounting concerns over anti-Asian violence during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d He argued \u201cthe federal response is woefully inadequate when it comes to preventing violence against Asian Americans. In order to effect lasting and meaningful change, we need an educational campaign starting in K-12 schools that reveals the strength and complexity of Asian Americans \u2013 just like any humans. People\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d Annika Olson\u2019s dream is to buy a house in the \u201cabsolutely bonkers\u201d real estate market of Austin, Texas. The 26-year-old checks new listings before work. \u201cI look at a house one day, and the next day a little red icon says \u201cpending.\u201d \u2026 In short, I\u2019m toast.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve scrimped and saved for years, working for AmeriCorps for $1,000 a month and doing everything I could to build up my credit score and savings account so I could buy a house. But with inventory so low, it barely seems possible.\u201d Millennials, already hard hit by the pandemic downturn, are getting shut out of many other cities due to high prices, she wrote. \u201cWe, as a country, need to find a way to allow young people a slice of the pie, an opportunity to grow their wealth and invest in something that is important for their future.\u201d The wars of the 20th century were personally disastrous for many people in Britain \u2013 but not for everyone. Hence the phrase that became popular to describe those who came through them with an enhanced reputation: he or she \u201chad a good war.\u201d We\u2019re beginning to see people claim to have had a good pandemic. For example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that \u201cFlorida cut against the grain of elite opinion and bucked the media narrative. The result is open schools, comparatively low unemployment and per capita Covid mortality below the national average.\u201d Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist, isn\u2019t buying it. \u201cAs of March 22, over the last seven days, Florida has had the most Covid-19 cases in the country, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 12th highest per capita case-rate, the fourth highest number of deaths, and the 17th highest death rate.\u201d New York\u2019s lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, pointed to the pandemic\u2019s continuing impact on women. \u201cWhen the Covid-19 tsunami hit us one year ago, the tidal wave swept over our most vulnerable. Now left in the wake are women of all ages struggling because for them, this pandemic has been a living hell.\u201d For more on Covid-19\u2019s impact: Dorit Reiss: Can your boss require you to get vaccinated?

It\u2019s time we recognize them as such Kaylah Dessausure: My Covid life as a single mom: Like juggling bowling pins and chainsaws Sandy Tolan: The promise of a post-Covid life The ramifications of former President Donald Trump\u2019s big lie that the election was stolen from him continue to ripple out. Prosecutors have charged hundreds of people with crimes as a result of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Sidney Powell, a former Trump lawyer responsible for some of the most outlandish and groundless allegations about the election, is trying to defend herself from a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems (the company also filed a suit against Fox News Friday). \u201cPowell now argues that she did not defame Dominion because her statements were not factual in nature at all, but instead were merely her opinions,\u201d Jennifer Rodgers wrote. But Powell was doing more than just offering her opinion. She and her colleagues \u201cwere doing everything in their power to convince Trump\u2019s supporters that the election was stolen from him through fraud. They created and fed the big lie.\u201d Despite all of the video evidence to the contrary, Trump claimed on Fox News that the Jan. 6 riot \u201cwas zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn\u2019t have done it. Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships.\u201d As Michael D\u2019Antonio pointed out, \u201cWhile one officer appeared to pose for a selfie with a rioter and others opened the barricades to allow the mob to enter the grounds of the US Capitol, many Capitol and DC Metro police officers also risked their lives and engaged in hand-to-hand combat trying to protect the lawmakers who were certifying the results of the 2020 election inside. During the melee, some officers were beaten and sprayed with chemicals. At least 138 sustained injuries including burns, concussions and rib fractures. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died from injuries sustained during the attack, and two others later died by suicide.\u201d Meanwhile, an adviser said Trump is readying a new social platform to air his views, now that he has been banned from Twitter. \u201cTrump hates not being heard,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be easy for him to regain his hold. After all, the former president is now officially a political loser.\u201d A 1,300-foot container ship called Ever Given gave the world of international shipping a body blow Wednesday. It ran aground in the Suez Canal, a waterway that carries 12% of the world\u2019s shipping, and blocked traffic, stranding hundreds of ships. \u201cA failure of machinery, human error or natural events \u2013 high winds and reduced visibility \u2013 may have caused Ever Given to run ashore in the Suez Canal,\u201d wrote Salvatore R. Mercogliano, a history professor and former merchant mariner. \u201cBut its impact will resonate far from its banks as it has blocked the jugular of one of the largest trade routes in human history.\u201d Stephanie Flores: In the US Navy I learned about honor, courage, commitment and sexism Erica Armstrong Dunbar: Beulah Mae Donald\u2019s nightmare became a challenge to America Elie Honig: One of the most important trials America has ever seen is about to start Jain Kim: My parents came to the US from Korea for a better future.

It changed the weather and caused more deaths across Europe.\u201d What will happen to the new, and so far mild, Iceland eruption? Lev wrote, \u201cNobody knows now whether it will stop in a few days or continue for years and become an unparalleled tourist attraction.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. Running White House messaging is like driving a high-performance race car. The machine is powerful but it is easy at any moment to spin off the track. Seared in my memory as a former White House adviser is a lesson President Joe Biden\u2019s team is learning today: Hard as you try to drive a message, major unforeseen events intrude, diverting public attention and demanding your response. When the White House announced eight days ago that Biden would hold his first formal press conference on Thursday, his team probably hoped to use the exchange with reporters to tout progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the virtues of his signature American Rescue Act which greenlighted stimulus checks, as well as more aid for the unemployed and Americans facing eviction, and additional support for small businesses. Since then, two mass shootings \u2013 in the Atlanta area and in Boulder, Colorado \u2013 have rekindled demands for federal action for stricter gun laws. While the pace of vaccinations rapidly accelerates, the number of Covid cases has climbed as states across the country are beginning to reopen. Illegal border crossings by unaccompanied minors are increasing, as is friction among factions of the Democratic base. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy should be fired As if that weren\u2019t enough, rhetorical salvos have flown between the US and its two most irksome adversaries, China and Russia, portending challenging days ahead.  And on the eve of the press conference came news of provocative new ballistic missile tests by North Korea. In fact, a week that was supposed to feature presidential events to lift up and underline the Rescue Act has yielded entirely different and vexing storylines that you can be sure will dominate Thursday\u2019s session. Eager to avoid unforced rhetorical errors, Biden\u2019s team did a brilliant job throughout the general election campaign of controlling his interactions with the news media, mitigating the risk of unintended stories. That has continued during his first weeks in office. Americans mostly have heard from their new President in scripted remarks. It\u2019s in marked contrast to his ubiquitous predecessor, who was always eager to share every thought \u2013 well-founded and truthful or not. Biden has done relatively few interviews. (In fairness, even Trump limited most of his interviews to the fawning precincts of Fox News.) Donald Trump thirsts to be heard As president, Biden participated last month in a televised CNN town hall with citizens, a format that allowed him to display his prodigious empathy and decency, with limited opportunity for follow-ups from the moderator. Thursday\u2019s event will be a more challenging format, with reporter questions and follow-ups. Biden may choose in an opening statement to make an announcement that he hopes will drive the news coverage. He will be furnished with a list of questioners, carefully curated by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki. As is customary, he will have spent hours prepping with his team. But rigorous though his prep may be, Biden and his team can only guess at the nature of the questions, many of which will be shaped by the events of the past week and even the hours before he takes the podium. Some questions may come with a twist. Last week, in one of Biden\u2019s rare interviews, ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos asked the President whether he thought Vladimir Putin is a \u201ckiller.\u201d Biden paused, but after a moment of hesitation said, \u201cI do.\u201d His blunt characterization of the Russian president touched off a diplomatic furor and probably was not the news the White House wanted to make.  When he steps up to the podium Thursday, Biden\u2019s aides and advisers will be hoping that the questions he hears will be familiar and the news he makes intended. That podium, with the presidential seal affixed, is a powerful platform but there is no guarantee. Buffeted by unanticipated events and lines of questioning \u2013 and complicated by the President\u2019s tendency to occasionally drift off point \u2013 the White House communications machine is hard to control. Thursday will be an interesting test for this nascent presidency.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Where does the hate come from? That was the question on many people\u2019s minds after the killing of women at three spas in Georgia on Tuesday drew even more attention to the targeting of Asian Americans in the year since the coronavirus pandemic was declared. A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with shooting to death eight people, including six Asian women, in metropolitan Atlanta. While officials said they were investigating the motive \u2013 they cited the suspect\u2019s claim he had a \u201csex addiction\u201d \u2013 there was growing outrage over the spate of attacks ever since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in China, and politicians, including then-President Donald Trump, labeled it the \u201cChina virus.\u201d \u201cPoliticians didn\u2019t invent prejudice, but they are exploiting it for political gain, and destroying lives in the process,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cDuring House hearings on anti-Asian violence Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, somehow managed to speak approvingly of lynchings \u2013 \u2018Find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree\u2026we take justice very seriously\u2026\u2019 \u2013 while excoriating China\u2019s regime and its role in the pandemic. It was a virtuoso performance of false equivalency and incitement. But stoking racism and fear of immigrants has become one of the go-to tools of the Trumpist Republican Party.\u201d Jennifer Ho, the daughter of a refugee father from China and an immigrant mother from Jamaica, lived in the South for nearly 20 years. She wrote that \u201cTo be an Asian woman in America means you can\u2019t just be what you are: a fully enfranchised human being. It means you are a blank screen on which others project their stories, especially, too often, their sexualized fantasies \u2013 because US culture has long presented Asian women as sexualized objects for White male enjoyment.\u201d A professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Ho is the president of the Association for Asian American Studies. \u201cTo be an Asian woman working in the US South in the massage industry means being an object, not a subject\u2026It means further disappearing: being one of six women killed in what people aren\u2019t even calling a racially motivated crime, although can there be any doubt that it was misogyny and toxic masculinity that killed you?\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristie Lu Stout wrote from Hong Kong that \u201chate has turned my once proud and confident Asian-American mother into a shut-in. It\u2019s not because of the virus as Covid-19 continues to rage in my home state of California. It\u2019s because she is absolutely certain that as an older Asian woman with a limp she will be targeted by violence. THIS is the America she left her homeland for?\u201d  Adeline Chen, a features producer in Atlanta for CNN International, took a road trip with her family through the South last summer because further travels seemed risky. \u201cWhile on the surface, it might have seemed like a safe and socially distant trip, it felt anything but during this period of racial reckoning and a pandemic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy daughter and I were often the sole minorities in RV parks surrounded by flags and signs supporting then-President Donald Trump, who routinely called Covid-19 the \u2018China Virus\u2019 or \u2018Kung Flu.\u2019\u2026 Many people can afford to excuse the \u2018crazy uncle\u2019 who says racist things, but in doing so, they allow unacceptable rhetoric that has real life harmful implications for those like myself, who cannot shed their skin \u2013 nor would want to.\u201d In just the first two months of this year, \u201cAsian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times,\u201d John Avlon pointed out. \u201cIn recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen the murder of an 87-year-old Thai immigrant, Vichar Ratanapakdee, as well as the brutal assault of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco not named publicly, and the beating of 27-year-old Denny Kim in LA\u2019s Koreatown, who says his attackers shouted \u2018You have the Chinese Virus, go back to China.\u2019\u201d For more on political issues: Euny Hong: How are the Atlanta spa shootings NOT a hate crime SE Cupp: \u2018What century am I in?\u2019 Jeffrey D.

President Joe Biden isn\u2019t even finished with his first 100 days in office and he\u2019s already locked in a war of words with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, Biden told interviewer George Stephanopoulos that he would indeed characterize Putin as a \u201ckiller\u201d and said he would \u201cpay a price\u201d after a US government intelligence report accusing Russia of meddling in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump. Putin answered Biden, \u201cI wish you health.\u201d As Russia expert Daniel Treisman wrote, \u201cIt was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned\u2026All this suggests the depths to which US-Russia relations have sunk.\u201d Biden\u2019s policy on Russia couldn\u2019t be more different from Trump\u2019s. But on China, the two administrations may have a lot in common. At the end of last week, Biden\u2019s team brought together the leaders of the \u201cQuad\u201d countries \u2013 Australia, India, Japan and the US. Lisa Curtis, who was deputy assistant to Trump and a director on the National Security Council, called the Biden move \u201ca remarkable demonstration that it will not only build on the momentum the alliance has gained over the last three years, but also make it the centerpiece of the US\u2019 Indo-Pacific strategy,\u201d to counter \u201cthe rising superpower,\u201d China. Last May 24 was supposed to be wedding day for Aliza Norwood, a physician and medical school professor in Austin, Texas, and her fianc\u00e9 Dan. \u201cInstead,\u201d Norwood recalled, \u201cwe stood in the open doorway of his house in our sweats and laughed as a torrent of hail pelted down from the sky. The absurdity of a torrential hailstorm during a Texas summer on that particular day felt totally appropriate during those early months of the pandemic, when the whole world seemed turned upside down.\u201d Since then, they\u2019ve rescheduled the wedding three times, waiting for a time when a large gathering would be safe again. They are not alone of course \u2013 millions have canceled plans and taken smart precautions against spreading the virus. But now there are glimmers of hope. CNN\u2019s global tracker shows that an average of 11 million vaccine doses are being administered each day around the world. The US is among the nations furthest along in vaccinating its population, with 12% fully \u2013 and another 10% partly \u2013 vaccinated. Still, there are fears about variant versions of the virus that causes Covid-19, and Europe is struggling with a resurgence, along with a slow rollout of vaccines. \u201cThe virus will always find a way around things \u2014 become more transmissible, less vaccine-controllable,\u201d wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. \u201cLike everything else in the real world, pandemic control will require that people make good decisions.\u201d What are you hoping to do once it\u2019s safe to venture out more widely? Share your thoughts here and we\u2019ll report back. Jill Filipovic can\u2019t wait for things to get back to \u201csome kind of normal.\u201d She observed, \u201cI feel isolated, anxious, depressed and miserable, like an entire year of my life disappeared. But this moment \u2013 the beginning of the end of our social halt \u2013 is going to be one of the hardest parts for a lot of us \u2026 like all big life transitions, a lot of people are going to react poorly to it. It\u2019s going to stir up uncertainty and fear, hope and disappointment. Change \u2013 even change for the better \u2013 is tough on a lot of people. Let\u2019s all go easy on each other.\u201d As hard as it may be to get a vaccine appointment right now, the surprising reality is that the US will soon have an enormous glut of vaccines, wrote Michael Camu\u00f1ez, a former US Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. It has secured enough doses of the three FDA -approved vaccines for at least 500 million people, \u201ctwice the target population.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t let a life-saving surplus go to waste,\u201d Camu\u00f1ez wrote. The first place that should get America\u2019s excess vaccine? Mexico. It is one of the nation\u2019s largest trading partners and shares a 2,200 mile border with the US. \u201cThe longer Mexico persists with a majority of its population unvaccinated, the greater the risk that a new mutation or strain of the virus could emerge and infect those in the US,\u201d he observed in a CNN Opinion piece published Monday. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is finalizing plans to start sharing doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada. Several nations paused the use of that vaccine after reports surfaced of blood clots among a few recipients. \u201cRegulators and vaccine safety experts still consider the vaccine to be overwhelmingly safe and effective,\u201d wrote Ines Hassan, a senior health policy researcher, \u201cand many of the countries that halted the use of the vaccine have since reversed course. Nevertheless, there is a great deal more work that needs to be done to rebuild trust in the vaccine.\u201d How did President Joe Biden win approval for a $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package that sent money to most Americans, state and local governments, schools and businesses? Credit a 47-year Georgia politician who continually demonstrates her accomplishment. Stacey Abrams became the first woman party leader in the Georgia legislature, narrowly lost a race for governor and led voter-outreach efforts that helped turn the red state blue in November and then went on to elect two Democratic senators. Now Abrams is focused on fighting GOP efforts to make voting harder in states where Democrats scored victories last year. \u201cMany Republicans have weaponized the 2020 election lies as the impetus to propose sweeping efforts to suppress voter access,\u201d Abrams wrote for CNN Opinion. \u201cThe litany of proposed changes is dizzying \u2013 from making voting by mail more difficult by eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, to limiting early voting options to restricting ballot drop box locations.\u201d She urged the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, even if it has to make an exception to the filibuster rule, as it did with the Covid relief package. \u201cNothing is more essential to the durability of our democracy than the ability of the people to speak, regardless of ZIP code, race, age or income.\u201d Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican, warned Democrats to take care. \u201cIf the filibuster is eliminated \u2013 and when Republicans regain control of the White House and Congress someday \u2013 Democrats should expect attempts by the GOP to strike back.\u201d The filibuster needs changes, Dent argued. \u201cWithout a bipartisan consensus on changes to the filibuster, however, Congress will become even more tragically divided than it already is.\u201d The Democratic-controlled House is facing a potentially momentous election ruling. Rita Hart, a Democratic candidate in Iowa, lost her election by six votes to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, according to that state\u2019s election officials. There are 22 disputed ballots, enough to oust the Republican and install Hart in the seat, if the Democratic-controlled House supports her challenge. Election law expert Joshua A. Douglas argued that it would be a mistake: \u201cFormer President Donald Trump infamously refused to accept defeat in 2020, producing dangerous results for the peaceful transfer of power. He wanted Vice President Pence and Republicans in Congress to object to states that he lost. That mindset \u2014 that it is acceptable for a losing candidate to appeal to a favorable partisan body to challenge the results \u2014 undermines the legitimacy of our democracy.\u201d The governors of two huge coastal states faced crises \u2013 of two very different natures \u2013 this week that could end with them thrown them out of office. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under investigation by the State Attorney General and a state assembly committee that could launch an effort to impeach him over sexual harassment allegations and a scandal involving the misreporting of deaths in nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic. It shouldn\u2019t have taken the recent revelations for New Yorkers to recognize that Cuomo\u2019s conduct has long been disqualifying, wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cIt is not news that Gov. Cuomo is a bully. While there is no excuse for his behavior, New Yorkers also bear some responsibility for repeatedly choosing to elevate him to power. Now, it\u2019s time for all of us to reevaluate the values we want our leaders to embody and withdraw support for the kinds of men who \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 hold women back.\u201d The case \u201cfor impeaching New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is increasingly compelling,\u201d wrote Lincoln Mitchell, but his rivals in the state may fear that the potential elevation of lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat from upstate, could frustrate their hopes \u2013 of either a progressive successor to Cuomo, or, in the Republicans\u2019 case, of a GOP governor. In California, Republicans may have secured enough petition signatures to force Gov. Gavin Newsom into a recall election. But it\u2019s not a partisan \u201cpower play,\u201d wrote Lanhee J.

He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. When I was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 2004, I did not spend much time thinking or worrying about the US Senate filibuster, a rule invoked by the minority party to delay the passage of a bill or confirmation of a federal appointment. Yet, during the 2005-2006 session of Congress, when Republicans controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress, I regularly heard fellow House GOP members lambast obstructionist Senate Democrats, as they demanded abolition or extreme changes to the Senate filibuster rules. Back then, Democrats \u2013 like then-Sen. Joe Biden \u2013 opposed eliminating the filibuster, saying it would be \u201ca fundamental power grab by the majority party.\u201d Fast forward in time, and now it is Democrats who are decrying the filibuster. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, in a letter to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, recently wrote, \u201cThere is an institutional deference that maybe would have been fine in times past, but a defense of the status quo is inadequate to the challenges of our time. We have to follow the rule of law, but we don\u2019t have to defer to norms and traditions.\u201d After four years of former President Donald Trump indiscriminately swinging his wrecking ball at all sorts of norms, customs and traditions, I am surprised to hear Democrats make such statements. But, more importantly, I think, as I did when I entered Congress, that eliminating the filibuster \u2013 despite its flaws \u2013 would be disastrous. The filibuster is the last and best mechanism available to compel some level of bipartisan cooperation to advance meaningful, durable legislation in Congress. It\u2019s important to note that some of the biggest opponents of the filibuster have been the most radical and extreme voices \u2013 not the leaders who strive for moderation. In 2010, the Tea Party\u2019s electoral victories brought an aggressive, merry band of hard-right conservatives to Congress who, with great zeal, further turbocharged the filibuster abolition movement. Those GOP House voices grew even louder and angrier after the 2014 midterm election delivered a Republican majority to the Senate. The 'nuclear option' could change the Senate filibuster In 2016, Trump was elected president and, predictably and in short order, said the Senate should get rid of the filibuster. The GOP had the White House and Congress at the time, so why not use that majority power to deliver a conservative agenda for the American people?  Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell drew the scorn of some of his House GOP colleagues for objecting and telling them such a change will not happen because, someday, they would not be in the majority and then they\u2019d lose whatever voice the filibuster had given them. So, here we are. The GOP is back in the minority in Congress \u2013 and if not for the objections of Democratic moderates like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, the filibuster would be in grave danger. But I, like I suspect these moderate Democratic senators, understand the value of the filibuster in shaping better legislation. During my congressional tenure, I witnessed how the filibuster empowered the Senate to engage in bipartisan negotiations to finalize critical budget agreements, spending bills, debt ceiling increases, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) after the 2008 financial crash, Hurricane Sandy disaster relief and other measures essential to the stable functioning of government. In addition to killing bipartisanship, eliminating the filibuster would increase the likelihood of sweeping, draconian laws being enacted on a purely partisan basis. The filibuster gives the Senate the capacity to check the excesses of the House, since a 60-vote threshold (rather than a simple majority) requires compromise with the other party \u2013 even when one party controls both the legislative and executive branch. Stacey Abrams: It's time to make an exception to the filibuster rule If the filibuster is eliminated \u2013 and when Republicans regain control of the White House and Congress someday \u2013 Democrats should expect attempts by the GOP to strike back. McConnell said as much this week, warning \u201ca completely scorched earth Senate\u201d should the filibuster rules change. He argued, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t just erase every liberal change that hurt the country \u2013 we\u2019d strengthen America with all kinds of conservative policies with zero, zero input from the other side,\u201d highlighting how the GOP would move to defund Planned Parenthood, take away support from sanctuary cities, etc. Some Democrats are now arguing that to retain the filibuster is to support a racist rule because Southern segregationists deployed the tactic many decades ago. But it should be noted that both the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law in spite of the Senate filibusters each bill faced. And, with GOP control of Washington in 2006, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized with a strong bipartisan vote \u2013 a vote that was among my proudest moments in the House of Representatives. In this highly divided Senate, there still may be room for common sense electoral reform that can win over enough moderate Republicans to become law \u2013 even if the current piece of legislation, the For the People Act, misses the mark. In a closed-door House GOP Conference, I periodically gave this speech to my colleagues: If you want the Senate to be a smaller version of the House, then eliminate the filibuster. The way to do it is to announce your Senate candidacy, raise several millions of dollars, get elected and then, once seated, vote to change the Senate rules. But, until then, stop complaining and let\u2019s get back to business here in the House.  To be clear, the Senate filibuster is an overused, imperfect tool and there is certainly room for improvement.  As a former senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I was frequently annoyed with the Senate\u2019s inability to proceed on appropriations bills. These bills provide critical funding for programs that support the armed forces, medical research, small business, infrastructure, border security, agriculture, housing, education and more. And yet, senators would frequently launch filibusters on motions to proceed on these bills \u2013 thus delaying floor debate and final votes. Perhaps, if the Senate were to make a change, it could rewrite the rules so senators would not be able to filibuster until the bill is actually being debated on the floor for final passage? Without a bipartisan consensus on changes to the filibuster, however, Congress will become even more tragically divided than it already is. And an outright repeal of the filibuster will lead to more partisan legislation that can be overturned by the minority party when it once again gains the majority \u2013 adding more fuel to fire the kilns of national hostility, grievance and resentment. So, before pulling the trigger on the filibuster, Democrats should think hard about future ramifications.",

            "article_content": "For more than a century, the details of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s life and presidency have been told, re-told and told again, creating a near mythological figure in American history. But what many may not realize is that the 16th president\u2019s legacy is far more complex than we\u2019re often taught. We asked six historians from CNN\u2019s new Original Series \u201cLincoln: Divided We Stand\u201d to share the myths they\u2019ve seen persist about Abraham Lincoln, and what they wish more Americans understood about this monumental president.

Among the more complicated and persistent historical beliefs is the one that credits Abraham Lincoln as having single-handedly \u201cfreed the slaves.\u201d It is true that in a time of civil war, he issued a proclamation of emancipation that declared enslaved people free in areas under the control of the Confederacy. In so doing, he opened the door that led to the end of slavery throughout America. But that is only half of the story. Often missing in the emancipation narrative is the role others played in freeing enslaved people and ending the institution. In order for freedom to be realized, bondmen and women had to either make their way to the Union lines or be liberated by Northern soldiers and sailors. Among that liberating force were Black men, who made up 10 percent of the Union military. It is important to remember as well that not all enslaved people were touched by the proclamation. Roughly 830,000 remained enslaved, exempted because they resided in the slave-holding loyal border states or in areas already occupied by Union forces. Their freedom and the freedom of those yet to be born rested with the passage and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which forever outlawed the institution. While Lincoln played a crucial role in securing Black freedom, he was not the sole architect. The persistence of the abolitionists in pushing their decades-long agenda of liberation, and the agency of Black people themselves, ensured that America\u2019s commitment to freedom would not remain a hollow promise. Edna Greene Medford is a professor of history at Howard University, author of \u201cLincoln and Emancipation\u201d and co-author of \u201cThe Emancipation Proclamation: Three Views.\u201d A powerful, inaccurate and unfortunate counter-myth percolates in both our curricula and culture that Lincoln was indifferent to slavery. Not true. \u201cI am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think and feel,\u201d he told a newspaper editor in 1864. I take Honest Abe at his word. Nearly three decades earlier, as a young state legislator, he was already on record that slavery was \u201cfounded on both injustice and bad policy.\u201d He never changed his position, even when such views placed him outside the moderate mainstream of his era. He didn\u2019t immediately abolish slavery after winning the 1860 election not because he had no opinion on the institution; it was because, as he wrote in the 1864 letter, he didn\u2019t believe he had the right to \u201cact officially upon\u201d his personal views. His stance was always clear to the White South, who so feared Lincoln\u2019s antislavery views that seven states seceded from the Union before he was inaugurated, organizing a separate nation with slavery protected and perpetual. Within five years, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and pushed for the Thirteenth Amendment, ending slavery forever. Then, in his final speech, he became the first president in history to call for Black voting rights. Indeed, when John Wilkes Booth heard Lincoln suggest enfranchising some African Americans on April 11, 1865, he hissed: \u201cThat means n****r citizenship. That is the last speech he\u2019ll ever make.\u201d Three nights later, Booth killed him. In essence, Lincoln lived to destroy slavery, and died for advancing Black rights. And he still deserves to be so remembered. Harold Holzer, director of the Roosevelt House Policy Institute at Hunter College, is the author of several books on Abraham Lincoln, including \u201cLincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion.\u201d Despite Lincoln\u2019s lifelong political career, there is a tendency to see him as some backwoods naif who transcended the jangle of politics. His self-deprecating manner, his striking oratory and his determined defense of democracy have contributed to a myth that he emerged unbidden to preserve the union and emancipate the slaves. The truth is that Abraham Lincoln was a politician to his core, and an ambitious one. When he ran (unsuccessfully) for office at the age of 23, his first political announcement spoke of his ambition to be \u201ctruly esteemed of my fellow men.\u201d He faced defeats and disappointments, but he persevered to serve several terms in the Illinois House of Representatives and one term in Congress. Lincoln succeeded because he never abandoned politics, even when he thought his career was over. After losing a Senate race to his Democratic rival Stephen Douglas in 1858, he lamented that he would \u201cnow sink out of view, and shall be forgotten.\u201d He was feeling sorry for himself, yet two years later, when asked about his presidential intentions, he admitted, \u201cthe taste is in my mouth a little.\u201d William Herndon, his former law partner, recalled that \u201chis ambition was a little engine that knew no rest\u201d \u2013 a central fact that is often overlooked. His presidency was no accident; he fought for it, and he showed that same grit in office. Seeing Lincoln as an ambitious politician allows us to appreciate all the more what he accomplished, and to hold elected officials to a higher standard. As president, he faced unrelenting opposition, death and destruction on an unprecedented scale, and personal devastation when he lost his son. At times, he fell into despair \u2013 \u201cif there is a worse place than hell I am in it\u201d he once cried \u2013 yet he never stopped growing and he never stopped working, deliberately and patiently, to save the nation. We can only hope for the same from our current collection of politicians. Louis P. Masur is a Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at Rutgers University and the author of many books, including \u201cThe Sum of Our Dreams: A Concise History of America.\u201d When it comes to Lincoln\u2019s stance on slavery, two contradictory myths persist: That he was proslavery, and if he had lived the South could somehow have kept the institution, or that he was radically antislavery. Neither of these perspectives accord with his complicated views, which evolved until he actively pushed Congress to enact the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Five years earlier, when a proslavery amendment was proposed, Lincoln did not announce his disapproval. Instead, the newly elected president said in his first inaugural address that he wouldn\u2019t object to the amendment, which was designed to keep slavery in perpetuity as a way to avoid Southern secession. Lincoln knew that his personal opinion of slavery\u2019s wrongs did not change the fact that proslavery provisions in the Constitution protected the institution. And the proposed amendment, enacted by Congress in March 1861, seemed to meet his objective of saving the Union. It was the Confederate firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861 that ended that possibility, and the arrival of war interrupted the amendment\u2019s path toward ratification. Military necessity, given the Union army\u2019s manpower needs, led Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. In his speeches, however, Lincoln\u2019s evolution slowly began to come to light: In the Gettysburg address of 1863, he talked of \u201ca new birth of freedom.\u201d And in his second inaugural address in 1865, Lincoln spoke explicitly about division over slavery as the cause of the war. His fight that year for the Thirteenth Amendment would make slavery\u2019s eradication permanent, not just a measure ending with a Union victory. His evolution shows how circumstances can change the views of not just ordinary people, but great leaders \u2013 in this case, altering the course of history. Mary Frances Berry is a Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought and professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of 12 books, including \u201cFive Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich: Vote Buying and the Corruption of Democracy\u201d and \u201cAnd Justice For All: The United States Commission On Civil Rights And the Struggle For Freedom in America.\u201d Lincoln is so famous \u2013 some 15,000 books and counting \u2013 that myths grow around him all the time, like fungi in a dark forest. In his lifetime, he was denounced by the South as dangerously abolitionist, while some in his party accused him of not being abolitionist enough \u2013 a criticism that continues today. Neither characterization gets it right. The South\u2019s diatribes were alarmist from the moment Lincoln won the Republican nomination in May 1860, well before he had made any announcement of his policy. In fact, Lincoln was considered to be more centrist than his main rival for the nomination, William Henry Seward. In 1858, Seward had predicted an \u201cirrepressible conflict\u201d over slavery, which was interpreted as an extreme statement \u2013 especially coming from a Senator from upstate New York, where so many simon-pure abolitionists made their home.  Lincoln had said something similar when he predicted that \u201ca house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d But compared to Seward, he was perceived as a moderate \u2013 from a calmer state, with calmer opinions and calmer friends. That helped him to win the nomination. During the convention, voters from Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana were delighted to vote against the New York candidate and steer support toward a fellow Midwesterner who represented the broad middle in every sense. Still, Lincoln was antislavery enough to make an enormous impact on his divided nation. As many histories have explained, it took years to get from the first inaugural address (which promised to protect slavery); to the wartime Emancipation Proclamation (which ended it behind enemy lines); to the Thirteenth Amendment (which ended it throughout the country). Lincoln was growing throughout this time, and as he grew, he brought the country along with him. Many historians have found fault with the proclamation for its carve-outs and exceptions, but the simple fact is that Lincoln deployed the full might of the US government to extinguish the shameful curse of human bondage. And as President Biden said during his inaugural address, Lincoln committed himself completely to the cause, writing, \u201cmy whole soul is in it.\u201d In his own way, and in his own time, he became one of the greatest abolitionists in American history. Ted Widmer is a historian and professor at Macaulay Honors College (CUNY) and the author of \u201cLincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington.\u201d There\u2019s a myth that Lincoln was so magnanimous and empathetic that if he had not been murdered, the United States would have avoided the racial conflict of the Reconstruction era and maybe even decades of state-imposed discrimination and disenfranchisement. Hillary Clinton voiced this view in 2016 when she speculated that if Lincoln had lived, the nation would have been \u201ca little less rancorous, a little more forgiving and tolerant.\u201d Without his leadership, she said, \u201cwe had Reconstruction, we had the re-instigation of segregation and Jim Crow. We had people in the South feeling totally discouraged and defiant.\u201d This common myth, that Lincoln would have stemmed racial conflict and oppression by going easy on White southerners, relies on an outdated vision of Reconstruction history. For decades, American history textbooks taught that after Lincoln\u2019s assassination, radical Republicans like Thaddeus Stevens acted vindictively when they insisted that Black men in the South must be permitted vote, and that White southerners were justified in resisting, even to the point of inflicting violence and terror on Black communities. Historians now see the period much differently. We know that the mainstream Republican vision was one of multiracial democracy; that the Radical Republicans lacked the power to impose their will; and that in many respects what was tragic about Reconstruction was not that it went too far, but that it did not go far enough. In fact, Clinton was roundly criticized for her comments and quickly issued a clarification that she was referring only to Lincoln\u2019s ability to lead toward reconciliation. We can\u2019t know, of course, how Lincoln would have handled the fierce challenges of Reconstruction. But no single leader, however great, could have saved the nation from having to contend with the legacies of two and half centuries of racial slavery. To meet our own moment, we need to acknowledge the scope of Reconstruction\u2019s challenges, as well as the long and continuing history of White Americans\u2019 resistance to racial justice.

On Tuesday, prosecutors revealed that they had lost track of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Illinois resident accused of killing two people at anti-racist protests in Wisconsin last August. Rittenhouse, who has pleaded not guilty to two counts of homicide and a felony count of attempted homicide, was seen recently partying with Proud Boys and flashing White power hand signs while out on bail. His legal team now says he is in a \u201csafe house\u201d after receiving death threats and that they need to keep his location secret. In the meantime, he has become a folk hero in some conservative circles, with his name appearing on T-shirts declaring \u201cRittenhouse did nothing wrong.\u201d Right-wing activists have raised more than $2 million in donations for a legal-defense fund. The glorification of Rittenhouse, who apparently believed himself to be in Kenosha as part of a militia and whose lawyers have said was acting in self-defense, is part of a rising cult of the vigilante, one that has found an eager following in the past five years. Former President Donald Trump helped fuel that rise: he personally suggested Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense, and his Department of Homeland Security reportedly sent around an internal memo directing federal officials how to respond to any questions about Rittenhouse. Trump also welcomed other vigilantes into his circle, giving a prime speaking slot at the Republican convention to Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis couple facing charges (to which they pleaded not guilty) for brandishing guns at protesters who walked down the private street in front of their house. The embrace of these armed suspects might seem to contradict the right\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d message. But vigilante violence has often been part of law enforcement in the United States, a complement to state power rather than a threat to it. Both have been required to uphold America\u2019s racial order, and both will need to be radically re-imagined \u2013 or dismantled \u2013 if the country is to have a fair and equitable justice system. The talk White parents need to have with their kids after Kenosha Though we tend to think that the state has a monopoly on legal violence, that has seldom been the case. White vigilantes have long acted as an extension of state violence against Black people and other people of color, and their allies, often with the tacit approval of police, prosecutors, and juries in a spectrum of legal and illegal acts that together create the political idea of \u201claw and order\u201d that has been the backbone of right-wing politics for more than 50 years. It\u2019s easy to caricature this relationship between law enforcement and vigilantism as a feature of the Jim Crow South, when the Ku Klux Klan worked with local sheriffs to attack Black people and their White Republican allies who seemed to imperil the social and political order of the White South. But Klan violence persisted after Jim Crow, and vigilantes have worked with \u2013 and been part of \u2013 governments throughout the US. My great-grandmother exposed lynchings. This is what she would say about the Capitol riot This was especially true in the years after the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Act, when White vigilantism became a powerful force in American culture and politics. A wave of vigilante films in the 1970s and 1980s depicted White men fed up with the limits of policing, eager to take the law into their own hands. In part in response to rising crime rates and in part in response to growing Black political power \u2013 two forces routinely conflated \u2013 White vigilantism featured in movies like \u201cDirty Harry\u201d (where the vigilante himself was a cop) and \u201cFighting Back\u201d (where vigilantes worked in tandem with the police). Filmmakers were inspired by people like Anthony Imperiale, a city councilor in Newark who formed the North Ward Citizens Committee, a White vigilante group in New Jersey in the late 1960s. \u201cIf the Black Panther comes, the White Hunter will be waiting,\u201d Imperiale famously warned, referring to the Black power group that, notably, was not granted the same freedom to act as vigilantes. (Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, pushed for gun control laws in response to Black Panthers carrying firearms.) In reporting on Imperiale in 1968, The New York Times wrote that police \u201cofficially frowned on\u201d his organization\u2019s street patrols, a description suggesting that unofficially they were more supportive. As were voters in New Jersey: Imperiale would go on to serve as a member of the New Jersey state government for most of the 1970s. Juries, too, sometimes went easy on vigilantes. In 1984, when four Black teenagers approached Bernhard Goetz on the New York City subway and asked for five dollars, Goetz shot them all, then fled. He became known as the Subway Vigilante, lionized as a force of order in a city plagued by crime. During his trial, Goetz confessed that he\u2019d hoped to kill the teens, who he thought were about to rob him, and that the only thing stopping him was that he\u2019d run out of bullets. That the young people he shot had committed no crimes did not faze Goetz nor the jury that sentenced him to just eight months in jail for criminal possession of a weapon. That vigilante spirit infused the rise of everything from neighborhood watches to militias in the decades that followed. Though the militia boom that started in the early 1990s at first centered on groups that were explicitly anti-government and anti-police, over time it has grown to include groups who see themselves as an extension of law enforcement, whether as unofficial border patrol agents seizing suspected migrants or armed groups defending Confederate statues or countering anti-racist protests. Police have often welcomed these groups, as seen in footage from Kenosha, Wisconsin, where shortly before the August shootings, officers thanked the armed men \u2013 including Kyle Rittenhouse \u2013 who appeared at the protests. This was not an uncommon sight at protests this past summer. How I felt seeing guys like me at the Capitol riot A recent report by Michael German at the Brennan Center for Justice outlined not only these incidents, but the ways militias have maintained active ties with law enforcement \u2013 including officers who are part of these groups. The line between police and vigilantes often blurs not only because some officers approve of vigilantism, but because some officers likewise engage in unlawful yet unpunished uses of force against Black people, as decades of police riots and brutality demonstrate. Some lawmakers welcome them as well, helping to enshrine vigilantism in law. The radical gun jurisprudence and legislation of the past few decades has enabled citizens not only to legally arm themselves with military-grade weapons, but to use those weapons against other humans in increasingly unrestricted ways. That\u2019s the case in states like Florida, where the law allowed George Zimmerman to follow and kill 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. That said, as the insurrection at the Capitol last month showed, neither police nor lawmakers are themselves safe from vigilante violence. Considered \u201coath breakers\u201d by the mob for not helping overturn the election, these members of law enforcement and Congress were no longer viewed as instruments of law and order, but violators of it. That mental shift helps to explain why people bearing \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d flags overwhelmed and injured Capitol Police, in violence that left one police officer dead. Of course, not everyone can engage in armed vigilantism and escape unscathed, left to skip bail or ransack the Capitol. As staff writer David A. Graham noted in The Atlantic in 2016, gun radicalism has extended almost exclusively to White Americans. When Black Americans take up arms, it quickly becomes clear that they are what he called \u201cthe Second Amendment\u2019s second-class citizens\u201d: arrested, charged, and even killed for the sort of gun ownership that White Americans consider a sacred right. Thus while Black vigilantism does exist, it is far riskier to engage in and far less likely to receive the sanction of law than its White counterpart.  Rittenhouse has, of course, been charged, and the facts of his case are still being investigated. But there are many on the right who see his prosecution as a disruption of a tacit understanding that White vigilantes have been sanctioned to police, and even injure or kill, anti-racist activists who they see as disruptive. And no wonder they think so: they have more than 100 years of history showing that, most of the time, that\u2019s exactly what \u201claw and order\u201d means.",

A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founded its Center for Public Leadership. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. Donald Trump chose to focus on the wrong fence this week. Instead of calling our attention to the barrier he has been struggling to build on our southern border, he should have been focusing on the fence now surrounding our nation\u2019s Capitol in Washington, DC. The new fence, 7-feet-tall and considered \u201cnon-scalable,\u201d should eventually find a home in the Smithsonian. Pieces of it would be an appropriate remembrance of just how dangerous and frightening the Trump years have been. Massive protests are nothing new in Washington, of course. In the 1970s, when I was working in the White House, protests against the Vietnam War reached a crescendo. I remember walking through a courtyard at the Old Executive Office Building and finding military tanks secretly stationed there, ready to move if trouble got out of hand. This won't be like Trump's last impeachment But those protests were wholly legitimate \u2014 citizens rising up to demand changes in government policy. In this past week, by contrast, we were watching as the leader of the executive branch of government incited mob violence in an attempted takeover of the legislative branch.  Through all of our history, although there have been attacks on our Capitol, we have never seen American citizens try to bring down our central government. Attempted overthrows by civilians have been rare as well among major Western democracies. The closest parallel to the Trump years for many has been the Hitler years in Germany. But even there, mobs weren\u2019t marching on the Reichstag. Instead the similarity to today is really more about clever deployment of disinformation by both men. As World War I ended, Hitler and his followers invented \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d: Germany did not lose the war on the battlefields, they argued; rather, its democratically elected leaders undermined the war effort back home. They convinced the electorate that opponents of the war, especially Jews, had delivered a \u201cstab in the back\u201d to German soldiers.  That was a huge lie, but its proponents rode it to power. Just as Trump has with his cynical narrative about Biden\u2019s election victory. Impeaching Trump isn't enough Trump\u2019s greatest strength is perhaps his ability to convince large swaths of people that what is true is false and what is false is true.  He has become a master of \u201cThe Big Lie\u201d \u2014 namely, that he won the election and Joe Biden lost. A majority of Americans don\u2019t believe him, but opinion polls show that roughly a third are still on his side, even after the bloody assault on Congress.  It will be extremely difficult for Biden to govern as long as large portions of our electorate believe his presidency is illegitimate. It is disturbing but true that Trump has become even more threatening to our democracy in the past few weeks. With the FBI warning that insurrectionists may stage new marches across 50 state capitols and are personally targeting Biden, Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi, one would think that Trump would have the decency and good sense to tell his followers to back off, put down your guns, and stay home. How can he continue to be so blind to his own self-interest?  Does he really want to leave office with more blood on his hands? Actually, the biggest test at the moment is not about Trump. It is whether the Republican Party will assume serious responsibility for keeping the peace in coming days. That third of the electorate still in Trump\u2019s corner won\u2019t listen to Biden or any other Democrat, but they might listen if a big chorus of conservative Republicans as well as business leaders now stand up and speak up \u2014 just as Rep. Liz Cheney has done in the House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is signaling in the Senate.  As a people, we are staring into an abyss; things could well get worse before they get better. It is hugely important to the country now that we de-escalate and search for higher ground. If we can just get through the first hundred days of a Biden presidency with our democracy intact, perhaps we can all catch our breath, welcome in a little sunshine, and send pieces of that fence to the Smithsonian.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Elie Honig is a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, and author of \u201cHatchet Man: How Bill Barr Broke the Prosecutor\u2019s Code and Corrupted the Justice Department.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends. The two-page memo from John Eastman, disclosed in the new book by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, begins with a lie and then descends into madness. Eastman is a lawyer who worked with former president Donald Trump\u2019s legal team to overthrow democracy and try to steal the 2020 election. First, the lie: \u201c7 states have transmitted dual slates of Electors to the President of the Senate.\u201d What seven states? What \u201cdual slates of electors\u201d? How were they purportedly \u201ctransmitted\u201d to the Senate? This is all, of course, nonsense. In fact, every single state certified one, and only one, slate of presidential electors based on the 2020 election results. The Eastman memo proceeds from this foundational lie to build a wild legal fantasy on top of it; in that respect, the memo is a perfect encapsulation of Trump\u2019s overarching strategy to steal the 2020 election. Eastman casually adopts as true a bold legal fiction that \u201c[t]here is very solid legal authority, and historical precedent, for the view that the President of the Senate does the counting, including the resolution of disputed electoral votes \u2026 and all the Members of Congress can do is watch.\u201d That\u2019s simply wrong as a matter of law and history. Thankfully, the President of the Senate, who was then-Vice President Mike Pence, recognized this, and refused to unilaterally override the votes cast by the disputed states. Eastman proceeds to lay out a strategy that is purposefully deceptive. He suggests Pence should announce the results in the states alphabetically, but should \u201cdefer decision\u201d on Arizona and the other six states that Trump is trying to steal until the very end of the count. At that point, Eastman suggests, Pence should reject the vote counts from those seven states. Then, according to Eastman, comes the dramatic climax: \u201cPence then gavels Trump as re-elected.\u201d This suggestion is as wrong-headed as it is audacious. No person \u2013 not the vice president or anybody else \u2013 has the power to \u201cgavel\u201d anybody as the president of the United States. That\u2019s the stuff of dictatorship. Then again, that seems to be precisely what Eastman aims for in his memo. Eastman dismissively predicts \u201c[h]owls, of course, from Democrats\u2026\u201d He\u2019s only partially correct here; no doubt, there would have been \u201chowls\u201d but likely from many conscientious Republicans and Democrats alike. Republican members of Congress, including Senators Mike Lee and Lindsey Graham \u2013 both reliable Trump loyalists \u2013 rightly ridiculed and rejected Eastman\u2019s proposed plan and other variations of it, according to Woodward and Costa, authors of \u201cPeril.\u201d  Eastman closes the memo by noting that his plan should be enacted by Vice President Pence but, \u201cPence should do this without asking for permission \u2013 either from a vote of a joint session or from the Court.\u201d That\u2019s a sure sign Eastman knows his scheme is outrageous and illegal. He proposes simply to ram it through and make the other side fight, after the fact, to undo the damage. Eastman now claims that his memo merely \u201cexplored all options that had been proposed.\u201d But that\u2019s revisionism. In the memo, Eastman doesn\u2019t merely \u201cexplore\u201d or ruminate on theoretical or academic possibilities. He specifically argues that Pence \u201cshould\u201d carry out the plan, as proposed, and he offers strategic advice on how to spring the scheme as a trap on unsuspecting members of Congress (by holding the seven states until last and by springing the plot first \u201cwithout asking for permission\u201d). Eastman is, somehow, both a lawyer and a senior fellow at a research institute. He\u2019s also a disgrace to the profession. His memo is at once rife with falsehoods, childlike in its reasoning and deadly dangerous in its proposed application. Eastman needs to face consequences. State licensing authorities should review his fitness to practice law. Congress needs to demand answers, issuing a subpoena to compel Eastman to testify if necessary. And the Justice Department must, at a minimum, open a criminal investigation to determine whether Eastman\u2019s proposed actions constituted conspiracy to violate federal election laws. If nobody takes action, then Eastman will fade into memory as just another unhinged conspiracy theorist who proposed dangerous abuses of power to serve Trump\u2019s whims, and then walked away unscathed. Now, your questions: David (North Carolina): Regarding Roe v. Wade, doesn\u2019t established federal law from the Supreme Court supersede any conflicting state law? That\u2019s exactly how things are supposed to work. However, the Supreme Court earlier this month declined to issue an emergency stay (a pause, essentially) on a Texas state law known as \u201cSB-8,\u201d which makes it virtually impossible for a woman to get an abortion in Texas \u2013 squarely contradictory to Roe v. Wade. The five-justice majority noted that, while they expressed no view on the constitutionality of the Texas law, they would not issue a stay because the law posed complex procedural issues that could pose an obstacle to future legal challenges. The Justice Department has now filed a direct legal challenge to the Texas law, arguing that it operates in \u201copen defiance\u201d of Roe v. Wade. While the Texas case winds through the federal courts over the coming months, however, keep an eye on a different restrictive state law, out of Mississippi. The Supreme Court will hear and rule on this case in the upcoming term, with oral argument set for December and a decision likely in the spring or summer of 2022. The Mississippi case has been positioned by advocates as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, and could give the court an opportunity to overrule its own longstanding precedent. Gregory (Indiana): How much jeopardy is DACA in, given that it was created by executive action and not by Congressional legislation? Once again, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, adopted through executive action by then-President Barack Obama in 2012 to provide a temporary reprieve from deportation for \u201cDreamers\u201d who arrived in the United States as children, is in legal jeopardy. Last year, the US Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to rescind DACA, ruling that the administration had not followed proper administrative procedures. However, a federal judge has since ruled that DACA is unconstitutional on the merits because it was enacted by presidential decree, without Congressional authorization. The Biden administration has appealed that ruling to the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court\u2019s ruling likely will settle the issue, unless the Supreme Court decides to take the case and rule on the merits once and for all.",

            "article_content": "To learn more about the changing demographics of the US, watch \u201cUnited Shades of America\u201d Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Dr. Raed Al-Naser was on the front lines at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego when patients first started coming in with symptoms of Covid-19. \u201cThe hospital was packed and the ICU was at full capacity,\u201d the ICU pulmonologist told CNN. \u201cAnd I saw a disproportionate number of Arab Americans in the ICU.\u201d This realization, and a lack of public health data on the Arab American community, motivated Al-Naser to conduct his own research based on the patients he was seeing at Grossmont Hospital and his own private practice. \u201cThere is a large Arab American community nearby in East San Diego, specifically in El Cajon county,\u201d Al-Naser said. \u201cAnd because there is no identifier for the group, they\u2019re all being counted as White Covid-19 patients and no one was noticing how the virus was specifically affecting this population.\u201d Based on the standards set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), there are seven categories for data on race and ethnicity: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic or Latino, and non-Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 Census program memorandum. As a result, Arab Americans are forced to tick \u201cWhite\u201d or \u201cother\u201d on the Census and medical paperwork, which means that public health data collected on the community is largely anecdotal, according to experts like Al-Naser. Arab Americans trace their origins to the Middle East and North Africa, which is traditionally comprised of 22 Arabic-speaking countries. They are not a monolith and can be White, Black and brown. Los Angeles and New York City have the largest populations of Arab American residents in the country based on data from the 2015-2019 ACS Ancestry survey. Both areas have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected minority and immigrant populations. Through his research, Al-Naser found that around 15% of Covid-19 patients classified as White were actually Arab American. Also, about 30 to 35% of Covid-19 patients in the ICU classified as White were Arab American. \u201cThe Arab American community is a historically understudied group because it has no identifiers, so Covid-19 exposed the invisibility of the group rather than created it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s key to identify people at risk or else they\u2019ll go unnoticed and the disparity will deepen.\u201d Dr. Nadia Abuelezam, epidemiologist and assistant professor at Boston College\u2019s Connell School of Nursing, has studied health disparities among the Arab American community throughout her career. \u201cThere are a lot of disparities in the community and they\u2019re not well known because of the whitewashing that\u2019s happening,\u201d Abuelezam said. \u201cThe lack of identifiers limit our ability to use national data sets and receive funding to understand Arab and Middle Eastern American health results.\u201d According to a study Abuelezam published in 2020, \u201cthere are a number of reasons why Arab Americans may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, complications, and death, including exposure to xenophobia and stigma, pre-existing conditions,\u201d like diabetes and hypertension, \u201cmultigenerational homes,\u201d lack of social support for new immigrants, and poor adoption of prevention behavior,\u201d which includes vaccine hesitancy. New York resident Mohamed Madboly, 26, is all too familiar with this as a first-generation Arab American. Last year, Madboly, his diabetic father and his mother, who has hypertension, all became infected with Covid-19. \u201cI feel like America is intentionally neglecting Arab identities,\u201d said Madboly about the lack of data on the community. \u201cWe\u2019re blinded from our own statistics. This makes it very difficult for experts to draw accurate conclusions to help our community not only improve but get better. Especially in a time like now, where we need it more than ever.\u201d Although public health data on the community is limited, prior samplings and independent studies show that Arab Americans\u2019 health outcomes and needs are distinctly different from the outcomes of White non-Hispanics, according to Abuelezam\u2019s study. A hospital-based study in Michigan found that Arab Americans have a higher prevalence of preexisting conditions like diabetes and hypertension than in White communities. Researchers also found in a study on Arab Americans in California that 55.2% of the respondents were overweight or obese, another condition that can mean increased risk and severity of Covid-19 and death. Also, Arab American homes are more likely to be multigenerational than non-Arab homes, which can \u201clead to greater transmission risk within households to older individuals, increasing vulnerability to infection,\u201d according to Abuelezam\u2019s study. There is also a lot of vaccine hesitancy within the community, which is corroborated by national data for flu and pneumonia vaccines, according to a study from the National Library of Medicine published in 2014. Research done by Al-Naser in East San Diego also found that most of his Arab American patients were socioeconomically underprivileged and had less access to insurance than his Black and Hispanic patients. So, not only is asking Arab Americans, like Madboly and his parents, to identify as White inaccurate, but it can also skew Covid-19 data, according to Abuelezam and Al-Naser. Advocacy groups, such as the Arab American Institute (AAI) and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), have been pushing for a Middle East and North Africa (MENA) categorization, which is a geographic designation that includes ethnic and racial options, to be adopted by the OMB for decades. Although the Census Bureau does not include identifiers for the community, it estimated MENA Americans at 3.1 million in the 2015 census. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an undercount,\u201d Maya Berry, executive director of the AAI, told CNN. \u201cThe Census is about providing an accurate count of the community, so that its members can participate fully in our democracy. The limited publicly available data has always been used against the community.\u201d Samer Khalaf, president of the ADC, which estimates Arab Americans at the 4.5 million range, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s an underserved community when it comes to social programs and mental health programs, because we can\u2019t get the proper finances and resources to help the community,\u201d Khalaf said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not different with Covid. How can we tell how hard-hit the community is? How do we advocate for a proper allocation of resources, like the vaccine, in these communities if we can\u2019t show what our concentrations are?\u201d Advocacy groups expected the adoption of a MENA category in 2015 and 2017, according to Khalaf, but the OMB abandoned the motion upon the emergence of the Trump administration. CNN has reached out to the OMB for comment. The Biden-Harris administration drafted a \u201cplan for partnership\u201d with the Arab American community prior to its election pledging to \u201csupport the creation of a new Middle East North Africa (MENA) category, which was recommended by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017, so that Arab Americans can be more fairly counted and their needs studied and considered alongside other minorities.\u201d \u201cThe Trump Administration politicized the 2020 Census, putting marginalized communities at risk of a drastic undercount, and abandoned the addition of a MENA category on the Census,\u201d reads the Biden-Harris partnership plan. Khalaf is cautiously optimistic that the Biden-Harris administration could be open to adopting a correct categorization for the community. But he emphasized that this should have never been a partisan issue. \u201cWith the Biden administration, at least now we have a cabinet that will listen, said Khalaf. \u201cWhether or not they act upon it is a different story.\u201d Nadeem Muaddi and Priya Krishnakumar contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Tishaura Jones on Tuesday was elected mayor of St. Louis and will become the city\u2019s first Black woman to hold that office after running on a progressive platform and a promise to reform and revitalize the city. Jones, the city\u2019s treasurer, beat Alderwoman Cara Spencer by 2,280 votes, according to the final unofficial election results posted online by the city\u2019s election board. Jones will be sworn into office on April 20. In her victory speech Tuesday, Jones reflected on her historic win. \u201cThis campaign can unequivocally say that we\u2019ve begun breaking down the historic racial barriers and the racial divides that exist, and have existed for generations in our city,\u201d she said. Spencer conceded to Jones Tuesday night, according to CNN affiliate station KSDK. On Twitter, she congratulated Jones on her win, saying, \u201cYou have my support in making St. Louis the great city we know it can be.\u201d This year\u2019s mayoral race was a shift to St. Louis\u2019 new nonpartisan voting system approved in November by voters. Under the new system, residents can vote for as many candidates as they want in municipal primaries and the top two vote-getters move onto the general election. Jones comes into office amid the Covid-19 pandemic, two disturbances within two months at the city jail, and a significant increase in homicides in 2020, and a population decline. \u201cAs a city, we\u2019ve been surviving. We\u2019ve suffered disinvestments, decades of violence, broken promises from our city\u2019s leaders, who have bowed to the will of special interests and insider dealings,\u201d Jones said Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s time for St. Louis to thrive.\u201d Jones also said she \u201cwill not stay silent\u201d when she spots racism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, religious intolerance, and \u201cany injustice.\u201d She said that St. Louis isn\u2019t \u201cdone avoiding tough conversations. We are done ignoring the racism that has held our city and our region back.\u201d Jones told CNN\u2019s Erica Hill on Thursday that the city needs to work to reverse the trend of a \u201chuge brain drain\u201d and \u201cshould be sounding the alarm\u201d and asking why Black residents are choosing to leave St. Louis. \u201cWe need to provide opportunities, everyone to succeed, no matter their zip code, the color of their skin, who they love or how they worship,\u201d she said on \u201cNew Day.\u201d With St. Louis expected to receive more than $500 million as part of President Joe Biden\u2019s economic stimulus package, Jones has pledged to disburse the federal funds \u201cwith an eye towards equity.\u201d Her proposed priorities for the funds include rental and mortgage assistance, expanding small business grants, setting up new emergency shelters, and mass vaccination clinics. Her approach to city policing will be to invest more in treatments for substance abuse and mental health disorders and routing certain 911 calls to social workers and other licensed professionals. She also vowed to invest to be an advocate for ending cash bail and to close the Workhouse, the city\u2019s medium security institution. Jones told CNN that \u201cthere is a level of mistrust within our first responders, our public safety department, and we have to have the hard and difficult conversations to heal those divides.\u201d Jones ran for mayor in 2017, narrowly losing in the crowded Democratic primary to current St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. Krewson, the city\u2019s first female mayor, announced last year she would not run for reelection and would retire at the end of her term. Jones was also the first Black woman to serve as St Louis\u2019 treasurer, a role she\u2019s held for eight years and was recently reelected to last November. Before that, she served two terms in the Missouri House of Representatives, during which she was the first Black woman selected to hold the position of Assistant Minority Floor Leader. Jones\u2019 career in public service began in 2002 when she was appointed Democratic committeewoman of St. Louis\u2019 Ward 8.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Friday condemned rising hate crimes against Asian Americans in the wake of the mass shooting in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Biden said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been \u201cskyrocketing\u201d since the coronavirus pandemic began more than a year ago and that the country cannot be silent in the face of the hate and violence. \u201cOur silence is\u00a0complicity.\u00a0We cannot be complicit.\u00a0We have to speak out. We have to\u00a0act,\u201d Biden said, speaking from Emory University in Atlanta. He said Asian Americans have been \u201cattacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed. They\u2019ve been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.\u201d Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta on Friday to meet with Asian American leaders in the wake of the deadly shooting. They had originally planned to travel to Atlanta to tout the benefits of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package that Biden recently signed into law, but the White House scrapped plans for a rally after the shooting. \u201cThe conversation we had today\u00a0with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that\u00a0we\u2019re hearing all across the\u00a0country, is that hate and\u00a0violence often hide in plain\u00a0sight. It\u2019s often met with silence,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s been true throughout our\u00a0history, but that has to change\u00a0because our silence is\u00a0complicity.\u201d Biden urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which he has said would expedite the federal government\u2019s response to hate crimes that have risen during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting and make information on hate crimes more accessible to Asian American communities. Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings earlier this week a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the motivation of the shooter, the killings come amid rising hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States. \u201cRacism is real in America and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America and always has been \u2013 sexism too,\u201d said Harris, who is America\u2019s first Black and South Asian vice president. The vice president said: \u201cFor the last year, we\u2019ve had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian Americans \u2013 people with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate. Ultimately this is about who we are as a nation. This is about how we treat people with dignity and respect.\u201d During a meeting with leaders of the Asian American Pacific Islander \u2013 sometimes shortened to AAPI \u2013 community, Biden echoed Harris in condemning the rhetoric from powerful political leaders, according to one attendee. Stephanie Cho, the executive director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said former President Donald Trump\u2019s name came up repeatedly during Biden\u2019s hourlong meeting with the group. Biden acknowledged Trump\u2019s contributions to a rise in hate against Asian Americans, Cho told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny. As for what Cho hopes to see from the administration, she said: \u201cI\u2019d like to see it be beyond this moment. And that as much as the former President called it the \u2018China virus\u2019 and scapegoated Asian Americans and really fueled this racism around Asian Americans, I would like to see the Biden administration come out just as strongly but in support of Asian Americans.\u201d Biden said he would work as \u201cmuch as possible\u201d to roll back that rhetoric. \u201cHe definitely said that they were definitely harmful,\u201d Cho said of when the topic of Trump\u2019s statements came up in the meeting. \u201cAnd it\u2019s his position and his administration to completely roll back all of that,\u201d Cho added. Cho described the meeting as \u201cvery somber\u201d but said that Biden was \u201ctrying to understand\u201d the issue and to hear directly from AAPI leaders. Biden would not describe the shootings as a hate crime yet, and Cho said she understood why he has to take that position, although she feels differently. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois sent two letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray this week asking for a review of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as she lobbies the Biden administration to prioritize the issue. She asked for them to review why some hate crimes against the AAPI community are not reported as such. Duckworth also called Harris this week, a source familiar with the call told CNN. The source declined to provide details of the pair\u2019s conversation, but added broadly, \u201cThe administration is keeping an open line out to everyone. We want to keep talking and figure out ways to engage with the AAPI community.\u201d The call was first reported by Politico. Prior to meeting with the AAPI leaders, Biden and Harris visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is headquartered in Atlanta, and received an update on the pandemic from health and medical experts. \u201cThis is a war and you are the front-line troops,\u201d Biden told the CDC staff. \u201cI came here to say thank you.\u201d The visit came as the Biden administration reached its goal of 100 million shots in arms. Biden will meet with Stacey Abrams in Atlanta Georgia has emerged as a key political state for Democrats. Biden narrowly won there in the presidential race and Democrats subsequently won two Senate seats there earlier this year, which gave the party control of the chamber \u2013 enabling passage of Biden\u2019s sweeping Covid-19 law. Biden and Harris met with those Democrats, Georgia Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, during their trip, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, as well as Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate\u00a0and voting rights champion Stacey Abrams. Biden touted passage of his administration\u2019s Covid relief package in his remarks, boasting that Americans who\u2019ve already seen direct payments from the package \u201ccan thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff \u2013 but for their votes, that would not have happened.\u201d \u201cIf anyone ever wondered if voting can change your country, Georgia just proved it can. Because when you elected two new United States senators, it made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan \u2013 landmark legislation to not only meet the emergency we\u2019re in but transform this nation,\u201d he said. Both Warnock and Ossoff narrowly won their seats from incumbent Republicans in runoff elections, flipping the balance of control in the Senate and paving the way for passage of the administration\u2019s American Rescue Plan, which cleared the Senate without any Republican support. In a statement following the meeting, Warnock and Ossoff pointed to the American Rescue Plan as a bright point in a tough week. They said the meeting consisted of discussions about how the legislation will affect Georgians \u2013 from free vaccines to direct payments to Peach State residents who qualify \u2013 and looked toward investing in infrastructure as a next step. \u201cAs Georgia unites in grief after this week\u2019s massacre, the President and Vice President made clear today that they are here for Georgia, and that together we will defeat Covid-19, rebuild our economy, and re-unite our country,\u201d Ossoff said. Warnock added, \u201cI look forward to welcoming (Biden and Harris) back to Georgia, and working with them to make sure the robust relief we passed\u2014from expanded tax refunds for working families, to debt relief for farmers of color, to strong federal incentives to expand Medicaid in our state and more\u2014is reaching Georgians where they are to help us continue moving beyond the health and economic devastation of this once-in-a-century pandemic.\u201d Abrams has devoted years to expanding the electorate and boosting turnout in Georgia, a typically reliable red state. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Georgia is ground zero for one of the country\u2019s biggest fights over voting rights. Georgia Republicans are trying to pass new laws to make voting more difficult \u2013 an expansive new voting bill unveiled on Wednesday would give the state broad powers over local election officials, set limits on weekend early voting and add voter ID requirements for absentee ballots.

            "article_content": "The Rev. Raphael Warnock said Sunday his election victory was a \u201cglimpse of God\u2019s vision\u201d as he delivered his first sermon at Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church since he and fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff won Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff elections. \u201cWhoever would have thought that in the state of Georgia we would see the people of Georgia rise up and send an African American man who grew up in public housing, the pastor of this Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King preached, and a Jewish young man, the son of an immigrant, to the US Senate?\u201d Warnock said. The church\u2019s services were delivered without an in-person audience and posted online because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Warnock, the senior pastor at the church where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, was projected early Wednesday to win Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff election against incumbent Kelly Loeffler, who conceded the race. The election results are expected to be officially certified later this month. His win, combined with Ossoff\u2019s projected victory, means the US Senate will be split 50-50 between the two parties, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019 tiebreaking vote giving Democrats control of the chamber. \u201cYou must know that this is a glimpse of God\u2019s vision of a more inclusive humanity that embraces all of God\u2019s children. I\u2019m just grateful to be a part of this. I\u2019m just grateful because I just want to serve, I just want to be a vessel, I just want to be an instrument, I just want to be a prism of God\u2019s glory so that God\u2019s glory can shine through me,\u201d Warnock said. Warnock grew up in Savannah, Georgia, in public housing, the 11th out of 12 children. He\u2019s the first college graduate in his family, having attended Morehouse College, a historically Black college in Atlanta. Warnock centered his sermon on the story of John the Baptist, the \u201ctruth-telling troublemaker\u201d who was beheaded for speaking out against the powerful ruler Herod. \u201cHe created a lot of trouble for himself in the process. Telling the truth will get you in trouble, yet there can be no transformation without truth,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cWe cannot and we will not change until we confront or are confronted by the sickness of our own situation. That applies to individuals, that applies to institutions, that applies to nations.\u201d Warnock also quoted from the Book of Matthew, which says: \u201cFrom the days of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence.\u201d How Warnock and Ossoff's victories evoked the history of the Black freedom struggle He said the tensions in that verse \u2013 that something as holy as heaven still suffers violence \u2013 were similarly seen on Wednesday when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol hours after Warnock\u2019s election win. \u201cWe witnessed that tension in such a powerful and such a tragic way,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we were trying to put on our celebration shoes, the ugly side of our story, our great and grand American story, began to emerge. We saw the crude and the angry and the disrespectful and the violent break their way into the people\u2019s house.\u201d When the old order slips away, people sometimes respond violently and desperately, he said. \u201cSo there is victory in this moment, there is violence in this moment, there is fantastic opportunity and fierce opposition, and it reminds us that there is still a whole lot of work to do,\u201d he said. He called on listeners to combat the violence of prejudice and fear, the violence of poverty, and the violence of our politics. \u201cThe violence in this world is real, don\u2019t be dishonest about that, yet violence does not have the last word,\u201d he said. \u201cGod is still up to something in this world. So don\u2019t give in to cynicism, don\u2019t give in to fear. Don\u2019t give in to hatred, don\u2019t give in to bigotry, don\u2019t give in to see the xenophobia because violence will never have the last word.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi and Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Patrick Duddy is director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and senior adviser on global affairs at Duke University. He retired from the State Department after serving as the US Ambassador to Venezuela and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere. Michael Schoenfeld is vice president for public affairs and government relations, chief communications officer and visiting professor of the practice of media and public policy at Duke University. He previously served as a broadcaster, public liaison officer and executive assistant to the director at the Voice of America. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion on CNN. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts in office was to request the resignation of Michael Pack as head of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which manages all US government broadcasting, including such venerable services as the Voice of America, Radio Marti, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. These networks have a nearly 80-year record of providing credible news and information, and by extension inspiration, to hundreds of millions of listeners and viewers around the world and have been among the most visible and pervasive exemplars of democratic values. Yet within weeks of Pack\u2019s arrival at the USAGM last year, heads of the separate broadcast services were ousted from their positions, with no explanation provided for their removals. Their departures were followed by appointments of questionably qualified replacements and dismissals of governing boards which were charged with protecting the hard-earned editorial integrity of the various networks. (USAGM officials have consistently declined to comment on these staffing changes.) Biden\u2019s early action in addressing the turmoil at USAGM indicated his concern for the dilapidated state of US public diplomacy. Let\u2019s hope he invests similar energy in breathing new life into those media entities, whose journalism has been essential for decades and which have been bruised and besieged by partisan warfare for far too long. Of course, rebuilding confidence in US international broadcasting will take more than Pack\u2019s removal. Similarly, while world leaders will likely note with satisfaction Biden\u2019s public rescinding of some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s more controversial policies on his first day in office, rebuilding international trust in the United States will also take a great deal more than a single day of symbolic gestures. It will require a vigorous and creative campaign of soft power, and the strengthening of the people and programs that sustain it. To do this, the Biden administration needs to boost the US\u2019s public diplomacy apparatus, from the broadcasting networks of the USAGM to the diplomats who facilitate educational and cultural exchanges in the State Department and American embassies abroad with shrinking staffs and diminished resources. Though they are struggling now, these broadcasters and diplomats have a long history of success in advancing American values, foreign policy and democracy. Why reporters at Voice of America are worried it may turn into 'Voice of Trump' According to Gallup in December 2020, the United States\u2019 standing in the world has been seriously eroded. Of 29 countries surveyed, the median approval for the US was only 18% in 2020. The images of mob violence in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, did not help matters. The world was aghast, and the reaction of the foreign press has been brutal. Allies and foes alike expressed their shock, revealing a deep skepticism about the stability of America\u2019s global leadership. And this is only the first of what will be a long line of public diplomacy challenges facing the Biden administration. Global approval of the United States has been slipping for years. This didn\u2019t happen all at once, and it certainly didn\u2019t begin with the Trump administration. The decision to invade Iraq in 2003, and the ineptitude and recklessness revealed by the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, further divided a world already exhausted by years of American lectures on armed conflicts and fiscal prudence. During the George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump administrations, repeated drone attacks on terrorists in countries with which the US is not at war was evidence of an alarming American unwillingness to be constrained by international norms. And demonstrations of persistent and deadly racial injustice, along with the alarmingly botched response to Covid-19, have undermined confidence in US competence to manage its own affairs. Trump vs the federally-funded Voice of America newsroom Given that many of these issues preceded the Trump presidency, his exit from the White House alone will not restore America\u2019s reputation. Indeed, in many world capitals, Trump\u2019s election was seen as a manifestation of the isolationist strain often present in America\u2019s political life Ironically, notwithstanding his great personal wealth, he was also viewed as a beneficiary of the abiding sense of class and racial grievance which have become more pronounced as the country reckons with its history of inequality. At the same time he was also seen as a quintessential American populist. Trump\u2019s political instincts were not unlike other populist leaders who were propelled into power by their citizens\u2019 frustration with globalization and anger at those they saw as cosmopolitan elites.\u201d While social media has been a pernicious force multiplier of the challenges we now face, Facebook and Twitter alone did not create this situation. They had help from the accelerated decline in US public diplomacy that began in 1998 with the Clinton administration\u2019s dismantling of the United States Information Agency (USIA), which managed overseas press operations for our embassies as well as cultural programs and US government-supported educational exchanges. The justification for dismantling USIA started with a zeal to cash in a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d at the end of the Cold War, in which spending on functions like public diplomacy could be cut or redirected to domestic priorities, but its impact has been far-reaching. By dismantling USIA, burying some public diplomacy functions like educational exchanges and embassy public affairs offices in the State Department and creating an unwieldy new agency, first known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors and now as USAGM, to manage international broadcasting, the country fractured political support for public diplomacy at home. It also seemed to signal to the rest of the world that the US was no longer interested in the sustained dialogue with other nations\u2019 publics, which the USIA had helped to foster. What Biden's new security and diplomatic team can do for America The Biden administration can reverse this immediately, starting with the appointment of strong, credible leadership at the State Department, where the top public diplomacy position has been vacant since early 2018, and the USAGM, which has been in a state of near-constant upheaval since it was created in 1999 to consolidate the management of what had been a patchwork of US global broadcasting agencies. America\u2019s influence following World War II derived only in part from respect for the country\u2019s military victory over the Axis powers. Arguably, the unprecedented US efforts to underwrite world recovery, including rebuilding the economies of our defeated enemies, were even more important. American soft power became critically important in the long campaign to contain the Soviet Union. Indeed, in many respects, much of the Cold War was waged most effectively with soft power. The United States brought to the fight a potent combination of a values-based aspirational foreign policy, a rich and diverse culture, and a record of economic progress and political stability at home. Of course, the US has worked with unsavory partners \u2013 and wound up in unpopular regional conflicts like Vietnam \u2013 as it worked to contain the Soviet Union\u2019s global ambitions. Agonizing interludes like the red-baiting Joe McCarthy era and the assassinations of political leaders, as well as the racial tension and anti-war demonstrations that characterized the late 1960s and early 1970s, understandably sowed doubt about America\u2019s version of its own narrative. Through the turmoil, though, the US consistently reached out to foreign publics and emerging leaders, believing that an understanding of American society with all of its flaws would ultimately help the country play a positive role in the world. The Jazz Ambassadors programs, for instance, brought America\u2019s home-grown musical genre to the world.  We do far less of that now. And to much of the world, it seems the old demons of isolationism, xenophobia and racism have resurfaced with renewed intensity. As a consequence, the country\u2019s ability to influence events abroad without resorting to coercive diplomacy, sanctions or force has shrunk dramatically. This deeply worries many of America\u2019s allies and should worry Americans of all political persuasions. As Biden begins his term, our economy is still the largest in the world. Our military is the most capable. Our science and technology is ascendant. And our universities are among the best in the world. Yet, the US faces serious challenges from an emboldened Russia, from a surging China, as well as from hostile regional powers like Iran and North Korea. We need to work with global partners that share our values and our ambitions for peace and prosperity. This is the work of public diplomacy, and it is a foreign policy portfolio we have undervalued for years.  We can no longer afford to do so.",

Keri Leigh Merritt is a historian, writer, and filmmaker from Atlanta. They are at work on a new Civil War documentary. The views expressed here are the authors\u2019 own. Read more opinion on CNN. The American Capitol has long known violence in its halls. In 1814, the British stormed and burned it. In 1856, southern slaveholding Rep. Preston Brooks nearly beat abolitionist Charles Sumner to death on the Senate floor. During the Cold War, armed Puerto Rican nationalists barraged into the Chamber, shooting five Congressmen while unfurling the Puerto Rican flag. Over the last four years, many have warned the public about the flagrant threat to democracy that President Donald Trump poses. Wednesday\u2019s failed coup proved that \u201cMAGA,\u201d or Trumpism, is not over simply because Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. Trumpism is far from dead. Instead, it is now their New Lost Cause. The Lost Cause, also known as the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, is America\u2019s most successful disinformation campaign. It was an ahistorical theory advocating the erroneous belief that all White southerners valiantly fought for the Confederacy to save true \u201cAmerican\u201d (read: White supremacist) values. It centers on the delusion that slavery, known as \u201cthe peculiar institution,\u201d was often benign and even welcomed by the enslaved. This postwar mythology exploded nationally in the late 19th and early 20th century through popular culture vehicles like the films \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d and \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d and White supremacist laced textbooks that argued the American Civil War hinged on the protection of states rights from an aggressive North or federal government \u2013 not the expansion of slavery \u2013 and the promise that the South would rise again. During Tuesday\u2019s Georgia runoff election, the South did rise to meet our historical moment and elected two Democrats, further spurring Trump\u2019s New Lost Cause, a dangerous delusion of election fraud spread rampantly by social media algorithms proven to spread disinformation faster than fact, Russian bot farms and far-right media. But the main perpetrator and beneficiary of the myth is Trump himself, who claimed even before the election took place that it would be stolen through rigged election practices, hacked voter machines and by fraudulent ballots. Much like the perpetrators of the Confederate Lost Cause, the proponents of the New Lost Cause claim to be patriotic defenders of the \u201creal America\u201d or authentic (White) America. What the Warnock-Ossoff win tells us about a transforming South Much of Wednesday\u2019s melee was more reminiscent of both the triumphs and the tribulations of the historical era that created the Lost Cause: Reconstruction. Its distorted representations in popular culture, with its brilliantly hopeful beginnings, its progressive ideals, and its attempts at racial justice unbearably gave way to an unrelenting violent, deadly white backlash that had no repercussions or consequences for home-grown terrorists. Wednesday, for the first time in American history, White supremacists treasonously raised a Confederate flag inside the United States Capitol, disrupting America\u2019s peaceful transfer of power and invoking tangled memories of our nation\u2019s Civil War. Live on CNN, Washington, DC\u2019s former Chief of Police said the national guard needed to \u201ctake back the Capitol,\u201d a structure built by enslaved Black laborers, making it clear that the bedrock of our nation\u2019s legislative body was under siege. As historian Heather Cox Richardson argued Thursday, \u201cYesterday the Executive Branch of our government tried to destroy the Legislative Branch.\u201d Perhaps realizing this, Sen. Lindsay Graham, one of Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders, finally spoke out against the violent attempts to avenge Trump. Invoking the 1876 election that essentially ended Reconstruction, Graham quipped that for people \u201clooking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick.\u201d As a White Senator from the state that launched the Civil War, his aside about Reconstruction served to historically distance himself from the bloody violence and racist terror of his Confederate and segregationist forefathers. Keilar on GOP: When you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle Sen. Ted Cruz, advocating for a \u201cthird option,\u201d also hearkened to the 1876 compromise to call for an electoral commission \u201cto examine claims of voter fraud,\u201d urging Congress to create a committee of House Members, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices to \u201cconduct a 10-day emergency audit.\u201d Like Graham and Cruz, Sen. Dick Durbin also compared the Trumpist objections to the 2020 election results to the 1876 election. Durbin stressed the cataclysmic ramifications of ending Reconstruction too early: \u201cIt was a commission that killed Reconstruction, that established Jim Crow \u2026 (that) re-enslaved African Americans,\u201d Durbin said. Relating the 1876 compromise to modern-day voter suppression, he blamed Trump for inciting the attempted coup. Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, connected the day\u2019s events to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, tweeted that politicians who supported the coup \u201chave put their name on a list with Orval Faubus, George Wallace and Bull Connor.\u201d Faubus, Wallace and Connor all used the Confederate flag as a rallying cry to White supremacists to join in Lost Cause ideology and maintain Jim Crow segregation. As rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol, scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading \u201cCamp Auschwitz.\u201d The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away. Many historians have feared, and some have warned of the possibility of this day for months, some for years. Trump even campaigned in the style of the Jim Crow South\u2019s White supremacist demagogues, running on hatred and grievance, and cashing in on racism and xenophobia. Now, in the same moment as the historic election of Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who will respectively be the first Black and Jewish senators to represent Georgia, White supremacists armed with equipment ideal for taking hostages staged the nation\u2019s first real coup attempt while seeking to burn the Electoral College ballots. Just like their Confederate forebears, they angrily rejected legitimate election results, vowing vengeance and inciting racist violence. This is what it looks like when toxic White privilege is left unchecked To be sure, the chaos and uncertainty from the attempted coup and their defiling antics were jarring but not without precedent - the entire scene could have been lifted out of the 1915 White supremacist film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation.\u201d As the first major motion picture screened in the White House, the blackface epic rife with disinformation and Lost Cause sentiment had been based on the bestselling novel \u201cThe Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d Former President Woodrow Wilson, a historian and architect of federal segregation, was rumored to have deemed \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u201clike writing history with lightning.\u201d In one of the most pivotal scenes in the saga, set in 1871, former slaveholding Confederates watched in horror from the Capitol\u2019s gallery \u2013 the exact place where Reps. Jason Crow and Susan Wild were pinned to the floor beneath chairs yesterday \u2013 and gawked at America\u2019s newly-elected Black congressmen and the first (fictional) Black speaker of the House. Like the domestic terrorists who vandalized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, defiantly putting their feet on her desk with the American flag prostrate, the Black congressmen in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d (White actors in blackface) were admonished to keep their shoes on, with their feet off desks. The blackface congressmen snuck liquor into the Capitol. They devoured fried chicken while wildly gesturing as they argued in favor of interracial marriage. They openly brandished guns and knives, gambled, and leered lasciviously at cowering white women in the gallery. As a silent movie, a title card on screen explained it all: \u201cThe helpless white minority.\u201d \u201cThe helpless white minority.\u201d That simple lie lays bare so much of America\u2019s misery and suffering. The far-right and White supremacists\u2019 purported fear of losing status, wealth and most importantly, political power, in the face of mass Black voter turnout has always been part of what animated racial violence in this country, from riots to lynchings to police brutality. It\u2019s no coincidence that the infamous \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d scene that perverts and degrades Black leadership supposedly occurs in 1871, one of the most tumultuous years in Reconstruction. Hiram Revels, America\u2019s first Black Senator and a preacher like Warnock, was in office, serving only a year. Union Army Generals founded the National Rifle Association, and Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act outlawing terrorist conspiracies by white supremacists. The act gave the President the power to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus in regions prone to homegrown terrorism.  Despite this act, and the formation of Black militias and voting blocs throughout the South, White supremacist violence accelerated unabated throughout the region for another 90 years with a legacy that still haunts us today. Slavery, Jim Crow and Reconstruction\u2019s failures to prosecute treasonous Americans materialized yesterday - in the plume of gun smoke inside the Capitol. The task of peaceful unification is monumental, but it is imperative America upholds the Constitution and prosecutes those who commit treason to the full extent of the law \u2013 for the stability of the nation and for the continuation of democracy. As the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens aptly concluded just months after the bloody Civil War, \u201cIf we fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve and receive the execration of history and of all future ages.\u201d",
