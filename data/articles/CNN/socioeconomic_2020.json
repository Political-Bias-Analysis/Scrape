The coronavirus may be here to stay, says Dr. Anthony Fauci. The leading US infectious disease doctor said it\u2019s possible the virus never truly goes away, and the world will just get better at managing it with vaccines. Public health methods, like mask wearing, will also help, and more places around the world are mandating them to contain surges. Face masks are now required in all public spaces in Greece, Portugal\u2019s Madeira Islands and Hong Kong. Mississippi just instituted a mask policy as well, making them mandatory in schools and public gatherings. The state now has the fifth-highest number of coronavirus cases per capita in the US, which overall is hurtling toward 5 million cases. Meanwhile, a new study confirmed Covid-19 rates are much higher among minority children and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, highlighting inequities in treatment and prevention. Lebanese officials have pointed to a possible cause of the massive explosion that tore through Beirut. Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the devastating blast was caused by 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate. The dangerous compound could be traced back to a massive shipment of agricultural fertilizer that had been stored in the port of Beirut without safety precautions for years, despite warnings from local officials. At least 135 people are dead, many more are missing, and more than 5,000 are injured. Beirut\u2019s governor says about 300,000 people couldn\u2019t return to their homes after the blast, and at least half the city\u2019s population now have homes that are \u201cunlivable for the foreseeable future.\u201d New York prosecutors have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank, President Trump\u2019s primary lender, as part of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s criminal investigation into the President\u2019s business practices, The New York Times reported. The probe initially was thought to be limited to hush-money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who alleged affairs with Trump, but prosecutors recently made clear it goes far beyond that. Meanwhile, the White House got dinged on social media again. Facebook removed a post from the President\u2019s page that claimed children were \u201calmost immune\u201d to Covid-19. And Twitter said it temporarily restricted the Trump campaign account after it shared a tweet with the same false claim. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows says President Trump is poised to take action if Congress can\u2019t get a stimulus package together \u2013 or at least somewhat together \u2013 by the end of the week. That could include executive actions to extend eviction protection and unemployment enhancements, though it\u2019s unclear exactly what those would be or what authority the President would have over those provisions. Either way, it\u2019s another sign that patience is running out for a new deal. Meadows blamed Democrats for the stalemate, and some Republican senators are worried that delays in another deal could affect their chances of maintaining a Senate majority this fall. Women flooded the streets of Turkish cities in protest of the country\u2019s potential withdrawal from a European treaty on gender-based violence. The Council of Europe\u2019s agreement, commonly known as the Istanbul Convention, was created in 2011 to address systemic violence against women and to define a state\u2019s role in preventing femicide and domestic abuse. The heated public discussions about the deal come amid an increase in Turkey\u2019s domestic violence cases. You may recall, Poland recently announced it is considering leaving the treaty, sparking similar outrage. The deal is also being debated in Croatia and Serbia.

He was a fellow at the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago and the Hechinger Institute at Columbia University. He is the sports and culture columnist for the Los Angeles Times and co-host of ESPN LA 710\u2019s \u201cMornings With Keyshawn, LZ and Travis.\u201d Follow him on Twitter and Instagram @lzgranderson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. In 2012, Jackie Lacey made history. Not only did she become the first woman to serve as Los Angeles district attorney, she was also the first black person in the job. Lacey was born and raised in Crenshaw, and her victory appeared to represent a significant change for an office routinely criticized by community leaders for its slothful response to police brutality and corruption. Since then there have been more than 500 officers involved in fatal shootings, and according to the Los Angeles Times, Lacey\u2019s office has only brought charges against less than 1% of them. Fair or not, perhaps this reality helps explain why protesters in Southern California felt the need to shut down a major highway and flood the streets of downtown Los Angeles Friday night in solidarity with Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, the former police officer seen on video kneeling on 46-year-old George Floyd\u2019s neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. (He has not yet been arraigned or entered a plea; his bail has been set at $500,000.) The three other officers connected to Floyd\u2019s death have been fired, and one hopes they will face charges as well. Eventually the uprisings in Minneapolis will subside, as well as the protests and community unrest peppered throughout the country, including in Lacey\u2019s backyard. The camera crews documenting all of this will disperse as well. It's been five decades since 1968, and things are somehow worse And we will be left with one pressing question: Now what? It\u2019s intellectually dishonest to say we will return to \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d because this country has never been at peace. We\u2019ve had moments of quiet, albeit uneasy quiet, but never peace. How can a nation born out of genocide, built on slavery, and sustained by a system which places minorities firmly behind their white counterparts in every significant socioeconomic measurement by a considerable margin have peace? In fact, I would dare say all of these elected officials on TV clamoring for things to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d are part of the problem. \u201cNormal\u201d is not only what got us here, it is what keeps us here. What this nation needs is to move forward, and stories like Lacey\u2019s \u2014 with her paltry prosecution of use-of-force \u2014 make it apparent what the first step needs to be. There is an uncomfortable, symbiotic relationship between the nation\u2019s police unions and the district and county attorneys who are elected to hold the union\u2019s membership accountable. In the new light of the high-profile death of Floyd \u2014 and so many unarmed minority women and men at the hands of police officers \u2014 records like Lacey\u2019s 500-to-1 certainly raises an eyebrow. Now is the moment to sign Colin Kaepernick In her case, we can juxtapose it against the millions of dollars sent to her campaign by law enforcement unions, and the $1 million dollars the LAPD union contributed to a PAC dedicated to defeating her most recent opponent (George Gasc\u00f3n, the one who has promised to toughen the standards for \u201cnecessary\u201d use of force by police). You begin to wonder if there\u2019s a conflict of interest. After all, if grassroots leaders worry that powerful politicians with close ties to gun and oil lobbies are somewhat compromised, is it not fair to wonder the same here? At a January debate, Gasc\u00f3n said with regard to Lacey\u2019s record on police force that she is a \u201cdistrict attorney that is comfortable looking away.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Lacey replied, according to an article in Mother Jones. \u201cPeople can talk trash, but what they will do when the pressure is on is different.\u201d To be clear, Lacey did not create this mess. Prosecutors must work closely with law enforcement in order to do their jobs effectively. It gets sticky when the job requires those prosecutors to investigate police officers, and downright seedy when prosecutors accept money from police unions, something that has occurred in cities and counties across the country for some time. As The Guardian notes: \u201cAmong the 95% of district attorneys who are elected, many \u2026 receive valuable donations and public endorsements from police unions for their campaigns.\u201d An important way for law enforcement to gain trust from the communities it serves is for legislators to put an end to this practice and the perceptions it raises. Trump is at war with the truth, not Twitter Consider this: On March 18, 2018 Sacramento police shot dead Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old black man, after pursuing him on foot to his grandmother\u2019s backyard. They were responding to a 911 call about someone breaking into cars in the neighborhood. Clark had turned toward them in his grandmother\u2019s yard with his arms outstretched, police said, and they believed the cellphone in one of his hand was a gun. Protests ensued, in a scene very similar to what\u2019s happening today. The Sacramento Bee reported that days after the shooting, two local police unions donated a combined $13,000 in campaign donations to Anne Marie Schubert, the district attorney up for reelection. Ultimately the officers were not charged. The unions and Schubert\u2019s team said the timing had nothing to do with the case. Schubert, like Lacey, has been criticized for not holding police accountable for shootings. It was a line of attack by her 2018 opponent, Noah Phillips, who claimed she was too close to law enforcement to effectively do the job. In an interview leading up to the election, Schubert countered by saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve prosecuted officers for raping women on duty. We\u2019ve prosecuted officers for welfare fraud,\u201d adding \u201cWe do our jobs. We\u2019re going to follow the law, we\u2019re going to follow the facts.\u201d (Last fall the city of Sacramento agreed to pay $2.4 million to Stephon Clark\u2019s two sons, 5 and 2 at the time of the settlement.) Racist attacks are mounting, but in L.A., Taiwanese Americans are among the first to help In a vacuum, there\u2019s nothing to see here. But we don\u2019t live in a vacuum. Former presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar was the Hennepin County attorney, the chief prosecutor in Minneapolis, from 1999 to 2007. She has come under fire from some for not bringing charges against Derek Chauvin, one of six officers involved in a 2006 shooting of a man who stabbed multiple people. Now Klobuchar, whose name has surfaced as a potential running mate for presumptive Democrat nominee Joe Biden, has called the suggestion that she had a role in declining to bring charges against Chauvin in 2006 as a \u201clie,\u201d according to the New York Times. (Chauvin had also accumulated several complaints before Floyd\u2019s death.) How Minneapolis protesters are honoring the site of George Floyd's death However, what she can\u2019t deny is her record. In the more than two dozen cases in which people were killed by police, she didn\u2019t bring charges against any of them. She did, however, go hard after vandals and minors, which disproportionately affected minorities. And while the source of contributions made to her reelection campaign can no longer be found, she had a cozy relationship with \u2014 and public backing of \u2014 the police unions that endorsed her, according to a 2019 report from American Public Media and Minnesota Public Radio. In and of itself, this does not indicate any wrongdoing. But given that Minneapolis paid $4.8 million in legal settlements related to 122 police misconduct incidents, and law enforcement was involved in 29 deaths during her tenure, according to the APM/MPR report, why must we be expected to believe it means nothing? Indeed, none of these examples point to clear corruption, but they certainly give the appearance of a conflict of interest. How can local and federal officials expect the minority community to trust the justice system when it looks as if the justice system is stacked against it? Again, even if none of the district attorneys who receive large sums of money from police unions are corrupt in the least bit, only a fool would look at these numbers and not at least consider the possibility. This incestuous relationship must end. People see millions of dollars exchanged between the police and the people who are supposed to hold the police accountable and they feel helpless.  Vulnerable. On edge. We want the violence in the streets to end but we don\u2019t want to return to normal. Normal is where injustice lies in wait. Normal is seeing police officers corroborate falsified reports and not be held accountable for doing so. So f- - -  normal. What is required to move forward is a belief that the justice system is there to protect us, not use us as a bartering chip. Even if it\u2019s not true, and everyone elected to this office does so with integrity, it sure doesn\u2019t look that way. It looks like we\u2019re being sacrificed because the district attorney doesn\u2019t want to bite the hand that feeds it.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The World Health Organization has officially declared the Wuhan coronavirus\u00a0a public health emergency of international concern. The organization had been withholding such a declaration, but the rapidly rising number of diagnoses and deaths, plus the evidence of person-to-person transmission cases outside China (including one in the US), made them reconsider. It\u2019s largely a political move that serves as a signal to governments to take the outbreak seriously.\u00a0At least 213 people are now dead from the disease, and more than 9,709 cases are confirmed worldwide. While everyone is worried about this particular outbreak, it\u2019s easy to forget about another deadly virus that has sickened more than 15 million Americans and killed more than 8,200 this season alone: influenza. Doctors say since the flu is more of a constant in American lives, it\u2019s easy to take for granted just how deadly it can be. This could be the most crucial day in the impeachment trial yet. Today, the Senate will vote on whether to call witnesses. Despite the wave of uncertainty over revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton\u00a0and despite ongoing debates about whether Chief Justice John Roberts can intervene to make sure witnesses are called,\u00a0it appears Republicans will close ranks and vote against witnesses. That means\u00a0the Senate could swiftly vote\u00a0to acquit President Trump\u00a0and end the trial, possibly today.\u00a0What happens after it\u2019s all over? Well, there will be a lot to think about.\u00a0In the short term, it\u2019s unclear how the whole saga will affect this year\u2019s presidential election. Constitutionally speaking, the broad presidential powers outlined by the President\u2019s defense could reshape the way future Oval Office occupants view their duties. The US military is looking to bolster its defenses against Iran by putting\u00a0Patriot missiles, a kind of\u00a0surface-to-air missile defense system, in Iraq. However, the momentum in Iraq seems to be toward decreasing \u2013 not increasing \u2013\u00a0the US\u00a0military presence there. The US will also levy new sanctions against Iran\u2019s\u00a0Atomic Energy Organization to try to pressure the regime after it reneged on key nuclear commitments. These escalating strategies could squeeze the Iranian economy and affect ordinary citizens. In response, the US also recently approved of a new channel of humanitarian aid that will guarantee payment for exports of\u00a0agricultural commodities, food, medicine,\u00a0medical devices and other necessities into the country. Mexico was plagued last year by the most murders the country had seen since records began. A staggering 35,588 murders were recorded by the\u00a0National Public Safety Secretariat, due in part to a social crisis fueled by turf wars among drug cartels. In some parts of the country, communities have taken to defending themselves against the violence. In the state of Guerrero, which saw\u00a01,891 intentional homicides last year, children as young as 6 are training to defend their neighborhoods as part of a self-defense militia. President\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u00a0has vowed to curb Mexico\u2019s violence problem by addressing the poverty that often leads to gang membership, but he hasn\u2019t yet\u00a0stemmed\u00a0the bloodshed. The Virginia House of Delegates passed a whopping seven gun safety bills yesterday. Democrats last year won control of Virginia\u2019s\u00a0government, and they\u2019ve wasted no time declaring gun control a priority for the brand-new legislative session.\u00a0The new measures address universal background checks and substantial risk protective orders, and they limit\u00a0the number of handgun purchases by a person to one per month. The legislation is expected to pass the state\u00a0Senate, then be signed by the Democratic governor. Pro-gun groups are not happy with the push to redefine gun laws. Some counties and cities have passed informal measures to declare themselves\u00a0\u201cSecond Amendment sanctuaries\u201d in support of gun rights.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his election loss are plunging deeper into incoherence. On Saturday night, the Trump campaign requested a second recount in Georgia, a day after top Republican state officials certified his defeat following a statewide audit. This one will be done by machine and is even less likely to reverse his fate. Hours earlier, a federal judge rejected the Trump campaign\u2019s latest effort to disenfranchise millions of voters \u2013 this time in Pennsylvania. All around the country, Trump lawyers and loyalists are seeing their baseless allegations of systemic voter fraud treated with increasing contempt by disbelieving judges. Even now, with a wave of certification deadlines about to crash down, the President and his opportunistic enablers are injecting doubt \u2013 and anxiety \u2013 wherever they can. The returns, though, seem to be diminishing and Joe Biden\u2019s transition team is plowing forward \u2013 with the President-elect set to announce his Cabinet picks this week. On Saturday, it was Judge Matthew Brann, a Republican, who in tossing out a Trump-backed lawsuit felt compelled to underscore, with a literary flourish, the absurdity of the campaign\u2019s assertions. RELATED: CNN\u2019s live results from the presidential election \u201cThis claim, like Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together from two distinct theories in an attempt to avoid controlling precedent,\u201d Brann wrote. His decision prompted another Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey \u2013 who is not running for reelection in 2022 \u2013 to do the bare minimum in breaking ranks with party leaders and acknowledging Biden as the President-elect. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch Trump ally, called the conduct of the President\u2019s legal team a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d on Sunday and said it was time for him to end his futile legal gambit. \u201cI have been a supporter of the President\u2019s. I voted for him twice, but elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Christie, an ABC contributor, said on \u201cThis Week.\u201d Later Sunday, Trump\u2019s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis attempted to distance themselves from attorney Sidney Powell, a member of Trump\u2019s legal team who has been spreading conspiracy theories about the election and whom Christie had singled out. \u201cSidney Powell is practicing law on her own,\u201d Giuliani and Ellis said in their statement, which came just days after Powell joined them for a wild news conference at Republican National Committee headquarters and a week after the President announced on Twitter that she was joining his legal team. In her own statement later Sunday, Powell said she agreed that she was \u201cnot part of the campaign\u2019s legal team\u201d and that she never billed the campaign any fees. \u201cMy intent has always been to expose all the fraud I could find and let the chips fall where they may\u2013whether it be upon Republicans or Democrats,\u201d she added, vowing to file an \u201cepic\u201d lawsuit this week. But even as Trump\u2019s brazen bid to subvert American democracy keeps gobbling up headlines, it is his appalling handling of the pandemic that seems poised now to etch itself more lastingly into the history books. The United States surpassed 12 million coronavirus cases on Saturday, adding nearly 200,000 more to its staggering count. Trump has made no mention of the terrifying milestone. Rather, he spent part of the day golfing. It was just as well. When the lame duck President speaks about the pandemic, he only further undermines scattershot efforts to contain it. That Trump skipped out of a side-session focused on pandemic preparedness with world leaders at the G20 virtual gathering on Saturday surprised no one. It\u2019s unlikely he was missed. All the while, states and cities around this country reported record-high numbers of infections as hospitalizations mounted \u2013 setting off alarm bells over a collapse of an overwhelmed health care system. And that\u2019s before millions of Americans begin their ill-advised holiday travels ahead of Thanksgiving this week. More than 255,000 are already dead, millions out work, and the administration and its Republican allies in the Senate seem determined to deepen the despair \u2013 while, in the process, undermining Biden\u2019s efforts to right the ship when he takes control on January 20 of next year. By blocking Biden\u2019s team from accessing sensitive government information, complicated operations like the distribution of a vaccine are likely to be delayed or made more cumbersome. Moncef Slaoui, the head of the White House\u2019s coronavirus vaccine effort, lamented Sunday that \u201cit\u2019s very\u00a0unfortunate that the whole (vaccine)\u00a0process has been politicized\u00a0and, therefore, the context has\u00a0created conditions whereby\u00a0people\u2019s perception has been\u00a0exacerbated and we are where we\u00a0are today.\u201d Vaccines are safe for Americans, Slaoui told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and with two separate vaccine makers \u2013 Moderna and Pfizer \u2013 reporting their vaccines are about 95% effective with no major safety concerns, \u201cit\u2019s almost a full\u00a0insurance against this pandemic,\u201d he said. Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, told Tapper that the operation has stayed out of the political arena, but, when asked about the transition between the Trump administration and incoming Biden administration, said: \u201cSmoothness is what we all aim for and therefore it would be better.\u201d Some nine months after the coronavirus first gripped the country, there is still no unified plan to combat it. And measures taken by Congress to mitigate the pain are lapsing. The expanded federal unemployment benefits extended as part of $2 trillion package passed earlier this year are due to run out just after Christmas, affecting an estimated 12 million Americans. There is, for now, little to suggest a coming renaissance of negotiation on Capitol Hill, where Senate Republicans have refused to take up a new aid package passed by House Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected potential piecemeal deals floated by the GOP in the run-up to the election.   The trickle down effects of inaction in Washington, DC, are being felt most acutely at the state and local level, where even officials who acknowledge the extent of the crisis are hesitant to take bold action and implement the kind of drastic measures proven to help curb the spread of the virus. \u201cYou shut nonessential workplaces or indoor dining, you\u2019re basically putting a bullet in them,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on Friday about the absence of federal aid, suggesting that something like a \u201ctwo-week pause\u201d is effectively out of the question without a capital boost from Capitol Hill. Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, ripped Senate Republicans over their hesitance to act \u2013 a contrast with the body\u2019s relatively swift passage of the initial $2 trillion package back in March. \u201cWith more than 12 million cases, over a quarter million Americans dead, more than 60 million unemployment claims filed since March, 8 million people have been pushed into poverty, and over one hundred thousand businesses shuttered, the same exact Senate has recessed without even the notion of hope of relief for Americans destined to die more likely from homelessness than a raging pandemic,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnyone musing politics makes inaction explainable better just resign now and let the patriotic essential workers take the reins.\u201d Even within congressional ranks, the number of Covid cases is steadily rising. Just this week, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Rick Scott of Florida tested positive. On Saturday night, Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican campaigning ahead of a runoff for her seat, announced that she, too, returned a positive test, bringing the total count to more than three dozen lawmakers from both parties. (Loeffler\u2019s campaign said Sunday that a previously inconclusive test came back negative but she will continue to undergo testing and self-isolate.) The twin crises of Covid and Trump\u2019s antidemocratic machinations collided over the last 48 hours, when two leading Michigan GOP lawmakers emerged from a meeting at the White House by stating, again, that they had seen no evidence to suggest Biden did not win their state fair and square. Instead, state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield apparently used at least part of their time with the President to deliver a letter pleading for more federal aid to fight the virus. \u201cMonths ago, Michigan received funds through the federal CARES Act, and we used that funding to quickly support front line workers, improve testing, ensure adequate PPE, provide additional support to out-of-work Michiganders, and deliver assistance to local businesses that are struggling through no fault of their own,\u201d the Michigan Republicans said in a joint statement. \u201cWe once again face a time in our state when additional support would go a long way to help those same residents who need our help.\u201d Trump retweeted the statement on Saturday morning, but ignored the request for help and focused on pumping air into his deflating campaign to upend the election. \u201cThis is true, but much different than reported by the media,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will show massive and unprecedented fraud!\u201d The meeting drew criticism from Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who told Tapper on Sunday that it was \u201ccompletely outrageous.\u201d Hogan, a moderate member of his party and a known Trump critic, also said he\u2019s \u201cembarrassed that more people in the party aren\u2019t speaking up.\u201d \u201cWe used to go supervise elections around the world, and we were the most respected, you know, country with respect to elections. And now we\u2019re beginning to look like we\u2019re a banana republic. It\u2019s time for them to stop the nonsense,\u201d he said. With a handful of local and state certification deadlines early next week, it has become plain that \u2013 like with so many other promises \u2013 Trump\u2019s pledge to reveal some kind of massive, coordinated fraud will never materialize. Shortly before news of the Pennsylvania case\u2019s embarrassing defeat began to spread, Trump retreated to more hospitable territory \u2013 the Wild West of social media \u2013 to engage in a round of coronavirus whataboutism. He pointed to the toll of the pandemic on other countries and attacked the media for not reporting on the efficacy of emerging therapeutics. \u201cThe Fake News is not talking about the fact that \u2018Covid\u2019 is running wild all over the World, not just in the U.S.,\u201d he wrote, before referencing, presumably, the portion of the morning\u2019s international summit he took part in. \u201cI was at the Virtual G-20 meeting early this morning and the biggest subject was Covid. We will be healing fast, especially with our vaccines!\u201d Those vaccines, though promising, are still months away being made available to millions of desperate Americans, tens of thousands of whom are projected to die before they arrive. In the meantime, Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary appears to be doing his best to starve the distressed business community of a key lifeline. On Thursday, Steve Mnuchin requested that the Federal Reserve return some $455 billion in so-far unused funding that the central bank insists has \u2013 and will \u2013 continue to be crucial in preventing further economic woes. Mnuchin himself, in a letter to the Federal Reserve, acknowledged that the lending programs \u201cclearly achieved their objective.\u201d But he still demanded the return of the nearly half-trillion dollars, a move that brought objections from corporate leaders \u2013 hardly a hotbed of anti-Trump resistance \u2013 and the Fed, which said it preferred \u201cthat the full suite of emergency facilities established during the coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained and vulnerable economy.\u201d The reasoning for the decision, some experts said, appeared to be a bid to hamstring the incoming administration. \u201cThis appears to be a political move by Team Trump to limit what President-elect Joe Biden can do next year to boost the economy,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services and housing policy analyst for Cowen Washington Research Group, wrote in a research note, \u201cespecially if Congress fails to pass a big stimulus.\u201d   And with the balance of the next Senate currently up for grabs, with Democrats needing to sweep the January runoff elections in Georgia to win control, the prospects for a package sizable enough to match the needs of the country are, at best, uncertain. So too is it for Biden and his transition team, which remains locked out of the agencies it is poised to take over after the inauguration, and cut off from information that could help in planning its way out of the current shambles. Emily Murphy, the Trump appointee who heads the General Services Administration, has given no indication of when, or if, she plans to exercise her power to acknowledge Biden as the \u201capparent\u201d winner, which would open up crucial lines of communication and avail the President-elect\u2019s team to millions of dollars in federal funds. Jen Psaki, who is overseeing Biden\u2019s nominations team, said Sunday that \u201cthe longer this goes, the longer it\u2019s going to jeopardize people\u2019s well being.\u201d But legal action, she told Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d isn\u2019t the transition team\u2019s \u201cpreference\u201d for getting the GSA to formally begin the transition process. \u201cIf it was, we would have done it days ago because we have known the clear outcome for two weeks now and that\u2019s the only trigger for ascertainment,\u201d Psaki said. She tweeted shortly after her interview with Tapper that Biden will name his first Cabinet picks on Tuesday \u2013 a date also confirmed by White House chief of staff Ron Klain on ABC Sunday. With Murphy stalling, Biden\u2019s transition team is now seeking to effectively crowdsource its efforts. On Friday it sent a fundraising email to supporters as it weighs legal options. \u201cThe nation faces too many challenges to not have a fully funded and smooth transition to prepare the President-elect and Vice President-elect to govern on Day One,\u201d a transition official told CNN. But no amount of money can buy access to the classified briefings typically granted within days to election winners. Biden \u2013 and the country \u2013 appear condemned to wait for Trump to set aside his wounded pride and concede to reality. The wait continues. The surge of death and despair does, too. This story has been updated with additional developments Sunday. CNN\u2019s Devan Cole, Sarah Mucha, Kevin Bohn and Daniella Mora contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Despite the coronavirus spreading among Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s orbit, the President and Vice President are ignoring the threat of the virus nine days before Election Day, continuing to downplay its risk at packed rallies across the country while endangering the lives of people around them, including their own staff and supporters. Marc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, tested positive on Saturday, the vice president\u2019s office announced in a statement late in the day. Sources told CNN that Marty Obst, a senior adviser to Pence who is not a government employee, and at least three staffers in Pence\u2019s office also tested positive for the virus in recent days. Zach Bauer, a longtime aide and one of the staffers who works closest with Pence, has tested positive for coronavirus, CNN learned Sunday. At least 5 of Vice President Pence's aides test positive for coronavirus \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep opening up America again,\u201d Pence said at a North Carolina rally Sunday evening, arguing that the Democrats\u2019 approach would be far too restrictive and barely mentioning the virus and the fact that cases are surging. Trump once again advanced the false claim this weekend that coronavirus infections are rising because the US has increased testing and chided reporters in Ohio for using the word \u201ccases\u201d \u2013 arguing the phrase is meant to \u201cscare people.\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows made the administration\u2019s approach clear when he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that it was not possible to control the virus, because \u201cit is a contagious virus just like the flu.\u201d He later added that the White House is \u201cmaking efforts to contain it.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas,\u201d Meadows told Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to do is make sure that we have the proper mitigation factors, whether it\u2019s therapies or vaccines or treatments to make sure that people don\u2019t die from this.\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, pushed back against those comments. \u201cWe all have control, and we all have responsibility as leaders to set an example that consists of doing the right thing to stop the spread,\u201d he said, pointing to mask wearing and social distancing. \u201cThere are certain elements of it that yes, we cannot control. It\u2019s a virus. It\u2019s very aggressive. It wants to infect a lot of people, but there are things about our own behavior that we can control.\u201d Other GOP senators distanced themselves from Meadows\u2019 comments. Asked whether they should stop trying to get the virus under control, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said, \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d \u201cNo, I think we do everything and throw the kitchen sink at getting the virus under control,\u201d Indiana Sen. Mike Braun said when asked the same question. 9 days to go: Biden's lead over Trump is holding, while Clinton's was collapsing at this point With just a little more than a week to go, and early voting already surpassing 2016 levels, the campaign is still dominated by Covid-19 \u2013 an area where Trump has gotten poor marks. The virus is still the most important issue to American voters, millions of whom are waiting for Congress to strike a stimulus deal that would provide emergency relief to unemployed workers and businesses that are struggling to hang on. But the two sides remain at an impasse as hopes for a deal in the near-term fade. The US hit a new daily record for coronavirus cases last week, but both the administration and Trump campaign don\u2019t seem to have learned from last month\u2019s Rose Garden Supreme Court nomination ceremony, which has since been called a superspreader event. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Dueling rallies this weekend showed the stark contrast between the campaigns\u2019 visions of how to tackle the pandemic. Pence and second lady Karen Pence each tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday, a White House official said, but despite his contact with multiple people who tested positive, the vice president is refusing to quarantine and plans to continue traveling and campaigning every day in the final stretch to Election Day, an official told CNN. Meadows said Sunday that Pence will continue \u201cwearing a mask, socially distancing and when he goes up to speak he will take the mask off and put it back on.\u201d Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris had canceled travel a week ago \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d after two people in her orbit tested positive. The California senator on Sunday said the Trump administration is \u201cadmitting defeat\u201d on the virus. Trump wouldn\u2019t say whether Pence should come off the trail. \u201cYou have to ask him, he\u2019s doing very well, good crowds, very socially distanced, he\u2019s doing very well,\u201d Trump told reporters after he touched down in Maine on Sunday. There didn\u2019t appear to be much distancing at Pence\u2019s Saturday rallies in Florida. Pence said on Friday that he\u2019s planning to preside over the Senate vote to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett Monday evening. \u201cTheir carelessness with the health and safety of their colleagues and Capitol employees mirrors their carelessness with the health and safety of Americans during this crisis,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to his Democratic colleagues, urging them not to congregate in the chamber ahead of Sunday\u2019s procedural vote advancing Barrett\u2019s nomination. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to answer a reporter\u2019s question Sunday on whether Pence should stay away from the Senate because several members of his team tested positive for coronavirus. As coronavirus cases hit daily record, Trump tries to reframe race about oil But New Jersey\u2019s former Republican Gov. Chris Christie, an ABC News contributor, said Sunday he\u2019s \u201csurprised\u201d Pence is not quarantining. \u201cThe whole getting of Covid to begin with and the not wearing of masks has been a problem,\u201d Christie, who has urged Americans to wear a mask since his own positive diagnosis, told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. Out on the campaign trail, at rallies with little mask wearing or social distancing, Trump has continued to make the dubious claim that the pandemic is \u201crounding the turn\u201d \u2013 an assertion that stands in complete opposition to the facts. His disconnection from reality gave former Vice President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama an opening Saturday to call out his denials. Obama in Florida: Trump's tough guy schtick is a fraud Both Biden and Obama, who hit the campaign trail in Miami as his former vice president\u2019s most powerful surrogate, criticized Trump\u2019s lack of a strategy for halting the spread of the virus as the weather grows colder and more Americans head indoors. \u201cEight months into this pandemic, new cases are breaking records. Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to suddenly protect all of us. He can\u2019t even take the basic steps to protect himself,\u201d Obama said in Florida, a state he won twice where CNN\u2019s poll of polls currently shows Trump and Biden running even. \u201cThere\u2019s no sense that he\u2019s coming up with a new approach, with a new plan. He doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that there\u2019s a problem.\u201d Noting the President\u2019s recurring theme that he speaks for the forgotten men and women of America, Biden criticized Trump for viewing the country through the lens of blue and red states when it comes to Covid-19. \u201cHe got elected and he immediately forgot the forgotten man. Remember what Donald Trump said when Covid hit 200,000 deaths? He said if you take out the blue states with Democratic governors and just look at the red states with Republican governors, we\u2019re doing quite well. First of all that\u2019s not true,\u201d Biden said Saturday. \u201cSecond, (why) the hell would the President say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do anything for Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin, Democratic states. I\u2019m only going to help red states.\u2019 Where does this guy come from?\u201d Biden said. \u201cLook folks, I don\u2019t see the presidency that way. I don\u2019t see America that way. This has to change. And it will change with me.\u201d Obama did a line-by-line takedown of Trump\u2019s character flaws and his bullying behavior, mocking the President for complaining about his press coverage and for walking out of an interview this past week with Lesley Stahl of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cThis President, he likes to act tough and talk tough,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe thinks scowling and being mean is tough, and being rude is tough. But when \u201960 Minutes\u2019 and Lesley Stahl are too tough for you, you ain\u2019t all that tough. If you\u2019ve got to walk out of a \u201860 Minutes\u2019 interview, then you\u2019re never going to stand up to a dictator.\u201d Referencing some of Trump\u2019s recent comments that Obama, Hillary Clinton and members of the Biden family should all be thrown in jail, Obama also argued that America should not have a President \u201cwho threatens people with jail just for criticizing him.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not normal behavior, Florida,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a coworker. You wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a high school principal. You wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a coach. You wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a family member. \u2018Florida Man\u2019 wouldn\u2019t even do this stuff,\u201d he said to laughter and honking from the drive-in audience at the Miami event. \u201cWhy are we accepting it from the President of the United States?\u201d Trump\u2019s self-centered delusion extended to the horse race this weekend, when he predicted \u201ca red wave\u201d in November up and down the ticket, despite Democrats being on track to gain seats in the House and Senate \u2013 largely because the President has been such a drag on down-ballot Republicans. But the Washington Post reported that the President admitted to donors in Nashville Thursday that \u201cthe Senate is very tough,\u201d because, he said, there are some senators he refuses to help. In their back-to-back events on Saturday, Obama in Florida and Biden in Pennsylvania both argued that Trump should be spending more of his time trying to work with Congress to channel more emergency aid to the American people in the midst of rising poverty levels and economic uncertainty due to the pandemic. Biden touted his plans for halting the spread of the virus through testing, tracing, a more robust distribution of personal protective equipment and national standards for schools and businesses to open safely. And he said he would prioritize \u201cbringing together Republicans and Democrats to deliver relief to working families and schools and businesses.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to shut down the economy. I\u2019m going to shut down the virus and build the economy,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFolks, this is all within our power. We can build back better than before.\u201d During his Miami rally, Obama faulted Trump for failing to get a deal to \u201cextend relief to the millions of families who can\u2019t pay the rent or put food on the table.\u201d \u201cThe fact that he can\u2019t make that happen \u2013 that he won\u2019t make that happen \u2013 it\u2019s hard to understand, because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s his money. He barely pays income taxes,\u201d Obama said, alluding to New York Times reporting that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes during his first year in the White House. Trump, who did not speak at any length about the possibility of a Covid-19 relief package on Saturday, chose instead to emphasize positive news like the drop in the nation\u2019s mortality rate, due to enhanced treatments and better management of cases. And he touted the nation\u2019s fragile economic recovery \u2013 claiming it would be jeopardized by a Biden presidency. The President argued the election is a choice between a \u201cTrump super recovery\u201d and a Biden depression, at times seizing on Biden\u2019s confusing comments about fracking, which came up during Thursday\u2019s debate. As the President played clips of Biden talking about fracking at his own rallies this weekend, Biden responded on Saturday. \u201cLet me get something straight here in coal country,\u201d Biden said in Luzerne County. \u201cI will not ban fracking, period. I will protect Pennsylvania jobs.\u201d But despite the back-and-forth on the campaign trail about the economy, Americans are still waiting for real economic relief. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin needed to strike a deal within 48 hours if they wanted to pass a coronavirus stimulus relief package before Election Day. But that self-imposed deadline passed and talks did not appear any closer to a conclusion at the end of the week. Pelosi told Tapper Sunday on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that she never gives up hope, but said the two sides have not reached an agreement on central issues like coronavirus testing, jobless benefits and state and local funding. Meadows told Tapper that the White House has continued to make \u201coffer after offer\u201d and \u201cNancy continues to move the goalposts,\u201d while Pelosi accused the administration of doing the same. If they are able to resolve differences on the remaining issues, \u201cit could happen this week in the House,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut that\u2019s up to (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch (McConnell), as to whether it would happen in the Senate and go to the President\u2019s desk, which is our hope and prayer,\u201d she added.

            },
            "article_content": "If there\u2019s one story from 2016 that Bernie Sanders wants to flip in 2020, it\u2019s the one about how he just doesn\u2019t resonate with a wide range of black voters as much as his rivals do. Nowhere will the senator from Vermont face a greater reckoning on this score than in South Carolina, where a majority of the Democratic electorate is black and where, four years ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat him in the primary by almost 50 points \u2013 a stratospheric margin. While Clinton had always been the odds-on favorite to win the Palmetto State \u2013 aka \u201cClinton Country\u201d \u2013 Sanders\u2019 messaging on race likely did little to help him woo more than just younger black voters. Back then, he often failed to articulate the quieter complexities of oppression to a base that\u2019s increasingly wrestling with race and identity. Ahead of South Carolina\u2019s primary on Saturday, then, a fair question to ask is: Has Sanders\u2019 outreach to black voters in the state felt meaningfully different this time around? In interviews here, black Sanders supporters \u2013 who arguably have a distinct interest in observing if and how the campaign grapples with the unflattering narrative from 2016 \u2013 said that they\u2019ve perceived a change, especially when it comes to the senator\u2019s team.   \u201cSanders has been selling the same product his entire life,\u201d Allen Kagler, 22, who said he\u2019s knocked on \u201cmaybe 7,000 doors\u201d for the senator, told CNN, referring to Sanders\u2019 broad message of social justice. \u201cBut it\u2019s about how you angle it toward specific communities. I feel like in 2020, maybe he hasn\u2019t been doing it, but his team\u201d \u2013 which both nationally and in the state is more diverse now than it was in 2016 and has beefed up its grassroots work \u2013 \u201chas been more intentional in this way.\u201d Kagler continued: \u201cSanders has people who are willing to go out and have these (more direct) conversations with the black community.\u201d Consider former Democratic Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner. A co-chair of Sanders\u2019 2020 campaign and one of his top black surrogates in 2016, she\u2019s made the Palmetto State her \u201cadopted home\u201d during this election cycle, working to forge local relationships. \u201cWe paid lots of attention to South Carolina. (Sanders) has been to about 60 events in that state,\u201d Turner told NPR earlier this month. \u201cHe started going through that state in the latter part of 2018, even before he knew he was ever going to run again. So he was continuously doing the work of the people, being out there on the front line.\u201d And just last weekend, as Sanders was anticipating his thumping victory in the Nevada caucuses while on the campaign trail in Texas, the scholar Cornel West and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, two of Sanders\u2019 most prominent black surrogates, were stumping for him in a historically black neighborhood in Columbia, Mother Jones\u2019 Kara Voght reported. Faith Adedokun, 34, echoed Kagler\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI do think that there\u2019s been a bit of a pivot in 2020,\u201d she said, in Sanders\u2019 approach to black voters in South Carolina. \u201cBut it\u2019s less that he\u2019s altered his message and more that he\u2019s been particular about where that message is going and how it\u2019s getting there.\u201d That Sanders has been so consistent in his expansive calls for equality was a common point of praise in interviews. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what I like about him,\u201d Adedokun said. \u201cCandidates do have to evolve as the world around them evolves, but I think that one of the reasons Sanders hasn\u2019t changed much is because he\u2019s been ahead of the curve when it comes to the issues he\u2019s been trying to push to the forefront of the national conversation.\u201d Still, change \u2013 what it looks like, what it should look like \u2013 is subjective. For some black voters here, Sanders\u2019 campaign either no longer stands out from the progressive crowd or hasn\u2019t grown enough, so they\u2019ve peeled off from it. \u201cI appreciate when Sanders comes to the South to campaign and talk about how he can help us, but I needed more from him,\u201d Latia Curtis, 34, who supported Sanders in 2016 but in 2020 backs Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, told CNN. \u201cI probably would\u2019ve stayed (in his camp) had I heard clear, unabashed support for things that aren\u2019t just (class) politics but are about people\u2019s humanity.\u201d Curtis added: \u201cI do believe that his intent is good \u2013 that he wants to make it easier for all people to break free from the grips of poverty. But there are a lot of other (intersecting) social issues I wanted him to be passionate about. I don\u2019t feel like he is. I feel like Warren is.\u201d Lawrence Moore, 64, was equally blunt in detailing his turn away from Sanders. \u201cA lot of times, politicians talk to you but not with you. And from 2016 to now, my impression is that Sanders doesn\u2019t address black issues from the perspective of black people but rather from the perspective of his need to have us on board,\u201d he said. Moore, who was the South Carolina political director for Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign and is still mulling over the remaining 2020 candidates, recalled a moving event the senator held in 2014. \u201cHe was in Columbia, at The Lourie Center, talking about a variety of progressive issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the opportunity to ask him about the Black Lives Matter movement, and I remember thinking that the way he talked about it was beyond how other white politicians talked about it at the time.\u201d This enthusiasm has since cooled. \u201cGiven the several decades he\u2019s been in politics, I don\u2019t think that he has the relationships with our community that he should have,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI\u2019m still very impressed by his positions on issues, but many other people have had those same positions. Sometimes Sanders\u2019 supporters act like he invented the idea of universal health care. But when I was in college at the University of South Carolina, I backed Ted Kennedy\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign against Jimmy Carter. I did so partly because of Kennedy\u2019s understanding that we need universal health care. And that idea had already been around before him.\u201d In the Palmetto State, former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead among black voters, with 35% favoring him for the Democratic presidential nomination and 20% favoring Sanders, according to a poll from NBC News/Marist released on Monday. (Crucially, on Wednesday, South Carolina\u2019s Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black American in Congress and an icon in the state, endorsed Biden.) Zooming out, Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, where his research focuses on the role of race in electoral politics, was dubious about whether Sanders will shore up national black support in 2020 in a way he didn\u2019t in 2016. \u201cI think that his black support this cycle looks a lot like his black support in 2016. It tends to be geographically dispersed and stem from younger black voters who usually lean to the left on a range of policy issues,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that Sanders has hit a ceiling, but he seems to have found his constituency, and it\u2019s similar to what it was four years ago. The question is: Can he increase his share of the black vote through turnout instead of through converting older black voters?\u201d On Saturday, the country will move one step closer to getting an answer.",

            "article_content": "In South Carolina, Michael Bloomberg is something of a phantom: He won\u2019t be on the ballot in the state\u2019s Democratic primary on Saturday, but you can still feel his presence. And the dueling attachments black voters here have to the billionaire reveal a lot about what the country tends to miss when it comes to the varied concerns of this voting bloc more broadly. As with his tenure as New York City\u2019s mayor, Bloomberg\u2019s late-entry bid for the Democratic presidential nomination has become synonymous with \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d a discriminatory policing strategy that made targets of black and Latino men. Indeed, anger is the first word Jasmine Johnson, 30, a grassroots organizer, thinks of when she hears Bloomberg\u2019s name. \u201cThere are better things he could\u2019ve done with his money than hop into the race (this late) and stir up these feelings that people in New York City now have to relive,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just trauma that we don\u2019t need.\u201d How\u2019s it possible, then, that in recent weeks, a candidate so publicly haunted by his prior backing of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d has managed to make meaningful inroads with, in particular, black voters? (His support rocketed from 7% in January to 22% in February, according to Quinnipiac University national polls.)   It\u2019s a question that feels worth parsing as the country gears up for Saturday\u2019s primary in the Palmetto State \u2013 where black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate \u2013 and for the Super Tuesday races that Bloomberg will compete in just days later, on March 3. One reason for Bloomberg\u2019s peculiar appeal isn\u2019t too tough to understand: Over and over, black voters have underscored that trouncing President Donald Trump in the general election is their No. 1 priority, and Bloomberg has brought his campaign in line with this goal. Via a media blitz worth hundreds of millions of dollars that\u2019s flooded the Internet and airwaves, Bloomberg has channeled his energy almost entirely into knocking Trump. In doing so, he\u2019s fashioned himself as the moderate alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden, the previous front-runner, who can end an administration that\u2019s been a persistent source of unease for black Americans. (\u201cAmerica demanded change, and change is what we got,\u201d the narrator says in one such ad, before it jumps to a supercut of the nadirs of the Trump era, including the 2017 white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia.) Or, as South Carolina Rep. Todd Rutherford \u2013 the House minority leader and an influential black leader in the state \u2013 put it in his endorsement of Bloomberg: \u201cI believe he\u2019s the only one who can take the ball and push it across the finish line.\u201d Yet Bloomberg\u2019s allure stems from more than his perceived electability (already a gauzy concept). There\u2019s the tangle of money and mobility to consider, too. \u201cJobs creator, leader, servant & problem solver,\u201d Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, a key black Democrat in the state and also a co-chair of Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, tweeted in November. \u201cI firmly believe that America needs Mike Bloomberg now.\u201d Jobs creator. Problem solver. Beyond providing staff positions with his campaign that pay more than his rivals\u2019 (to mixed effect), Bloomberg has a platform that wrestles with empowering black communities on a more fundamental level, an ambition reflected in his Greenwood Initiative to \u201caddress the systemic bias that has kept black Americans from building wealth.\u201d One South Carolina voter, Tina Herbert, 45, who was previously the director of the Office of Business Opportunity for the City of Columbia, spoke directly to this point. \u201cWhen Bloomberg was in Columbia maybe one or two years ago, he worked with artisans who have a certain craft but don\u2019t necessarily have business acumen,\u201d Herbert recalled. \u201cHe wanted to work with that group of people to help them to build wealth with their skill set. And that resonates with people, including black Americans.\u201d Herbert highlighted a recent example of Bloomberg\u2019s attention to black wealth: the announcement earlier this month that the billionaire made a historic, $3.5 million ad buy with the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which represents more than 200 black-owned community newspapers. \u201cThe ad buy not only is a show of respect to the incredible impact and importance of African American journalism but also it is Mike walking the walk when it comes to his investing in African American-owned businesses,\u201d Benjamin said at the time. While Herbert supports Biden in the 2020 race, she acknowledged that Bloomberg\u2019s move is noteworthy. \u201cI had to give them a thumbs-up for that one, because it wasn\u2019t just throwing money out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was investing money in minority businesses.\u201d Something else Herbert said also stood out: that Bloomberg\u2019s approach to courting black voters has seen some success in part because it gets at the profound skepticism many black Americans have of a government that, over the centuries, has done very little to earn their trust. \u201cYou can\u2019t depend on the government to lift people out of poverty,\u201d she explained. This belief has, in turn, made the billionaire\u2019s nods toward economic self-sufficiency strike a chord. Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, where he investigates the role of race in electoral politics, echoed some of Herbert\u2019s sentiments. \u201cWhen it comes to black Americans\u2019 expectations for government, they usually want a strong government for things such as protecting voting rights,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cBut when it comes to economic security, there\u2019s fascinating research coming out showing that more and more view government-assistance programs less favorably because these programs have been stereotyped as handouts to black people who can\u2019t make it on their own. And so they prefer a government that allows them to become economically self-sufficient.\u201d In regard to Bloomberg, \u201cthe more a candidate champions black economic self-determination, the more of an audience that candidate will have,\u201d Johnson explained. (Jesse Jackson touted something similar in the 1980s, when he pushed for \u201csilver rights.\u201d) Of course, black voters are no monolith. Despite the enthusiasm with which some members of this demographic in South Carolina have greeted Bloomberg, others look at him askance. Johnson, the grassroots organizer, backs the other billionaire in the Democratic field, Tom Steyer, drawn to the candidate\u2019s attention to local issues such as the clean water crisis in Denmark, South Carolina. While Steyer has yet to catch on nationally, he\u2019s gained traction in the Palmetto State \u2013 according to a recent CBS News poll, he\u2019s the first choice nominee for 18% of likely primary voters, behind only Biden (28%) and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (23%). \u201cIf you listen to the conversations about Bloomberg, they\u2019re all about how he\u2019s hurt people of color,\u201d Johnson said, reiterating what for many here is a sticking point. \u201cFor Trump and hate to be the first things attached to your name, that\u2019s not cool.\u201d It\u2019s still an open question as to whether Bloomberg\u2019s ballooning black support will last, especially in light of his poor performance on the debate stage in Las Vegas, Nevada. \u201cIf Biden\u201d \u2013 who\u2019s long considered South Carolina to be his \u201cfirewall\u201d but has recently seen cracks in it \u2013 \u201cwins on Saturday, folks who were skittish about his chances may feel a renewed sense of his electability rolling into Super Tuesday,\u201d Theodore Johnson said. Still, regardless of what happens, it\u2019d be ill-advised to gloss over the distinct pull Bloomberg has with a number of black voters in South Carolina and beyond. Democratic candidates perennially ask how to secure this vital voting bloc\u2019s support \u2013 the answers may lie in the campaigns they least expect.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. I\u2019m not in the habit of quoting lines from movies I\u2019ve appeared in, but every once in a while, something brings one of those old lines to mind. Recently, I\u2019ve been thinking of a scene from a film I did in 1972 called \u201cThe Candidate.\u201d My character, Bill McKay, is running for the US Senate from California. At the end of a televised debate, McKay is prompted to give his closing statement. He veers off script \u2013 casting aside the careful messages his consultants had crafted \u2013 and speaks from the heart. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to note what subjects we haven\u2019t discussed,\u201d he says. He mentions race, and poverty and urban blight. \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed any of the sicknesses that may yet send this country up in flames.\u201d I\u2019ve thought of that scene as I\u2019ve watched the land near my home in California go up in flames \u2013 literally. The wildfires there, like the ones in Oregon and Washington and Colorado, did draw some news coverage, as you\u2019d expect them to. But climate change \u2013 which is creating the conditions for fires like these and for extreme, destructive weather of other kinds \u2013 isn\u2019t being discussed to any meaningful degree. According to a new analysis of Americans who rely on major broadcasters as their source of news, only 20% feel \u201cvery well-informed\u201d about climate change. Other than the time last month that Donald Trump said \u201cscience doesn\u2019t know\u201d whether our planet is overheating, climate change has barely registered in media coverage. The Amazon's frontline defenders are under siege. Where are their reinforcements? The equatorial rainforests of South America, Africa, and Asia are being destroyed at a staggering rate \u2013 and at a rising cost to biodiversity and the quality of our air and water \u2013 yet outside of environmental circles, this is largely not considered news. Of course, I\u2019m as aware as anyone that we\u2019re only weeks away from Election Day. Our country, reasonably enough, is consumed with questions about the pandemic; the state of the President\u2019s physical and mental health after his Covid-19 diagnosis; the federal government\u2019s failure to extend relief for unemployed Americans and struggling small businesses; concerns about the integrity of our election; our ongoing reckoning with systemic racism. And that\u2019s hardly a complete list. It\u2019s a lot to lie awake thinking about. In the tech world, they talk about information overload. We\u2019ve all got it. Couple that with the President\u2019s constant attempts to change the subject, and it\u2019s not surprising that key issues get ignored \u2013 particularly the root causes of issues, which require the press to dig deeper. So we hear about the plot by a group of men to \u201cstorm\u201d the Michigan capitol building and kidnap the governor, but not about the laws and court rulings that allowed far-right protesters to bring guns into the state Senate gallery last spring and loom above the lawmakers. We hear a lot about the shocking rate of Covid-19 infections affecting senior citizens, but much less about the chronically crowded, unsafe conditions in nursing homes \u2013 \u201cdeath pits,\u201d as a former New York lieutenant governor has called them. And for all the valid concern about the peaceful transfer of power after an election, when the President has refused to commit to it, there is too little discussion of the structural reasons our democracy fails to represent a majority of the American people.  Maybe it\u2019s too much to suggest, at the peak of a presidential campaign, that we have a serious discussion about burning rainforests or understaffed long-term care facilities. Complex problems don\u2019t make great campaign issues. They don\u2019t rally your base; they don\u2019t get people to the polls (or the post office). But these are not subjects that are going to patiently wait their turn, that are going to hang back in line until we\u2019re ready to talk about them. For all these reasons, it\u2019s my hope that this November will provide a hard reset \u2013 of our national direction, most of all, but also our national attention. An election is democracy\u2019s pivot point. It\u2019s a moment that should prompt us, all of us, to refocus on what really matters. That list of issues is longer and more daunting than it has been for generations. When the campaign merry-go-round finally stops, when the cycle of charges and counter-charges finally ceases, we can turn to the subjects we haven\u2019t discussed. And we can begin to answer the question that my character, Bill McKay, asks at the end of the movie: \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d",

Dr. William Barber II is president of Repairers of the Breach and co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival. His co-chair, the Rev. Dr. Liz Theoharis, is the director of the Kairos Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary.  The Poor People\u2019s Campaign is mobilizing poor people, clergy and people of conscience for a Mass Poor People\u2019s Assembly and March on Washington on June 20, 2020. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN. As the primaries turn towards Nevada and South Carolina, there is ongoing discussion about how voter turnout impacted the outcome in New Hampshire. To understand voter participation in 2020, we need to go back and take a look at what happened in 2016.That year was the first election without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. Racist gerrymandering was reconfiguring voting districts to favor one party or another. Hundreds of polling stations were closed. The electoral college system once again crowded out the popular vote. And on top of all this, one of the most stunning factors about 2016 was that close to 100 million eligible voters \u2013 or nearly 43% of the electorate - did not vote, according to the US elections project. In 2016 there were approximately 225.7 million eligible voters:  65.8 million voted for Hillary Clinton and 62.9 million voted for Donald Trump, leaving some 100 million eligible voters who opted out.  Of these nearly 100 million non-voting eligible voters, the Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival has worked with Robert Paul Hartley, an economist with the Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) at Columbia University, to calculate \u2013 using data from the Census Bureau \u2013 in a forthcoming report that 23 million were poor or low-income, with household incomes falling below twice the federal poverty line. There is untapped potential among this voting bloc of 23 million poor and low-income voters. In the report, Hartley shows that small increases in their participation in elections could change the political terrain of this country. Biden has one last chance to save his candidacy Yet, this voting bloc remains largely ignored by the major political parties. They and other poor Americans rarely hear a politician call their name and speak to their conditions. In the more than 20 debates leading up to the 2016 elections, there was not a single hour dedicated to poverty or economic insecurity. This is true across party lines: Democratic candidates seemingly run from using the word \u201cpoor\u201d or addressing poverty, focusing mainly on the middle class, while Republicans racialize poverty. As a result, 150 years after the 15th amendment, millions of voters are walking away from the ballot box. In our work across 42 states in the country, among the 140 million poor and low-income people who are daily struggling to meet their needs in one of the richest countries in the world, we have witnessed the untapped potential of these voters. The power of independents in New Hampshire and the nation In North Carolina, the Forward Together Moral Movement launched \u201cMoral Monday\u201d protests in 2013 to highlight the impact of Republican Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s policies to cut early voting, block the expansion of Medicaid and slash unemployment benefits. Better known as the \u201cMoral Monday\u2019s Movement,\u201d we brought together a coalition of 200 organizations, clergy, and impacted people to resist these attacks and others on the rights of women, labor, immigrants and the LGBTQ community. Shortly after the \u201cMoral Monday\u201d marches, McCrory\u2019s approval ratings dropped significantly. He was never able to regain his popularity and was eventually unseated in 2016. In 2019, our sustained organizing among poor and low-income voters in Kentucky resulted in several predominantly white counties that had previously gone to both Donald Trump and the Republican incumbent, Governor Matt Bevin, to flip by small margins and elect the gubernatorial candidate that embraced our agenda. In his acceptance speech, the new governor, Andy Beshear, referenced a line that we use regularly in our movement and immediately enacted several policies listed in our Moral Agenda, including ending work requirements for Medicaid and restoring voting rights to the formerly incarcerated.  The lesson we have learned is that fusion organizing - the deliberate effort to bring together poor black, white and brown people around their common interests - can change the political landscape. These poor and low-income communities are not necessarily interested in a specific candidate, so much as a substantive platform that speaks to their needs. Contrary to popular wisdom, Trump was not ushered into the presidency by poor or working class white voters.  According to the American National Election Study, only 25% of people who voted for Trump were poor, white (non-Hispanic), without college degrees and they did not necessarily agree with his platform or agenda. When we were in Harlan, Kentucky, a predominantly white county that went to Trump in 2016, we asked the people there why they voted for him. They knew he didn\u2019t represent their interests, but, they answered, \u201cHe came to see us.\u201d Let\u2019s learn our lessons from 2016. Let\u2019s put poverty front and center in the political narrative and see what change will come. Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly referenced a Kentucky county the authors visited to discuss the 2016 election. It was Harlan County.",

The agents with Postal Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General were responding to a report about undelivered mail on Sunday outside the employee\u2019s home. The employee works at the Mount Oliver post office, according to a statement from Postal Service. \u201cUSPS OIG Special Agents recovered several different classes of mail, including business mail, flats, and small amount of first class mail,\u201d Special Agent Scott Balfour told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe expect to perform a piece count of the mail today, and make arrangements to have to mail delivered to customers as soon as feasible.\u201d The employee was not named in the statement, but Balfour said he is currently on a non-duty and non-pay status. \u201cOnce USPS OIG special agents conclude their investigation, the case will be presented for federal prosecution to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d he said. Balfour noted that the Postal Service has 630,000 employees and the majority are \u201chard-working, trustworthy individuals\u201d who work around the clock to deliver the nation\u2019s mail. \u201cIncidents of this nature are exceedingly rare when put into that context,\u201d he said. Baldwin is a suburb of Pittsburgh while Mount Oliver is a small town that is completely surrounded the Pittsburgh city limits. Last week, the Justice Department charged a mail carrier in New Jersey for dumping mail. According to a DOJ statement, 26-year-old Nicholas Beauchene was arrested and charged with one count of delay of mail and one of obstruction of mail. If found guilty of both charges, he faces up to five years and six months in prison and a $255,000 fine. Court documents say that Beauchene has worked for the Postal Service since July. He\u2019s accused of dumping 1,875 pieces of mail in two dumpsters, one in North Arlington and the other in West Orange. The mail in the North Arlington dumpster contained 98 general election ballots; mail found in the West Orange dumpster had one general election ballot. All of the mail, according to the DOJ, was eventually delivered. Howard Dinger, a North Arlington resident, told CNN he found the mail sitting in a North Arlington dumpster, wrapped with rubber bands on October 2. He said he discovered it while throwing out his own trash and immediately called police. CNN has reached out to Beauchene for comment.

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced legislation Tuesday to combine two additional demands from President Donald Trump to an expansion of direct stimulus payments as part of the Covid-19 relief package, raising Democratic concern the pathway for expanded stimulus payments would soon be short-circuited. The Kentucky Republican, shortly before adjourning the Senate on Tuesday afternoon, introduced a bill that would combine increased direct payments with a repeal of the online liability protections known as Section 230 and the establishment of a commission to study voter fraud. The latter two issues have been significant drivers of Trump\u2019s ire in the wake of his general election loss \u2013 the latter of which with zero evidence presented to this point. While the move doesn\u2019t guarantee McConnell will bring the bill up for a vote, it provides a substantive option should time \u2013 and the political winds \u2013 press the chamber in that direction. It\u2019s also one that would be all but certain to fail to garner the votes for passage. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the bill a \u201ccynical gambit\u201d and said it would serve as \u201ca blatant attempt\u201d to ensure the $2,000 direct payments were not signed into law. But McConnell\u2019s move was crucial for several reasons in the final chaotic days of the 116th Congress. With two politically endangered GOP senators just days away from runoff elections \u2013 Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia \u2013 announcing their support for Trump\u2019s push for $2,000 checks, McConnell has found himself in a position he spends the vast majority of his time as Republican leader trying to avoid: Navigating a divided conference. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri are also behind the push to expand the payments, with Hawley playing a central role in pushing the issue to the forefront. The group is hardly a majority, however, aides say. A significant number of Senate Republicans have problems with the House-passed measure to increase the direct payments. Sen. Patrick Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, called the direct payments, given their size and scope, \u201cnot sound economic policy.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and ally of McConnell\u2019s, said he was opposed to the standalone direct payments increase and said given the amount Congress has appropriated in Covid relief up to this point, more focus should be placed on those efforts. \u201cThis is just opportunistic on the part of the House,\u201d Cornyn said of House Democrats. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an issue and unfortunately it seems to be drowning out all the other good stuff we\u2019ve done.\u201d By tying all of Trump\u2019s demands together, particularly with policies Democrats are almost sure to oppose, McConnell gives himself an option that, should he bring it to the floor, would give Republicans something to vote for with little risk it could become law. \u201cIf we start adding poison pills to the $2,000 payment bill, that is just another way of telling the American people that this body doesn\u2019t support $2,000 payments,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said of the additional provisions. McConnell blocks effort to quickly increase direct stimulus payments McConnell, with this alternative bill, is tying all of Trump\u2019s demands into a single piece of legislation. While aides say it\u2019s unclear if the bill will actually come up \u2013 there remains a possibility the 116th Congress comes to an end with no action at all \u2013 should it do so, it would serve as a way to address the President\u2019s issues and give the two Georgia Republican senators in tight runoffs something to vote for. Even without a vote, the existence of the bill itself would appear to address Trump\u2019s demands from a Sunday statement that the Senate \u201cstart the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230, and starts an investigation into voter fraud.\u201d By introducing the bill and moving to place it on the Senate calendar, McConnell has, technically, started that process. McConnell himself appeared to allude to the very specific language in his earlier Senate floor remarks, noting that the chamber would \u201cbegin a process\u201d to address the President\u2019s demands. Trump, however, has continued to beat the drum on the increased payments on Twitter \u2013 and to attack Republican leaders. \u201cUnless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP,\u201d Trump tweeted.  \u201c$600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don\u2019t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don\u2019t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!\u201d But, as is often a hallmark of Trump\u2019s dealings with Congress, it has remained unclear whether he wants the vote on expanded direct payments as a standalone measure or combined with the other elements. That ambiguity has, in a way, opened the door for McConnell\u2019s legislative offer. Trump lashes out at Republicans after they override his veto Before any action on stimulus payments, McConnell has made clear the priority for the chamber is to stay on track to process the override of Trump\u2019s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act, which failed to include the changes Trump wanted to Section 230. McConnell initially attempted to set that vote for Wednesday, but Sen. Bernie Sanders objected and made clear he would draw the process out unless the Senate held an up-or-down vote on the House-passed stimulus check measure. \u201cThe working class of this country today faces more economic desperation than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s,\u201d said Sanders, a Vermont independent who has been central in the push to increase the size of the direct payments. Sanders, however, can\u2019t stop the NDAA override vote \u2013 only draw it out. And several GOP aides noted that a longer process on the NDAA could aid Republicans who are opposed to the check entirely and want no action taken at all on the direct payments issue before the end of the 116th Congress on Sunday. Earlier Tuesday, McConnell pledged on the Senate floor only that he would \u201cbegin the process\u201d of addressing the issues raised by Trump. He never committed to any votes, on the stimulus checks or anything else. This provides him a pathway should he decide to take it, but nothing is locked in at this point, aides say. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Millions of Americans are on the brink of financial disaster. Many small businesses crushed by the pandemic won\u2019t make it much longer without aid. States and cities are facing the possibility of laying off essential workers as they scramble to put resources into Covid-19 vaccine distribution and education. Hospitals in Covid-19 hotspots are in desperate straits with too many patients and not enough beds. Yet even in the depths of that crisis, members of Congress are still bickering and stalling \u2013 leaving the Capitol on Friday night without striking an agreement on an emergency coronavirus stimulus package to get the economy back on track and narrowly avoiding a government shutdown by passing a two-day extension of funding that will keep agencies running through Sunday night. The consequences of their negligence and indecision if they do not reach a deal within days could be brutal. Some 12 million Americans could lose their jobless benefits on December 26 if Congress fails to act, according to an analysis by The Century Foundation, and many others have already lost those benefits because members didn\u2019t get a deal done months ago when those benefits started running out. Five stark measures show rising American suffering as Congress stalls on aid Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana noted Friday night that the $908 billion package \u201chas been talked about, in a bipartisan way, for about a month now.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s really ridiculous that we can\u2019t give businesses and working families the kind of certainty that they need to be able to be successful, especially during the holiday season,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we tend to business and get it done. The negotiations are going on. But the bottom line is, let\u2019s get a bill, let\u2019s bring to the floor, let\u2019s amend it if we have to, and vote.\u201d One central point of tension in the negotiations is the size of direct payments to working-class Americans, many of whom are facing food insecurity and the possibility of eviction. The deal that took shape this week included $600 payments for individuals. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate who is an independent, is warning that he could try to block the major government spending bill from passing the Senate if members do not approve \u201csubstantial direct payments\u201d for individuals and families affected by the pandemic. Congress under pressure to lock down pandemic relief deal He argued Friday in a floor speech that payments should be $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for families \u2014 and refused to define exactly what amount he would consider \u201csubstantial.\u201d \u201cIf this country means anything, if the US government means anything, it means that we cannot turn our backs on that suffering, and that we cannot leave Washington for the holidays to go back to our families unless we address the pain and anxiety of other families throughout this country,\u201d Sanders said in his speech.   Under normal circumstances, any responsible commander-in-chief witnessing the congressional stalemate would try to intercede to nudge both sides toward a deal. But President Donald Trump has been silent, still obsessed with his election conspiracy theories as he urges his allies to mount a new effort to overturn Biden\u2019s victory on January 6 when Congress ratifies the election results. Trump, who retweeted a mask skeptic this week, was also notably absent on Friday when Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams, publicly took their first shots of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine that was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration last week. The on-camera display by Pence and Adams was praised by medical and public health experts who say that it is important for Americans to see that show of confidence in the vaccine as hesitancy persists in some of America\u2019s hardest-hit communities. President-elect Joe Biden and incoming first lady Jill Biden will be vaccinated Monday in Delaware. But the vaccinations of the nation\u2019s top leaders, including some members of Congress, occurred as the country\u2019s Covid-19 crisis deepened \u2013 with the US hitting a record 114,751 hospitalizations and a record 249,709 new cases Friday. In the midst of those alarming numbers, the FDA authorized the Moderna vaccine for emergency use Friday night \u2013 a welcome development for hospitals that are trying to get as many front-line health workers vaccinated as quickly as possible. Shots of the Moderna vaccine, which could be easier to deliver to hard-to-reach communities because it does not have to be kept at the ultra cold temperatures required for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, could begin going into the arms of Americans next week if a key advisory panel to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the agency itself, sign off this weekend. But those additional Moderna doses will not arrive soon enough to alleviate the havoc that the virus is creating in communities where case numbers are surging out of control, such as Los Angeles County. Dr. Brad Spellberg, the chief medical officer at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California (LAC+USC) Medical Center, warned Friday that \u201chospitals around the county are running out of ICU beds.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting crushed,\u201d Spellberg said during a briefing Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this. We are getting crushed.\u201d States told by federal government they will receive fewer Pfizer vaccine doses next week, sparking confusion There are also puzzling signs of problems within the nation\u2019s vaccine distribution system, an area where members of Congress should be doing troubleshooting if they were not so mired in their own dysfunction. Several governors and state health officials have said they are confused about why they are receiving smaller allotments than expected of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer accused the Trump administration of \u201cslow-walking the process\u201d of getting the addresses to Pfizer of where the vaccine needs to be shipped. \u201cI still cannot get a straight answer out of the Trump administration on why Michigan, like many other states, is receiving a fraction of the vaccines that we were slated to receive,\u201d the Democratic governor told reporters. She added that the delay is \u201ceither corruption or ineptitude that is keeping us from saving lives and protecting people.\u201d Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, also said he was unable to understand the rationale for the smaller vaccine deliveries that the federal government is coordinating with Pfizer. \u201cMany people heard the news yesterday that the federal government announced that smaller quantities of vaccine would be delivered to states, in this first wave \u2013 including Massachusetts,\u201d Baker said Friday. \u201cAt this time, it\u2019s not clear to us why the shipment amounts have been adjusted. \u2026 We\u2019re certainly frustrated that we won\u2019t be receiving the amount that we expected in the first wave.\u201d On Thursday, Pfizer said in a statement that the company is not having any production issues and that \u201cno shipments containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed.\u201d \u201cWe have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses,\u201d Pfizer said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN this week that states will ultimately receive their full allotment but deliveries may be spread over a longer time frame. Despite those hangups, medical experts took a moment at the end of this week to mark the historic nature of the swift authorizations of the first two vaccines in the US and the speed at which they were developed. \u201cBiomedical research and science have given us something that just a decade ago would have seemed unimaginable,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, said during a virtual event with the Duke Initiative for Science & Society Friday. He noted that over the past year the world has been engulfed in one of the most \u201cdestructive pandemics in over a 100 years.\u201d \u201cJust over the past few days, science has allowed us to have a vaccine that when we distribute it to people throughout the country, and hopefully throughout the world,\u201d Fauci said, \u201cwe will crush this outbreak that has really terrorized us for the last 11 months.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A key panel charged with evaluating the first coronavirus vaccine candidate in the US raced against the clock on Thursday in the quest to save American lives \u2013 a stark contrast with the dithering, excuses and appalling lack of action on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are struggling to strike a deal to send emergency pandemic relief to millions of Americans and are again kicking the can down the road with a one-week funding deal the Senate passed Friday afternoon, narrowly avoiding a midnight government shutdown. But the country caught a glimpse of what efficiency and transparency look like during the marathon public hearing Thursday of the US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel, whose members were productive, competent and questioned experts directly without grandstanding. For hours, the group sliced through the incredibly complex issues surrounding the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine \u2013 wrestling with ethical and medical questions about who should get the first doses and when \u2013 capping the day with their historic vote urging the FDA to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. Members of Congress, meanwhile, notched yet another day with no deal on a desperately needed emergency stimulus package intended to help millions of unemployed Americans who are about to careen off a financial cliff when their benefits expire at the end of this month. Many small business owners who have been decimated by Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 particularly those in the restaurant industry \u2013 say they need another round of relief to stay afloat. And a huge question looms about how much vaccine distribution could be slowed in the coming months by Congress\u2019 failure to provide additional aid to state and local governments that are trying to assist providers, combat vaccine skepticism and get the vaccine where it needs to go in the remote corners of each state once it is delivered. Covid-recovering Trump promised top drugs for all -- he's mainly just helped his friends Reflecting the apparent lack of urgency and continued intransigence from the top, both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have shown little indication that they are willing to work together and help the bipartisan group of senators, who are trying to assemble a framework for a Covid-19 relief package. McConnell\u2019s aides have told top staff in both parties that the leader doesn\u2019t see a way to resolve the disagreements over liability provisions in the emergency stimulus package or the requested Covid-19 aid for state and local governments, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reported Thursday. McConnell has said he would like negotiators to drop those two sticking points and pass a more limited package without them \u2013 but Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer say they cannot agree to a scaled-back package when it comes to aid. When Pelosi was asked when she plans to start negotiating directly with McConnell, she replied during a press conference Thursday that it was important to follow \u201cthe normal regular order\u201d and let the committees work out the details of a package before leadership gets involved: \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate the bill all along,\u201d she said. The fact that the people\u2019s representatives in Congress can\u2019t figure out how to strike an agreement on aid to Americans on the brink in the middle of a deadly pandemic is mind-boggling enough. But there were new signs of the utter dysfunction in Congress this week with a series of last-minute holdups to the short-term spending bill that threatened a government shutdown. The Senate ultimately passed the bill, which Trump signed Friday evening and will fund the government through December 18. Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, was standing in the way of a vote on that essential legislation because of his opposition to a provision in a must-pass defense bill, which also passed the Senate Friday. Paul told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Friday morning he would let the stopgap bill pass. He explained his main point had been to delay the defense bill for a day. But there were also objections to the short-term spending measure itself from different corners: a group of conservative senators wanted language to prevent future government shutdowns, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, was demanding the Senate vote on a provision to give Americans $1,200 stimulus checks. Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota accused Sanders of \u201cbasically trying to hijack\u201d the bill that would fund the government through next week \u201cto get the vote he wants on stimulus checks.\u201d While a shutdown likely would have been brief and have occurred over the weekend when many government operations are closed, it would have been a new low in what has already been an unbearable year. Before the Senate voted on the continuing resolution to keep the government funded for one week, Sanders and GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri both made impassioned pleas for the chamber to take further action to provide pandemic relief ahead of the holidays. Sanders said that he would withdraw an objection to the stopgap funding bill Friday to allow the government to remain open, but threatened that he would not do the same next week. \u201cI am not one of the members of the Senate who shuts down \u2026 does this and does that, keeps people here for the weekend. \u2026 I don\u2019t do that. But this I want to say right now, I am prepared to withdraw my objection at this moment. But I will not be prepared to withdraw an objection next week,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders made no apologies for his position in an earlier statement, underscoring that \u201ctens of millions of working-class Americans are facing economic devastation.\u201d \u201cThey have no income, they face eviction, they can\u2019t afford to go to the doctor, and many are unable to adequately feed their kids,\u201d he said in a statement to CNN. \u201cCongress cannot adjourn for the holidays in order to return to our families when so many other families are living in desperation. It is absolutely imperative that we provide $1,200 for every working-class adult and $500 for each of their children.\u201d The Vermont senator noted that level of aid was included in the CARES package approved in March and said Congress should not go home until they address the current crisis.   And like Trump, some members of Congress appear to still be more focused on spreading disinformation about the November election than halting the spread of the coronavirus or delivering relief. More than 125 House Republicans signed on to an amicus brief to support an effort, begun by the Texas attorney general, to invalidate the election results in four battleground states that Trump lost to Biden \u2013 Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The President filed a motion on Wednesday to intervene, and 18 Republican attorneys general are are also backing the effort. At the President\u2019s request, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he would argue the case if the Supreme Court decides to hear it. But even some Republicans from Texas were skeptical. One of them, Rep. Kay Granger, said she does not support the lawsuit and called it \u201ca distraction.\u201d Another, Sen. John Cornyn, told CNN he was struggling to \u201cunderstand the legal theory of it.\u201d But other Republicans, like Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, have been more than happy to support the President\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud. Johnson intends to hold a hearing next week \u201cexamining irregularities in the 2020 election\u201d before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican, has argued that the hearing is inappropriate in the partisan halls of Congress and said he does not know if he will participate. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources to do investigations, nor do we have the constitutional mandate to make judicial decisions,\u201d Romney said Thursday. \u201cThe Justice Department does investigations. The courts do judiciary matters. \u2026 So, I don\u2019t see the purpose of a hearing other than to stir up controversy.\u201d The disconnection between Congress\u2019 inability to compromise and the need for relief across the country was underlined this week by the horrifying hospitalization rates and rising death toll, trends that are expected to continue into the New Year. A day before the FDA advisory panel voted to recommend emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, there were a stunning 3,124 deaths \u2013 a single-day record since the pandemic began \u2013 as the virus continued to race unchecked through urban and rural communities across America. Doctors and nurses are exhausted as hospitalizations surge and states try to recruit more health care workers to help administer the vaccine to everyday Americans next year. And rural and underserved communities are struggling with shortages in volunteer first responders like EMTs and firefighters who assist in getting patients to hospitals for care. The coronavirus model from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation now projects that another half-million Americans will have died from Covid-19 by April 1, a slight improvement from its prediction last week. (The model predicted that the vaccine rollout could save at least 25,000 lives). In the midst of so much grim news, the fast-moving discussions to approve the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine were a rare glimmer of hope on Thursday. The power now rests with the FDA to take the next big step by granting emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, which would allow the first doses to be shipped out across the country. The FDA and its advisory panel will repeat the same process next week when they consider the Moderna vaccine. Before vaccines can actually be injected into Americans\u2019 arms, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must agree to offer it to the American public based on the recommendation of one of their advisory panels. But that chain of events is expected to move quickly this weekend. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, called the FDA advisory panel\u2019s move \u201ca very important step\u201d as the government tries to build trust in the vaccine. \u201cWe want to make sure that we impress the American public that decisions that involve their health and safety are made outside of the realm of politics, outside of the realm of self-aggrandizement, and are made in essence by independent groups,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d Thursday night. President-elect Joe Biden called the FDA advisory committee\u2019s decision \u201ca bright light in a needlessly dark time,\u201d offering his gratitude to the scientists and public health experts \u201cwho evaluated the safety and efficacy of this vaccine free from political influence.\u201d After weeks in which President Donald Trump needlessly delayed the transition between administrations while pursuing his failed court challenges to the election, Biden\u2019s advisers finally met with Operation Warp Speed on Thursday and plan to do so again on Friday. \u201cVaccines don\u2019t equal vaccinations. Our challenge now is to scale up manufacturing and distribution,\u201d Biden said in a statement, adding that he hopes to distribute 100 million shots in the first 100 days of his administration. \u201cWe are putting together an experienced team to do just that,\u201d the President-elect said. \u201cBefore I take office, we need the Trump Administration to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the U.S. population and the world. And, we will need Congress to fund our distribution efforts.\u201d This story has been updated Friday with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "President John F. Kennedy urged Americans to ask not what their country could do for them, but what they could do for their country. When he takes the same oath of office next month, Joe Biden will effectively beseech the nation to do exactly the same thing, if in more prosaic terms, with an appeal for every American to wear a mask for his first, symbolic 100 days in office. The President-elect revealed the galvanizing, altruistic, first national rallying call of his administration in an exclusive CNN interview on Thursday with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, previewing a sharp change of direction when he succeeds President Donald Trump. \u201cJust 100 days to mask, not forever. One hundred days. And I think we\u2019ll see a significant reduction,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, implicitly acknowledging that the coronavirus could be raging at even more intense levels when he takes office than its current alarming spike. Ever since President Franklin Roosevelt took office in the dark days of the Great Depression in 1933, the first 100 days have marked the apex of a new US leader\u2019s power and often the most prolific period for policy wins. During the interview Thursday, Biden referenced the steep challenges Roosevelt confronted when he was first elected, noting that the current circumstances are \u201cnot unlike what happened in 1932.\u201d \u201cThere was a fundamental change, not only taking place here in the United States, but around the world,\u201d Biden told Tapper. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of this fourth industrial revolution,\u201d he noted. With all the changes in technology, he said, Americans are wondering, \u201cWill there be a middle class? What will people be doing? \u2026 There\u2019s genuine, genuine anxiety.\u201d FDR told Americans in his first inaugural address that \u201cthe only thing we have to fear, is fear itself,\u201d steeling a demoralized citizenry to hold firm amid a banking crisis that threatened to destroy an already devastated economy. Biden will take office amid the most extreme domestic circumstances of any president since Roosevelt, with sickness and death rampant and millions of Americans unemployed, hungry or at risk of losing their homes. CNN Exclusive: Biden says he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days he's in office Like his Democratic forbear, he will use the iconic opening moments of his term to summon an exhausted people to unite, in common cause \u2013 with the help of new vaccines \u2013 this time to beat the virus and save the economy. There is a question, however, whether Biden\u2019s calls for national unity will resonate among people who didn\u2019t vote for him after Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on the legitimacy of his victory in the presidential election. But Biden\u2019s call to action may carry greater urgency now that the virus is taking hold in rural areas of the heartland with comparatively rudimentary health care systems, which escaped the first wave of infection that concentrated in many cities that tend to vote for Democrats. Biden\u2019s interview \u2013 his first since the election that also included Harris \u2013 underscored a complete course correction from Trump\u2019s attitude towards the virus. The pandemic has never been worse than it is now in the United States. One American is dying every 30 seconds amid record fatality figures and hospitalizations. Doctors and nurses are exhausted after months inside overflowing under-resourced Covid wards. More than 276,000 people have now died from coronavirus in the United States and the nation set a new record for hospitalizations on Thursday with more than 100,667 people being treated for Covid-19. Yet the current President is ignoring the carnage, as he pursues his fantastical lies and claims the election that he lost by a comfortable margin was stolen. Trump has frequently mocked the wearing of masks. He is holding holiday parties inside the White House in defiance of his own government\u2019s health recommendations. When he returned home after his bout in military hospital with Covid-19 he famously turned to the cameras and ripped off his mask. By contrast, and if past behavior is any guide, it is conceivable that one of Biden\u2019s first acts after delivering his inaugural address in 47 days will be to put his mask back on. Biden said he asked Fauci to stay on and be a chief medical adviser in his administration In another sign of a fresh approach to the pandemic, Biden said in the interview he had asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, who Trump has marginalized and insulted, to continue his current role as the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases specialist in Biden\u2019s administration and announced an effective promotion for the globally respected expert. Fauci told NBC on Friday that he immediately accepted. \u201cI asked him to stay on the exact same role he\u2019s had for the past several presidents, and I asked him to be a chief medical adviser for me as well, and be part of the Covid team,\u201d Biden told Tapper, in a gesture that implies a return to continuity and science based policy-making after Trump\u2019s wild presidency. Biden emphasized that he and Fauci spoke about the fact that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to close down the economy\u201d if Americans are following through with other safety protocols to prevent the spread of the virus. And he noted that even before they spoke, Fauci has been speaking regularly with Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s incoming chief of staff, and the two forged a close working relationship during the Ebola outbreak. The President-elect also said during the interview that he would get the vaccine publicly to show the public his confidence in it. \u201cWhen Dr. Fauci says we have a vaccine that is safe, that\u2019s the moment in which I will stand before the public and say that,\u201d Biden said. People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already the numbers are really staggeringly low, and it matters what the president and vice president do.\u201d Earlier this week, former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all pledged to get the vaccine in public view to help combat vaccine skepticism. Biden said his three predecessors \u201chave set the model as to what should be done.\u201d Capitol Hill talks intensify over Covid-19 relief deal but major sticking points remain The President-elect said it is already clear to him from his conversations with governors across the country, as well as 50 Democratic and Republican mayors, that they will need a significant amount of money to get the vaccine where it needs to go. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get the vaccine delivered \u2013 in cases, some frozen, some not \u2013 and another thing to get the vaccine to move from the case to a vaccination in someone\u2019s arm. That\u2019s the really complicated piece,\u201d Biden said, noting that governors and mayors told him they need far more financial assistance to get the vaccine delivered, which he described as \u201can incredibly expensive proposition.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to hope that the Senate does something and responds to the immediate need to provide dollars. But we\u2019re going to need a lot more\u201d once in office, Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost literally billions of dollars to get this done. We can keep schools open. We can keep businesses open. But you have to be able to get the vaccine distributed.\u201d The President-elect noted that the Trump administration has been \u201ccooperating with us of late\u201d and looping them in on the plans for how they are going to deliver on the vaccine, but he said, \u201cThere\u2019s not any help getting out there.\u201d \u201cLook at all the businesses that are being hurt so badly,\u201d he said. \u201cNo money to help them. Come Christmas time, there\u2019s going to be millions of people see their unemployment run out. So, there\u2019s a whole range of things that have to be done.\u201d Biden called the $900 billion framework for a congressional aid package proposed by a bipartisan group of members \u201ca good start,\u201d but said more aid would be needed and he urged members to focus on what struggling Americans need most.   \u201cWhat\u2019s immediately needed is relief for people in their unemployment checks; relief for people who are going to get thrown out of their apartments after Christmas because they can\u2019t afford to pay the rent anymore; relief on mortgage payments; relief on all the things that are in the original bill the House passed,\u201d Biden said. \u201cPeople are really hurting. They\u2019re scared to death.\u201d Biden\u2019s diametrically different Covid strategy, particularly his call for Americans to mask up in the first 100 days, is already being welcomed by medical experts who are watching in horror as daily Covid deaths soar over 2,500 per day even before the feared escalation in infections following Thanksgiving travel. \u201cPresident-elect Biden, and his leadership and listening to scientists, believe that if we all wore our masks for 100 days, we would have a significant reduction in the transmission of the virus,\u201d said Rick Bright, a former Trump administration vaccine expert who resigned after warning the administration ignored warnings about the early spread of Covid-19. \u201cThe science shows that wearing a face mask reduces the spread. I think it would have a huge impact,\u201d Bright, who now sits on Biden\u2019s coronavirus advisory board, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. Hospitals in California were treating 2,066 patients with Covid-19 in intensive care units, breaking a record for the highest number of Covid cases since the start of the pandemic. California\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom warned that most regions of the state will soon cross the threshold he has set for a three-week stay-at-home order, which is triggered once ICU beds fall to 15% capacity in that region. Harris on her working relationship with Biden: 'We are full partners in this\u00a0process' While Biden and Harris had differences on an array of issues when she was running for president \u2013 from their health care plans to her desire to see the Justice Department prosecute Trump after he leaves office \u2013 she and Biden showed their policy alignment during the interview, which also offered some clues into her role and portfolio as vice president. \u201cWe are full partners in this process,\u201d Harris said. Since the first day Biden asked her to join him on the ticket, she said he has been \u201cvery clear with me that he wants me to be the first and the last in the room\u201d on major decisions. \u201cSo on every issue that impacts the American people, I will be a full partner to the President-elect and the President.\u201d She mirrored Biden\u2019s position, for example, on how the administration would treat any potential investigations into Trump\u2019s conduct after he leaves office, even though it is different than the tone she used toward Trump during her campaign. Biden told Tapper that his Justice Department will operate independently, and that he would not direct them on how or who to investigate: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be saying go prosecute A, B or C \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be telling them,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the role, it\u2019s not my Justice Department it\u2019s the people\u2019s Justice Department.\u201d Harris, a former prosecutor who served as California\u2019s attorney general, echoed that call for independence for the Justice Department, drawing a bright line between the Biden administration\u2019s approach and Trump\u2019s. \u201cWe will not tell the Justice Department how to do its job. And we are going to assume, and I say this as a former attorney general elected in California \u2013 and I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States \u2013 that any decision coming out of the Justice Department, in particular the United States Department of Justice, should be based on facts, it should be based on the law, it should not be influenced by politics, period,\u201d Harris told Tapper. When Tapper asked Harris what her portfolio would be as vice president \u2013 whether she would head a Covid-19 task force, for example, as Vice President Mike Pence has \u2013 Biden interrupted to say he would answer the question. He said he planned to enlist Harris on whatever the most urgent need was at a given moment, much as he did for President Barack Obama as vice president. \u201cWhatever the most urgent need is that I\u2019m not able to attend to, I have confidence in turning to her,\u201d Biden said, noting that was dissimilar from former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s approach, which was to handle an entire issue portfolio like the environment. \u201cLook, there\u2019s not a single decision I\u2019ve made yet about personnel or about how to proceed that I haven\u2019t discussed it with Kamala first.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sitting in an Iowa diner a year ago, candidate Joe Biden aimed his economic agenda at the widening gap between America\u2019s rich and everyone else. \u201cYou have to right the market a little bit,\u201d the former vice president told me. \u201cThe middle class is getting killed.\u201d Within weeks, the coronavirus hit and worsened the toll \u2013 literally and figuratively. That steepens the challenge President-elect Biden faces when he replaces President Donald Trump in January. MAP: See 2020 election results For at least a half century, multiple economic forces have exacerbated disparities within American society. By 2016, a Pew Research Center analysis recently found, the most affluent 5% possessed 248 times the wealth of the least affluent 40%. Wealth improves health; on average, the richest 1% of Americans live more than 10 years longer than the poorest 1%, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found. Covid has deepened both dismal grooves. Blacks and Hispanics, who lag behind Whites in wealth and income, die from the virus more than five times as often, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The economic dislocations of the pandemic have largely spared more affluent Americans. Buoyant financial markets and home values have protected their wealth, and their ability to work from home has protected their jobs. Low-paid service workers, by contrast, have been devastated. Many of those who have been lucky enough to avoid being laid off must report to job sites as \u201cessential workers,\u201d heightening their risk of exposure. Others have faced layoffs due to plummeting demand, and the prospect of permanent job loss from sectors such as leisure travel or in-person retailing that won\u2019t recover soon if ever. While higher-wage employment has risen back to pre-pandemic levels, the number of jobs paying $27,000 or less remains down 19%, according to Harvard\u2019s Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker. \u201cFor people who can work remotely, all this is slightly inconvenient,\u201d observed Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist David Autor. \u201cFor many others, they\u2019re going to have to change their livelihoods.\u201d Responding to all this won\u2019t require Biden to rewrite the economic plans he\u2019d already developed, because of who they were always intended to help. \u201cThe agenda was really crafted with the core insight in mind that a lot of people have been left behind for a long time,\u201d noted longtime Biden economic adviser Jared Bernstein. In the name of rebalancing for fairness and equity, his campaign proposed trillions in tax increases on the affluent to finance trillions in spending on health care, infrastructure, education and other programs. But Covid raises the stakes for getting his proposals enacted, and suggests subtle shifts of emphasis. For example, higher minimum wages work best in tight labor markets. So elevated unemployment has diminished the urgency of Biden\u2019s call for doubling the federal minimum to $15, according to Autor. Will your taxes go up under Biden? It's unlikely Yet pushing any tax increases through Congress will be difficult, especially if Republicans keep control of the Senate after Georgia\u2019s runoff elections in January. But Biden\u2019s proposed payroll tax hike on incomes over $400,000 has grown more important. That\u2019s because a significant number of older Americans who\u2019ve lost jobs are expected seek Social Security earlier than previously planned, adding new strains to the program\u2019s finances. Workers cast off by suddenly declining industries face a more immediate need for the job training upgrades Biden has proposed. Those responsible for young children and aging parents have grown more desperate for the kind of help Biden\u2019s proposed caregiving subsidies would provide. The inadequacy of virtual learning required by Covid elevates the importance of his higher proposed school funding levels. Without remedial education programs, low-income families less able to compensate with technology or tutoring will fall farther behind than they already are. \u201cThe learning deficits are going to be so deep we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever be able to overcome them,\u201d said Melissa Kearney, a University of Maryland economics professor who specializes in inequality. \u201cI want to be an optimistic person, but I am so disheartened at this moment.\u201d One source of her discouragement: the inability of the lame-duck Congress and Trump White House to agree on a new Covid-relief package, which Republicans and Democrats alike call necessary. Without year-end action, millions face impoverishment from expiring unemployment benefits, eviction from their homes and business failures. The stalemate augurs poorly for passing a major new economic stimulus once Biden and the new Congress take office in 2021. Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody\u2019s, calls a large infrastructure program, to help stave off a backslide into recession, the most potent single step the new president could take to reduce economic disparities. Key pandemic relief programs are set to expire at the end of the year. No one knows what's next. Democrats say Biden can make some progress without Congress, including possible executive action to relieve some student loan debts. His expected choice for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, is a labor market expert deeply familiar with fiscal and monetary tools from her past work as Federal Reserve chair and a Clinton White House economist. Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain brings expertise in pandemics from his work overseeing President Barack Obama\u2019s successful response to Ebola. Taming the coronavirus would at least help the new administration prevent economic disparities from widening any further. A year later, that issue remains Biden\u2019s target. \u201cThe middle-class and working-class people are being crushed,\u201d the President-elect told NBC last week. \u201cThat\u2019s my focus.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Even before Joe Biden won the presidency earlier this month, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren made clear that she wanted to be Treasury secretary in his administration. As Politico reported in late October: \u201cElizabeth Warren wants to be Joe Biden\u2019s Treasury secretary and will make her case for it if he wins next week, according to three Democratic officials who have spoken with her inner circle. \u2018She wants it,\u2019 two of them said matter-of-factly.\u201d On Monday, it became clear: Warren would not be Biden\u2019s pick to be Treasury secretary. Instead, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will get the nod. The truth of the matter is that Warren was never going to be Biden\u2019s pick for Treasury secretary \u2013 for four big reasons. 1) Warren in the Cabinet would allow Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to appoint a temporary replacement for her in the Senate. While the seat would eventually be filled in a special election, Democrats are still haunted by what happened following the death of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy in 2009. The 2010 special election to replace Kennedy was won, stunningly, by Republican Scott Brown. Brown lost in 2012 to Warren. While Massachusetts is a comfortably Democratic state, Biden was never going to allow a Democratic seat to go Republican \u2013 even for a few months \u2013 given the narrow partisan divide in the Senate. 2) Warren\u2019s vision for big structural change doesn\u2019t fit Biden\u2019s pragmatic approach. Biden and Warren have radically different political DNA. Biden is an institutionalist who believes in deal-making with the other side. Warren is an ideologue who has advocated, throughout her life in and out of politics, for large-scale change of big institutions.  When Warren and Biden were running against one another in the Democratic primary, she bashed him for \u201crepeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies,\u201d for his opposition to a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan. He fought back by dismissing her views as \u201can elitism that working- and middle-class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing.\u2019\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 3) Warren would have spooked Wall Street. While Warren backers believe the fear she instilled in the heart of Wall Street executives was her biggest strength for the Treasury job, Biden and his team didn\u2019t see things that way. Over the summer, former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, who had been a past advocate for Warren in other jobs, told CNN Business that it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d for Biden to put her at Treasury. \u201cThe financial institutions are very negative about her, unfairly in the degree they are,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIf you have someone who is that much opposed by the people being regulated, it doesn\u2019t work smoothly.\u201d The Biden team has little interest in scaring Wall Street at this moment \u2013 when coronavirus has decimated the American economy and the road to recovery seems long and difficult. 4) Warren might not get confirmed by the Senate. Republicans currently control the Senate majority at the moment \u2013 pending two runoffs in Georgia. Unless Democrats sweep both of those races, Biden\u2019s Cabinet picks will need at least one or two Republican votes to be confirmed. It\u2019s not at all clear that Warren, as the Treasury nominee, would have been able to convince even a single Republican to confirm her. And it\u2019s possible she might not have been able to depend on unanimous support from Democrats either; West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has been critical of her liberal worldview in the past. The push by progressives for Biden to consider Warren for Treasury then was always a pipe dream. No one in Bidenworld shot it down because, well, what was the point other than to make liberals mad? But if you think Warren was ever under serious consideration for the job Yellen got, then you don\u2019t know Joe.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated since an initial version was published in 2015. The 2020 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is perhaps the craziest, most controversial election in US history. We say perhaps because we don\u2019t want to bog you down with superlatives when there have been so many truly zany moments in American elections. Who could forget Howard Dean screaming like he\u2019d lost a limb, or Rick Perry forgetting one of the three federal agencies he\u2019d cut if elected? Then there\u2019s the bevy of oh-so-colorful characters, from Jello Biafra, Joan Jett Blakk and Wavy Gravy to Lee Mercer, Jack Shepard and Lyndon LaRouche. Did we mention Deez Nuts? To say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn\u2019t objective. Sure, Trump has claimed victory despite Biden\u2019s projected win, questioned the voting system\u2019s integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than Congress picking a president? That\u2019s happened a few times. We\u2019ll let you decide. So, without any superlatives, here are 11 fascinating elections in American history: The outcome of the 1800 contest between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams was so bizarre, the United States had to amend the Constitution. Pre-12th Amendment, Electoral College members each had two votes for president, and there were no official tickets. Whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency. Though problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw Jefferson tie with his Democratic-Republican \u201crunning mate\u201d Aaron Burr. Both had 73 votes to Adams\u2019 65. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Hamilton Congress would be called upon to break the tie. Enter Alexander Hamilton, the nation\u2019s first treasury secretary, founder of the Federalist Party and a man who did not care for Adams, Jefferson or Burr. Nonetheless, Hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the Federalists to vote for Jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that \u201cMr. Burr loves nothing but himself \u2013 thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\u201d The House of Representatives didn\u2019t easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name Jefferson the victor and Burr the veep on February 7, 1801. Making the election all the zanier, the rivalry between Burr and Hamilton would continue for more than three years before Burr, still the sitting vice president, killed Hamilton in a duel. This one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the Federalist Party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were Democratic-Republicans. Andrew Jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 Electoral College votes. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams secured 84, Treasury Secretary William Crawford won 41 and House Speaker Henry Clay had 37. With no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the House again had to settle the deadlock, and Jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and Electoral College. Because the House could choose among only three candidates, Clay got the boot. Presidential Places: Andrew Jackson's Hermitage We mentioned Clay was speaker, yes? Well, after a month of horse trading, many of Clay\u2019s supporters shifted their support to Adams, who would go on to win the majority of the House vote. Maryland, Illinois and Louisiana, which had cast most of their Electoral College votes for Jackson, as well as Kentucky, where Adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back Adams. After his inauguration, Adams selected Clay as his secretary of state. Jackson was furious and accused Adams and Clay of a \u201ccorrupt bargain.\u201d He vacated his Senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a Washington outsider. Backed by his new party, the Democrats, Jackson made good on the promise, besting Adams, who by then was a leader in the National Republican Party. This election wasn\u2019t particularly close. Abraham Lincoln trounced John Breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time. No, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant Democratic Party \u2013 and thereby, the nation \u2013 in half. The Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all U.S. territories, had laid the battleground: The Republican Party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the Democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery. An actor, a president and the crime of the 19th century At a second convention that year, the Democrats nominated Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, but many Southerners in the party defected and selected Breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. Both would claim to be the official Democratic candidate. The Constitutional Union Party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected Sen. John Bell of Tennessee. The Electoral College vote told the story. Lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College took most of the North, along with California and Oregon. Douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only Missouri (and three votes in New Jersey). Breckinridge took most of the South, along with Maryland and Delaware, and Bell\u2019s middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Weeks after the election, South Carolina voted to secede, followed by six more Southern states. In February 1861, delegates from those states formed the Confederate States of America and selected Jefferson Davis as their president. In April, a South Carolina militia would take Fort Sumter, and four more states would join the Confederacy. Set aside that 1872 was the year suffragette Victoria Woodhull of the People\u2019s Party became the first woman to run for president. Also, forget that writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, her running mate, was the first African-American to be considered for the vice presidency. And never mind this was the year Susan B. Anthony would be arrested for illegal voting. No, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final Electoral College vote. Horace Greeley wasn\u2019t supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat President Ulysses S. Grant, but a schism in Grant\u2019s Republican Party made things a little more interesting. Grant, who led the Union armies that defeated the Confederacy, had not been so convincing in the Oval Office. The White House website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his \u201cpuzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\u201d Some Republicans defected, becoming Liberal Republicans, and cast their lot with Greeley, a Democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election. Before the Electoral College could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died November 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among Thomas Hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other Democrats. Grant attended his rival\u2019s funeral. Democrat Samuel Tilden had beaten Republican Rutherford Hayes. He snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the Electoral College. Problem was, Tilden was one Electoral College vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes \u2013 Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon \u2013 were disputing the results. In the Southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud. With no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and an independent. The independent, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the Illinois Legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was replaced by Justice Joseph Bradley, a diehard Republican who would cast every vote for Hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority. Democrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if Hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the South under Reconstruction. Hayes was sworn in March 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. Reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress African Americans had made. It would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in Congress. It was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn\u2019t terribly exciting. Republican Warren G. Harding handed Democrat James Cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states. Third place is where it got interesting. Long before Bernie Sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the Socialist Party of America enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. That union leader Eugene Debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots. In 1920, though, Debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison. No stranger to incarceration \u2013 he\u2019d served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike \u2013 Debs again drew the government\u2019s ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he pilloried \u201cthe ruling class\u201d who made all the decisions to send the working class to war. \u201cYours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die,\u201d he said. He was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the May Day riots of 1919, and Debs was later moved to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign. He would again secure more than 900,000 votes \u2013 an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with Harding, who snared more than 16 million. The following year, on Christmas, Harding commuted Debs\u2019 sentence to time served. President Harry S. Truman was done before the election began. You could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. The election was New York Gov. Thomas Dewey\u2019s. Period. The 1946 midterms had handed both houses to Republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three Americans approved of Truman\u2019s handling of the presidency. Making matters worse, Truman\u2019s commerce secretary, Henry Wallace, had revolted over the administration\u2019s foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate. Southern Democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the States\u2019 Rights Party \u2013 aka the Dixiecrats \u2013 and electing segregationist South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond as their candidate. The final pre-election Gallup poll \u2013 interestingly, taken in mid-October and not released until the day before Election Day \u2013 showed Dewey beating Truman by 5 percentage points. Even on Election Day, Truman recalled an NBC report predicting he would lose. It wasn\u2019t until 4 a.m. that his Secret Service agents woke him to say he had won. The Chicago Daily Tribune had referred to Truman as a \u201cnincompoop\u201d on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. Poetically, a printers\u2019 strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and Publisher J. Loy Maloney took the pollsters\u2019 word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history. \u201cDewey defeats Truman.\u201d John F. Kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. He was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. He was also the first Catholic president. The contest between Kennedy and Richard Nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into American living rooms. This was important to the vote\u2019s outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the American household. Eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950. Nixon had recently been hospitalized. He refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. He had a 5 o\u2019clock shadow. He wore a gray suit that blended into the background. His appearance left much to be desired, historians would note. Kennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. Unlike Nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent. Debates enter the TV age The estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on September 26, 1960, felt Kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt Nixon was the victor. On November 8, Kennedy edged out Nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million). Though it\u2019s arguable that the debate alone won Kennedy the election (he also secured the African-American vote by offering his assistance in getting the Rev. Martin Luther Jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns. Televised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate. This is the election that brought us the \u201cDaisy\u201d ad \u2013 an attempt to paint Republican Barry Goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The ad remains haunting even amid today\u2019s supercharged mudslinging. The summer of 1964 brought the Civil Rights Act. Angry Whites protested the legislation across the South, while Blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and other cities. The stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether Goldwater or President Lyndon Johnson was a more capable commander in chief. Race would not only shape 1964\u2019s ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come. The civil rights movement in photos Alabama\u2019s fiery segregationist Gov. George Wallace took on Johnson for the Democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that \u201cwhite backlash\u201d against the Civil Rights Act was a Southern thing, Wallace received more than 30% of the vote in Wisconsin and Indiana and more than 40% in Maryland in the primaries. Wallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both Goldwater and Johnson substantial concerns. Goldwater feared Wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and Johnson worried about Wallace\u2019s strong showing in non-Southern states. While Goldwater, who had cast his vote against the Civil Rights Act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, Johnson tried to please everyone. That was most evident when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Black activists organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because Mississippi had run a segregated primary. Johnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. He would later anger many in the South by selecting Hubert Humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate. Johnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. Goldwater won only his home state of Arizona and Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. Republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the South to this day. It happened in a hasty two-minute phone call. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota had just won the Democratic nomination for president and phoned Sen. Thomas Eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. Several high-profile Democrats had declined to join McGovern on the ticket, so he picked Eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the Catholic vote. To say Eagleton didn\u2019t undergo the intense vetting of, say, Sarah Palin or Paul Ryan would be an understatement. 2012: A look at the life of George McGovern Had McGovern grilled Eagleton according to today\u2019s standards, he might\u2019ve learned Eagleton\u2019s secret: that the senator from Missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions. When rumors first began to surface, McGovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that Eagleton posed a liability. During a news conference at a South Dakota state park, where McGovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, Eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to McGovern. On August 1 \u2013 18 days after he was selected \u2013 Eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign. Richard Nixon would go on to obliterate McGovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the Democrat by about 18 million votes \u2013 thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket. It all came down to Florida, and if you think that \u201cDewey defeats Truman\u201d headline was nuts, the 2000 presidential election was pure bonkers. Vying for the deciding 25 Electoral College votes were Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose brother was Florida\u2019s governor, and Vice President Al Gore. Some networks called the race for Gore, others Bush. Some flipped. Gore called Bush to concede \u2013 only to call back and say never mind. So, who really won? What the Bush v. Gore studies showed The day after voting, the Florida Division of Elections said Bush had won by 1,784 ballots, though CNN had pegged it at fewer than 1,000. A recount two days later winnowed it down to 327 votes \u2013 out of almost 6 million cast. At issue were Florida\u2019s punch-hole ballots, and while hanging chads \u2013 punched holes that still had a corner intact \u2013 dominated headlines, pregnant or dimpled chads, which were indented but still attached, also came into play. Lawyers, like locusts, descended on the Sunshine State as Bush\u2019s legal team sought to head off any potential recount. Led by James Baker \u2013 a Cabinet member and chief of staff to Ronald Reagan and Bush\u2019s father \u2013 the team also included Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts, who now serve on the US Supreme Court. On November 21, the Florida Supreme Court ordered manual recounts in four counties, including the state\u2019s most populous, Miami-Dade. Protesters \u2013 which The Wall Street Journal described as \u201c50-year-old White lawyers with cell phones and Hermes ties\u201d \u2013 descended on the Miami recount headquarters in what became known as the Brooks Brothers Riot. They wanted the recount shut down, and eventually, it was. Bush v. Gore: The Final Hours Baker and his team never wanted the race decided in a state whose courts were dominated by Democrats, and on December 9 the US Supreme Court issued a stay on the Florida high court\u2019s decision to recount tens of thousands of ballots. By a 5-4 margin along ideological lines, SCOTUS ruled a previous certification by the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state could stand, propelling Bush to the 271 votes he needed to assume the Oval Office. The decision came 36 days after the election. Dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens wrote, \u201cAlthough we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year\u2019s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation\u2019s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\u201d Subsequent reviews by news outlets and other organizations were less than illuminating, yielding myriad scenarios ranging from Gore winning by 332 votes to Bush winning by 1,665. The consensus was that Bush would have won the statewide recount ordered by Florida\u2019s Supreme Court, while Gore would have won a recount of all disputed ballots \u2013 had his team ever requested one.",

            "article_content": "Rebecca Spoor was too young to vote in the general election. The 17-year-old Georgian thought she would have to wait until the next election cycle to cast her first ballot. But now, with her state\u2019s runoff elections on the horizon, Spoor, who turns 18 on January 3, is excited to become a first-time voter much sooner. While Election Day has come and gone, the races for Georgia\u2019s US Senate seats are headed to runoffs since none of the candidates received a majority of the vote in November. Voters will go to the polls once again on January 5. The fate of the Senate majority hinges on whichever party wins in the runoffs, and Democrats are hoping to flip the seats so Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to break ties in the upper chamber. With that at stake, groups that had made a concerted effort to turn out young voters for the general election are eager to rally even more in the coming months. Under Georgia law, people must be at least 17-and-a-half years old to register and 18 to vote, which means that voters who will turn 18 by January 5 can register to vote in the runoffs. The deadline to register is December 7. Loeffler unleashes onslaught against Warnock in Georgia race for Senate control \u201cThroughout the past four years, I\u2019ve developed more of a voice to speak up against what I think is right and to push for a fight for human rights. I\u2019ve always known I wasn\u2019t going to be able to vote, but it still bummed me out. I wanted to contribute to this election to fight for the LGBTQ+ community and also for BIPOC,\u201d Spoor told CNN. \u201cFinding out that Georgia was going to have a runoff election excited me,\u201d said Spoor, who registered to vote on Monday. \u201c\u2026 My voice has more power now that I can actually vote.\u201d March For Our Lives Georgia is now looking to register as many soon-to-be 18-year-olds as possible and reengage other young people who voted on Election Day. Georgia election results and maps Mina Turabi, the group\u2019s Georgia state director, said March For Our Lives Georgia will take to social media to encourage young people to register to vote. The group also will encourage all eligible voters to participate in the runoffs, emphasizing the critical role they believe young people can play in determining the outcome. The nonpartisan organization will use social media to highlight the candidates and their positions based on survey questions the organization sent the candidates in September. According to Turabi, March For Our Lives Georgia will drop postcards with similar information on college campuses around the metro Atlanta area, including Georgia State University, University of Georgia, Emory University and Georgia Tech. Turabi said the organization plans to place the postcards in high-traffic areas for students such as Jittery Joes, the popular on-campus coffee shop at the University of Georgia. The organization is encouraging its members to share information about the runoffs with their classes, whether it be on video calls or in person, taking two minutes at the end of class to talk about the elections or to drop a voter registration link into their class chats. \u201cThis is a new voter pool and, frankly, these voters or soon-to-be-voters are ready for change,\u201d Turabi said. Early voting begins for the general election runoff for federal offices in Georgia on December 14. Citing Georgia\u2019s history with voter suppression, the group is encouraging young people in the state to vote early. \u201cMomentum and progression\u201d are at stake in the runoffs, Turabi said. When We All Vote, the nonpartisan voter-engagement organization started by former first lady Michelle Obama, is also ramping up its efforts in the state ahead of the runoffs. When We All Vote has \u201cMy School Votes\u201d programs in high schools across the metro Atlanta area, including in Atlanta and DeKalb and Clayton counties. The group says it will encourage students to participate in the runoffs by voting themselves if they are of age or encouraging others to vote if they are not. Democratic energy in Georgia is high leading into the state\u2019s federal runoffs, following President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s projected victory in the state. In the lead-up to the general election, groups like Fair Fight Action, the voting rights organization started by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams,  made a concerted effort to expand the electorate. Some young organizers in Georgia believe young voters of color played an important role in boosting the Democratic vote share in the state. According to CNN\u2019s national exit polls, young voters of color broke hard for Biden in Georgia, while their White counterparts were more loyal to Trump. While Black voters in Georgia ages 18-29 supported Biden over Trump by 76% to 23% and Latino voters in Georgia ages 18-29 supported Biden over Trump by 74% to 25%, White voters in Georgia ages 18-29 supported Trump over Biden by 60% to 38%. Young Americans and White college-educated voters flock to Biden in several battleground states, CNN exit polls show \u201cGeorgia is historically a very red state. We\u2019re not our parents, we\u2019re not our grandparents and we\u2019re thinking a different way. We realize the power our votes have,\u201d Turabi told CNN. Ethan Asher, 18, an organizer with the Future Coalition, a national network of youth-led organizations and leaders, says he \u201ccould not be happier\u201d about the energy from young people in Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to see the changing geopolitical climate of the state over the past decade and it\u2019s really fueling us,\u201d he said. He said his interest in activism came in part because of the late Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic Georgia icon whose own civil rights work began when he was a teen. \u201cWe went from learning about the \u2018war of northern aggression\u2019 to now seeing Georgia flip blue.\u201d Asher and Sophia Woodrow, also 18 and an organizer with the Future Coalition, are teaming up with other young organizers in the state, including March For Our Lives Georgia and the Georgia Youth Poll Worker Project, to build on the momentum from young people and channel it into the runoffs. The Georgia Youth Poll Workers Project, an initiative started by Evan Malbrough, 22, a recent graduate of Georgia State University, convened 1,000 poll workers  ages 18-25 to work the polls in the general election. In the next three weeks, Malbrough said, his group is planning a holiday-themed voter registration event for high schoolers and working with schools across seven counties in the metro Atlanta area. Asher said he\u2019s excited to create \u201cVoting Atlanta Santa\u201d Christmas sweaters with Malbrough for the event. The young organizers will be holding get-out-the-vote weekends between now and January 5, phone banking, text banking and encouraging young Georgians to \u201cget their peaches to the polls,\u201d Asher told CNN, a play on the state fruit. Malbrough wasn\u2019t initially expecting to expand his poll worker initiative, but now, he said, he wants to build on his prior success. \u201cWe aren\u2019t planning to stop after the runoff,\u201d Malbrough said. \u201cWe want to be a full-fledged poll worker recruiter station for young people in Georgia.\u201d And for its part, Sunrise Movement, the progressive youth-led climate organization that gained prominence while advocating for the Green New Deal, will once again mobilize its Georgia hubs, Shant\u00e9 Wolfe, Sunrise\u2019s coordinate campaigns director, told CNN. Sunrise will canvass for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who are challenging the GOP incumbents in the runoffs. \u201cOur Atlanta area hubs will be doing Covid-friendly neighborhood canvassing in addition to political education and training to address the uptick in White youth voters casting ballots for Trump in Georgia,\u201d Wolfe told CNN. \u201cGeorgia is key to taking back our Senate, and we look forward to standing alongside leaders that have been laying the framework for the moment we are now in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Top Donald Trump campaign and White House officials continue to baselessly assert there was widespread election fraud in the 2020 election and refuse to acknowledge President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory, but four years ago, those close to Trump mocked Democrats who didn\u2019t accept his victory as \u201csore losers.\u201d In 2016, Trump\u2019s allies routinely attacked recount efforts that they said were \u201cbased on no evidence\u201d and were designed to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d his 2016 victory. They also commended President Barack Obama and administration officials for accepting the results of the election. The comments were made in response to protests against Trump\u2019s victory, recount efforts sponsored by the Green Party and candidate Jill Stein, and efforts to persuade Electoral College voters to vote against Trump. \u201cYou have people trying to delegitimize the President-elect of the United States right now,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, then a CNN contributor, said in November 2016. \u201cYou have people out there that are calling for recounts that are unsubstantiated based on no evidence.\u201d   In one instance, Rudy Giuliani, who is today leading the charge to challenge the election results, called protesters against Trump\u2019s election \u201ca bunch of spoiled crybabies,\u201d and added it was \u201creally not the right thing in a democracy.\u201d Matt Schlapp, a top Trump ally who has pushed baseless claims of voter fraud, said on Fox Business Clinton was on a \u201csore loser tour,\u201d saying, \u201cShe needs to get over it. She lost. Get out of the way and let Donald Trump be President.\u201d Clinton conceded the 2016 election to Trump on the morning after the election. And, Jason Miller, another Trump spokesman, called recount efforts in 2016 \u201cridiculous\u201d and attempts to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d Trump\u2019s victory. See 2020 election results Many of those same allies are now bolstering Trump\u2019s baseless and dangerous claim that the election is being stolen out from under him, despite no evidence of widespread voting fraud. The aides continue to feed into Trump\u2019s delusion about winning the election and continue to work on his behalf to file longshot legal and recount efforts, despite a widening vote count in key battleground states in favor of Biden. CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed statements from officials and allies. Here\u2019s what they said in 2016: Conway, now the President\u2019s adviser and then-campaign manager, hit Democrats over recount efforts when speaking with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in late November 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s a respect there. And there is a respect for the process and the peaceful transition of power, which is why this recount by Jill Stein and now the Hillary (Clinton) people just is so confounding and disappointing. Their president, Barack Obama, is going to be in office for eight more weeks,\u201d Conway said. \u201cThey have to decide whether they\u2019re going to interfere with him finishing his business, interfere with the peaceful transition, transfer of power to President-elect Trump and Vice-President-elect Pence, or if they\u2019re going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers about an election they can\u2019t turn around.\u201d Speaking on Hannity several days later, Conway said Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t accept the election results.\u201d She had previously called those protesting Trump\u2019s win \u201ccry babies\u201d and \u201cprecious snowflakes,\u201d in a November appearance on \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine.\u201d McEnany attacked people who called for recount efforts as trying to delegitimize the President-elect on CNN Tonight in late November 2016. \u201cYou have people trying to delegitimize the President-elect of the United States right now,\u201d McEnany said, adding that Trump won the Electoral College. \u201cYou have people out there that are calling for recounts that are unsubstantiated based on no evidence.\u201d On the same day, McEnany commended Obama for accepting the results of the 2016 election and working with President-elect Trump during the transition, even calling Obama a \u201chero.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re commending the people who have put feelings aside and done what\u2019s for the betterment of the country and that\u2019s President Obama,\u201d she said. \u201cWho put out a statement when this all was going on saying, \u2018Look, we believe the vote represents the voice of the American people.\u2019 And he has acted like a gracious, really hero in all of this, the way he\u2019s accepted this and moved on.\u201d In December 2016, McEnany said it was \u201cinexcusable\u201d to \u201cquestion the legitimacy of the election\u201d after Obama said there was no widespread fraud, and it was a legitimate election. Speaking on Fox Business Network in December 2016, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, attacked Democrats trying to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cNews flash for many of the partisan Democrats and those in the mainstream media who continue to try to delegitimize President-elect Trump\u2019s massive and historic win last month \u2013 the election\u2019s over. Hillary Clinton lost,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNow, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence are focused on going to work for the American people.\u201d \u201cAnd whether it was this nonsense about the recount or nonsense about the popular vote, you have to win 270 electoral votes to be elected president and President-elect Trump actually got 306,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is all really just an effort to try to delegitimize the win.\u201d In November, Miller told reporters on a conference call that the recount effort was \u201cridiculous\u201d and no chance of overturning the election results. \u201cI really do think it\u2019s ridiculous that so much oxygen has been given to the recount effort when there\u2019s absolutely no chance of any election results changing. This election\u2019s been decided,\u201d Miller said. The former New York City mayor and personal attorney to Trump called anti-Trump protesters \u201ca bunch of spoiled crybabies\u201d in November 2016 after Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThe reality is they are a bunch of spoiled crybabies. And \u2013 and somebody said \u2013 I think I heard somebody said we\u2019re bringing up a generation of spoiled crybabies. Most of the kids aren\u2019t crying. Most of the kids are going to class,\u201d he said on Fox News. On ABC News, Giuliani later called on Obama and Clinton to \u201csay something about this\u201d to anti-Trump protesters because it is \u201creally not the right thing in a democracy.\u201d He further suggested that some might be \u201cprofessional protesters.\u201d Schlapp, the Trump ally who is chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in early December 2016 on Fox Business that Clinton was on her \u201csore loser tour\u201d and that she needed to \u201cget out of the way\u201d to allow Trump to become president. \u201cHillary is on her sore loser tour. It started at Harvard where the Hillary campaign blamed everybody for Hillary\u2019s lost. And now we have her going through recounts. You know what she needs to do? She needs to get over it. She lost. Get out of the way and let Donald Trump be President,\u201d Schlapp said. Clinton conceded the 2016 election to Trump on election night and delivered a concession speech the following day. Guilfoyle, then a Fox News-host and now a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, criticized people protesting the election results just days after the 2016 election. \u201cThis is America. We live in a democracy. Everybody, when they woke up in the morning, was registered to vote, could go choose. So how about respecting the majority that also live here, and their vote should count,\u201d Guilfoyle said on Fox News. She then mocked \u201cthis intellectual, pseudo-intellectual minority of people that didn\u2019t support him\u201d for protesting and believing \u201ctheir vote should count more than everybody else who went out there?\u201d \u201cThat makes no sense to me. Give somebody a chance,\u201d she said. As the national spokesperson for the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign and now a senior adviser to his 2020 campaign, Pierson attacked any recount efforts in the 2016 election. In November 2016, she tweeted, \u201cRecount Ridiculousness!  A generation of sore losers whines for a do-over.\u201d On a Fox News appearance in late November 2016, Pierson called a recount effort from Stein \u201csinister\u201d and \u201csuspect\u201d because Stein was \u201cnowhere close to even winning in any of these states.\u201d Schlapp, who is now a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said on Fox Business in December 2016 that Democrats couldn\u2019t accept Trump\u2019s victory and were throwing a \u201ctantrum.\u201d \u201cI have to tell you, I believe the Democrats are behaving like the Grinch of Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating group of these Democrats who can\u2019t seem to realize that it is time to move on. It is time to accept the fact that Trump will be the next President of the United States,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd one of the key points of stability in our nation\u2026 is ensuring that we have a peaceful transition of power. And that at some point, Trump is pushing for this message of unity for all Americans. And unfortunately, the Democrats, they just want to throw a tantrum, which I think is hurtful for their party.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden addressed a deeply divided nation Saturday night, turning to the challenges ahead by grounding his victory speech in the spirit of compromise, asking supporters of President Donald Trump to give him a chance, and calling on all Americans to turn the page from what he described as a \u201cgrim era of demonization.\u201d Biden made that plea for unity and understanding in his home town of Wilmington, Delaware, at an extraordinary moment in American history when the current occupant of the White House showed no indication that he plans to concede to his rival and continued to push the fiction on Twitter that he had won the election, while making baseless accusations about how the election was stolen from him. After jogging on stage wearing a mask, Biden repeated his promise that he would seek to unify rather than divide. He pledged to govern by the creed that he does not see blue states and red states, but only the United States. When the campaign started nearly two years ago, it would have been extraordinary to think that Americans would show up to a victory rally wearing masks. The fact that they had to, and at a drive-in event outside in November, was a reminder of the moment of national extremis that Biden and Harris will inherit in January. Cities erupt in celebration after Biden named winner Biden noted that he sought the nation\u2019s highest office \u201cto rebuild the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class and to make America respected around the world again.\u201d He acknowledged how Black voters carried him across the finish line both in the primary and then again in the general election by increasing turnout in key battleground states. But it was Biden\u2019s entreaties to Trump voters, who also turned out in huge numbers on Election Day, that were the most striking as he faces the daunting task of governing in a sharply polarized nation. \u201cFor all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment tonight. I\u2019ve lost a couple of times myself. But now, let\u2019s give each other a chance,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies.\u201d Alluding to scripture, he added: \u201cThis is the time to heal in America.\u201d The speech marked the time-honored pivot between a hard-fought campaign and the calls for unity that are traditional after an acrimonious election. It also epitomized the perceptible start of the process of shifting of power to a newly elected president from a defeated one, who scorned tradition at every turn. And it was a rare moment in the last five years that Trump was not the dominant figure seizing the attention on the national political stage. Cognizant of the historical import of the moment, the Biden campaign opened the event by having Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduce her running mate. Harris will be the first woman \u2013 and the first woman of color \u2013 to serve as vice president. Invoking the legacy of the late Georgia Congressman John Lewis, Harris praised the campaign\u2019s supporters for turning out in record numbers at a time when \u201cour very democracy was on the ballot in this election,\u201d and said they had chosen hope, science and truth by selecting Biden as the next president. Harris bursts through another barrier, becoming the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president-elect She also credited Biden for having the \u201caudacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president.\u201d \u201cWhile I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last, because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\u201d \u201cAnd to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they\u2019ve never seen it before. And we will applaud you every step of the way.\u201d On Saturday, jubilant celebrations erupted in big cities across America, with supporters pouring into the streets \u2013 shouting, chanting, singing, dancing and waving flags as drivers honked their horns \u2013 to mark the victory and the end of Trump\u2019s presidency. The celebrations began near the White House on Saturday while Trump was golfing in Virginia \u2013 forcing the smoldering President to wind his way back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in his motorcade through those crowds after hitting the links. There was no sign that Trump would extend the traditional invitation for a White House visit to the President-elect as he continues to falsely maintain that the election was stolen from him. While Trump has yet to give any public sign he\u2019s prepared to relinquish power, Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, has approached him about conceding the election, two sources tell CNN. First lady Melania Trump has also advised the President that the time has come for him to accept the election loss, a source familiar with the conversations told CNN on Sunday. Trump has not denied the outcome of the election, privately at least, sources tell CNN, and he returned to the golf course Sunday. But he\u2019s continuing to push his attorneys to pursue legal challenges that would delay formal certification of the results. Chief of staff Mark Meadows, who is working from home after testing positive for coronavirus, has discussed next steps with the legal team. Trump again on Saturday baselessly impugned mail-in ballots, which overwhelmingly tipped the election in Biden\u2019s favor, and repeated the falsehoods on Twitter that he \u201cWON THE ELECTION.\u201d He claimed \u201cbad things happened\u201d in the election that his poll observers were not allowed to see, even though there is no evidence that GOP poll watchers were systematically shut out of the process anywhere in the country. \u201c71,000,000 Legal Votes. The most EVER for a sitting President!\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. (While the popular vote tally was continuing to rise for both men as ballots were counted Saturday, Biden had won 74.5 million votes and Trump had won 70.4 million votes). Trump\u2019s campaign team is expected to continue its effort to dispute the election results with a next round of lawsuits Monday, but so far they have been unable to point to any credible instance of voter fraud that would alter the outcome of the race. \u201cI will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands,\u201d Trump said in a statement Saturday after the race was called. On Sunday, Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of The Union\u201d that \u201ca number of Republicans from the Hill have reached out. I don\u2019t believe anyone from the White House has.\u201d Fact check: Trump falsely claims 'illegal ballots' are changing the election As the Trump campaign maps out its legal strategy, it is not clear how isolated instances of irregularities, even if found, would add up to a case with sufficient legal questions to make it all the way to the Supreme Court or would challenge the integrity of an election that Biden looks set to eventually win with sufficient electoral votes, which would make challenges in individual states unlikely to alter the national result. The legal front looks increasingly like a rallying point for partisans keen to prevent Biden\u2019s presidency from being seen as legitimate by Trump supporters and as a face-saving way for the President himself to explain his defeat. Renowned Republican election lawyer Benjamin Ginsberg said that there was no sign that the President had any case that could change the result of the election. He told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that there was so far \u201cno evidence of the systemic fraud or irregularities to cast any of the results in any of the states into doubt.\u201d While Trump may not accept that he has lost, many world leaders did on Saturday as they sent congratulatory messages to Biden and Harris. In a sign of how quickly global realities shift after a US election, even some leaders who had courted Trump, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, rushed to congratulate the President-elect. In perhaps the most notable message, India\u2019s nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had appeared at huge campaign-style rallies with Trump in India and the United States, tweeted a picture of Biden leaning in to whisper in his ear during a previous meeting. Modi sent a separate tweet congratulating Harris and noting her Indian heritage, saying her success was a great source of pride for Indian Americans and her \u201cchittis\u201d \u2013 a Tamil term of endearment that has been used by the vice president-elect. Many prominent Republicans remained silent this weekend, but there were a few exceptions, including former President George W. Bush \u2013 who won the presidency in 2000 after the contentious Florida recount \u2013 and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has often sparred with the President. Trump\u2019s failure to concede and congratulate his opponent may have suppressed normal courtesies from Republican leaders who remain intimidated by him and dependent on the President\u2019s base for their reelection prospects in 2024. Bush said he had called both Biden and Harris to offer his congratulations. \u201cThough we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country,\u201d Bush said in a statement Sunday, adding that the fact that Trump won more than 70 million votes was \u201can extraordinary political achievement.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump has the right to request recounts and pursue legal challenges, and any unresolved issues will be properly adjudicated,\u201d Bush said, but added, \u201cThe American people can have confidence that this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.\u201d Romney told Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cgiven the fact that the statisticians have come to a conclusion at this stage, I think we get behind the new President.\u201d When asked whether he had concerns about Trump\u2019s lies about the integrity of the election, the Utah senator noted that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to change the nature of President Trump in these last days.\u201d \u201cHe has a relatively relaxed relationship with the truth. And so he\u2019s going to keep on fighting until the very end,\u201d Romney said. \u201cBut I\u2019m convinced that, once all remedies have been exhausted, if those are exhausted in a way that\u2019s not favorable to him, he will accept the inevitable. But don\u2019t expect him to go quietly in the night. That\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d Though Biden pulled off an impressive feat by dispatching an incumbent President and rebuilding the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Midwest, he is keenly aware of the enormous governing challenge facing him given his slender margin of victory in key swing states. Beyond that \u2013 despite fervent hopes that they could deliver a sharp repudiation of Trump and his party at the polls \u2013 Democrats actually lost seats in the US House, though they will maintain a majority. Despite massive fundraising, Democrats also failed to make much of a dent in the GOP-controlled Senate. The balance of power in the chamber hinges on two likely runoff elections in Georgia in January. Biden outlined ambitious goals during his campaign \u2013 from a major revamp of the tax code to aggressive efforts to deal with the climate crisis to an expansion of Obamacare \u2013 as he tried to hold his fractious party together and inspire the loyalty of progressive Democrats who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the political reality of a still-polarized nation, a divided government in Washington and the difficulty of solving the nation\u2019s Covid-19 crisis are likely to temper Biden\u2019s ambitions. In his remarks Saturday night, Biden promised to get the pandemic \u201cunder control\u201d so Americans could reclaim their most precious moments \u2014 from visiting with their grandchildren to celebrating weddings and graduations. He noted that he would name a group of leading scientists and experts to his coronavirus task force on Monday, who would build an \u201caction blueprint\u201d that could be deployed as soon as he is inaugurated in January. The task force will be headed by three co-chairs: former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Yale University\u2019s School of Medicine, CNN reported Saturday. Biden\u2019s plan to tackle the virus, he said, would be rooted in science and constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern. He also plans to take a series of executive actions on day one to reverse some of Trump\u2019s foreign policy actions. As he did throughout the campaign, Biden spoke Saturday night to the grief that many Americans have experienced during the pandemic, alluding to the loss of his own son Beau Biden, the former attorney general of Delaware who died of brain cancer at the age of 46. Capturing the faith that sustains him, Biden quoted from a Catholic hymn \u2013 \u201cOn Eagle\u2019s Wings\u201d \u2013 that he said had meant a great deal to his family and to Beau Biden. \u201cI hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the 230,000 Americans who have lost a loved one to this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you,\u201d Biden said. As CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz reported, there was another reminder of Beau as fireworks lit up the sky outside the Chase Center: One of the songs that played during the show was \u201cA Sky Full of Stars\u201d by Coldplay, one of Beau Biden\u2019s favorite bands. Former President Barack Obama underscored the challenges ahead for his former vice president on Saturday when he asked Americans to set aside their political differences and \u201cgive him a chance and lend him your support.\u201d \u201cWhen he walks into the White House in January, he\u2019ll face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming President ever has \u2013 a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril,\u201d Obama said in a statement. \u201cI know he\u2019ll do the job with the best interests of every American at heart, whether or not he had their vote.\u201d Obama noted that the election results \u201cat every level show that the country remains deeply and bitterly divided.\u201d \u201cIt will be up to not just Joe and Kamala, but each of us, to do our part \u2013 to reach out beyond our comfort zone, to listen to others, to lower the temperature and find some common ground from which to move forward.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Sunday.

Biden rebuilt the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Great Lakes states where Trump had won four years earlier. He also delivered Democrats\u2019 strongest performance in a generation in Arizona and Georgia, leading both states by narrow margins as votes continue to be counted there and in Nevada, where CNN projects a Biden victory. Biden, who turns 78 later this month and who was among the youngest men ever elected to the Senate in 1972, is now the oldest elected to the presidency. In his third bid for the presidency, Biden\u2019s life story of overcoming personal tragedy met the moment of a nation in the grips of health and economic crises. He built a coalition of people of color, suburban women, younger and older voters, and just enough independents and disaffected Republicans to win narrow margins in several battleground states where Republicans down-ballot outperformed Trump. And with Biden\u2019s victory, his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, has made history. One hundred years after the United States\u2019 constitutional guarantee of women\u2019s right to vote, she becomes America\u2019s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president-elect. Democrats did not see the results they were hoping for in the Senate or House, although they lead in the race to retain control of the House. And the party is closely watching Georgia, where one Senate race is already headed to a runoff and another could be, as well \u2013 setting up two high-stakes races on January 5 with control of the Senate on the line. Here are seven takeaways from the results of the 2020 presidential election: Biden\u2019s ability to rebuild the \u201cblue wall\u201d of industrial states across the Great Lakes region wasn\u2019t just his political argument to Democrats over why they should nominate him. It\u2019s at the core of his identity: A candidate from a working-class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, who never lost touch with those roots over nearly five decades in national politics and could move areas like it back into the Democratic column. When the party\u2019s primary voters rejected more progressive candidates and young, emerging stars who might have better aligned with their political beliefs in favor of Biden, a figure hardened by presidential and vice presidential campaigns, it was because they believed he represented their best shot at winning. Biden executed on that promise, winning Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, according to CNN projections \u2013 all states that went to Trump four years earlier. Biden\u2019s campaign looked to other battlegrounds across the Sun Belt, and \u2013 in addition to winning every state Hillary Clinton won four years ago \u2013 is currently leading in Arizona and Georgia. But the \u201cblue wall\u201d was his primary focus, and what ultimately cemented his victory. Biden spent the final two days of the race barnstorming Pennsylvania, and then spent Election Day revisiting old haunts, including his childhood home in Scranton. \u201cFrom this house to the White House with the grace of God,\u201d he wrote on the living room wall there. The battle for control of the Senate is going into overtime, with Georgia appearing to be headed toward two runoffs January 5 that will determine whether Republicans maintain their majority. CNN has not yet projected winners in Senate races in Alaska and North Carolina. But if Republicans\u2019 leads in those states hold, the Senate would have 48 Democrats and 50 Republicans \u2013 meaning Democrats\u2019 only shot at a majority is a 50-50 split, since Vice President-elect Harris would serve as the tie-breaker. The runoffs are happening because of Georgia\u2019s unique requirement that to win in November, the first-place finisher must top 50% of the vote. Though incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue is narrowly ahead of Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, the presence of a Libertarian in that race slightly reduced both of their vote totals, holding Perdue just under the 50% mark unless something changes at the last minute. Meanwhile, the \u201cjungle primary\u201d in the special election for Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat always looked likely to head to a runoff. Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock and appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler have qualified for it. With the highest possible stakes, the runoffs will turn Georgia into the site of an all-out political battle, with both parties throwing everything they have at organizing and advertising in the state. Democrats historically have underperformed in Georgia runoffs \u2013 including in 2008, when Democratic challenger Jim Martin finished 3 percentage points behind Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss in the general election, only to lose the runoff by 15 points. But Democratic down-ballot candidates have come much closer to winning runoffs in recent years, and organizing efforts led by former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have positioned Democrats to be more competitive this year. Biden himself holds a razor-thin lead over Trump in the state, which has not gone for a Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992. The chance to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, from his leadership position is all but certain to motivate Democratic donors to pour money into both races. Expect both parties to pour everything they have into the runoffs. Concessions by losing presidential candidates are an important American tradition, helping to legitimize the winner and affirm the democratic process. Trump, though, appears uninterested in playing a part in that tradition, instead bent on tearing down that process on his way out of the White House. In conversations with allies in recent days, Trump has said he has no intention to concede the election to Biden, CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reported Friday morning. Aides, including his chief of staff Mark Meadows, have not attempted to bring Trump to terms of what\u2019s happening and have instead fed his baseless claim that the election is being stolen from him. Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 many of which have been slapped with warning labels by Twitter \u2013 have complained that the legitimate process of counting absentee ballots amounts to the race being stolen from him. His right-wing media supporters have mobilized, amplifying disinformation about how counties\u2019 and states\u2019 vote counts are taking place. How Republicans in Congress handle Trump\u2019s tantrum bears watching in the coming days and weeks. Cloaking his lies about voter fraud and the vote-counting process with an air of legitimacy could do more long-lasting damage to the peaceful transition of power \u2013 if that damage isn\u2019t already irreversible. For the first time, the United States has elected a Black and South Asian woman as vice president. The huge historical significance of Harris\u2019 breakthrough might be lost temporarily amid the drama of close vote counts in several key states dragging on for several days, amid Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated complaints. But it is likely to come into view in the coming days, weeks and months, as the January 20 inauguration of Biden and Harris approaches. And, as CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip pointed out on-air, Trump\u2019s political career began with the racist \u201cbirther\u201d lie intended to discredit the first Black president, Barack Obama. It now ends with the first Black woman in the White House. The 2020 election featured the most motivated electorate in recent American history, underscoring how deeply motivated both parties\u2019 bases were. Biden and Trump have now gotten the first- and second-most votes ever in United States presidential elections \u2013 and many states are still counting. Biden is the first candidate ever to top 70 million votes, and Trump in on the cusp of crossing that threshold. Voter turnout appears to be on pace to reach the highest level since 1900, when more than 73% of eligible Americans cast ballots. Despite his loss, Trump once again outperformed polls and increased turnout among his base of White working-class voters in rural areas. Biden saw jumps over 2016 turnout in urban and suburban regions. Both parties have data to pick through to determine where they fell short, on a percentage basis, compared to previous years \u2013 such as Trump drawing much stronger Hispanic support in Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade County, a weakness for Biden that Democrats will urgently seek to correct in future elections. But that\u2019s a challenge of persuasion, not mobilization. Both parties\u2019 voters were more motivated than at any point in modern history in 2020. A big question Republicans now face is whether the sort of White working-class turnout that Trump motivated can transfer to other GOP candidates, or \u2013 as the party\u2019s losses in the midterms suggest it could be \u2013 a phenomenon exclusively driven by Trump. Democrats entered the 2020 election expecting to build on their 2018 midterm gains, when a huge swing in their favor in the suburbs delivered the party control of the House of Representatives. This year, Democrats hoped to add to that House majority, win a decisive Senate majority and flip several state legislative chambers in order to position the party to have a bigger say in the 2021 redistricting process, when legislatures draw new congressional district maps after the Census. The party even hoped that by smashing fundraising records across the map \u2013 including in long-shot Senate races in states like South Carolina and Kentucky \u2013 it would deliver a few shockers on election night. Democrats are on pace to lose several House seats, though they\u2019ll maintain their majority. They didn\u2019t gain ground in key state legislatures, and in some appear to have lost ground. And they saw several Senate races \u2013 particularly marquee battles in Maine and North Carolina \u2013 slip out of their hands late. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins was boosted in the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis has appeared to hold onto his seat, after his Democratic challenger, Cal Cunningham, was caught in a sex scandal. (CNN has not yet projected in the North Carolina race.) It all led to a bittersweet election for Democrats, who are thrilled to have ended Trump\u2019s presidency but now must pick through the wreckage of their failures down-ballot. The first look at that reckoning came in a House Democratic call Thursday, where progressives and moderates vented frustration at each other. \u201cSomething went wrong here across the entire political world,\u201d Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told her caucus, sources told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Lauren Fox. \u201cOur polls, Senate polls, (governor) polls, presidential polls, Republican polls, public polls, turnout modeling, and prognosticators all pointed to one political environment \u2013 that environment never materialized. In fact, the voters who turned out look a lot more like 2016 than to what was projected.\u201d The overall result is exactly what Biden wanted: He rebuilt the \u201cblue wall\u201d and \u2013 if his current leads hold \u2013 would become the first Democrat in a generation to win Arizona and Georgia. Even if those leads slip away, he\u2019ll have come closer than any Democrat since Bill Clinton. And he\u2019ll have embarrassed Trump\u2019s campaign, which insisted there was no way he\u2019d lose either state. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even be here. They say I have Georgia made,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Rome, Georgia, two days before the election. But Biden lost states where polls had shown him ahead and where his campaign had pumped vast resources in the race\u2019s closing weeks. The two most glaring losses are Florida and North Carolina \u2013 both presidential battlegrounds where former President Barack Obama won once (North Carolina in 2008) and twice (Florida). Biden also visited Des Moines, Iowa, on the last Friday of the race, and Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday \u2013 indicators his campaign believed both were in play. Trump won both states handily. Biden\u2019s campaign never bought into Democratic optimism that Texas would become a swing state this year. It made overtures, sending Harris to the state the Friday before the election, but never pumped the kind of money into Texas that a true battleground would require and never sending Biden there. Still, a better performance at the top of the ticket could have helped Democrats pick up congressional and state legislative seats in a state where they hope a growing, diversifying electorate will ultimately tip it in their direction. None of that materialized in 2020. This story has been updated with CNN\u2019s Nevada projection.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is making his final stand on the \u201cblue wall\u201d that President Donald Trump toppled four years ago. The Democratic presidential nominee is spending Sunday campaigning in Philadelphia. He\u2019ll speak early in the afternoon at a \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d event aimed at getting Black church attendees to vote, and then hold a drive-in rally in the evening. It comes after he spent Saturday in Michigan campaigning with former President Barack Obama, and Friday in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa \u2013 visiting a region that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was accused of ignoring, only to watch several states once considered reliably Democratic slip away in Election Night stunners four year ago. Biden\u2019s decision to focus his final days of campaigning on northern battlegrounds showed that \u2013 while polls show him with narrow leads in other battleground states across the Sun Belt \u2013 his campaign believes winning back enough White, working-class voters to rebuild the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin represents his clearest path to 270 electoral votes.   \u201cIt\u2019s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home,\u201d Biden said Saturday night in Detroit. CNN polls released Saturday showed Biden with a 52% to 44% lead in Wisconsin, one of the nation\u2019s leading hot spots in the coronavirus pandemic as cases spike there, and a 53% to 41% advantage in Michigan. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map Now, Biden is fully shifting his focus to what polls have shown might be the most competitive of those states, and the tipping point that pushes one candidate to victory: Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral votes. Beyond the state\u2019s competitiveness, it also represents for the campaigns the best chance to shift votes late. Other swing states \u2013 particularly in the Sun Belt \u2013 cast huge shares of their ballots early and by mail. In Pennsylvania, the majority of votes are expected to be cast on Election Day itself. Trump barnstormed Pennsylvania on Saturday, holding rallies in Newtown, Reading, Butler and Montoursville. \u201cWe win Pennsylvania, we win it all \u2013 you know that, right?\u201d Trump said Saturday night in Butler. He complained about states counting mail-in ballots after Election Day, and falsely claimed that the United States is \u201crounding the turn\u201d against the coronavirus pandemic. He praised his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic, claiming a vaccine would \u201cend the pandemic once and for all,\u201d and that the country is \u201cnow just weeks away from the mass distributing of a safe vaccine.\u201d Throughout the summer, he often predicted a vaccine would be available by Election Day. A day earlier, Trump had made the baseless claim that American doctors are profiting from coronavirus deaths. Obama and Biden lambasted Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic on the campaign trail Saturday. Obama: Trump cares about his ego, Biden cares about 'keeping your family safe' \u201cHe\u2019s jealous of Covid\u2019s media coverage and now he\u2019s accusing doctors of profiting off this pandemic \u2013 think about that,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe cannot fathom, he does not understand the notion that somebody would risk their life to save others without trying to make a buck.\u201d Trump has also made a big bet on fracking for natural gas, which is a major economic driver in Western Pennsylvania but is opposed by many concerned with climate change. He is alleging that Biden would ban fracking; Biden had previously indicated he was open to it, but has more recently said he would not ban fracking. On Saturday, Trump issued a memo instructing his administration to \u201cassess the potential consequences of fracking bans.\u201d \u201cBiden\u2019s plan to Abolish American Energy is an economic DEATH SENTENCE for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to BAN FRACKING & send PA into a nightmare of poverty & depression. Gas prices would explode & family incomes would plummet\u2014I will always defend & promote PA energy!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. Rebuilding that \u201cblue wall\u201d isn\u2019t Biden\u2019s only path to 270 electoral votes. His campaign has also targeted a number of Sun Belt states that are must-wins for Trump: Florida and North Carolina are crucial battlegrounds, and Biden\u2019s campaign is bullish on Georgia \u2013 where a diversifying electorate and a suburban swing in Democrats\u2019 favor has reshaped the political landscape of what was once a reliably Republican state. Biden\u2019s campaign has also focused on Arizona, a state that \u2013 like Georgia and North Carolina \u2013 is also key to determining which party controls the Senate. And amid an unprecedented surge in early votes in Texas that has already resulted in more votes being cast there than in the 2016 election, Biden\u2019s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, spent Friday campaigning there. CNN Polls: Biden leads in Michigan and Wisconsin as campaign ends, with tighter races in Arizona and North Carolina Those states, though, aren\u2019t must-wins: Biden\u2019s big bet has always been that he could rebuild the blue wall. And if he falls short everywhere else, those blue wall states could still leave him a path to victory \u2013 as long as he holds onto two additional Democratic-leaning states where Trump has campaigned, Minnesota and Nevada. He has deep connections to the region: Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and for decades has lived just southwest of Philadelphia. The Obama administration\u2019s 2009 bailout of the automotive industry was vital to the economies of Michigan and other Rust Belt states. Biden\u2019s ability to recapture Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin after Trump\u2019s wins in those states in 2016 has always been at the core of his candidacy. Those states, as well as Minnesota, a Democratic state that Trump has also targeted, have drifted in Republicans\u2019 favor in recent elections as the GOP\u2019s margins of victory have grown among rural and White voters. But Biden represents his party\u2019s best chance to stop that trend. The coalition of voters he has sought to assemble to build a path to victory relies more on strong performances with White voters, independents and older voters than Obama and Clinton have in previous elections. He also stands to benefit from the suburban shift toward Democrats during Trump\u2019s presidency. Still, Biden\u2019s campaign has shown that \u2013 while the former vice president\u2019s focus is the \u201cblue wall\u201d \u2013 it is also competing hard in the Sun Belt. Harris campaigned in Texas on Friday and spent Saturday in Florida. She\u2019ll be in Georgia and North Carolina on Sunday. Obama is being dispatched to Georgia and Florida on Monday, the final day of campaigning.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is ending his reelection bid in a frenzied cross-country push for votes in states he won \u2013 some handily \u2013 four years ago. But he is not pretending to be happy about it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even going to be like we had an election,\u201d Trump said on a rain-drenched tarmac in Lansing, Michigan, on Tuesday, lamenting that the coronavirus had imperiled his political prospects and, in his telling, forced him to return to the cold grind and meteorological mishaps of the campaign trail. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t be standing out here in the freezing rain with you,\u201d he told a crowd of hearty souls who had been standing for hours in persistent drizzle to hear him speak. \u201cI\u2019d be home in the White House, doing whatever the hell I was doing. I wouldn\u2019t be out here.\u201d As he barnstorms the country in seek of electoral votes, Trump is hoping to out-hustle his rival in the places he claims have been long ignored by the political class. But he has also been explicit that he would likely be ignoring them, too, unless they provided him political fuel. He hasn\u2019t shied away from telling his supporters he would never find himself in their states unless he needed their votes. \u201cWe win Wisconsin, we win the whole ballgame,\u201d he said last week on yet another frigid airport tarmac, this time in Janesville. \u201cWhat the hell do you think I\u2019m doing here on a freezing night with 45-degree winds?\u201d \u201cDo you think I\u2019m doing this for my health?\u201d he continued as the temperature dropped and some of the crowd began trickling out. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for my health.\u201d CNN\u2019s Road to 270 interactive map A week earlier at the Des Moines airport, he warned a crowd of adoring fans huddled outside a plane hangar he\u2019d never return unless they reward him with Iowa\u2019s six electoral votes. \u201cI may never have to come back here again if I don\u2019t get Iowa,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll never be back.\u201d While Trump proclaims to his sizable crowds he has restored their way of life over the past four years, he doesn\u2019t paper over the fact it\u2019s not really a life for him. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s established brand: I\u2019m not like you, but you could be like me. Speaking in Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley on Monday, Trump became briefly waylaid after thinking of the freedom a 18-wheeler might provide. But the aside was less about the appeal of truck stops and the open road than the potential for escaping the life he is currently leading. \u201cBy the way, nice trucks,\u201d he said to no one in particular on yet another airport tarmac. \u201cYou think I could hop into one of them and drive it away?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to just drive the hell out of here. Just get the hell out of this,\u201d he went on. \u201cI had such a good life. My life was great.\u201d Trump makes frenetic election push in states that highlight his Covid denial In the campaign\u2019s final stretch, Trump is tailoring his appeals to suburban women, senior citizens, non-college educated Whites and whatever overlap those groups contain. He has narrowed his sights outside major urban centers, looking to rural regions or smaller cities for votes. Along the way, Trump has only rarely made an attempt to place himself within that milieu. Trump\u2019s rallies almost never take him further than the airport, where he lands, taxis into place next to a well-lit and crowded hangar, walks from the plane, speaks, dances to YMCA and returns up the steps an hour later. He did make a brief foray from the tarmac in Wisconsin on Tuesday, driving 15 minutes to a nearby motorsports track in West Salem past retail strips and a Sam\u2019s Club. He took a lap around the track in his presidential limousine on his way in, but as soon as he wrapped up he quickly got in his car and sped away. Trump made clear it wasn\u2019t his first choice. \u2018We were going to be out at the airport but the governor made it very difficult so I said, \u2018That\u2019s all right, get a location,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cFriendly people.\u201d Unlike his Democratic rival Joe Biden, whose working-class biography is the basis of his entire political persona, Trump does not ask voters to identify with the life he has led or the struggles he has encountered. Stumping in Pennsylvania, Trump often claims to understand the commonwealth better than his rival \u2013 who was born in Scranton \u2013 because he went to college there. Trump graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, hardly a part of the state he is hoping to win. He transferred there after two years at Fordham, in the Bronx. Attacking Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for her stance on renewable energy, Trump has taken to asking his crowds incredulously whether she even attended college (she did, at Boston University) \u2013 hardly a nod to the non-college educated voters who form his base. His explicit overtures to, as he calls it, \u201cthe suburban woman\u201d have taken an increasingly archaic tone as the election nears, including in Lansing on Tuesday when he claimed to be \u201cgetting your husbands back to work\u201d \u2013 a line that seemed to discount the lopsided effect the pandemic-related economic slowdown has had on women. In Florida, Trump has taken to labeling himself a senior citizen as he speaks to crowds of elderly backers, hoping the self-identification might make him seem more like them. But his account, repeated at every rally, of receiving an experimental antibody treatment unavailable to nearly anyone else hardly places him in the category of Americans worried about their health care or the coronavirus pandemic. Trump uses outdated thinking in attempt to woo suburban women: I'm 'getting your husbands back to work' When he does seek to convey shared plight with his supporters, it is often through the highly specific grievances of his presidency, like the Russia investigation or aggressive media coverage, hoping they will enrage his backers in the same way they have animated him. Trump\u2019s rally crowds typically go along, though the more he delves into the highly coded and sometimes arcane miscellany of his presidency the more the response dims. On Tuesday, when he brought up the \u201clid\u201d (a function of press coverage that tells reporters when no further events are expected for a candidate or president), his rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska did not swell. Mentions of Section 230, which shields some major tech companies from liability, garnered only some scattered hoots and hollers. At last week\u2019s debate, Trump offered asides about the \u201cbig guy\u201d and the \u201claptop from hell\u201d without ever really expanding. Trump never quite explains what those things mean, assuming his supporters are as well-versed in the lingo and minutiae of various conservative scandals as he is. Trump\u2019s political advisers have said they wish the President stuck closer to issues like the economy. Of late, Trump has been aided in his message by video montages pieced together by his campaign depicting Biden\u2019s positions on energy, policing and trade. The spots are aired on large screens which Trump notes to his crowds he \u201cspent a lot of money on.\u201d \u201cOne thing nice is when you put this thing up here, saves you a lot of words, right? It saves you a lot of words,\u201d he told the crowd in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The economy of words has made for slightly shorter rallies; his events on Tuesday diminished in length as he headed west. When Trump left Omaha on Tuesday after a 45-minute speech, thousands watched and cheered in the frigid air as Air Force One took off into the night sky. But for the next several hours, hundreds and hundreds of people who attended the rally were stranded as a chaotic scene unfolded on dark roads on a remote stretch near the Omaha airport. They waited for buses that didn\u2019t arrive, unable to reach the site because of a clogged two-lane road. Many people started walking to their cars, parked three or four miles away, which blocked the roads even further. Several medics were seen by CNN giving attention to people in the bone-chilling evening air. The temperature was right at freezing, but wind chills were far lower. Trump acknowledged the cold weather to the crowd from the podium earlier in the evening, where he stood in an overcoat and gloves. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m standing here freezing,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you one little favor: Get the hell out and vote.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "The Senate majority is firmly within Democrats\u2019 reach with just a week to go until Election Day. That wasn\u2019t necessarily expected a year ago, but Democrats\u2019 improving fortunes have a lot do with President Donald Trump. Republicans breathed a sigh of relief after the second presidential debate last week, where they think the President at least didn\u2019t hurt himself. But Trump has been a consistent drag on down-ballot Republicans, and he\u2019s spurred Democrats to raise staggering sums of money. Democrats in once-red suburban House districts started shattering fundraising records in the 2018 midterms, and now a similar dynamic is playing out across the Senate landscape, with Democratic challengers raising more in one quarter than incumbents and challengers \u2013 combined \u2013 used to raise in an entire cycle. And while that money has helped Democrats expand the playing field deeper into Trump states \u2013 like South Carolina, Kansas and Alaska, for example \u2013 it\u2019s not going unanswered in the final weeks of the campaign. Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC tied to Senate leadership, raised nearly $50 million in the first two weeks of October that it can use to level the playing field in red states where the Democratic candidates have had significant fundraising advantages. Conservative donor enthusiasm for the Senate underscores that Republicans think holding the chamber is their best firewall against Democratic-controlled government \u2013 a theme coming through in some GOP advertising in individual races. A lot depends on the presidential race in the final stretch, since down-ballot races have become increasingly nationalized. In 2016, for the first time, every state voted for president the same way it did for Senate. For Senate Democrats looking at Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s poll numbers, that\u2019s good news. Biden led Trump by 52% to 42% in CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls as of Thursday and held margins of varying sizes in several states with key Senate races. Interactive: 2020 Senate race ratings Democrats need a net gain of four Senate seats to win the chamber if Biden loses. Assuming Democrats lose Alabama \u2013 which CNN has consistently ranked the seat most likely to flip this year \u2013 they need to flip five other seats. But if Biden wins the presidency, they need a net gain of only three since the vice president breaks ties in the Senate. Again, assuming they lose Alabama, Democrats would need to flip four seats. Latest House and Senate ratings show Democrats increasingly competitive in Republican areas Colorado and Arizona are top targets, and they\u2019ve been consistently ranked No. 2 and 3, respectively, in CNN\u2019s ranking of seats most likely to flip. The rankings are based on CNN\u2019s reporting, as well as polling, fundraising and advertising spending data. There\u2019s a handful of GOP-held seats that come next on the ranking that could put Democrats over the edge. Besides Alabama, though, Democrats also have to keep their eye on Michigan \u2013 the only other state Trump won in 2016 where a Democrat is running for reelection. Even with Biden leading there, the Wolverine State rounds out the bottom of this ranking. There are many more Republican trouble spots than Democratic trouble spots, though. Biden is doing better among White working-class voters than Hillary Clinton did in 2016, which is helping him narrow Trump\u2019s margin in many red states. That gives Senate Democrats a chance to play offense \u2013 even if Trump is ultimately expected to carry those states. In Kansas, for example, Trump was leading by just 7 points \u2013 down from his 21-point margin in 2016 \u2013 and GOP Rep. Roger Marshall was ahead by only 4 in a New York Times/Siena College poll from last week. Biden\u2019s competitiveness in Texas has also given Democrats late optimism about the Senate race there, although it\u2019s still a Lean Republican contest, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, a CNN contributor. Both parties acknowledge something would have to go horribly wrong for Republicans to lose the Senate race in Mississippi. But the spending disparity there is not to be ignored: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who won a 2018 special election, raised just $84,000 during the first two weeks of October. During the same period, Democratic challenger Mike Espy raised nearly $4 million. The 10 House districts most likely to flip two weeks from Election Day The Southern state that\u2019s perhaps most concerning to Republicans is Georgia, where Biden is competitive and where not one but both Senate seats are at risk. The special election featuring Sen. Kelly Loeffler is almost certain to go to a runoff. The regular election, featuring GOP Sen. David Perdue, ranks seventh on this list. But if neither candidate gets a majority, which seems likely, it\u2019ll also go to a runoff, which means that while Election Day is next week, the fight over the balance of the Senate could extend until January. Here are the seats most likely to flip partisan control: Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Doug Jones Ever since scandal-plagued Roy Moore lost the GOP nomination earlier this year, there hasn\u2019t been much that could displace Jones as the most vulnerable senator of the year. Even against Moore, who was facing allegations of sexual assault, the Democrat only barely won a 2017 special election. He\u2019s outraising and outspending Republican Tommy Tuberville, and his best path to victory remains turning out Black voters. But that doesn\u2019t look like enough to overcome the partisan lean of the state. Trump won Alabama by 28 points, and unlike in some other red states he carried in 2016, where his margins are slipping, he\u2019s holding up pretty well in the Yellowhammer State. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Cory Gardner The president Gardner has chosen to put in one of his most recent ads isn\u2019t the current occupant of the White House; it\u2019s former Democratic President John F. Kennedy. That says a lot about this first-term Republican senator\u2019s reelection fight in a state Trump lost by 5 points in 2016 and is likely to lose again this year. Gardner needs ticket-splitters, hence he\u2019s touting the bipartisanship of his own work on conservation legislation but he also can\u2019t afford to alienate the GOP base. That\u2019s a difficult balance to strike, and one that doesn\u2019t leave him with much of a path to victory. Democrat John Hickenlooper, meanwhile, has been putting Trump in his ads to tie Gardner to the top of the ticket. The former Democratic governor has faced his own stumbles, but the partisanship of the state during a presidential election year should help him become the next senator from the Centennial State. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Martha McSally This is McSally\u2019s second bid for Senate in as many years, and some of the dynamics that hurt her in that 2018 race are at play again this year. The former congresswoman, who was appointed to the open seat after losing last time, is still struggling to simultaneously appeal to Trump supporters and the suburban voters \u2013 especially women \u2013 who dislike him. The difference this year is that Trump is on the ballot with her. Depending on how he does in Arizona, that could give McSally a boost. But with Biden having an edge in several recent polls of the state, Trump could also drag her down. She\u2019s facing a well-funded opponent in Democrat Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Kelly led McSally 52% to 42% among registered voters in a Monmouth University poll from mid-October, a widening of his 6-point advantage from the same pollster in September. Underscoring McSally\u2019s problem: Nearly half of Arizona voters said she had been too supportive of the President \u2013 and that was even higher among independents \u2013 compared with 38% of voters who said she\u2019s given him the right amount of support. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Susan Collins The four-term senator is in the toughest fight of her career. And while Republicans hope voters in the state\u2019s more conservative 2nd District may be coming home to her in the final stretch, she still faces a daunting path to reelection with the state\u2019s use of ranked choice voting. She\u2019s trying to hold on to ticket-splitting voters (who do still exist in Maine) while not alienating base voters who think she hasn\u2019t been chummy enough with Trump. She hasn\u2019t made the same commitment she did in 2016 not to vote for him. But there\u2019s no love lost between Collins and the President, who tweeted earlier this month that she\u2019s \u201cnot worth the work.\u201d Democrats, however, are trying to nationalize the contest, eagerly pointing out all the times she\u2019s voted with Trump, with Democrat Sara Gideon arguing this race is just as much about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s fate as leader as it is about Collins. The senator may earn plaudits for being the only Republican to vote against Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, citing the closeness to the election and the precedent set in 2016, but that probably won\u2019t win her back voters who were enraged by her support of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Thom Tillis Republicans think they caught a break in North Carolina with Democrat Cal Cunningham\u2019s sex scandal, especially if it gives conservatives a reason to vote for Tillis, who has long struggled to consolidate the Republican vote. Senate Leadership Fund has seized on the issue to argue the Army reservist is a hypocrite who lacks the character he\u2019s campaigned on. Cunningham has now responded in his own spot saying, \u201cTillis is desperately attacking my personal life because he doesn\u2019t want to talk about his own record.\u201d He goes on to tell voters, \u201cIt may be my name on the ballot, but it\u2019s your health care.\u201d Public polling, at least, seems to bear out Cunningham\u2019s bet that voters don\u2019t much care about his personal scandal. He led Tillis by 49% to 43% among likely voters in a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday, with nearly an equal percentage of likely voters saying they disapprove of how each candidate handles himself personally. A Washington Post/ABC News poll from mid-October showed no clear leader, but 71% of registered voters said Cunningham\u2019s affair was less important, while 81% said who controls the Senate was more important to them. Carrying that message, however, requires spending, and Cunningham entered the final stretch of the race with a cash-on-hand deficit. But in one of the states most saturated with political advertising, the Senate race may come down to what happens in the presidential contest, which has been consistently close here. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Joni Ernst Both sides acknowledge this race is a coin toss. Trump carried the state by nearly 10 points in 2016. But now Ernst \u2013 the first woman elected to federal office in Iowa \u2013 is in the same boat as many GOP senators who need to convince voters why they deserve a second term, even if Trump doesn\u2019t. A recent spot from the National Republican Senatorial Committee makes a checks and balances argument for rejecting Democrat Theresa Greenfield, implying that Senate control would be the last defense against a President Biden and Democratic House. Ernst burst onto the political scene with her infamous 2014 \u201cmake \u2018em squeal\u201d ad, but she may not have done herself any favors in a recent debate, where she couldn\u2019t state the price of soybeans. It\u2019s not clear the moment has resonated beyond the headlines, but Republicans are worried that Greenfield \u2013 who talks about being a \u201cfarm kid\u201d \u2013 has had a fundraising advantage. (She raised nearly four times as much as Ernst in the first two weeks of October.) A recent New York Times/Siena College poll had Ernst at 45% to Greenfield\u2019s 44% and Biden at 46% to Trump\u2019s 43% among likely voters \u2013 all within the margin of error. Monmouth\u2019s poll from around the same time showed an essentially tied Senate race, as it has for much of the late summer and fall. Incumbent: Republican Sen. David Perdue Biden\u2019s trip to Georgia on Tuesday says it all \u2013 the state is in play, and that\u2019s making Republicans nervous about holding on to both Senate seats, most immediately Perdue\u2019s. The Atlanta suburbs are changing fast, and they\u2019re populated with the kinds of well-educated and diverse voters who don\u2019t like the President. Perdue has been outraised by Democrat Jon Ossoff, who lost the most expensive House race in history in 2017, and the GOP incumbent is still responding to Democratic attacks about his stock trades. Senate Leadership Fund aired an ad defending Perdue on the issue, an unusual and telling move since super PACs often stick to attacking opponents. A CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday had the race even, with Perdue at 47% to Ossoff\u2019s 46% among likely voters, while a Quinnipiac University poll from earlier in the month gave Ossoff a 51% to 45% edge. Getting more than 50% on Election Day is Ossoff\u2019s best path to victory. If neither candidate receives a majority, the contest advances to a January runoff, when Democrats might not have the same level of enthusiasm (and the spending) of a presidential race. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Steve Daines Another first-term Republican, Daines is facing two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who\u2019s proved he can win statewide at the same time Trump carries the state. The President isn\u2019t expected to post anywhere near the 21-point margin he did in 2016 (a recent New York Times/Siena College poll gave him just a 6-point lead among likely voters). Which is why, in addition to attacking Bullock as being too liberal, Republicans have turned to a checks and balances argument here: \u201cImagine Biden, Pelosi and Schumer in charge \u2013 it could happen if Steve Bullock is elected to the Senate,\u201d a recent National Republican Senatorial Committee ad says. Montanans are used to splitting their tickets, as Bullock\u2019s 2016 reelection, and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s reelection two years later, showed. Since then, though, Bullock has run for president against Trump. And Republicans hope that with Trump on the ticket, the partisanship of Montana will be too much for Bullock to overcome. The New York Times survey had Daines at 49% and Bullock at 46%, within the margin of error. Incumbent: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham If there\u2019s any Senate race where the Supreme Court vacancy has altered the trajectory, it may be South Carolina, where Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham\u2019s visibility during Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings gave him a prominent platform to raise money. Republican outside groups have also come to his rescue, with Senate Leadership Fund spending nearly $16 million in the state. Despite Democrat Jaime Harrison raising a record-breaking $57 million in the third quarter, he may be outspent in the final stretch. Republicans hope that Graham\u2019s Judiciary Committee performance will also help him consolidate support among conservatives, who\u2019ve long viewed him skeptically. Democrats are trying to exploit any lingering gap there, though, with Senate Majority PAC running ads about how Graham has criticized Trump while Harrison props up a third-party candidate as the true conservative. Bill Bledsoe already dropped out and endorsed Graham, but his name is still on the ballot. A New York Times/Siena College poll taken in mid-October (with the final days of interviews overlapping with the confirmation hearings) gave Graham a 6-point lead and Trump an 8-point lead. Democrats will also be closely watching the turnout of Black voters \u2013 a crucial voting bloc to get Harrison across the finish line. Incumbent: Democratic Sen. Gary Peters Some recent public polling has shown a close race here. A New York Times/Siena College poll from early October, for example, put Peters ahead by just 43% to 42%, well within the margin of error. Republicans think that reflects the strength of their candidate, Iraq War veteran John James, compared with the first-term incumbent. But Democrats aren\u2019t buying it, pointing out that Peters outraised James in the pre-general reporting period \u2013 a change from earlier in the year \u2013  and that Biden\u2019s edge here should boost the incumbent. A Fox News poll from later in October gave Peters a 49% to 41% lead among likely voters, which is more in line with what one would expect if the Democrats are performing well here at the top of the ticket. Still, given the outside spending from both sides in the Senate race, this contest is worth keeping a close eye on.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s one of those seemingly hard-to-explain things: President Donald Trump holds an allure for some Black men, despite his history of denigrating Black Americans and his refusal to explicitly acknowledge systemic racism. This relationship was on display on Monday, when the rapper 50 Cent said to \u201cvote for Trump\u201d in response to Democratic nominee Joe Biden\u2019s tax plan. At the Republican National Convention in August, speakers including the former NFL star Herschel Walker and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott lacquered Trump with praise. With the 2020 presidential election coming down to the wire, it\u2019s clear that Team Trump is hoping to maximize its appeal with Black voters. During the final debate on Thursday, NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker asked Trump and Biden if they understand why Black parents have to give their children \u201cthe talk\u201d about how to handle encounters with the police. The President said yes \u2013 before he quickly moved on and claimed to be \u201cthe least racist person in the room,\u201d a response that was at odds with his track record and failed to reflect if he truly understands anything about the Black experience. Just last month, the Trump campaign announced a thinly detailed \u201cPlatinum Plan,\u201d which extends a promise of Black economic development. At first glance, such maneuvering is puzzling. The President is decidedly unpopular with the Black electorate: In September, Gallup reported that Trump\u2019s job approval rating among Black Americans hovers at 11%. According to a January Washington Post/Ipsos poll, more than 8-in-10 black Americans believe that Trump is a racist. On Friday, California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, knocked the President for his efforts. \u201cDonald Trump has this goal to turn 20% of Black men out in favor of him. Donald Trump who pushed, as part of his popularity, the theme that the first Black man to be President of the United States was illegitimately there,\u201d she said. But the Trump campaign isn\u2019t without a strategy. According to Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, where he studies the role of race in electoral politics, figures such as Walker and 50 Cent share a few meaningful characteristics. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican presidential candidate, you recognize that most Black people aren\u2019t going to vote for you. But the most likely segment of Black people to vote for you is Black men, and a particular sort of Black man,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising that after Trump became the President-elect, a parade of Black men \u2013 celebrities and athletes including Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis and Kanye West \u2013 went into Trump Tower. If you\u2019re a Black man and a celebrity or an athlete, that usually means that the money you have is new and that you grew up either poor or working class.\u201d   Johnson believes that there\u2019s something about this brew of economic security, hypermasculinity and bootstrap self-determination \u2013 \u201che has accomplished so much almost all by himself,\u201d Walker says of the President in a spot airing on Black radio stations \u2013 that can make Trump resonate with some Black men. In 2016, 13% of Black men who voted cast their ballots for Trump. For Black women, this figure was a meager 4%. (Notably, men of every race supported Trump more than the women of that race did.) Consider Trump\u2019s complicated presence in hip-hop, stretching back to the 1980s. While in recent years the President has become a target on tracks, previously, he was something of an avatar of wealth, a name that Black male rappers dropped to boast about their fortunes. \u201cFrom broke to having brokers, my price range is Rover / Now I\u2019m knocking like Jehovah, let me in now, let me in now,\u201d Nelly says on his 2000 song \u201cCountry Grammar.\u201d \u201cBill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now.\u201d Far from being a scrub, Nelly on the track is a pioneer, barging into the White boys\u2019 club of the ultra-rich and famous. It\u2019s important to underscore that, in all likelihood, Trump will win no more than about 15% of votes from Black men, because most will back Biden. Indeed, when it comes to loyalty to the Democratic Party, Black men are second only to Black women. Still, as the political scientist Melanye Price wrote last week over at The Grio, that the Trump campaign is attempting to capture Black male support at all speaks to how \u201cclose victories are never about majorities, but the potential of small groups in important states to shape national results.\u201d Price added that \u201cthe power of this siphoning strategy is surgical. In the wake of grave concerns about voter suppression, fears about mail-in ballots and the continued impact of the pandemic, close political races are increasingly less predictable.\u201d This unsettling reality, made worse by a wider push for voter depression aimed at Black Americans, is partly why the Biden campaign has beefed up its outreach efforts. Earlier this year, the former vice president\u2019s team launched its \u201cShop Talk\u201d series, roundtables that focus on mining the issues affecting Black communities, especially Black men. While seemingly small, the series might be just the kind of venue the Biden campaign needs to animate a crucial constituency and blunt its opponent\u2019s reelection efforts. \u201cIf you know that man who likes Trump\u2019s machismo and supposed business acumen, ask him: Do you know anyone who\u2019s died from Covid-19? If he\u2019s in an urban area, he\u2019s probably going to answer yes,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cAsk him: Do you know anyone who\u2019s lost their job because of Covid-19? He\u2019s probably going to answer yes. What you do is contrast the perception of Trump with the reality of his governance and say that the best thing you can do for your life is to put new leadership in place.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is the last in a three-part series on swing states in the 2020 election. October 6: The Southeast. October 13: The Southwest. Two weeks before Election Day, Joe Biden appears well-positioned to finish the job that Democrats above all hired him to do: Rebuild the party\u2019s blue wall in the Rust Belt. Biden\u2019s principal asset in the 2020 Democratic primaries was the widespread sense among party voters that he was best qualified among the contenders to win back the defecting White voters, especially those without college degrees, who allowed Donald Trump to capture Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2016 \u2013 and with them the presidency. How 2020 may reconfigure politics in the Southwest Now, a wide array of public polls consistently shows Biden leading in all three states, defending Minnesota (which Trump has targeted) and running almost step for step with the President in Ohio and Iowa, two Rust Belt states Trump won more easily last time. With remarkable consistency across these states, polls show Biden benefiting from similar dynamics, as he attracts a solid majority of around 55% or more of college-educated White voters; a preponderant majority of around four-fifths of African Americans; and about two-fifths of Whites without college degrees, a number, that while modest, represents a clear improvement over Hillary Clinton\u2019s anemic showing with them in 2016. If Biden holds all of the 20 states Clinton won in 2016 and regains Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, he will win \u2013 whether or not he captures any of his targets across the Sun Belt, or for that matter, Ohio or Iowa. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map \u201cHe\u2019s settled in at a level that makes him formidable in terms of creating an Electoral College bloc that includes for sure Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, but also Minnesota, while competing readily for Ohio and Iowa,\u201d says veteran Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. Unless Trump can reverse Biden\u2019s advantages in the key Rust Belt battlegrounds, Greenberg argues, the former vice president \u201chas locked up the presidency. \u2026 You have an impossible Electoral College advantage with the states he\u2019s ahead of in the Rust Belt.\u201d Trump stunned Democrats in 2016 when he captured Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, despite trailing in the polls then too, behind an unexpected surge of turnout from his core group of non-college-educated Whites, especially those in small-town and rural communities. Apart from Michigan, where Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the coronavirus pandemic have weakened his position, few in either party rule out the possibility of Trump surprising again in the Rust Belt, even if polls are more favorable for Biden now than Clinton then. Why the Southeast is up for grabs in the 2020 election \u201cMy sense of what I see particularly in rural parts of the state and smaller cities is that the Trump vote is more energized now than it was four years ago,\u201d says Mark Graul, a Wisconsin-based Republican strategist who ran George W. Bush\u2019s campaign there in 2004. Privately, some Democratic operatives who are closely watching the early voting totals say they see worrisome signs that once again the share of non-college and rural Whites who are participating is larger than expected, even as turnout is slightly disappointing among voters of color and young people. \u201cThe overperformance of non-college White and rural is nothing to laugh at,\u201d said one high-level Democratic strategist who\u2019s monitoring the data. CNN Poll of Polls averages show Biden advantage in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin But unlike Clinton, who slighted Michigan and Wisconsin in campaign visits and advertising, Biden has remained laser-focused on these three states. According to CNN ad tracking, he\u2019s spent more on television advertising in Pennsylvania than in any other state except Florida, which is much larger; he is outspending Trump on television by about 2-to-1 or more in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin alike. Biden has also devoted many of his relatively few personal campaign appearances to those states, usually appearing before working-class audiences. Biden is \u201cvisibly campaigning for working-class votes, speaking to those who had voted for Trump and saying, I hear you,\u201d said Greenberg, who first became prominent for his landmark focus groups after the 1984 election documenting White working-class defection from the Democrats in blue-collar Macomb County outside Detroit. It may not be as flashy as tipping the rapidly changing states of the Sun Belt, but Biden appears to have decided it is the staid Rust Belt that will settle his fate. For years, the motto of Ohio State football was \u201cthree yards and a cloud of dust\u201d: Biden seems to have concluded that the shortest path to the White House is three states and a cloud of dust through the industrial Midwest. In 2016, the Rust Belt was the epicenter of the Trump earthquake. He narrowly tipped Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by a combined 77,744 votes, dislodging them from the \u201cblue wall,\u201d the phrase I coined for the 18 states that had voted Democratic in at least each presidential race from 1992 through 2012. As an exclamation point, Trump scored blow-out victories in Iowa (which had voted Democratic five times over that period) and Ohio (which Democrats had won four times.) He even held down Clinton\u2019s margin of victory in Minnesota to fewer than 45,000 votes, the smallest cushion there for any Democratic nominee since native son Walter Mondale barely surmounted Ronald Reagan in 1984. Across the region, Trump dominated everything but the largest metropolitan centers \u2013 and even in most of those Clinton lagged from the pace set by Barack Obama in his 2008 and 2012 victories. Looking at all six states combined, Trump won 442 of their 496 counties, according to analysis by Polidata, a political data consulting firm. He flipped 98 counties that Obama had won in 2012. (Clinton won back just a single county that Obama had lost, Chester in the Philadelphia suburbs.) In preponderantly White rural regions across these states, from southwest Pennsylvania and southeast Ohio to northern counties in Michigan and Minnesota to western Wisconsin, Trump posted staggering advances over the showings of Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. He improved on Romney\u2019s margin of victory, for instance, by at least 30 points in the southeast Ohio counties of Meigs, Gallia, Monroe and Washington. Trump also posted big gains in blue-collar suburbs and smaller cities across these states. Obama had carried Macomb County, the prototypical White blue-collar suburb outside Detroit, in each of his two elections; Trump won it by nearly 50,000 votes. Trump flipped the counties centered on Dubuque in Iowa, Racine and Kenosha in Wisconsin, and Erie and Wilkes-Barre in Pennsylvania; Obama had won each of those mostly White and blue-collar communities twice. Trump vastly expanded Romney\u2019s margins in the blue-collar counties surrounding Pittsburgh (including Beaver, Washington and Westmoreland) and slashed the Democratic advantage in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Janesville, Wisconsin, Davenport, Iowa, and Youngstown, Akron and Toledo in Ohio. In all, Trump improved by at least 10 points on Romney\u2019s vote share in fully 138 counties across the region, according to Polidata\u2019s analysis. Clinton generally ran well in counties with large numbers of college-educated professionals. She expanded on Obama\u2019s 2012 margin in booming Dane County, Wisconsin (which includes the University of Wisconsin and the state capital of Madison); Washtenaw in Michigan (which includes the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor); Franklin County in Ohio (which combines the state capital of Columbus and Ohio State University); and Iowa\u2019s Johnson County (which houses the University of Iowa). She pushed the Democratic margin in the four big suburban counties outside of Philadelphia to nearly a combined 190,000 votes, up about 65,000 votes from Obama\u2019s showing four years earlier. But Clinton lagged in almost all the region\u2019s big diverse urban centers, where Democrats rely on large turnout from Black voters. Compared with Obama in 2012, her margin of victory dropped by about 90,000 votes in Wayne County, Michigan (Detroit), 44,000 votes in Cuyahoga County, Ohio (Cleveland), 17,000 votes in Philadelphia and 15,000 votes in Milwaukee. Combined with Trump\u2019s blue-collar breakthroughs, that erosion doomed her in the three blue wall states, which effectively decided the election. Trump\u2019s sweep through the Rust Belt exposed the inherent vulnerability of Democrats in the region as the currents reshaping the electorate have quickened in recent years. In a process that predates Trump but has intensified under him, Republicans have gained ground among White blue-collar and rural voters while losing support among college-educated Whites, minorities and young people (particularly after the first millennials, later joined by Generation Z, entered the electorate around 2000). The fundamental challenge for Democrats in the Rust Belt is that Whites without college degrees remain a much larger share of the vote there than in the contested states across the Sun Belt. In 2020, non-college-educated Whites are expected to compose 60% of the voters in Iowa, 55% in Wisconsin, 52% in Ohio, 51% in Michigan and just under half in Minnesota (49%) and Pennsylvania (48%), according to projections by the nonpartisan States of Change project shared exclusively with CNN. By contrast, States of Change projects that those non-college Whites will represent only about two-fifths of voters in Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona and just around one-third in Georgia, Virginia and Texas. (States of Change is a research collaborative of three liberal-leaning groups \u2013 the Center for American Progress, the Brookings Institution and the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group \u2013 and the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center that studies the changing composition of the American electorate and its implications for policy and politics.) The Democratic success in Rust Belt presidential elections from 1992 through 2012, as I wrote in early 2016, \u201cdepends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else.\u201d Experts attributed that Democratic-lean to an assortment of factors, from the region\u2019s union tradition and a broader legacy of class consciousness across these manufacturing-heavy states to a smaller presence than in the South of fervently conservative evangelical Christians among the White working-class population. But Trump blew through all of the remaining bonds that had connected the region\u2019s White working-class voters to the Democratic Party. In 2012, exit polls showed Obama winning between 42% and 50% of Whites without college degrees in these six states. In 2016, the exit polls showed Clinton carrying no more than 38% of those voters in any of the six states, and in some cases less than one-third of them. (The States of Change estimates of voter preferences in these states put her number even slightly lower.) Clinton\u2019s showing with college-educated Whites matched or exceeded Obama\u2019s in all of these states except Ohio, the exit poll found. But her collapse among the region\u2019s huge population of working-class Whites proved fatal, especially when combined with slightly diminished margins and lackluster turnout relative to Obama among African American voters. There are just lots of people who seem to be tired of the rhetoric that comes out of the Trump campaign, particularly suburban women with younger kids. They don\u2019t want them growing up in an America where the president refuses to condemn White supremacists. What I think is even moderate Republicans may be willing to go out and vote for a moderate or center-left Democrat. Lauren Copeland, assistant professor of political science, Baldwin Wallace University Yet even the Rust Belt is not immune to the larger demographic changes reshaping the electorate across the country. Although Whites without college degrees still make up about half or more of the voters in all six of these states, in each case that number is down from 2004, when they represented about three-fifths or more, according to Census Bureau figures. Just from 2016 to 2020, States of Change projects, those non-college Whites will fall as a share of voters by at least 2 percentage points in each of these states. College-educated Whites, who are trending more Democratic, will grow slightly in each state as a share of voters and likely cast about one-third of the vote in all of them; non-Whites, including small but growing populations of Hispanics and Asians, will increase in almost all of them as well, though much more modestly than in the Sun Belt. Non-Whites, according to States of Change, will compose about 1-in-5 voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio, but only around 1-in-10 or less in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. (By contrast, voters of color may cast about two-fifths of the vote in many of the Sun Belt states.) All of this tilts the hill slightly, but perceptibly, away from Trump this time. The demographic divergence between the two parties has translated into a widening geographic divide across the region between town and country. In the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans generally remained strong across the region\u2019s rural areas. But the results provided a clear signal that the metro recoil from Trump apparent in 2016 is continuing, and even accelerating. Large urban and suburban counties provided huge margins for Democrats. In Michigan, Whitmer, en route to her gubernatorial win, won Oakland County by nearly twice as big a margin as Clinton had done just two years before. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf improved on Clinton\u2019s vote share in all four of the big suburban counties outside Philadelphia, as well as in Philadelphia and Allegheny (centered on Pittsburgh). Likewise, Democrat Tim Walz, while winning election as Minnesota\u2019s governor, improved on Clinton\u2019s vote share in the counties centered on Minneapolis and St. Paul as well as their suburbs.   Though the Democratic gubernatorial candidates fell short in Iowa and Ohio, the most Republican-leaning of these states, they significantly expanded on Clinton\u2019s vote share in the counties centered on Des Moines and Columbus, respectively. This wave, more mildly, reached even into Wisconsin, where the preponderantly White so-called WOW counties outside Milwaukee \u2013 Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington \u2013 have remained more resolutely Republican than almost any suburban counties outside the South. Yet even there, Democrat Tony Evers cut Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s margins by about 25,000 votes from 2014, while narrowly ousting him from office. Democrats are confident that this metropolitan recoil from the GOP hasn\u2019t peaked. Virtually all public polls in these six states show Biden winning a majority of college-educated White voters against Trump; Biden\u2019s share of them in these surveys generally ranges from just over 50% in Ohio to around 55% in Iowa and Michigan to around 60% or more in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Graul and other Republicans believe that concern about crime and disorder will help Trump stabilize his position in the suburbs. But observers from all points on the spectrum agree that he\u2019s facing towering discontent among suburban voters over his personal behavior and conduct, and his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThere are just lots of people who seem to be tired of the rhetoric that comes out of the Trump campaign, particularly suburban women with younger kids,\u201d says Lauren Copeland, an assistant professor of political science at Baldwin Wallace University near Cleveland who supervises a regular poll of the Rust Belt states. \u201cThey don\u2019t want them growing up in an America where the president refuses to condemn White supremacists. What I think is even moderate Republicans may be willing to go out and vote for a moderate or center-left Democrat.\u201d Private Democratic analyses of the early vote show that college Whites are voting more heavily than any other group, including both non-college Whites and voters of color. Those sentiments will likely translate into even greater turnout and Democratic margins in booming white-collar counties, such as Franklin, Ohio; Dane, Wisconsin; Oakland, Michigan; Polk (Des Moines), Iowa; and Montgomery, Delaware and Chester in Pennsylvania. Signs aren\u2019t as unequivocal, but Democrats are cautiously optimistic that Black turnout will recover at least somewhat from its 2016 decline. Adrian Hemond, a Michigan-based Democratic consultant, says there are red flags both about turnout and possible defection from Biden among younger Black men, but that among older African American voters the commitment to voting against Trump \u201cfrom the polling we\u2019ve done, particularly for Black voters over the age of 40, is very, very high.\u201d With Democrats poised to gain ground among college-educated White voters, and potentially turn out at least somewhat more Black voters, Trump\u2019s best hope of holding the critical states that decided 2016 \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 rests on him winning bigger margins and inspiring higher turnout than polls now expect among his base of non-college and rural Whites. There\u2019s certainly a big pool of possible voters for him to draw on: As political analyst David Wasserman has repeatedly noted, Whites without college degrees make up a majority of adults in each of those states who were eligible to vote in 2016 but did not. (That again contrasts sharply with most of the Sun Belt states, where non-Whites and college-educated Whites combined compose most nonvoters.) All public polls across the Rust Belt states show that Trump remains strong among Whites without college degrees. But polls show he\u2019s not quite as strong with them as he was against Clinton. With remarkable consistency, public polls across all six of these states show Biden winning about 40% of Whites without college degrees, sometimes slightly more, but more typically slightly less. While Trump generally retains dominant (if sometimes slightly diminished) leads among White men without college degrees, many of these polls show Biden running much more competitively than Clinton did among blue-collar White women. Among both genders combined, he\u2019s performing much better among working-class Whites in the Rust Belt states than he is in the Sun Belt, where polls usually show him attracting only about 30% of them or less. ELECTION 2020: Send us your stories about voting issues Tim Burga, president of the Ohio AFL-CIO, speaks for labor leaders and Democratic strategists all across the Rust Belt when he says that Biden, a 77-year-old Catholic born to a working-class family in Scranton, is much easier to sell to working-class White voters there than Clinton was. \u201cFour years ago, our members, too many of them voted for Trump. Maybe it was because they didn\u2019t like Hillary Clinton or maybe it was because they thought an outsider would shake things up or maybe he would deliver the promises he made\u201d about restoring American jobs, Burga told me. Now, he says, \u201cwe are having zero pushback whatsoever with Joe Biden as our endorsed candidate.\u201d The result, Burga predicts, is that \u201cwe are definitely going to move the dial in terms of non-college voters that voted for Trump moving over to the Biden column.\u201d I\u2019ve worked in Wisconsin politics now for nearly 30 years and I have never seen the kind of enthusiasm for a candidate that exists for Trump among his supporters. I think there is a level of loyalty and enthusiasm to him that is unique to any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen. Mark Graul, Republican strategist Paul Maslin, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Madison, says he expects such sentiments to translate into consistent gains for Biden relative to Clinton in the weathered, midsized manufacturing cities that proved so crucial to Trump\u2019s victories across the region last time. \u201cI think the same thing is happening all across the Midwest,\u201d Maslin says. \u201cWhen all is said and done, when we cut out the major metropolitan areas \u2026 in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, I would guess we are going to see net 5- and 10-point movement toward Biden across the board in these more working class small-town, small-city, rural, non-metro areas.\u201d One place to watch to see if this trend materializes: the so-called BOW counties (Brown, Outagamie and Winnebago) around Green Bay: They split about evenly in 2012 before shifting sharply toward Trump in 2016, but Democrats are optimistic Biden can narrow or eliminate that lead in 2020. Graul, the Wisconsin-based GOP consultant, will be watching those counties closely, too. Their smaller cities and somewhat more blue-collar suburbs, he says, could be the tipping point between the two divergent poles that are emerging in the state. On one side, Democrats are benefiting from exploding margins in Dane County and shrinking deficits in the Milwaukee suburbs; on the other, he says, Trump is positioned to generate massive turnout from his rural and small-town strongholds in western and northern Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Wisconsin politics now for nearly 30 years and I have never seen the kind of enthusiasm for a candidate that exists for Trump among his supporters,\u201d Graul says. \u201cI think there is a level of loyalty and enthusiasm to him that is unique to any candidate I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Between those offsetting strengths, the BOW counties, and other smaller cities, could decide the outcome, he says. Another Republican strategist working with the Trump campaign, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal planning, likewise told me that maintaining the President\u2019s advantage among blue-collar voters in those midsized and rural communities all across the Rust Belt remains his key to victory. Big suburbs in the Rust Belt, as in the Sun Belt, will likely be tougher for Trump than in 2016, this adviser acknowledges, but \u201cthe belief is you counterbalance that with the sons and daughters of Reagan Democrats\u201d \u2013 in other words, blue-collar workers who grew up in households that once reliably leaned Democratic. \u201cSeniors and these blue-collar workers in Rust Belt states \u2013 those are what the race is coming down to,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cIt\u2019s really Donald Trump on the ballot. For these people, on one hand it\u2019s temperament and on the other, it\u2019s his agenda and does he have our backs? I think that\u2019s the question he is going to have on Election Day.\u201d Democrats maintain a wary respect for Trump\u2019s capacity to mobilize his voters to the polls, as evidenced by their close attention to the high level of participation among non-college Whites in the early voting. But even if Trump can generate more turnout than pollsters expect among his small-town and rural supporters, he faces the likelihood that turnout will also rise in more populous areas, diluting the potential impact of his new voters. \u201cI guarantee you they are not coming out in some massive droves compared to a 29-year-old young couple in Madison. \u2026 They are going to vote, too,\u201d says Maslin. (Madison, in fact, is already returning mail ballots at a record pace.) Big numbers for Biden in the big places would leave Trump with a very narrow path. If Biden, for instance, matches Whitmer\u2019s expanded margin from 2018 in Michigan\u2019s populous and prosperous Oakland County, says Hemond, the stark question facing Trump is \u201cWhere do you go to make up those votes?\u201d Given the nature of each party\u2019s contemporary coalition \u2013 with Republicans gaining among blue-collar and non-metro Whites while losing ground among the well-educated and diverse populations that concentrate mostly inside metro areas \u2013 the large number of working-class Whites in the Rust Belt states mean that Democratic candidates are unlikely to win them through the 2020s as reliably as they did in the two decades from 1992 through 2012. That reality will create growing pressure on Democrats in the years ahead to break through in the growing and diversifying states across the Southeast and Southwest. But Biden\u2019s candidacy may offer Democrats a unique, if perhaps temporary, opportunity to turn back the clock in the Rust Belt. As a result, in its final days, his campaign remains focused on the same three burly, heavily blue-collar states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that have been central to his strategy since he held his first rally in a union hall near Pittsburgh. \u201cThe tipping point states right now are the tipping point states most of us would have guessed this time last year,\u201d says Democratic consultant Michael Halle, who ran the battleground state operation for Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cNot a whole lot has changed. The best path for Biden is to win those three states and you are there.\u201d",

Election Day is still 16 days away and more than 27 million ballots have already been cast, according to a survey of election officials by CNN, Edison Research, and Catalist.   Voters in the 45 states and the District of Columbia that make pre-Election Day data available are already setting records. The ballots cast so far represent almost 20% of the more than 136 million total ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election. Some of the voter information comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations and is giving new insights into who is voting before November. Early in-person voters in Georgia have already cast more than 1,450,000 ballots as of Sunday afternoon. That\u2019s up 152% from 2016 when 578,147 ballots were cast during the same period. As of Friday, ballots are available in all 50 states and DC. In-person voting will kick off in a slate of critical swing states in the coming days. Nevada opened early in-person voting on Saturday with more than 17,800 voters casting their ballots in Clark County, which houses Las Vegas. One polling location in North Las Vegas opened two hours late due to a \u201chardware issue,\u201d Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin told CNN. The issue created long lines that circulated on social media, but was the only problem reported by the county as 48 in-person polling sites opened for the first day. Attention shifts to Florida on Monday, when 52 of state\u2019s 67 counties begin early voting \u2013 including in critical counties like Broward, Duval, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. All counties begin early voting by October 24 at the latest. It\u2019s pretty clear that President Donald Trump has very few paths to the White House without winning the state. It\u2019s possible, but it isn\u2019t really realistic. (Build your own electoral map here.) So far in Florida, more than 2.4 million votes have been cast by mail, which is about 261,000 ballots shy of all the vote-by-mail ballots cast in 2016. Of the 2.4 million ballots received so far this year, 30% are from registered Republicans, 49% Democrats and 20% No Party Affiliation. And while Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the state by about 134,000 registered voters, their lead has dropped significantly in recent years. In 2016, that gap was more than 327,000 and in 2012, it was more than 535,000. As for registered voters by race, this time around 61.5% are White, 17.3% are Hispanic and 13.4% are Black. In 2016, the breakdown was 64.2% White, 15.7% Hispanic and 13.4% Black. In Wisconsin, early voting begins on Tuesday. The state played a central role in Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, with rural and working class voters leading the rejection of Democrats throughout the Upper Midwest. Four years later, however, the state remains a key battleground, but one where Trump is trailing in the most recent polls. Here\u2019s the full rundown of where voting expands across the country in the coming days, plus some deadlines: Early voting begins in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho and North Dakota. Drop boxes open to accept mail ballots for the general election and Voter Services and Polling Centers open in Colorado. Early voting begins in some Florida counties, including Broward, Miami-Dade, Duval and Palm Beach. Deadline to apply for mail/absentee ballot in Maryland, Nevada and New Mexico. Early voting begins in Hawaii, Louisiana, Utah and Wisconsin. Deadline to apply for mail/absentee ballot in Missouri (request by mail). Early voting begins in West Virginia. Deadline to apply for mail/absentee ballot in Indiana. Deadline to apply for mail/absentee ballot in Arizona, Idaho, Nebraska (ballot by mail), New Jersey, Virginia (ballot by mail), Texas and Utah.

            "article_content": "Women and men of all ages arrive well before opening. It is midmorning in the middle of the week, but a lengthy line of people patiently waiting forms outside a country home painted to look like an American flag, near a 14-foot Donald Trump cutout on the front lawn. As the clock strikes 11 a.m., Trump House owner and creator Leslie Rossi arrives and is greeted with applause. \u201cWelcome to the Trump House!\u201d she bellows. The Trump House is a big attraction for the President\u2019s supporters in southwest Pennsylvania, where Trump\u2019s record turnout four years ago helped deliver his surprise Pennsylvania victory, and the White House. Independently run by supporters, the house draws out the rural voters who helped Trump win the state four years ago, a feat he hopes to repeat this year. Trump was the first Republican to win Pennsylvania in nearly three decades. With more than 6 million votes cast here, he defeated Hillary Clinton by little more than 44,000 votes. Now, with the President struggling in the suburbs here and nationwide, the Trump campaign is trying to squeeze even more votes out of his base in places like here in Westmoreland County, which has seen a surge in GOP voter registrations since the President took office. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cWe need to increase our voter turnout here for the President. Places like Westmoreland and some of the other counties out here in the west end of the central part of the state. He\u2019s going to count on us to pull those numbers in, to offset some of what might be happening in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania,\u201d said Kim Ward, a GOP state senator who represents this area. Democratic nominee Joe Biden is popular in the densely populated area of Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs in southeastern Pennsylvania, areas that are critically important to Biden\u2019s strategy. Finding even more Trump voters in rural Pennsylvania is a steep challenge, considering the President already won far more votes in this part of the state in 2016 than any Republican had in decades. But at the Trump House, Rossi, who spent countless hours in 2016 pushing disaffected Democrats and never-before voters to choose Trump, says she sees an uptick in passion for the President here. \u201cFour years ago, my work was really hard here,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cI had to convince them President Trump was the best choice for them. This time, I don\u2019t have to do any of that. They\u2019re all in,\u201d she insisted. Rossi said the number of people coming to the Trump House \u2013 where they can get free hats, pens, shirts and yard signs \u2013 has tripled since the last election, showing her logbook of thousands of visitors in the past few months alone. \u201cWe have already a sign, and we\u2019re going to put another one there, and we support him all the way,\u201d Norene Cinti told CNN. But many also come to register to vote and change their party affiliation. Rossi has forms ready and helps people fill them out. Scott Harrer got a break from his construction job to come wait in line so he could register to vote for the first time at age 65 because he likes the President so much. \u201cI  think it\u2019s going to be shaky. I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of problems. So the stronger we come in, the less chance of losing pretty much in my opinion,\u201d said Harrer. Rita Bair came to formally change her party affiliation. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I was a Democrat. I want to be with the Republicans right now, because I think Donald Trump is doing an absolutely wonderful job,\u201d she said. Evelyn Ross says she voted for former president Barack Obama twice but went for Trump in 2016 and hasn\u2019t looked back. \u201cI was a Democrat. My parents were Democrats. I changed in 2016 to Republican, because I didn\u2019t like what the Democrats were doing. I didn\u2019t like Hillary. And I liked everything that Trump said. I\u2019m not sorry that I changed. I\u2019ll be Republican for the rest of my life,\u201d said Ross. In 2016, Clinton, who followed the traditional Pennsylvania playbook of boosting support in the densely populated suburbs, did not campaign in more rural areas like Westmoreland County during the general election. Joe Biden is trying to learn from her mistake, coming through here on a train trip after the first presidential debate. His wife, Jill Biden, split off during their train tour with her own campaign events in order to reach more of this pastoral part of Pennsylvania. Outside Rizzo\u2019s Malabar Inn, she talked to a socially distanced small group of local Democrats, promising that they will not be forgotten. She talked to local leaders and the owners of Rizzo\u2019s about how they\u2019re faring during the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign marked spots where supporters could stand during the event to ensure they were complying with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay 6 feet apart. In a brief interview, she did not dispute that she was standing in Trump country. Trump won Westmoreland County by 56,853 votes. In prior presidential elections, Republicans also won the county but lost the state: In 2012, Mitt Romney won the county by 40,210 votes, and McCain in 2008 won it by 29,573 votes. \u201cIt is, but I\u2019m sure the Trump people are disillusioned. That\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d said Biden. \u201cWe are not taking any vote for granted,\u201d she added. Walking through leafy Latrobe, Westmoreland County Commissioner Gina Cerilli explains that this may be a Republican stronghold, but it is also Mister Rogers\u2019 neighborhood \u2013 where Fred Rogers, the famed host of the children\u2019s TV series, grew up. She says that four years ago, people here were willing to take a chance on Trump, but now she has a lot of neighbors who quietly regret it. \u201cThis is a working middle class here in Western Pennsylvania. In 2016, Donald Trump was a fresh face. He was new to politics. Everyone was excited. He made big promises to bring back jobs, but frankly, Donald Trump broke those promises,\u201d said Cerilli. Ten years ago, Cerilli was Miss Pennsylvania in Trump\u2019s Miss USA pageant. Now she is an elected Democrat working to defeat him. She and other Democrats in this part of the state are clear-eyed that Trump will still win southwest Pennsylvania, but they hope that keeping the margin of his victory down here could rob the President of a statewide win. \u201cDonald Trump changed the political game here in Pennsylvania four years ago. I\u2019m just very thankful that the Democratic Party, Joe Biden has realized that all of these little communities matter,\u201d said Cerilli, who added that Biden can\u2019t just rely on Philadelphia or Pittsburgh if he wants to win the state. \u201cHe has to be able to come here, meet the residents of Western Pennsylvania, these small, small towns, and that\u2019s how he\u2019s going to win Pennsylvania and we\u2019re going to flip to blue.\u201d Trump signs are everywhere, displayed proudly outside many homes and farms. But Biden signs are out there too, which matters in Trump country \u2013 showing potentially disaffected Trump voters that they\u2019re not alone. Democrats here say it\u2019s a big difference from 2016, when Clinton signs were harder to find. \u201cHillary really didn\u2019t resonate with the voters here in Western Pennsylvania. Joe has. It also has to do with the fact that President Trump has been in power for four years and we see how divided our country is,\u201d said Cerilli. Southwest Pennsylvania is rich in energy production, especially what\u2019s known as fracking, or hydraulic fracturing \u2013 a drilling method that uses water to extract oil and gas from the ground and is popular in this area because it produces jobs. The President and fellow Republicans are playing up the issue in a big way here, hoping it galvanizes voters. \u201cOne of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry,\u201d Trump told a crowd Tuesday night in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles from Westmoreland County. Trump has accused Biden of wanting to ban fracking, which is not true. Biden has explicitly said he does not support a nationwide ban; rather, his plan proposes banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, a move that would not end all new fracking or end existing fracking on public lands and waters. But even Democrats here worry the false attack is potent. \u201cFracking is huge here. Coal is huge here. There\u2019s a lot of jobs in Western Pennsylvania,\u201d said Cerilli, calling GOP commercials playing here that claim Biden wants to ban fracking \u201cflat-out lies.\u201d It is true that many in the Democratic base oppose fracking, calling it a hazard to the environment. Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate, supported a fracking ban when she ran for president during the Democratic primaries but told CNN last month that she is falling in line behind Biden\u2019s position. But Republicans here think the issue resonates with Democrats who may not think the national party understands their lives in rural America. \u201d \u2018Fracking is evil. We\u2019re going to kill coal.\u2019 When you hear all of that, the people here, this is what we do. We work here. This is a really hardworking area. And that is a turnoff, when you have somebody coming in, especially the national party and those national candidates coming in and threatening those jobs,\u201d explained Ward, the GOP state senator. A big challenge for Democrats in getting out the vote is that they have been very careful in the age of Covid-19. Volunteers like Phyllis Friend, head of Democratic Women of Westmoreland, would normally be out and about in the final weeks before Election Day, but now she uses Zoom and other virtual means to organize from home. \u201cEverybody\u2019s doing what they can from home. \u2026 I think sometimes, maybe some people could do actually more from their house, so looking at making lemonade out of lemons, right?\u201d Friend asked rhetorically. \u201cSo far, I haven\u2019t heard anybody say, \u2018I wish you\u2019d knock on my door.\u2019 \u201c Last weekend, the Biden campaign started what it calls \u201csafely\u201d canvassing, an effort that follows safety measures such as providing volunteers with masks, checking their temperatures and having them fill out a symptom questionnaire. But Republicans never stopped knocking on doors all throughout the pandemic. CNN followed GOP canvassers around the neighborhood of Greensburg in Westmoreland County. Wearing masks, they used a data-driven app run by the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign to target specific homes with individualized messages. \u201cWith our data program and all the investments we\u2019ve been able to make into our data, we know what kind of messaging that we need to make sure that we are getting to each and every voter. Depending on who that voter is, we\u2019re able to tailor that message at the door and on the phone to how we think we need to target that voter and turn them out,\u201d explained Brittney Robinson, who runs the Pennsylvania operation for the RNC. Part of the get-out-the-vote operation for both parties is educating voters about mail-in ballots, which is new in Pennsylvania this year, to help make it easier for voters in the pandemic. Even as the President is talking them down and falsely claiming mail-in ballots are riddled with fraud, his campaign is working hard to convince his voters to use the new system. \u201cThis is the first general election that we are going to have a mail-in ballot that is not restrictive. We can make sure that we are taking advantage of it with our voters, making sure that they are using these opportunities they have to vote in every different way. Especially during uncertain times, we want to make sure that we\u2019re educating our voters on that,\u201d said Robinson. Westmoreland County Republican Chairman Bill Bretz insists there are more GOP votes to mine in this part of Pennsylvania, but he admits the element of surprise that Trump benefited from here in 2016 is gone. Still, the stakes are higher than ever. \u201cThe Democratic Party is investing a lot in this area as well, so it raises the bar for us. We have a responsibility to our state and our nation to deliver for Donald Trump,\u201d said Bretz.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have taken very different positions on a range of policy issues. Hear from Trump and Biden in their own words how they would tackle the problems facing the United States. Biden\u2019s plan to address the pandemic includes offering free testing to all Americans. It calls for hiring 100,000 people for national contact-tracing, as well as increasing drive-thru testing sites. He is also urging Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of protective equipment for health care workers, testing supplies and other items. Biden\u2019s plan includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. The former vice president also said he would call Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shortly after being declared the winner of the general election to ask him to remain a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Biden has said he would mandate that everyone wear a mask in public. In January, as the coronavirus outbreak began, the White House formed a task force that included Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the US Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States. In February, the US began implementing stringent travel restrictions in an effort to contain the outbreak, which included temporarily denying entry to foreign nationals who had visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival in the US. Public health officials in Trump\u2019s administration have urged Americans to practice social distancing and wear masks to slow the spread of the virus, but Trump himself has been reluctant to wear a mask in public. The President said that he didn\u2019t believe making masks mandatory across the country was necessary, but said in July that he is \u201call for masks\u201d and that he \u201cthinks masks are good.\u201d Trump has repeatedly downplayed the need for increased testing, and told supporters at a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that Covid-19 testing was \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d \u201cWhen you do testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people,\u201d he said during the rally. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019 \u201c Biden\u2019s health care plan would greatly expand Obamacare\u2019s subsidies to make the private insurance policies available on the exchanges more affordable. The plan would also create a new \u201cpublic option\u201d similar to Medicare that people could buy into. \u201cWe\u2019re going to add to it a public option. And the public option says whether you are having employer-based insurance or private insurance, or you\u2019re in the exchange, you can join up for a Medicaid-Medicare-like provision in the law and not dump 300 million people on Medicare all of a sudden,\u201d he said in July 2019. Biden added that those covered by employer-based health insurance plans could also choose the public plan if they prefer it. \u201cYou can sign up and get this other plan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you like (your private insurance), you\u2019re able to keep it.\u201d Trump on September 24 laid out what he called his \u201cvision\u201d for health care in America, but the two executive orders Trump said he was going to sign fall far short of a comprehensive proposal. Trump said he was signing an executive order to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, even as Trump and Republican lawmakers attempt to try to tear down the Affordable Care Act that already protects them.\u00a0The second executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing by the end of the year, and if lawmakers don\u2019t achieve this, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will seek to do so via executive or regulatory action. Trump campaigned against the Affordable Care Act on the runup to his presidency. While the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal the law, Trump has taken a number of executive actions to undermine it, including making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have fewer protections and benefits. The administration is also seeking to invalidate the landmark health care law through the courts. Trump has promised to reduce drug prices and unveiled a blueprint to do so in 2018. Bucking long-standing Republican beliefs, the President is pushing to allow drug importation, particularly from Canada, and to tie the price of drugs in the US to their cost in other developed nations. However, several of his efforts have been stymied, including requiring drug makers to include their list prices in TV ads, which was nixed by a federal judge in summer 2019. In an effort to lower health care costs overall, the administration also issued a rule requiring hospitals to post the rates they negotiate privately with health insurers, starting in 2021. A coalition of major hospital groups took legal action to block the requirement. Boosting the middle class is one of the main pillars of Biden\u2019s campaign. He has said the country needs to build an economy that \u201crewards work, not just wealth.\u201d Biden wants to repeal the tax cuts enacted by the Trump administration and is pushing for a $15 minimum hourly wage, eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and expanding access to affordable education, including free community college. Biden\u2019s plan to address the coronavirus pandemic also includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. In an interview with CNN in July 2019, Biden said he would raise the top individual income tax rate to 39.5% and raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Biden has detailed a moderate proposal to use government purchasing to spur manufacturing in sectors including clean energy, infrastructure and health care. He has also proposed new tax credits for those who care for children, seniors and disabled people. Biden said he would build tens of thousands of new child-care facilities as part of a plan to bolster what his campaign called the \u201ccaregiving economy.\u201d Biden\u2019s climate plan also aims to spur the creation of millions of new jobs and focuses on infrastructure. His climate plan is part of a series of economic plans aimed at jump-starting an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Congress passed and Trump signed the largest emergency aid package in US history on March 27 in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The roughly $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus package included, among a myriad of other items, direct financial assistance to Americans. A large part of the stimulus package is the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses if at least 75% of the money goes toward payroll expenses. During an interview with Politico on April 25, Biden argued that another stimulus package was needed and should be \u201ca hell of a lot bigger\u201d than the CARES Act. On March 18, Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief package. The package included provisions for free testing for Covid-19 and paid emergency leave for certain people impacted by the coronavirus, with payments capped at $511 a day. It also increased Medicaid funding, certain tax credits, and expanded food assistance. There are many critics of these programs and packages and a good deal of evidence that some of the funds did not go to those Americans and small businesses most in need. Trump\u2019s major economic policy achievement in office was the 2017 tax cut, which drastically reduced rates for individuals and businesses \u2013 but led to a rise in the federal budget deficit to nearly $1 trillion in fiscal year 2019, undermining a campaign promise to not just shrink deficits but eliminate the national debt altogether by the end of a second term. Biden has said he does not support calls to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d which picked up steam after the police killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, as well as others. But he does support some of the principles the phrase\u2019s advocates champion. Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates has said that Biden supports \u201cthe urgent need for reform \u2013 including funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing \u2013 so that officers can focus on the job of policing.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has said he backs proposals to increase spending on social programs separate from local police budgets, but he also wants more funding for police reforms such as body cameras and training on community policing approaches. Biden has called for an additional $300 million in funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which would allow more officers to be hired and would pay for training on community policing approaches. Trump has declared himself \u201cyour President of law and order\u201d amid nationwide protests over systemic racism and police brutality in America. He has lambasted efforts to defund police departments and has said police were owed respect for their work. In June, he signed an order to enact modest reforms in a move to confront the outcry over police brutality, including a tracking program that will encourage localities to submit information on officers who have been fired or found in court to have used excessive force. The Justice Department will also direct federal grants toward police departments that are credentialed for having use of force and de-escalation policies and banning the use of chokeholds, except when lethal force is authorized. Working with federal health officials, the department will increase training on programs that pair social workers with police to answer mental health and homelessness calls. The Justice Department\u2019s political leadership under the Trump administration has endorsed a policing policy that prioritized stamping out a national uptick in violent crime and boosting the morale of street cops, who the Trump administration claimed had been antagonized under the Obama era. Biden has said he will push to ban so-called assault weapons if elected. In a New York Times op-ed, Biden \u2013 who helped lead the effort to ban assault weapons in the 1990s \u2013 wrote that the United States has a \u201chuge problem with guns,\u201d and that assault weapons, which he defined as \u201cmilitary-style firearms designed to fire rapidly,\u201d are a threat to US national security. He also told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that he would push for a federal gun buyback program in an attempt to take more weapons off the streets. He supports universal background checks, and said assault weapons \u201cshould be illegal. Period.\u201d In the first Democratic presidential debate, Biden called for \u201csmart guns\u201d \u2013 requiring manufacturers to include biometric measures that would block firearms from being used by those whose fingerprints aren\u2019t registered for that specific gun. He has also focused further on gun manufacturers. \u201cOur enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA. The gun manufacturers,\u201d he said at the debate. In the wake of mass shootings throughout his presidency, Trump has vowed action on gun violence, including expanding background checks. But he has been vague on the details, and has repeatedly pointed to mental health and hate as the underlying issues. After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Trump order the Department of Justice to ban bump stocks, attachments that effectively make semi-automatic rifles fire continuously. The ban became effective in March 2019. The President has backed \u201cred flag\u201d gun laws on the state level, which enable those who have seen warning signs to seek court orders to intervene and prevent someone who is in crisis from temporarily having access to firearms. Biden supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He has also called on Congress to immediately grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. At the first Democratic presidential debate in June, Biden said that undocumented immigrants with no criminal records \u201cshould not be the focus of deportation.\u201d In an interview with CNN in July 2019, Biden said he opposes decriminalizing crossing the border without documentation, something other candidates in the field have supported. \u201cI think people should have to get in line, but if people are coming because they\u2019re actually seeking asylum, they should have a chance to make their case,\u201d Biden said. During his 2016 campaign, Trump proposed the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, and has made it a tenet of his immigration policy as President. After taking office, he issued an executive order suspending the entry of people from a number of Muslim-majority countries for 90 days; the order went through several iterations in court before it was upheld. The administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy in 2018 \u2013 criminal prosecutions of adults who illegally crossed the border \u2013 resulted in thousands of family separations at the border as parents were detained. Under a court order, the government must identify and reunify certain separated children. The President has proposed a merit-based immigration system, establishing a points-based system for green card holders and restricting sponsorship to spouses and minor children. Trump also officially ended Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children, a decision that has now been taken to the Supreme Court. Biden has proposed an education plan that would increase funding for schools in low-income areas, help teachers pay off student loans and double the number of health professionals working in schools. A core element involves tripling federal Title I funding for schools that serve low-income areas, closing what his campaign called a $23 billion funding gap between majority white and nonwhite school districts. In October 2019, Biden unveiled a plan that would cut student loan debt obligations, waiving $10,000 per year \u2013 for up to five years \u2013 for those in public service work, like teachers or members of the military. He would also guarantee that those earning less than $25,000 owe nothing on their undergraduate federal student loans, while everyone else\u2019s payments would be capped at 5% of their discretionary income above $25,000 \u2013 halving the current 10% cap. His plans heavily emphasize executive action. Biden said at an American Federation of Teachers forum in Houston in May 2019 that \u201cthe bulk of\u201d his education proposals can become law even if Republicans maintain control of the Senate after the 2020 elections. Trump, as President, has vowed to fix student loan debt. As directed by an executive order, the Department of Education published new data in November 2019 about graduates\u2019 income and debt levels aimed at helping students make more informed borrowing decisions before choosing colleges. The White House has also made loan forgiveness automatic for veterans with disabilities and urged Congress to include place a cap on student loan borrowing. By contrast, it has repeatedly proposed ending a student loan forgiveness program for public workers, but Congress has rejected those efforts. The administration has pushed for a school choice tax credit known as \u201cEducation Freedom Scholarships,\u201d which students could use to attend public or private schools, including charters, outside of their districts. It has rescinded a number of Obama-era policies, including those that promoted racial diversity in schools and protections for transgender students in public schools that let them use bathrooms and other facilities corresponding to their gender identities. It has also rolled back two rules that were intended to hold for-profit colleges accountable. A central argument of Biden\u2019s campaign for president is that the former Vice President has extensive foreign policy experience from his eight years serving in the White House and from traveling the globe as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In June, Biden pledged to undo President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves in a speech in which the former vice president laid out how he would seek to restore pre-Trump international norms and \u201cplace America back at the head of the table.\u201d The centerpiece of Biden\u2019s effort to return to international cooperation is a summit that Biden said he would call among the world\u2019s democracies, non-governmental organizations and corporations \u2013 particularly tech and social media companies \u2013 to seek a common agenda to protect their shared values. Such a summit would push companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2013 where Russian trolls reached American voters during the 2016 election \u2013 to combat challenges such as surveillance, censorship and the spread of hate speech. While in the Senate, Biden voted to authorize the war in Iraq in 2002. Like other Democrats who voted yes, Biden has spent the years since apologizing for it as the conflict became increasingly unpopular with the American public and Democratic voters. Trump has made a series of unpredictable moves on trade, including the imposition of tariffs against allies like the European Union. Trump has also engaged in a two-year trade war with China, imposing an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs that have hit American farmers, importers and manufacturers. He announced plans to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement, an Obama-era trade deal among a number of countries, soon after taking office in 2017. Preferring bilateral deals, he signed a new trade pact with Japan in 2019 \u2013 but it was no better for American ranchers and farmers than the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have been. His administration also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trade pact with Canada and Mexico. The countries have since agreed to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but it is pending ratification by the US Congress. Biden in July 2020 proposed spending $2 trillion over four years on clean energy projects and ending carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In a speech detailing the plan, Biden called the threat posed by climate change a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy.\u201d The plan marks a clear shift by Biden toward progressives\u2019 goals of urgently reducing fossil fuel consumption to combat climate change. Biden\u2019s new proposal is more ambitious than the 10-year, $1.7 trillion plan he\u2019d offered during the Democratic primary, which included the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. His proposed 100% clean electricity standard by 2035 is modeled after a proposal initially offered by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and later embraced by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The same aim was included in a series of recommendations recently negotiated by a task force made up of members appointed by Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and co-chaired by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a chief proponent of the Green New Deal. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord \u2013 a landmark 2015 deal on global warming targets \u2013 was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US \u2013 which can legally leave the agreement as early as 2020 \u2013 would not be leading the global fight against climate change. Trump\u2019s EPA chief has said that while he believes in climate change, it is not a top priority. The administration shrunk two of Utah\u2019s national monuments. It has also pushed to open Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters along the East and Pacific coasts. Under the Trump administration, the EPA announced it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors to detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump on Monday launched a three-week quest to save his presidency, behaving as though the pandemic that has killed 215,000 Americans was already a memory in front of a packed-in crowd \u2013 even amid chilling new warnings about the resurgent virus. In his first rally since his own bout with Covid-19, Trump painted a deeply dishonest picture of the nation\u2019s battle with the disease, mocked former Vice President Joe Biden over social distancing and vowed victory on November 3 as he began a frantic push to Election Day, marked by multiple rallies a day that could act as superspreader events. \u201cI feel so powerful, I\u2019ll walk into that audience. I\u2019ll walk in there, I\u2019ll kiss everyone in that audience,\u201d Trump said in Sanford, Florida, showing his illness did not teach him to respect his own government\u2019s pandemic guidelines. \u201cI\u2019ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women and the \u2013 everybody. I\u2019ll just give everybody a big, fat kiss.\u201d The President\u2019s return to the campaign trail coincided with rising alarm among Republicans about Trump\u2019s sliding poll numbers and after CNN reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently warned Democrats are \u201con fire.\u201d Biden on Monday seized on the start of confirmation hearings from Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett to warn that the GOP was ramming through the nomination in a last ditch bid to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Fiery exchanges between Trump and Biden came on a day when the enthusiasm in the electorate and the impediments some Americans must overcome to exercise their democratic rights was underscored by hours-long waits to cast ballots at the start of in-person early voting in Georgia, now a presidential and Senate battleground. Lines snaked around buildings and there were glitches at one supersite in Atlanta. A total of 126,876 Peach State voters cast their ballot on Monday, a record for the first day of early voting. Extremely long lines of voters lined up in Suwanee, a suburb of Atlanta, went viral on social media leading some Democrats to raise allegations of \u201cvoter suppression.\u201d At his Florida rally, Trump fed off the large crowd\u2019s energy during his hour-long performance and ran through his demagogic list of favored political attacks, from law and order to his false claims of voting irregularities. He took the stage hours after the White House physician said he posted negative Covid-19 tests in consecutive days. \u201c(Biden) may be the worst presidential candidate in history and I got him,\u201d Trump said, despite a flurry of recent polls showing him down by double digits to the former vice president and trailing in most swing states. Biden campaigned Monday in Ohio, a state once seen as a surefire bet for Trump that Democrats think is now in play, and synchronized his message with Capitol Hill colleagues using the Barrett nomination to supercharge claims that she would be a vessel to finally kill off Obamacare, which faces its next date with destiny in the court a week after the election. \u201cIn the middle of this pandemic, why do Republicans have time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of providing the significant economic need for localities?\u201d Biden asked. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why. It\u2019s about finally getting his wish to wipe out the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Biden also rebuked Trump for his \u201creckless\u201d conduct since his diagnosis, saying: \u201cThe longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he seems to get.\u201d In news about the presidential race, coronavirus overtakes nearly all else Taken in isolation, Trump\u2019s rally looked like any other big campaign event three weeks before an Election Day. While some supporters wore masks behind him in the camera shot, many people in the big, outdoor crowd did not. And despite presiding over a botched pandemic response, Trump claimed he had saved millions of lives. After turning his White House into a superspreader event that caused multiple infections, the President also criticized Biden for holding socially distanced events in which attendees sit in designated circles. \u201cThey only have the circles because that\u2019s the only way they can fill up the room,\u201d the President said, before gazing out at his own large and raucous crowd that contravenes every government recommendation on combating the virus and saying: \u201cThese are the real polls.\u201d But medical experts expressed despair at Trump\u2019s decision to gather huge crowds during a worsening pandemic, ahead of a swing that Trump aides said Monday would involve multiple rallies each day in the coming weeks. \u201cI promise you, the virus is there, whether it is an indoor event or an outdoor event in these large gatherings,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of health policy and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University on CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett \u201cOutFront,\u201d who added that the images of Trump\u2019s rally made him \u201cweep.\u201d \u201cSome of those people will become sick, they will spread it to others when they get home and they will become sick. These are accelerator events that promote the distribution of the virus,\u201d Schaffner said. Trump\u2019s mockery of his own government\u2019s recommendations \u2013 his rallies are almost the only mass participation events taking place in the world right now \u2013 came amid fast darkening warnings about the months ahead. The government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned that rallies like the one Trump held on Monday night are \u201casking for trouble.\u201d \u201cBecause when you look at what is going on in the United States, it is really very troublesome,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Later, Fauci delivered an even more dire warning about a pandemic that is seeing rising cases in 31 one states as a fall spike \u2013 that is effectively being ignored by a negligent White House \u2013 begins to gather pace. \u201cI think we\u2019re facing a whole lot of trouble,\u201d Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, referring to coronavirus infections which have recently climbed back above 50,000 a day. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad place to be when you\u2019re going into the cooler weather of the fall and the colder weather of the winter,\u201d Fauci said. Dr. Anthony Fauci hopes worrisome numbers jolt Americans to take steps to stem spread of Covid-19 Trump\u2019s claim to have saved millions of lives is based on the presumption that there would have been many more deaths had no counter-measures been taken against the disease \u2013 a scenario no one was seriously advocating. New research on Monday exposed the President\u2019s misinformation and showed in staggering clarity how the US has done far worse than many other industrialized nations in saving lives during the pandemic. After May 10, the US had more deaths per 100,000 people than other high mortality countries featured in a study published in the medical journal JAMA. Countries including South Korea, Japan and Australia recorded fewer than five deaths per 100,000 people. If the US had comparable death rates to Australia since the beginning of the pandemic, it would have had 187,661 fewer deaths, according to the study conducted by Alyssa Bilinski, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, vice provost of global initiatives and professor at the University of Pennsylvania. If the US had comparable death rates to Canada it would have had 117,622 fewer deaths. And it would have recorded 96,763 fewer deaths if it had comparable death rates to France. McConnell warns Democrats are 'on fire' as GOP falls behind on fundraising and polling In the CNN Poll of Polls on Monday, Biden led Trump by 11 points. Fresh New York Times/Siena surveys in battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin released Monday showed the Democrat up 6 points and 10 points, respectively. Trump is hoping to use his return to the campaign trail to portray himself as triumphing over Covid-19 and to solidify his assurances to Americans there is nothing to fear from the disease, despite its rising nationwide threat. The President \u2013 who has rarely tried to reach beyond his political base \u2013 is counting on a massive turnout not just from his 2016 supporters but also from new working class white voters who identify with him culturally but who have rarely cast a vote in previous elections. Trump\u2019s rally on Monday was for instance peppered with comments about the \u201cPanhandle,\u201d the portion of northern Florida where he performed especially strongly in 2016. CNN White House reporter Kevin Liptak reported Monday that Trump is pressing his advisers to organize multiple rallies in the next few weeks as he tries to unleash a late wave of momentum to overhaul Biden. The President is pining for two and three events a day \u2013 which in the circumstances could turn into multiple superspreader events \u2013 to revive the spirit of his push up to his shock victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. But there are signs that the GOP hierarchy in Washington is not seeing the similarities with 2016, with some seeing Trump\u2019s antics, including a boorish performance at the first presidential debate, as giving Democrats a golden opportunity to grab both the White House and Senate. McConnell delivered his warning about Democrats being \u201con fire\u201d in a call with lobbyists recently, according to someone familiar with the remarks. Senate Republicans who never expected to have a serious challenge, such as Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and Joni Ernst in Iowa, are at serious risk. Graham, who as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman is leading the Barrett hearings, is facing a challenger, Jaime Harrison, who just shattered the single quarter fundraising record for a Senate race with $57 million. And Trump\u2019s itinerary for later this week also indicates a campaign playing defense as he travels to Iowa, Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2013 all states he won four years ago and where he is in danger of losing now.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: An earlier version of this story was published September 28 before the first presidential debate. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the presidential and vice presidential debates this year. Three, along with the vice presidential debate. They\u2019re all at 9 p.m. ET. They\u2019ll all last approximately 90 minutes and run without commercials on networks and cable news outlets. Pretty much anywhere, but please watch CNN or stream at CNN.com. The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden was Tuesday, September 29, at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio. Read about what happened. Still coming: It\u2019s not exactly clear when Trump first contracted Covid and it is possible he was positive when he debated Biden in Ohio. But it\u2019s clearly infected the White House since numerous staffers and journalists have contracted the disease, including Stephen Miller, the Trump aide who is married to a top Pence staffer, who previously tested positive. So one major difference you\u2019ll see for the vice presidential debate in Utah is acrylic glass shields on-stage near Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence. The shields supplement the 12-foot separation the candidates will maintain on-stage. Pence, who has tested negative for the virus, balked at the precaution but ultimately backed down. First presidential debate - Chris Wallace of Fox News Vice presidential debate - Susan Page of USA Today Second presidential debate (the town hall) - Steve Scully of C-SPAN Third presidential debate - Kristen Welker of NBC News Chris Wallace, the first debate\u2019s moderator, came under criticism for not being able to control Trump\u2019s repeated interruptions of Biden and breaking of debate rules. Susan Page, USA Today\u2019s Washington bureau chief, might not encounter the same problems since Trump won\u2019t be on the stage. She\u2019s the first print reporter selected by the Commission on Presidential Debates to moderate a session. And she\u2019s interviewed six sitting presidents. However, she has faced some scrutiny for hosting a \u201cGirls Night Out\u201d party for Medicare administrator Seema Verma, a Pence ally, at her home. This information is taken from the Commission on Presidential Debates website, debates.org. First presidential debate \u2013 Six segments of approximately 15 minutes each From debates.org: \u201cThe moderator will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Candidates will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. The moderator will use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic.\u201d Vice presidential debate \u2013 Nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each The commission\u2019s note on this debate\u2019s format is the same as the first debate, except it omits the line: \u201cCandidates will then have an opportunity to respond to each other.\u201d Second presidential debate \u2013 This is a town hall featuring questions posed by members of an audience of citizens from the South Florida area From debates.org: \u201cThe candidates will have two minutes to respond to each question and there will be an additional minute for the moderator to facilitate further discussion. The town meeting participants will be uncommitted voters selected under the supervision of Dr. Frank Newport, Senior Scientist, Gallup.\u201d Third presidential debate \u2013 Six segments of approximately 15 minutes each The format will be the same as the first debate, according to debates.org. A grace note or a well-delivered one liner can be very effective, too. Palin crossed the stage to shake Joe Biden\u2019s hand and asked if she could call him Joe. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle he was no Jack Kennedy after Quayle tried to compare himself to JFK. Retired Admiral James Stockdale, running with outsider Ross Perot, asked aloud, \u201cWho am I? Why am I here? I\u2019m not a politician.\u201d But it was Ronald Reagan, the former actor, who put on the master class. \u201cThere you go again,\u201d he chided Jimmy Carter, shaking his head after Carter accused him of wanting to cut Medicare. And in his closing he asked the key question of presidential campaigns when he put it to voters, \u201care you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d It was their only debate and it was a week before Election Day. Nope. And there was a move among some Democrats, like Nancy Pelosi, to get Biden to skip the debates and rob Donald Trump of an opportunity to lie and misrepresent facts on a national stage. Biden rejected the idea and promised to be a \u201cfact checker on the floor.\u201d Conversely, Trump\u2019s campaign at one point threatened to not take part because of bias among possible moderators. But they were bluffing. Questions about the debates have only increased since Trump\u2019s aggressive interrupting during the first debate. It\u2019s also not clear if the President\u2019s medical condition will allow him to debate Biden in the weeks to come. No. The gold standard for debates were the 1858 sessions between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, although at the time they were squaring off for a Senate seat (Douglas won). They ran against each other in the presidential race in 1860 (Lincoln won). Lincoln and Douglas: The title match of titans Those debates are hard to imagine in today\u2019s media. Each man got an hour for an opening statement. Then they each got a half hour to rebut. The first televised debates took place in 1960 and Nixon did poorly in that format, which probably helped contribute to a lack of debates in the \u201964, \u201868 and \u201872 election years. Last-minute and fraught negotiations preceded the debates in \u201876, \u201880 and \u201884, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates has organized every general election debate since the 1988 general election. (Primary debates are a different matter and often organized by news networks working with political parties). It\u2019s got a bipartisan board and set of co-chairs. The chairman, Frank Fahrenkopf, is a co-founder of the commission and was RNC chairman in the 1980s. Dorothy Ridings is a former president of the League of Women Voters and an executive at philanthropic organizations. Kenneth Wollack is a former president of the National Democratic Institute. Yes. Big time. Nielsen, which tracks TV ratings, reported that 73 million people watched Trump and Biden\u2019s first debate. That\u2019s less than the 84 million people watched the September 27, 2016, debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump. But those numbers only reflected people who watched the debate on one of the 13 TV networks that broadcast it, not the growing number of people who stream the debate online. Fewer people usually watch vice presidential debates, but it will still be tens of millions. The most-watched vice presidential debate was between Biden and Palin in 2008, when 70 million people tuned in on TV. That Clinton/Trump debate set a new record, eclipsing the 80 million people who watched Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter in their 1980 debate. It was also well above debates between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Americans who don\u2019t watch live will still hear about the debate from news coverage and in their social media feeds after the fact. There\u2019s no evidence that debates lead to wide swings in public opinion. But presidential elections are decided by relatively close margins. It\u2019s possible for a candidate to survive a bad debate performance, as Barack Obama did when he bombed (Seriously. It was bad.) against Mitt Romney in 2012. Separately, a bad debate performance can, in hindsight be blamed for a razor-thin loss. Al Gore was unlikeable and overly dramatic, sighing on the debate stage. He still won the popular vote and lost the election. Richard Nixon was shifty and sweating on the debate stage in 1960, so that\u2019s baked into the fact that he lost. But he lost by a historically slim margin. Donald Trump loomed weirdly behind Clinton in 2016, but that didn\u2019t cost him the election. Further complicating things this year is that a large portion of the country is voting early \u2013 either in person or by mail \u2013 and will cast their votes before debate season ends. Gaffes are often the things that stick in the public consciousness. Gerald Ford denying there was Soviet Domination in Poland in 1976 made him look completely out of touch. George H.W. Bush checking his watch during a town hall made it look like he wanted to get out of there. Saturday Night Live\u2019s recreation of whatever happens can eclipse the debate itself, as it did with Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in 2008 and the question over whether you can see Russia from Alaska.",

            "article_content": "As states begin to mail ballots to voters, on-time delivery of first-class mail is plummeting across the US, according to new Postal Service documents submitted to a federal court. The USPS documents show first-class mail\u2019s on-time delivery performance for the week of September 19 sank to 84.23%, a decline of 4.51 percentage over two weeks. That means the nationwide on-time delivery score for first class mail are nearing lows seen in July and August, when the agency experienced significant delays because of significant changes to postal operations. The on-time delivery of first-class mail has taken on even greater significance in October because election mail, like ballots, are handled as first-class mail. Of the 28 states that are sending ballots to voters, 43% of them are seeing the worst on-time delivery of first-class mail so far this year. All but two of those the states have seen their first-class mail\u2019s on-time delivery drop over the last two weeks. The USPS blamed a portion of the drop in the last week to issues at the Great Lakes and Chicago Surface Transfer Center, but did not elaborate on what the problem was. \u201cTo address this issue, support teams have been on site and are working with contracting teams to increase staffing and reduce cycle times,\u201d the postal service said in a statement. The continued drop in on-time delivery threatens to undermine the USPS\u2019 and embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\u2019s promises to Americans, Congress and to federal judges that the USPS will be able to handle the surge in mail from ballots. Six of the seven USPS regional areas are seeing a drop in their on-time score for first class mail delivery. The nationwide drop is due largely to a profound and region-wide collapse of on-time first-class mail delivery in the eastern United States. How to track your mail-in ballot Although first-class mail on-time performance scores are cratering, the nationwide on-time delivery scores for marketing mail and periodicals increased from mid-July and early August. Periodicals are now delivered on-time 79.72% of the time, up from under 70% in early August. Marketing mail is on-time 88.68% of the time, up from 81% in early August. The USPS did not respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries as to why only first-class mail on-time delivery had decreased. CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump took four years of personal venom and outright lies and stuffed it all into 90 minutes of chaotic sparring with former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday night \u2013 a performance that, for all its sound and fury, even his allies said afterward was unlikely to change the dynamic of a contest that polls show he is losing. One of the biggest issues Trump has faced in the polls: a large gender gap. \u201cThe main thing keeping an anvil on Trump\u2019s head in terms of job approval all this four years has been women. He does fine among men, but women have never given him high marks,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a longtime adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and CNN contributor. \u201cAnd I cannot imagine he did anything tonight that any female viewer who was thinking about supporting him would have appreciated.\u201d Trump played to his committed base of support with repeated interruptions and bitter attacks on Biden, who shot back, beseeching the President to allow him to finish his sentences. The disjointed product was another dispiriting chapter in a general election campaign marked by them. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling. The debate showcased Trump as he has been since his entrance to the presidential arena, employing the same tactics that helped launch him to the White House. The issue for Trump, however, it that the bluster that helped win him in 2016 is shaping up as a disadvantage this time around. \u201cNarrowing the gender gap,\u201d said a Republican operative actively working on GOP congressional campaigns, \u201capparently is a concept foreign to Trump and his strategy team.\u201d In the process of blitzing Biden, Trump only affirmed the fundamentals of the race \u2013 one in which he is trailing the former vice president, according to both national and swing state polling, with women voters and moderates who say they have been turned off by his personal behavior. For the first hour, Trump glared at Biden and cut him off repeatedly, steamrolling the moderator, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. \u201cTrump has one speed. He always has. He always will. If you like it, you\u2019ve liked it from Day One. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re voting for Joe Biden,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a former top operative as the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cIt was jarring but not surprising.\u201d Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican close to the President who helped prepare him for the debate, said Trump was \u201ctoo hot.\u201d First 2020 presidential debate \u201cListen, you come in, decide you want to be aggressive and I think that was the right thing to be aggressive, but that was too hot,\u201d Christie said on ABC. \u201cAnd so I think that what happens is, with all that heat \u2026 you lose the light. That potentially can be fixed. Maybe, maybe not.\u201d Trump has tried to close his gap with women by focusing on the suburbs, believing that those living outside America\u2019s largest cities, who broke from Republicans in the midterms two years ago, can be reeled back in with a blunt message on safety and security. But Trump\u2019s message to them has been delivered in barely coded racist appeals, including claiming that efforts to increase affordable housing in the suburbs represented an existential threat. \u201cIf (Biden) ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he wants to run it, our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you would see problems like you have never seen.\u201d Biden was prepared for the line. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn,\u201d he said of the President. \u201cI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don\u2019t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated.\u201d Trump was on the offensive from the outset, ignoring the debate\u2019s rules and cutting off Biden, who bristled but could not wrest control from the President. Instead, he attempted \u2013 when he could \u2013 to address viewers directly, breaking the fourth wall to make his points. But Trump would not let down. \u201cDonald,\u201d an exasperated Biden asked at one point, \u201cwould you just be quiet for a minute?\u201d He would not. Biden\u2019s frustration boiled over at times, too, but even his outbursts \u2013 \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d \u2013 were subsumed by Trump\u2019s relentless nitpicking and petty aggressions. When Biden said \u201ca lot more people are going to die (of coronavirus) unless (Trump) gets a lot smarter a lot quicker,\u201d Trump ignored the mention of the pandemic and focused on the personal slight \u2013 mocking Biden\u2019s alma mater, the University of Delaware. \u201cYou graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don\u2019t ever use the word smart with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever use that word. Because you know what? There\u2019s nothing smart about you, Joe.\u201d Biden laughed it off, saying, \u201cOh, give me a break.\u201d Trump also assailed Biden\u2019s younger son, repeatedly, with a volley of largely unfounded or exaggerated attacks on his personal dealings overseas. He also zeroed in on the Hunter Biden\u2019s past drug use. \u201cMy son, like a lot of people you know at home, had a drug problem,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cHe\u2019s overtaken it. He\u2019s fixed it. He\u2019s worked on it. I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d Trump, momentarily quieted, heard Biden\u2019s words, then \u2013 unmoved \u2013 immediately ran back through his attack lines. Distaste with Trump\u2019s debate antics were front of mind in conversations with a CNN panel of undecided voters in suburban Columbus, Ohio, especially with women in the group \u2013 including one who said the style of Trump\u2019s performance overshadowed a message she liked. \u201cIt is so distracting. I found I was agreeing with a lot of what President Trump was saying, but it is not what he says, it is how he says it,\u201d Maria said. \u201cAnd it is so distracting, and he is saying it when he is not supposed to be saying it, and I am finding myself being swayed against him, not toward him, even though I believe in what he is saying.\u201d There was at least one potential upside for Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to drive down turnout in the election. Typically, and as he did later on in the debate, those efforts are framed by his questioning the validity of some mail-in ballots. But the nature of the debate might have accomplished his goal in another way \u2013 by turning off voters, potentially disengaging them from the process, as they recoiled at the sour tone of the night. \u201cI just thought it was exhausting,\u201d Jaclyn, one of the undecided voters, said. \u201cIt was, like two children fighting.\u201d She added: \u201cI came here to really try and learn and have an open mind and try and decide who I really wanted to vote for and hear their opinions rather than what social media had to say, and I just felt like I was just watching two people argue.\u201d While that dynamic might satisfy Trump\u2019s agenda, it could also trickle down \u2013 and cast a pall on Republicans running for seats in Congress and in state legislative races. \u201cIf I were a Republican elected official, if I was someone running for office right now, I would be pretty mad at him,\u201d former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said on CNN. \u201cHe indulged himself tonight.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s campaign at 9:20 a.m. ET on Thursday called a \u201clid\u201d \u2013 a term used to inform reporters that the Democratic presidential nominee wouldn\u2019t be making any public appearances for the rest of the day. It was no surprise: Biden had told reporters the day before that he was devoting Thursday to preparing for his first debate with President Donald Trump next week. But it meant Biden would be on the sidelines as the nation erupted in controversy, with a Supreme Court seat on the line, widespread protests over the police involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, not facing charges related to her death, and Trump refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses in November. And it was a drastic contrast to Trump, who traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday afternoon to deliver a speech focused on health care and then to Jacksonville, Florida, for a rally. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race In Jacksonville on Thursday night, Trump mocked Biden for calling an early lid. \u201cSupposing he never campaigns and he wins, you know how badly I\u2019m going to feel? I\u2019m working hard, and you\u2019ve got to work hard,\u201d Trump said of Biden. Trump and Republicans have sought to seize on Biden\u2019s relatively sparse schedule, accusing him of hiding in his basement \u2013 where his campaign in the pandemic\u2019s early days set up a camera so he could livestream events and sit for interviews. Some swing-state Democratic candidates and officials have privately complained that the lack of Biden events and his campaign\u2019s decision to eschew the usual door-to-door canvassing have put the party at a disadvantage. But Biden\u2019s aides argue that the former vice president is modeling the behavior public health officials advise in the pandemic \u2013 and that voters will credit him for a responsible approach. A look at seven days of campaign schedules for both Biden and Trump \u2013 this Monday through Sunday \u2013 underscores their divergent approaches: Biden is methodically targeting swing voters, but is willing to watch news cycles go by as he quietly prepares behind the scenes for big moments like the upcoming debate. Trump\u2019s flood-the-zone approach puts him on the campaign trail almost every day, making him a dominant factor in every news story \u2013 but often diluting his message as he ignites new controversies in front of crowds largely ignoring public health guidance amid the coronavirus pandemic. In that seven-day window, Biden has made two trips outside Delaware \u2013 and his campaign hasn\u2019t yet said whether any more are planned. On Monday, he visited Manitowoc, near Green Bay, Wisconsin \u2013 a region where Biden\u2019s campaign hopes to win back voters who supported former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but backed Trump in 2016 \u2013 to deliver a class-based message targeting Trump\u2019s economic record. He was at home Tuesday in Wilmington, attending virtual fundraisers. On Wednesday, he visited Charlotte, North Carolina, for an economic summit with Black small business owners, educators and workers \u2013 an effort to reach Democratic base voters in a state that has already begun voting. In both Wisconsin and North Carolina, Biden also gave interviews to three local television news stations, but did not take questions from the national press that travels with his campaign. On Thursday, he told reporters he was preparing for his upcoming debate with Trump at home in Wilmington, Delaware. And as of Thursday night, the only additional travel his campaign has announced through the weekend is a Friday trip to Washington, DC, to mourn the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Biden\u2019s campaign has long made clear it is willing to withstand the jeers about his public schedule, and doesn\u2019t see the former vice president as needing to respond to every Trump attack or position himself as a major player in every national news story.   Instead, aides said the campaign has sought opportunities to drive a message that will reach and appeal to swing voters in key regions \u2013 such as his economic speech in Wisconsin, and other recent events focused on the auto industry in Michigan; veterans in Tampa; Hispanic voters in Orlando \u2013 without diluting or distracting from that message. Justin Nickels, the Democratic mayor of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, who met Biden when he visited Monday, said he knew Democrats who would like to attend a campaign rally in person \u2013 but that they understood the pandemic makes the usual presidential campaign schedule of several large rallies a day through the fall impossible. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to a Packer game every single year of my entire life, and this year I can\u2019t. I\u2019m disappointed, but at least I know I can watch it on TV. And that\u2019s probably the best analogy for Wisconsin right now,\u201d he said. Aides argued that modeling the behavior recommended by public health experts during the pandemic \u2013 keeping events small and socially distanced \u2013 matters to voters. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s super-spreader events only serve to confirm to voters that Trump still refuses to take this pandemic seriously, even after it\u2019s taken 200,000 American lives and wrecked our economy,\u201d Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. \u201cWhile Trump plays politics with our health, Joe Biden is showing the American people how he would lead as President: listening to the experts, acting responsibly, and doing everything in his power to get this virus under control.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign responded by noting that Biden\u2019s campaign travel is a relatively recent development \u2013 he was largely off the campaign trail from the pandemic\u2019s beginning in mid-March through the Democratic National Convention at the end of August. \u201cIf meeting with Americans across the country wasn\u2019t important, why have Joe Biden\u2019s handlers suddenly decided the candidate should occasionally leave his basement to see voters?\u201d said Trump campaign spokeswoman Courtney Parella. Trump, meanwhile, has been much more visible: He visited Ohio on Monday, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, visited Florida and North Carolina on Thursday and is set to visit Virginia, Georgia, Florida and Pennsylvania over the following three days. Republicans said Trump\u2019s in-person campaign rallies drive spikes in voter registration and in the GOP base\u2019s enthusiasm that could pay off for the President and down-ballot Republican candidates. \u201cWinning campaigns inspire people,\u201d said Dallas Woodhouse, the former executive director of the North Carolina GOP. \u201cI think you feel that when Trump does these events, and you know, he\u2019s figured out a way to do outside and shorter. \u2026 You can just feel some energy coming off of those things.\u201d He often attacks Biden on the campaign trail. But Trump also often ignites controversies that dominate headlines from those rallies and events: On Monday in Ohio he continued to downplay the impact of coronavirus. In Pennsylvania on Tuesday, he made a racist attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia. On Wednesday, he refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses to Biden. The President appears to be targeting a different group of voters than Biden: his base, which polls show is overwhelmingly White and largely consists of men without college degrees. His approach to the fall campaign suggests his campaign views its path to victory on November 3 as requiring a stronger turnout from his largely rural, white base to make up for erosion since 2016 among suburban, older and independent voters \u2013 and that it believes the way to reach those voters is a show of force, delivering packed, raucous crowds and the backdrop of Air Force One in spite of the pandemic. The cost of that approach is that much of the local and national news coverage of Trump\u2019s rallies has focused on the reality that his crowds are closely packed together and largely not wearing masks. After an event in Henderson, Nevada, where Trump\u2019s campaign ignored the state\u2019s social distancing rules banning large indoor gatherings, the Nevada company that hosted the rally faced a $3,000 fine. Trump\u2019s campaign has largely ignored criticism that his rallies could spread the coronavirus. \u201cPresident Trump and I trust the American people. We truly do believe in this freedom-loving nation that the American people know how to look after themselves, look after their families, and look after their neighbors and look out for the future of this country,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told ABC on Wednesday when asked about the rallies.",

            "article_content": "Kanye West\u2019s presidential campaign has shelled out nearly $1.5 million to a secretive consulting firm in Arizona \u2013 a brand new one, explicitly devoted to independent campaigns but run by a man with a long history of controversial work for Republicans. Though the firm shows up in campaign finance reports with an address in downtown Tempe, its office doors are emblazoned instead with the name of another company: Lincoln Strategy Group, a GOP consulting firm. The man behind that company has an outsized reputation in politics, despite the fact that he has so far stayed below the radar in his work for the West campaign. Kanye West isn't going to be president, but his unconventional bid forges on Nathan Sproul, Lincoln Strategy Group\u2019s founder and a longtime Republican operative, has a history of working for the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign. Some of his companies have also faced fraud allegations over the course of 15 years, leading to investigations in a handful of states, a Federal Election Commission investigation, charges against a handful of former employees and a messy breakup with the RNC. Sproul, though, has always emerged unscathed legally and neither he nor his companies has ever faced charges. He says his latest company \u2013 called Fortified Consulting \u2013 was formed to help independent campaigns. \u201cLike its candidate, KANYE 2020 transcends traditional partisan labels and alliances to promote its vision of creating a culture of life,\u201d Sproul said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are proud to serve as a member of Kanye West\u2019s team because we believe voters deserve choices in the upcoming election.\u201d But Sproul\u2019s work for the West campaign \u2013 and his long track record of working for Republicans \u2013 lends credence to the notion that the West campaign is working to siphon votes from Democratic nominee Joe Biden and boost President Donald Trump\u2019s chances of reelection. West\u2019s campaign, which has been bolstered by Republican operatives nationwide, isn\u2019t holding events or hammering home an agenda with voters. Instead, it appears solely focused on getting on the ballot in as many states as possible. The Trump campaign has denied it has any involvement in West\u2019s presidential bid. West has suggested he will soldier on even though the millions of dollars he has dumped into the race has so far managed to get him on the ballot in just 12 states. Mathematically, the rap superstar cannot win the presidency. He is on the ballot, however, in battlegrounds such as Minnesota, Iowa and Colorado. \u201cI\u2019m running because I was hit with the idea to run in 2020,\u201d West said in a recent interview on the \u201cCannon\u2019s Class\u201d podcast. \u201cNow, the outcome is up to God.\u201d West, via his representative, did not respond to a request for comment. This election cycle, allegations have emerged across the country of the West campaign submitting fake signatures, duping voters into signing petitions supporting West or, in an instance in Wyoming, telling voters that a signature for West would take votes away from Biden. Sproul\u2019s firm has been handsomely compensated by the West campaign for its key role in ballot access work, but public records do not reveal which firms are working for West in which states. None of the complaints popping up around West\u2019s campaign have been directly linked to Sproul or his company, though they are the sort of claims Sproul has faced before in his long history working for Republicans. Sproul denounced the scrutiny his firms have repeatedly faced during election cycles, saying, \u201cEvery four years our efforts on behalf of presidential campaigns are subjected to a predictable series of scurrilous and defamatory political attacks designed to score cheap political points.\u201d Evidence of Sproul\u2019s past status as a well-connected Republican political operative is on display in the lobby of his second-floor office suite in downtown Tempe. It\u2019s in the form of a framed letter on White House stationary from a top adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThank you for the advice and friendship you have so generously given me during my years here,\u201d Karl Rove, a key figure in the Bush White House, wrote to Sproul in 2007. \u201cI appreciate your generosity, candor and kindness.\u201d Over the past three decades, Sproul\u2019s companies have hauled in millions for voter registration, polling and political consulting. It\u2019s the kind of behind-the-scenes work that can make or break campaigns. But Sproul has on occasion found himself in the spotlight \u2013 and not for good reasons. In 2004, Sproul\u2019s firms \u2013 prior to Fortified and Lincoln Strategy \u2013 faced allegations that, while running voter registration drives, they destroyed Democrats\u2019 registrations and forged registration cards. The complaints set off investigations in Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, according to news reports, government documents and CNN interviews. In Oregon, Sproul and Associates was the subject of a voter registration fraud investigation by state and federal authorities. The investigation delved into dozens of alleged improprieties, including a claim by a woman who said she and her husband filled out registration cards at the same time \u2013 him as Republican; her as Democrat \u2013 but that only he received a ballot in the mail. Investigators traced the husband\u2019s registration back to a subcontractor for Sproul\u2019s company but found no evidence that the worker registered the wife. Legal challenges swirl around Kanye West's attempt to mount an independent presidential bid \u201cThere is, however, no evidence indicating what happened to the registration card or establishing affirmatively that [the worker] knowingly or intentionally discarded or destroyed it,\u201d according to the report. Sproul\u2019s firm was cleared of any wrongdoing, according to an 11-page letter by a lawyer with the Oregon Department of Justice, which also notes that the investigating agencies in other states \u201cclosed their investigations with no criminal prosecution.\u201d But Erik Wasmann, the attorney in charge in Oregon, cautioned that the widespread practice of paying registration workers via a \u201cbounty\u201d system as opposed to an hourly rate created an incentive for potential fraud and abuse. Under the bounty system, a Sproul subcontractor said she was only paid to register Republican voters and those of other affiliations who said they would vote for Bush for president, the letter stated. The system, Wasmann wrote, provided an incentive for falsifying registration information in order to get paid, and for discarding accurate cards that wouldn\u2019t result in payment due to the voter\u2019s political affiliation. Eight years later, Sproul came under scrutiny again, this time in Florida. Elections officials in Palm Beach County flagged more than 100 suspicious voter registration forms linked to a Sproul company called Strategic Allied Consulting, according to press reports. Potentially problematic forms associated with the firm were discovered soon after in several other Florida counties, according to press reports and records from the Florida investigation. The Republican Party of Florida, which paid one of Sproul\u2019s firms \u2013 Strategic Allied Consulting\u2013 $1.3 million to register and turn out voters, filed a complaint against the company with the state Division of Elections. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation that, according to a 2014 article in the Palm Beach Post, \u201cincluded a close look at whether Sproul\u2019s company orchestrated fraud.\u201d Among the allegations: that Sproul\u2019s workers had been coached not to sign up Democrats and were provided with a vetting question to weed out supporters of Barack Obama. Several workers were charged with crimes, including a Palm Beach County man accused of fraudulently registering a string of family, friends and co-workers who later told investigators their registrations were bogus. All three admitted wrongdoing. Two received probation and one was sentenced to 10 days in county jail, records show. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement cleared Sproul and his company of any wrongdoing, according to an FDLE report summarizing the investigation. \u201cThis investigation revealed no evidence of a conspiracy between SAC employees and management to commit voter registration fraud,\u201d states the FDLE report. \u201cAll employees of SAC were provided with training on Florida law relating to voter registrations, and the investigation determined that those employees identified as possibly having completed fraudulent voter registration applications did so independently and of their own volition.\u201d At the time, Sproul also had contracts with the RNC and Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. Both dropped Sproul\u2019s firm. Then-RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said at the time, \u201cWe have zero tolerance for allegations of impropriety.\u201d When the late Rep. Elijah Cummings \u2013 the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee at the time \u2013 called on Sproul to submit documents and answer questions before Congress, Sproul refused. The Palm Beach Post reported at the time that Sproul appeared to be taking the scrutiny in stride. \u201cUnfortunately, the system we have in place doesn\u2019t lend itself to people learning the truth. Not when screaming and lies get much more news coverage,\u201d Sproul told the Palm Beach Post. Sproul told CNN this week that each time his companies have come under legal scrutiny, \u201cWe have consistently cooperated with authorities to address these false charges and every investigation has shown that allegations against the leadership of Lincoln Strategy Group are completely without merit.\u201d Fast forward four years and Sproul\u2019s team was back in lockstep with the RNC. In 2016, the Trump campaign shelled out $600,000 to one of Sproul\u2019s companies for door-knocking services, the campaign said at the time. The RNC paid the company some $1.2 million, according to press reports at the time. Sproul\u2019s creation of Fortified in the waning months of the 2020 presidential campaign is not the first time he formed a new company at the 11th hour. Strategic Allied Consulting, the company investigated in Florida, was formed in Virginia five months before the 2012 presidential election. Sproul told the Los Angeles Times back then that he was asked by the Republican National Committee to form a new company with a new name to avoid being linked to earlier bad publicity. An RNC spokesman told the paper that he \u201chad no knowledge of Sproul\u2019s assertion that the RNC wanted to conceal his identity\u201d according to the article. This time around a complicated paper trail links Sproul\u2019s new firm in with existing business. FEC records show Fortified\u2019s address in Tempe is the same address as Lincoln Strategy. But there are no business records for Fortified on file in Arizona. Instead, it was created in Virginia and lists its \u201cprincipal office address\u201d as one that traces back to a mailbox service in Alexandria, Virginia. Sproul\u2019s name is nowhere to be found in the documents available on Virginia\u2019s State Corporation Commission website. Rather, the \u201corganizer\u201d is listed as a person CNN determined is a subordinate in another of Sproul\u2019s companies. The contact information on file at the mailbox service is the personal email address of another Sproul employee. Executives of Lincoln Strategy Group acknowledged that Fortified is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sproul\u2019s Lincoln Strategy Group, as is noted in the fine print on its website www.fortifiedconsulting.org. They said the decision to create a subsidiary under a different name was done purely for business reasons and had nothing to do with wanting to avoid bad publicity. Meantime, Fortified appears poised to rake in even more cash from the billionaire rapper. The campaign owed the company another $1.2 million, according to a belated campaign finance report filed in September. West\u2019s campaign has courted controversy since he jumped in the race in July. The billionaire fashion and music mogul has been a vocal Trump supporter, visiting the President in the Oval Office and donning a Make America Great Again hat, which contributed to suspicions that his campaign was little more than a spoiler to assist the President\u2019s reelection effort. His insistence on staying in the race, even though he has no chance of winning, has cemented that view. Critics claim that West, who said he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is being taken advantage of by Republican operatives. The disorder can cause swings between mania and depression and West has said he does not take regular medication for it. Practically, West\u2019s late start set off a scramble to get him on the ballot. Ballot access is a complicated state-by-state process with requirements such as filing fees or collecting a set number of signatures from voters saying they\u2019d like the option to vote for the candidate. Petition gathering is also an imperfect business. Campaigns hire consulting companies who often turn to contractors to do the actual signature-gathering, which can make it difficult to determine whether bad practices are the result of a rogue subcontractor or a top-down strategy. In the case of West\u2019s campaign, public documents do not reveal which consulting firms are working in which states. People familiar with the campaign acknowledged that Fortified was involved in ballot access effort across multiple states and the size of payments to Sproul\u2019s firm indicate it has played a key role in West\u2019s efforts. Sproul, meantime, declined to list the states where his firm took the lead. He did, though, insist that the allegations against the West campaign were trumped up by Democrats. \u201cThey are so intimidated by Mr. West\u2019s candidacy that they are willing to go to great lengths to block a prominent African American candidate from even appearing on the ballot,\u201d Sproul said in his statement to CNN. \u201cThis is an affront to our democracy and should concern anybody who values free and fair elections.\u201d Ballot access issues are commonly surrounded by legal challenges, but election lawyers said they were struck by how widespread the cases of the West campaign\u2019s sloppy \u2013 and in some cases possibly fraudulent \u2013 paperwork appeared to be. \u201cTo put it mildly, the petition was a disaster,\u201d said Scott Salmon, a New Jersey attorney with experience in election law. Salmon filed an objection to West\u2019s attempt to appear on the ballot and noted issues with hundreds of signatures on his petition. Some weren\u2019t actually residents of the state. And there were large groups of signatures that all appeared in the same distinct handwriting, Salmon said. \u201cI opened it to a random page, and I noted that half of the signatures on the page, above the \u2018i\u2019 was like a little circle,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cI don\u2019t know one person that does that much less 10 people in a row who happen to live next door to each other.\u201d West ended up withdrawing his attempt to appear on the ballot and a judge ruled that, due to deficiencies in his paperwork, he wouldn\u2019t have qualified. A person familiar with the West campaign said Fortified was not responsible for the ballot effort in New Jersey. In Virginia, a judge booted West off the ballot after deciding that a number of oaths the campaign had collected from people promising to represent West in the Electoral College, \u201cwere obtained by improper, fraudulent and/or misleading means.\u201d In one complaint, Virginia voter David Pincus said signature collectors approached him asking him to sign a petition to ban West from the ballot. \u201cThe man assured me that the petition was to keep Kanye West off the ballot and even joked that West should stick to music, not run for political office,\u201d according to Pincus\u2019 written declaration. In reality, it was a petition to allow West on the ballot and to agree to serve as an elector, according to Pincus\u2019 declaration. \u201cI was outraged that there would be two people in my neighborhood aggressively soliciting for signatures under false pretenses,\u201d Pincus wrote. In Wyoming, signature-gatherers asked voters to sign petitions to \u201ctake votes\u201d away from Biden, saying the petition would help Trump, according to reporters from the Casper Star-Tribune. In Wisconsin, one voter said they were told that they were signing a petition to \u201csupport increasing minority representation,\u201d according to a complaint filed there. Bait-and-switch allegations have also popped in Arizona and Kentucky, according to local news reports. \u201cWe require comprehensive training for all of our staff, subject our work to a rigorous verification process and have a zero tolerance policy for any employee violation of our standards to ensure that we are always following local, state and federal laws,\u201d Sproul said in the statement to CNN. While Sproul\u2019s firm has played an important role in ballot access operations, other firms have worked alongside it. A California firm called Let the Voters Decide also worked on ballot access issues for the West campaign in multiple states. The firm\u2019s founder, Mark Jacoby, has also faced past allegations of fraud. Back in 2008, Jacoby was arrested and charged with four felonies related to voter registration fraud. He ended up pleading guilty to a lesser misdemeanor voter registration fraud charge. Jacoby caught the attention of authorities that election cycle because of the signature gathering work his then-company, Young Political Majors, was doing. The company\u2019s work registering voters on behalf of the California Republican Party sparked a series of complaints. Voters said workers for Jacoby\u2019s firm had tricked them into registering as Republicans by telling them they were actually signing petitions for harsher penalties for child molesters, according to press reports at the time. Representatives for Jacoby have repeatedly insisted his misdemeanor plea is not relevant to his political work. \u201cKanye West hired Let the Voters Decide because it is an industry-leading, professional signature gathering company, with a reputation for being able to deliver on short timelines,\u201d Mark Jacoby said in a statement to CNN. \u201cMark Jacoby has more than two decades of experience qualifying ballot initiatives, referenda and candidates throughout the country. He has overseen the collection of tens of millions of signatures for political candidates and issues on both sides of the aisle over the years.\u201d Jacoby\u2019s firm did not perform work for the West campaign in New Jersey or Wyoming, nor did it work on the electors effort in Virginia, according to a representative for Jacoby. None of the allegations of fraud surrounding the West campaign have been directly tied to Jacoby or his firm. West has not been oblivious to the controversy surrounding his no-shot candidacy. In an interview with The New York Times, West was asked why he was continuing his candidacy since it was too late to make the ballot in every state and he was asked whether he was being exploited by Republicans. \u201cThe first question is incorrect as I am already on some ballots,\u201d West told the Times. He did not appear to directly address the question of exploitation. The musician has devoted little time to any sort of traditional presidential campaign after his South Carolina kickoff event morphed into an erratic and emotional speech. After the appearance, his wife, Kim Kardashian West, noted that her husband was living with bipolar disorder and asked the public for \u201ccompassion and empathy.\u201d In an interview on the \u201cCannon\u2019s Class\u201d podcast, West said he and others with mental illnesses are discriminated against. \u201cIt\u2019s a superpower,\u201d West said. \u201cI\u2019m not even gonna let y\u2019all tell me it\u2019s an illness because I\u2019m seeing the truth inside of a phony world.\u201d Two people familiar with West\u2019s campaign effort said his 2020 campaign may simply be a test run for a future presidential bid. \u201cWell, God has made unreal things happen,\u201d West said on the podcast, when asked if his 2020 presidential hopes were realistic. West added, \u201cI shall be president at some point in our lifetimes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is making a bid to win back White working-class voters around smaller cities and towns in the Upper Midwest from President Donald Trump, targeting them with a cultural and economic pitch that was on display Monday in Wisconsin. A trip to Green Bay \u2013 a leading example of the places Democrats have seen their standing erode over the last decade \u2013 offered a window into the Biden campaign\u2019s belief that he brings a unique appeal to places with Democratic and labor-heavy roots that rejected President Barack Obama in 2012 and then, by even larger margins, Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden in recent days has woven into his stump speech a contrast between his family\u2019s working-class roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and lack of an Ivy League degree, and Trump\u2019s gilded New York life \u2013 arguing that his policies would benefit the middle class while Trump\u2019s tax cuts and other economic policies have mainly aided the wealthy. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cGuys who think they\u2019re better than you. Guys who inherit everything they\u2019ve ever gotten in their life and squander it. Guys who stretch and squeeze and stiff electricians and plumbers and contractors working on their hotels and casinos and golf courses to put more bucks in their pocket.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race. Biden largely ignored major national stories \u2013 including the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and questions about whether Republicans will fill her seat before the presidential election is decided and, if Biden wins, before he is inaugurated. Instead, he kept his message focused on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy, while making the case that he can better relate to the struggles of the working class. \u201cI say it\u2019s about time that a state school president sat in the Oval Office. Because you know what? If I\u2019m sitting there, you\u2019re going to be sitting there too,\u201d said Biden, who earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Delaware and his law degree from Syracuse University. Supreme Court vacancy brings new urgency to battle for Senate control. Here's a look at the ratings Beyond Biden\u2019s core coalition of women, people of color and younger voters, polls have shown he is outperforming Clinton and, in many cases, Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection effort with suburban voters, who have swung heavily to Democrats in the Trump era, older voters, who have favored Republicans in recent presidential elections but now favor Biden, and independents. Another key group Biden is targeting: disaffected White working-class voters \u2013 the people with whom Trump needs to rack up an enormous margin of victory to win the election, and where Biden just needs to chip into Trump\u2019s advantage. Those voters are crucial in the industrial Midwest, as Biden seeks to improve Democrats\u2019 performance in smaller cities and towns in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and western Pennsylvania. A CNN poll of Wisconsin conducted September 9-13 found Biden with a 10-percentage-point lead among likely voters in the state, with 52% backing the former vice president and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and 42% supporting Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The poll found Biden trailing Trump by just 8 points, 43% to Trump\u2019s 51%, among White non-college graduates. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling. The Biden campaign\u2019s particular focus is White women without college degrees \u2013 a group an adviser said it believes is a more realistic target than White men without college degrees, who make up the core of Trump\u2019s political support. \u201cIt\u2019s the non-college women who have been very \u2018swingy\u2019 in Wisconsin, and I think that we actually are doing really well with those folks,\u201d said a Biden campaign adviser in Wisconsin. In an early September videoconference with reporters, Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and chief strategist Mike Donilon ticked through the campaign\u2019s strategic imperatives in swing states. On the bulleted list for Wisconsin, in addition to get-out-the-vote efforts: \u201cpersuade rural voters\u201d and \u201clean into the gender gap.\u201d Its map of target-rich areas included Milwaukee and the college city Madison. It also included the counties that are home to a series of smaller cities where Democrats\u2019 performance has slipped, and in some cases collapsed, in recent presidential elections \u2013 Green Bay, Appleton and Oshkosh in the state\u2019s northeastern portion, as well as Wausau in central Wisconsin and Eau Claire and La Crosse in western Wisconsin. The presentation underscored the Biden campaign\u2019s belief that the former vice president can bring voters in areas with Democratic roots and heavy labor union presences back into the party\u2019s fold. Barack Obama won Brown County, the home of Green Bay, in 2008. But he lost it narrowly in 2012 \u2013 and then in 2016, Trump defeated Clinton there by 9 percentage points. Neighboring Outagamie County, the home of Appleton, shifted from a 12-point Obama win in 2008 to a 13-point Trump victory in 2016. And just south in Winnebago County, home of Oshkosh, a 12-point Obama 2008 win slipped into a 7-point Trump 2016 victory. Biden \u201chas experienced some of these things that should speak to the poor folks who have lost businesses during the pandemic and all that\u2019s going on right now,\u201d said Mike Holmgren, the former longtime head coach of the Green Bay Packers and a Biden supporter, who said he has always voted but never before actively campaigned for a candidate in a presidential election. \u201cThat\u2019s why I feel very strongly about this election,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most important election of my lifetime.\u201d In recent weeks, Biden has tailored his message to appeal to those voters. He has touted stimulus plans that would inject hundreds of billions of dollars into manufacturing and a \u201cBuy America\u201d platform that would impose tax penalties on companies that send production of goods that are sold in the United States overseas. Outside Green Bay on Monday, he also warned that Trump\u2019s push to cut payroll taxes would gut funding for Social Security. Last Friday in Minnesota, Biden told reporters he believes he can do well with White working-class voters, and specifically pointed to blue-collar women as winnable. He said Democrats must \u201cfocus on the needs of everyone\u201d to improve their performance with White working-class voters, \u201cwhich we don\u2019t spend enough time doing.\u201d Ben Delie, 36, a union utility worker in Green Bay schools and a father of three, said he was hit hard when he was off work for two months, while his wife lost her part-time job for four months in the early throes of the pandemic. He said he does not believe that the President represents his interests. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the middle class and lower-class people support a president like Donald Trump and would vote for him again,\u201d Delie said. A lifelong Democrat who voted for Obama, he said he is concerned about the growing political divide in the country and believes the President is to blame. \u201cIt\u2019s not the 1-percenters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ones that got a house with kids in it, trying to do the grind every day.\u201d He paused before adding, \u201cThis needs to change because this political divide is just terrible right now.\u201d Sue Conard, a retired public health nurse in La Crosse, echoed Delie\u2019s sentiment. \u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t relate to middle-class, working people,\u201d she said. \u201cHere in Wisconsin, I know that we\u2019ve got people that are really listening what (Biden) is saying because he understands. He\u2019s got integrity. He\u2019s got empathy for the working class.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The battle for control of the United States Senate assumed fresh urgency Friday following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, drawing more intense scrutiny to several competitive down-ballot contests whose outcomes could have long-lasting consequences for all three branches of government. For President Donald Trump, the vacancy offers an opportunity to further reshape the court and bolster his legacy by installing a third conservative justice during his first term in office. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is up for reelection this November, has vowed to give the President\u2019s eventual nominee a vote, ensuring the showdown on the chamber\u2019s floor will extend to the campaign trail this fall. Interactive: Senate race ratings Republicans enter the election on November 3 holding a narrow three-seat majority in the Senate. Democrats need a net gain of four seats to win a majority in the Senate, but can take control by picking up three seats if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the presidency, since the vice president breaks ties in the chamber. Of the 35 Senate seats up for grabs in November, 23 are held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats. For the 2020 cycle, CNN is featuring race ratings for Senate and House contests from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, who is a CNN contributor. According to Inside Elections, six Republican-held Senate seats currently rate as Tilt Democratic or Toss-up. In Arizona, Sen. Martha McSally is running against Democrat Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, meanwhile, is facing off against former Gov. John Hickenlooper in a Democratic-leaning state. Both contests are rated Tilt Democratic. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2020 The four Toss-up races are all seats with Republican incumbents. They include Iowa, where Sen. Joni Ernst is running against businesswoman Theresa Greenfield; Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins is facing a tough challenge from state House Speaker Sara Gideon; Montana, where Sen. Steve Daines is running against Steve Bullock, the state\u2019s two-term incumbent governor; and, North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis is matched up against Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and Army reservist. Republicans are also defending five seats that are rated Tilt Republican or Lean Republican, including the unexpectedly competitive race between Sen. Lindsey Graham and Jaime Harrison in South Carolina, which Inside Elections moved in the Democrats\u2019 favor last week. Democrats are also benefiting from not having to play much defense this cycle. Of the dozen Democrats up for reelection this year, only the two running for reelection in states Trump carried in 2016 \u2013 Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters \u2013 face competitive contests, according to Inside Elections. Jones has the far more difficult challenge, with his matchup against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville rated as Lean Republican. The contest between Peters and John James, an Army veteran who lost a bid for Senate in 2018, is rated as Lean Democratic. As things stand today, Inside Elections currently projects Democrats to pick up between three and five seats, which, depending on the results of the presidential race, could be enough to gain control of the Senate as well. With 43 days until Election Day, that is still plenty of time for the political winds to shift, particularly given the uncertain road ahead with the court vacancy. In the wake of Ginsburg\u2019s death and McConnell\u2019s commitment to giving Trump\u2019s nominee a vote, there\u2019s even more attention on Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Inside Elections shifted South Carolina\u2019s Senate race one step further from the solidly Republican category, where the third-term senator has normally sat in his previous reelections, from Likely Republican to Lean Republican on Friday \u2013 before Ginsburg\u2019s death. Graham, a close ally of the President, still has the advantage in this red state that Trump carried by more than 14 points in 2016. But Harrison, a former state Democratic Party chairman, is outraising and outspending Graham \u2014 and he\u2019s starting to attract the involvement of national allies, like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which announced a seven-figure coordinated investment with his campaign last week. Recent public polling suggests Harrison\u2019s spending could be paying off, too. He was tied with Graham at 48% among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month, which followed another tied-up Quinnipiac poll of registered voters last month. Harrison\u2019s quest to unseat Graham has long generated national headlines disproportionate to the race\u2019s competitiveness. That may be changing, although the next few weeks will be worth watching. The fight over Ginsburg\u2019s replacement not only shines a light on Graham\u2019s role as chairman \u2014 and the heat he\u2019s facing for backtracking on previous comments about not confirming a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election \u2014 but it also has the potential to drive South Carolina voters into their partisan corners, which would help the incumbent. Interactive: House race ratings For all the drama surrounding the Senate, Democrats appear poised to keep their House majority next Congress as the party seeks to make gains in suburban-based districts and finds many of its frontline members in districts Trump carried in 2016 holding advantages heading into the fall. Democrats won control of the House in 2018, picking up a net gain of 40 seats, many in diversifying suburban districts that delivered a rebuke of the President\u2019s first two years in office. Given those gains, Democrats have a smaller universe of offensive targets for this cycle, but the party still sees opportunities across the map \u2013 including a handful in Texas due, in part, to Republican retirements. For Republicans, the path back to the majority would start with the 30 districts held by Democrats that Trump carried on his way to the presidency four years ago. Many of those potential targets, however, remain a challenge, as Democratic incumbents hold overwhelming fundraising advantages while their GOP opponents have struggled to make the contests more competitive. The 10 House districts most likely to flip in 2020 Inside Elections currently rates 205 seats as safe for Democrats, which would put the party just 13 seats away from keeping control of the chamber. There are 164 seats that are Safe Republican, leaving a universe of 65 seats in play \u2013 37 held by Republicans and 28 by Democrats. Only 10 seats are rated Toss-up, the most competitive designation, with seven held by Republicans and three by Democrats. And while Democrats are seen as having an edge in four Republican-held districts, including two redistricted seats in North Carolina, the GOP is not favored in any Democratic-held districts at this point. Of the GOP\u2019s potential pick-up opportunities, one of their best shots could be Florida\u2019s 26th District, which was one of two races that Inside Elections shifted away from Democrats on Friday. Hillary Clinton won this South Florida district in 2016, but the Cuban-American community\u2019s embrace of Trump could move it away from Democrats. Freshman Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who unseated GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo in the 2018 midterms, is no longer in a Tilt Democratic race. Her campaign against Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, himself a Cuban American with a high profile, is now a Toss-up. The other race that Inside Elections shifted away from Democrats is one the party just recently lost in a spring special election. The rematch between GOP Rep. Mike Garcia and Democrat Christy Smith in California\u2019s 25th District moved from Tilt Democratic to Toss-up. The other four ratings changes, however, are all in Democrats\u2019 favor. A tightening presidential race in Arkansas\u2019 2nd District, which backed Trump by 10 points in 2016, could help Democrats unseat GOP Rep. French Hill. His race shifted from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. Two suburban seats where Democrats are on defense edged closer to them. Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids flipped Kansas\u2019 3rd District two years ago, but Kansas City-area voters are quickly moving away from Republicans. Inside Elections moved the race from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic. It\u2019s a similar story in the suburbs north of Dallas, where freshman Rep. Colin Allred has a strong financial advantage over his GOP opponent, contributing to Inside Elections shifting Texas\u2019 32nd District from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic. Although it\u2019s not at all like the suburban seats described above, Maine\u2019s 2nd District also shifted in Democrats\u2019 favor. Trump\u2019s 2016 victory here earned him an electoral vote, but he\u2019s not expected to do nearly as well in the White working class district against Biden as he did against Clinton. And Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a Marine veteran who flipped the district in 2018, has a financial advantage over his GOP opponent, who\u2019s hurting for cash. The 2nd District will get plenty of attention at the presidential, Senate and House level and see lots of outside spending, but Golden has a strong profile for the rural district. Inside Elections moved the race from Tilt Democratic to Lean Democratic.",

Election Day isn\u2019t for 45 days and the first presidential debate isn\u2019t until Sept. 29, but Americans are already voting. We\u2019ve talked a lot about mail-in voting, but early in-person voting got underway Friday in my state of Virginia and there were significant lines. \u201cI don\u2019t trust the mail right now, that\u2019s why (I\u2019m voting today). If I got to stand here all day, I\u2019m going to vote today,\u201d Jim O\u2019Conner, a voter in Fairfax County, Virginia, told CNN. Read more.   Voters can also cast in-person early ballots in South Dakota, Wyoming and Minnesota starting today. They join a handful of states that have already begun to send out \u2013 and accept \u2013 mail-in ballots. Note: Both Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump were scheduled to hold events on Friday in Minnesota, now a heavily contested state. New states will open their polls every week. Forty-five states and Washington, DC, are offering some form of early voting in this bizarre year. Two of the five that don\u2019t \u2013 Oregon and New Jersey \u2013 are conducting their elections entirely by mail, according to CNN\u2019s political unit. More than half of the states will have in-person early voting ongoing by October 15. Nine states are sending mail-in ballots to every voter. Among the rest of the states, 11 have already started sending ballots to people who have requested them. Get details at our Election 101 hub, which includes a voter guide where you can look up the rules and deadlines in your state. And know that court cases will continue to complicate this process. A Pennsylvania ruling. CNN\u2019S Katelyn Polantz reports Democrats had a sweeping victory Thursday in which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court extended the deadline for when mail-in ballots can arrive and gave election officials a green light to add more ballot drop boxes in the state. It also removed the Green Party candidate from the presidential ballot in that crucial state. The ruling essentially sets the ground rules for the general election, and it means that thousands of Pennsylvanians whose votes would\u2019ve been rejected for arriving after Election Day will now have their ballots counted. The deadline for ballots to be returned in Pennsylvania is now November 6 instead of November 3, Election Day. A Michigan extension. A  state judge on Friday dramatically expanded the window for when absentee ballots can arrive and get counted after Election Day in Michigan. Absentee ballots postmarked before Election Day can now be counted if they arrive two weeks after the polls close. These rules are different for each state. A Florida investment. In another battleground state, Florida, the billionaire Michael Bloomberg is funneling $100 million to oppose Trump. More evidence that the decisive portion of this campaign could occur now, not later. We\u2019ve collated many of the election-related questions sent by the What Matters hive mind and turned them into this searchable trove of answers.

If you didn\u2019t get a chance to watch CNN\u2019s drive-in town hall with Biden in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Thursday night, catch up here. What\u2019s Biden doing? The main thing I think we learned is that Biden will not, to the extent he\u2019s able, be focusing these last two months specifically on the coalition of minority voters and progressives. He clearly thinks \u2013 at least during this event in Scranton \u2013 the way he\u2019ll win in 2020 is by recapturing some of the White, working class vote lost by Hillary Clinton. And his goal is to be moderate. Put this on a bumper sticker: Check out this canned tagline he had prepared for the night: \u201cI view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAll Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market.\u201d Minor geographical note: Trump Tower is on Fifth Avenue. Regardless, this message is not about justice or transformation in a way many liberals would hope. While Trump has pointed to the strength of the stock market to argue the economy is in good shape, Biden seized on the fact that most working class Americans don\u2019t own stock. As Matt Egan noted this week over at CNN Business, \u201cJust over half (52%) of American families have some level of investment in the market, mostly through 401ks and other retirement accounts, according to the Pew Research Center. Only 14% of households are directly invested in the market.\u201d Biden might have read that story. \u201cIn my neighborhood in Scranton, not a lot of people (owned stock). We have to make sure that health care workers are paid, and paid a decent wage. At $15 an hour? It\u2019s not enough for a health care worker,\u201d he said. He also interrupted a Trump voter asking him a question to dispute her when she said he\u2019s pushing the Green New Deal. And he made clear he will not ban fracking as climate activists want, arguing instead there will be a transition period to emissions-free power. And that transition will take time. About climate science. CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir tells you on the Politically Sound podcast why presidential leadership is so important in fighting the climate crisis \u2013 and what that means for your vote this November. LISTEN HERE. His focus on the Average Joe ethos might be smart politics. If you look at polling in battlegrounds on CNN\u2019s presidential polling page, you\u2019ll notice that Biden\u2019s holding a fairly strong lead over Trump in the Rust Belt states Clinton lost \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2013 with a tighter race in states on Democrats\u2019 wish list, like North Carolina. In CNN polling in Wisconsin earlier this week, Biden led Trump 52%-42%. In North Carolina, Biden had 49% to Trump\u2019s 46%. Read Jennifer Agiesta\u2019s full story, but I found these two paragraphs particularly interesting in terms of how Biden is making his pitch: This isn\u2019t to say Biden can\u2019t or won\u2019t expand the map. An even race in North Carolina, a state Barack Obama won only in 2008, effectively makes the state a jump ball. And in the most recent polling in Arizona, he has 49% to Trump\u2019s 40%. That\u2019s a state Trump won in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden cast the United States as unsafe under President Donald Trump and claimed he could unite the country Thursday night in a CNN town hall less than two weeks before their first debate. The town hall was held as a drive-in, underscoring the unprecedented final months of campaigning after the coronavirus pandemic led Biden\u2019s campaign to call off public rallies where supporters gathered indoors. Biden and CNN\u2019s moderator, Anderson Cooper, stood onstage and questioners parked their cars around them, and approached microphones near the stage to ask questions. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race During the event, the Democratic presidential nominee mocked Trump\u2019s claims that electing Biden would lead to widespread violence and chaos in the streets of America \u2013 and particularly the suburbs. And he touted his own ability to unify the country, pointing to his record as a senator and saying he never questions his political opponents\u2019 motives. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a Democratic\u00a0president.\u00a0I\u2019m going to be America\u2019s\u00a0president,\u201d Biden said. Here are five takeaways from Biden\u2019s CNN town hall Thursday night in Scranton, Pennsylvania: Biden sought to frame voters\u2019 choice around a new shorthand: his hometown of Scranton, representing wage-earning, blue-collar Americans, and Park Avenue, home of a wealthy few who profit from the work of others. \u201cI view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAll Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market.\u201d It was an attack aimed at Trump\u2019s handling of the economy \u2013 one area on which polls have shown the President outperforming his overall numbers. Biden characterized Trump\u2019s economic record as one that has benefited the wealthy but ignored the working class. \u201cIn my neighborhood in Scranton, not a lot of people (owned stock). We have to make sure that health care workers are paid, and paid a decent wage. At $15 an hour? It\u2019s not enough for a health care worker,\u201d Biden said. Biden fended off more progressive rivals in the Democratic primary, and showed Thursday night thathe is resisting being pressured into embracing some of the left\u2019s priorities that could damage him politically. He insisted he would not end fracking for natural gas \u2013 a major industry in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. And when a questioner who had voted for Trump in 2016 said Biden had embraced the Green New Deal as part of his climate change platform, the former vice president said she was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own deal,\u201d he told Cooper in response to a question about the Green New Deal, pointing to a climate agenda his campaign negotiated with allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and then the Democratic National Committee adopted as its platform. The former vice president brought up Attorney General William Barr\u2019s recent comment as he addressed a Constitution Day celebration hosted by Hillsdale College that lockdowns to combat the coronavirus were the \u201cgreatest intrusion on civil liberties\u201d in history \u201cother than slavery.\u201d Barr says calls for coronavirus lockdown are the 'greatest intrusion on civil liberties' other than slavery in US history \u201cWhat Bill Barr recently said\u00a0is outrageous,\u201d Biden said, echoing other Democrats who had condemned Barr\u2019s comment on Thursday. \u201cI will tell you what takes away\u00a0your freedom: not being able to\u00a0see your kid, not being able to\u00a0go to the football game or\u00a0baseball game, not seeing your\u00a0mom or dad sick in the hospital,\u00a0not being able to do the things,\u00a0that\u2019s what is costing us our\u00a0freedom.\u201d It was part of Biden\u2019s effort to keep the electorate focused on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and the costs that have amassed in the wake of revelations in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book that Trump had known in February about the dangers of the virus but downplayed them publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s been the failure of\u00a0this President to deal with this\u00a0virus, and he knew about it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe knew the detail of it.\u00a0He knew it in clear terms.\u201d The most glaring differences between Biden and Trump are often stylistic. Biden on Thursday night displayed empathy and \u2013 in comments about cancer and his son Beau Biden \u2013 humanity. Trump, in an ABC town hall earlier in the week, had often disputed the premises of voters\u2019 questions. Biden\u2019s sharpest moment Thursday night might have come when he condemned Trump\u2019s characterization, reported by The Atlantic, of those killed and injured at war as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d Biden said he was offended by Trump\u2019s comment, which he said applied to \u201cguys like my son,\u201d referring to Beau Biden, who served a tour in Iraq in the Delaware National Guard while he was the state\u2019s attorney general. \u201cTalk about losers,\u201d an angry Biden added. Biden continued to cast doubt on Trump\u2019s claims that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready \u2013 or close to it \u2013 in time for the November 3 general election. But, he said, he would believe timelines and steps detailed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0trust the President on vaccines.\u00a0I trust Dr. Fauci,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf Fauci says a vaccine is safe, I would take the vaccine. We should listen to the scientists, not the President.\u201d His comment comes as Trump\u2019s campaign and allies have alleged that, by casting doubt on the President\u2019s vaccine claims, Biden is undermining trust in a potential vaccine. Biden, meanwhile, says Trump is trying to claim a panacea is just around the corner in order to blunt the political fallout of his handling of the virus enough to win a second term.",

            "article_content": "In a sweeping victory for Democrats, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued three significant rulings Thursday that extended the deadline for absentee ballots, allowed more ballot drop boxes and removed the Green Party candidate from the presidential ballot. The rulings come following court challenges from the state Democratic Party, which has been aiming to ease Pennsylvania\u2019s absentee voting procedures amid the pandemic and a surge in mail-in ballots and to have the Green Party off the ballot due to its potential to take votes from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Thursday\u2019s court decisions essentially set the ground rules for the general election. One of the more significant changes set by the court on Thursday is allowing election officials to count absentee ballots received up to three days after the election, if they are postmarked by Election Day. The change means that thousands of Pennsylvanians whose votes would\u2019ve been rejected for arriving after Election Day will now be counted. The Trump campaign and Pennsylvania Republicans had sought to place a hard ban on ballots arriving after Election Day. They also wanted to be able to recruit poll-watchers from neighboring counties, but the court rejected that request and upheld a state law banning out-of-county poll-watchers. Sharif Street, a Democratic state senator who\u2019s vice chair of Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic Party, hailed the decision as a major victory for the party amid Postal Service concerns and President Donald Trump\u2019s legal challenges to restrict absentee voting amid the pandemic. \u201c[I]n the birthplace of American democracy we are not going to have him (the President) turn it into the birthplace of Donald Trump\u2019s voter suppression,\u201d Street told CNN on Thursday following the decision. The Trump campaign is still challenging the state\u2019s balloting procedures in federal court, though it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s left for a federal judge to consider now that the state court has decided. In a 5-2 decision, the top Pennsylvania state court ruled that Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins hadn\u2019t followed proper procedures when submitting his nomination forms to get on the ballot. Election 2020: Send us your stories about voting issues The ruling eliminates the final hurdle blocking Pennsylvania from sending out absentee ballots to voters who requested them. The state had been stuck in a holding pattern while the litigation played out in court. The Green Party \u201cfailed to comply with the Election Code\u2019s strict mandate\u201d for how nomination paperwork must be handled, and its attempts to fix the problem \u201cdid not suffice to cure that error,\u201d the justices said in a 28-page majority opinion. As a result, \u201cthat defect was fatal\u201d to Hawkins\u2019 request to get on the ballot. Hawkins\u2019 campaign manager, Andrea M\u00e9rida Cu\u00e9llar, said the Democrats are playing \u201d legal shenanigans just to knock legitimate competition off of the ballot. I think that they should be afraid of having Greens on the ballot because their party is not offering anything that the working class of this country is actually asking for. We are.\u201d All five Democrats on the court voted to remove the Green Party, while the two Republicans dissented. The decision came a week after a similar ruling in Wisconsin, where Hawkins was also kicked off the ballot. \u201c[A]s soon as the ballots are changed, our printer will provide us with a test and we will make sure that everything counts accordingly and then we will start mailing out the ballot,\u201d Debbie Olivieri, Berks County director of elections, told CNN. The county, which includes Reading, is a closely contested battleground. Olivieri said she had received certification of the final ballot from the state about an hour after the ruling. She said that as of Thursday, the county had just over 58,000 total mail-in ballot requests. There's no evidence of fraud in mail-in ballots, part infinity The ruling will also force the county to adjust ballots that had already gone out to overseas voters. Saturday is the deadline for election officials to send absentee ballots to service members and citizens abroad. Olivieri told CNN the county had already been sending absentee ballots to those voters and will now have to send updated ones. \u201cA lot of the counties had sent them out already; we were one of them. We will now make the updates to those ballots,\u201d Olivieri said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we would have met Saturday\u2019s deadline if we didn\u2019t start that process already.\u201d In a separate ruling on Thursday, the high court rejected a request from Democrats to allow third-party groups and political organizers to collect and return people\u2019s absentee ballots with their permission \u2013 a process sometimes called \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d The justices wrote, \u201cIt has long been the law of this Commonwealth \u2026 that third-person delivery of absentee ballots is not permitted.\u201d Trump hailed this ruling in a series of tweets, saying, \u201cWe will be watching that the Democrats do not Ballot Harvest - a felony. In other words, the Republican Party won on the atrocious Ballot Harvesting Scam.\u201d He did not mention the other rulings that rejected his campaign\u2019s arguments. \u201cWe look forward to the federal courts weighing in on what \u2018Election Day\u2019 actually means, but we applaud this major win for voter integrity,\u201d Trump campaign general counsel Matthew Morgan said, referring to a still-ongoing federal lawsuit about voting procedures in Pennsylvania. Taken together, the rulings on postmark deadlines and drop-boxes blunts the victory Trump is claiming. \u201cif you have drop-boxes and a mail system that functions with deadlines it\u2019s less important to have extra assistance of people going around to collect the ballots,\u201d said Mark Gaber, director of trial litigation at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. This story has been updated with information on additional court rulings. CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General William Barr suggested on Wednesday that the calls for a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus were the \u201cgreatest intrusion on civil liberties\u201d in history \u201cother than slavery.\u201d The comments came minutes after he slammed the hundreds of Justice Department prosecutors working beneath him, equating them to preschoolers, in a defense of his own politically tuned decision making in the Trump administration. Addressing a Constitution Day celebration hosted by Hillsdale College, the event\u2019s host asked Barr to explain the \u201cconstitutional hurdles for forbidding a church from meeting during Covid-19.\u201d Attorney General William Barr suggests charging violent protesters with sedition The question lead Barr into a four-minute response where he said state governors were using their executive powers to stifle citizens and businesses from going back to work. \u201cYou know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,\u201d Barr said as a round of applause came from the crowd. Covid-19 has taken a measurable toll on minorities, including Black people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In recent weeks, Barr has taken a much more aggressive stance defending Trump administration policies, including suggesting voting by mail is not safe, attacking the Mueller investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and criticizing governors for their coronavirus response. Fact-checking William Barr: Is your vote no longer secret with mail-in ballots? \u201cMost of the governors do what bureaucrats always do, which is they \u2026 defy common sense,\u201d Barr said Wednesday. \u201cThey treat free citizens as babies that can\u2019t take responsibility for themselves and others.\u201d \u201cWe have to give business people an opportunity, tell them what the rules are you know the masks, which rule of masks, you had this month\u2026and then let them try to adapt their business to that and you\u2019ll have ingenuity and people will at least have the freedom to try to earn a living,\u201d he added. Barr has faced immense blowback from Justice Department employees and even rank-and-file attorneys in the department since the close of the Mueller investigation, for swaying cases in a way that undermines longstanding legal policies. Wednesday, he upped the ante and equated them to preschoolers. \u201cName one successful organization or institution where the lowest level employees\u2019 decisions are deemed sacrosanct, there aren\u2019t. There aren\u2019t any letting the most junior members set the agenda,\u201d Barr said during his speech. \u201cIt might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency,\u201d the attorney general added. Justice Department watchdog looking into Roger Stone sentencing changes The comments are likely to inflame already strained relations between the politically appointed Justice Department leadership in Washington and the career attorneys across the country who serve through multiple presidencies. Notably, several career prosecutors have not signed onto positions in court have pushed the wishes of President Donald Trump and Barr over, they say, the law, such as in the Roger Stone criminal case. In the speech, Barr questioned any criticism he\u2019s received for \u201cinterfering\u201d in cases. The attorney general has ultimate authority, he said. Barr's response to Trump's claim stuns CNN reporter \u201cThese people are agents of the attorney general. As I say, FBI agents, whose agent do you think you are?\u201d Barr asked on Tuesday, adding that career lawyers, too, might be influenced by politics. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018What exactly am I interfering with?\u2019 When you boil it right down, it\u2019s the will of the most junior member of the organization who has some idea he wants to do something. What makes that sacrosanct?\u201d \u201cThey do not have the political legitimacy to be the public face for tough decisions and they lack the political buy-in necessary to publicly defend those decisions,\u201d Barr also said. The speech comes after Barr has been escalating alarmist and politicized rhetoric in a series of interviews, and advocating against Democrats in the election. \u201cIn short, the attorney general, senior DOJ officials, and US attorneys are indeed political. But they are political in a good and necessary sense,\u201d he said. White House asked DOJ to defend Trump in defamation case, Barr says Barr also jabbed at the team of prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russian election interference investigation \u2013 and even appeared to slide in a remark on one of the legal industry\u2019s most respected criminal law advocates. \u201cAgain, the Obama administration, you know, had some of the people who were in Mueller\u2019s office writing their briefs in the Supreme Court. So maybe that explains something,\u201d he said Wednesday. Mueller, a lifelong Republican who led the FBI for 12 years, has become a target of Trump and conservatives before and after investigation ended, and because some top prosecutors on his team had worked for Democrats in the past. Barr\u2019s comment on Wednesday seemed to refer to Michael Dreeben, a longtime Justice Department lawyer who served as the top interpreter of criminal policy for the Mueller team. Dreeben is widely considered in the legal industry and in Justice Department hallways to be one of the nation\u2019s foremost experts on criminal law, and is among an elite class of lawyers who\u2019ve argued more than 100 times before the Supreme Court. He is now in private practice. Barr claims DOJ program intended to combat violence was derailed by pandemic \u201cYou know Barr has really lost it when he stoops to attacking the likes of Michael Dreeben,\u201d tweeted Andrew Weissmann, another longtime top federal prosecutor who led the investigation of Paul Manafort on Mueller\u2019s team.

            "article_content": "On-time mail service has still not recovered from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\u2019s controversial changes to the US Postal Service as the November election approaches, according to a new report from Senate Democrats. Shortly after starting at the agency in June, DeJoy \u2013 a Trump donor and ally \u2013 came under fire for implementing sweeping changes across the US Postal Service, including mandating stricter schedules for trucks transporting mail, which meant leaving mail behind at processing centers to stay on time. DeJoy\u2019s moves caused widespread delays in mail service across the country just before a general election expected to be conducted in large part through the mail. The report details the results of an investigation launched by Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The report alleges that DeJoy did not consider or conduct research on the effects that his changes would have on the postal service. According to data analyzed by Peters\u2019 office, every one of the postal service\u2019s 67 districts across the country saw a decline in the on-time delivery of first-class mail, which is supposed to be delivered the fastest. In early August, the report finds, on-time delivery of first-class mail fell by 9.1 percentage points compared to the week before the USPS began implementing DeJoy\u2019s changes. In the second week of August, alone, approximately 85 million more late deliveries of first-class mail happened than would have otherwise occurred due to DeJoy\u2019s order, according to the report. In some areas of the country, on-time delivery of first-class mail fell by 15-20 percentage points in the weeks after DeJoy\u2019s truck order. The report also notes that in early September, at the same time some states were gearing up to send out absentee ballots via mail, on-time delivery began declining again in many parts of the country. The report was released shortly after a court hearing in New York about some of the changes DeJoy ordered, and their potential to affect the election. At the hearing, Robert Cintron, the USPS vice president for logistics, testified that service standards \u201chave bounced back\u201d from their July lows. But asked if the new rules scaling back after-hours deliveries could cause election mail to get left behind, Cintron said it was possible. Another senior USPS official who testified, Angela Curtis, acknowledged that the rule changes caused delays but also blamed a spike in coronavirus cases among postal workers. DeJoy has testified in front of Congress twice over these changes and whether or not they would affect the 2020 election. DeJoy had until Wednesday to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Oversight Committee after he failed to turn over documents on the changes made to the postal service that caused the delays. A source familiar with the matter said that USPS was working with the committee to make the deadline. A committee staffer confirmed this, but noted that not all documents had been turned over, \u201cthe Postal Service has begun to produce some documents, and we look forward to a more fulsome production today.\u201d In recent weeks, DeJoy has acknowledged disruptions in service, but USPS maintains that the situation is improving and that many of the changes are routine in nature and have been planned out for months. DeJoy vehemently denies that he has ordered the changes to intentionally sabotage election mail this year, when there will be a record level of absentee ballots cast in the mail due to the coronavirus pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Two Virginia residents are suing to keep rapper and producer Kanye West\u2019s name off the state\u2019s ballot in November, saying they were duped into signing on as electors for West. The lawsuit, brought this week by a prominent Democratic firm, is the latest legal fight involving West\u2019s unorthodox candidacy for the White House. The music and fashion mogul has not mounted a traditional campaign, and GOP figures around the country have emerged to assist him in gaining access to state ballots. That has fueled speculation among Democrats that Republicans are promoting West\u2019s candidacy in an effort to siphon Black votes from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in key states. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race In recent days, West\u2019s campaign has sued to get on the ballot in two presidential battlegrounds \u2013  Wisconsin and Ohio \u2013 where local authorities have rejected his petitions. This week, the West campaign also sought a preliminary injunction against officials in West Virginia, who invalidated more than 7,000 signatures of the more than 14,000 collected by his campaign. Those actions have left West 761 signatures shy of the 7,144 needed for inclusion on the ballot, his lawsuit argues. And a legal fight is shaping up in Arizona, an emerging presidential battleground, where a lawsuit was filed Monday to keep West off the ballot as an independent candidate on the grounds that he and 10 of his 11 electors are Republicans. Friday is the deadline to turn in signatures to appear on the ballot in Arizona. West\u2019s campaign is working to get on the ballot in the Grand Canyon State, where recent polls show a competitive contest between Biden and President Donald Trump. Ballots are slated to be printed early next week in the state\u2019s two largest counties, the Arizona lawsuit says. That leaves little time for a legal challenge of any signatures West submits Friday, lawyers argued in their complaint, as they urged the court to take up the case even before West files final paperwork. A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon in Arizona. Last week, CNN reported about evasive tactics by a signature gatherer who approached students in Phoenix. An Arizona State University law school student told CNN the signature gatherer asked him to sign a petition for an independent candidate and only after repeated questioning did the person acknowledge he was working on behalf of the West campaign. In the Virginia case, two people \u2013 Matthan Wilson and Bryan Wright \u2013 who signed petitions to become West electors said they were misled. View 2020 presidential election polling Wilson, who lives in Suffolk, Virginia, said he was out on a bike ride when three people approached him and asked whether he would like to serve in a statewide pool of electors. \u201cKanye West\u2019s name was never mentioned,\u201d he said in an affidavit. Wright, also of Suffolk, said petition gatherers asked him to sign a petition to get West on the ballot, but instead gave him an elector oath to sign without his knowledge. Both men are plaintiffs in the Virginia lawsuit brought by Perkins Coie, a Washington law firm at the forefront of Democratic legal battles on the 2020 election. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, also has signed a brief in the case, seeking to block West\u2019s name from the ballot. A spokeswoman for the Virginia Elections Department said the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation. West\u2019s campaign has not responded to requests for comment. But in an interview this week on Nick Cannon\u2019s podcast Cannon\u2019s Class, West denied he was acting on behalf of Republicans in pursuing the presidency.  \u201cBro, can\u2019t nobody pay me,\u201d West told Cannon during an interview. \u201cI got more money than Trump.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not running for president,\u201d he also said. \u201cI\u2019m walking.\u201d West has no chance of winning the presidency. To date, he has made it onto the ballot in 11 states \u2013 Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Together, those states account for a 83 electoral votes \u2013 well short of the 270 needed for the presidency. West has missed the deadline, did not file or has been denied access in 34 other states and Washington, DC, according to CNN\u2019s most recent tally.

            "article_content": "Standing mask-less last week at the counter of Arcaro & Genell Takeaway Kitchen in Old Forge, Pennsylvania \u2013 \u201cPizza Capital of the World\u201d \u2013 President Donald Trump found himself, for the first time in a long time, in the role of retail politician. \u201cWhy did you want to come here?\u201d someone asked. \u201cBecause they have great pizza,\u201d the President replied, lifting open a box top and holding the pie aloft. The world-altering circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic have also altered the world of Trump\u2019s campaign. His poll numbers sank to historic lows. The charging economy that once formed the centerpiece of his reelection argument has stalled. And the arenas where his fans jammed shoulder-to-shoulder stand vacant. It\u2019s why Trump, who for most of his presidency has avoided interacting with voters on their turf, found himself posing with a box of steaming hot pizza on the day Joe Biden officially became the Democratic nominee. \u201cYou look forward to the day it comes down?\u201d he asked the pizzeria\u2019s manager when he noticed the acrylic glass barrier separating staff from customers \u2013 a Covid-era requirement in Pennsylvania and many other states for businesses to reopen. \u201cMe too.\u201d If this week\u2019s Republican National Convention offered a view of Trump\u2019s presidency that buffed away the flaws \u2013 an alternate world where crowds gathered without masks and the pandemic was mostly referenced in the past tense \u2013 the coming days and weeks will amount to a return to Earth. Trump remains a candidate still trailing in polls, confronting a virulent pandemic and struggling to offer rationale for a second term. The reality started setting in less than 24 hours after Trump spoke: his fireworks and opera-capped acceptance speech garnered a smaller television audience than Biden\u2019s by more than 2 million viewers. The next critical campaign juncture comes in a month, when Trump will face Biden for their first televised debate in Cleveland. While aides have already begun preparing the President for the showdown, it remains an open question whether he\u2019ll adhere to their strategy \u2013 or, like four years ago, tell advisers he\u2019s relying on instinct. Looking at a daunting electoral map showing Trump trailing Biden in several states he won handily in 2016, Trump\u2019s advisers are hoping a post-convention bounce will erode Biden\u2019s steady lead and make the race more competitive heading into the fall. Trump was in a jubilant mood Friday after his speech, according to three people who spoke with him. But Trump is entering the final stretch of the campaign in an historically bad place. A CNN poll of polls average heading into the national political conventions found 51% of registered voters nationwide backed Biden while 42% supported Trump. Both the President and his advisers insist their data show him more competitive than public polling, particularly in the critical battlegrounds that will determine the next president. But their confidence is belied somewhat by Trump\u2019s increasing predictions of a fraudulent election, which he says Democrats will win only through cheating. CNN Poll of Polls: Biden holds a nine-point lead over Trump ahead of the party conventions As the general election enters its final months, Trump plans to travel several times a week for a mix of official stops and scaled-down campaign events, people familiar with the plans said. Like Friday night\u2019s event in New Hampshire, most will occur inside airport hangars, where attendees are partially outdoors \u2013 considered safer from a contagion perspective \u2013 and where Trump can come and go easily. Trump\u2019s advisers, hoping to look on the bright side, have sold the events to the President as a nimbler version of his preferred rallies that can be scheduled quickly, filled to relative capacity and allow for last-minute changes depending on the current political calculus. Aides say he could also throw in more retail politicking of the type he practiced in Pennsylvania, though Trump himself does not particularly enjoy it and has questioned its value, people who have spoken to him said. When he visited the pizza shop in Pennsylvania, he didn\u2019t stop to greet any voters and was gone after less than 10 minutes. The campaign\u2019s geographic focus over the next few weeks are states beginning to mail absentee ballots to voters, according to advisers. North Carolina begins sending ballots on September 4, and both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence plan to visit the state next week. Several other battlegrounds \u2013 including Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 also begin mailing ballots more than 45 days before the election. Stops in those places are also being planned, but without the massive campaign rallies Trump once hoped to be headlining for much of the fall, advisers said. While Trump has bitterly complained about mail-in voting, many states do not make a distinction between \u201cmail-in ballots\u201d and \u201cabsentee ballots.\u201d Trump has encouraged his supporters to request absentee ballots, including in a video that showed him filling out his own ballot in Florida\u201ds recent congressional primary. The Kamala Harris pick is a hit with voters so far Over a month out from their first face-off \u2013 set for September 29 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland \u2013 Trump and Pence have already started debate preparation. Both have held several sessions with a small circle of aides, people familiar with the matter said, though some said the early sessions were mostly designed to channel Trump\u2019s attention toward the showdown, which \u2013 in the absence of major events \u2013 is now the next major campaign juncture. Some of the President\u2019s advisers voiced concerns that his allies were overly confident in their predictions that he would decimate Biden in the debates and were unintentionally setting the bar too high for him to claim success. Aides were surprised that Trump agreed to start debate prep this soon. In 2016, he was notoriously reluctant to hold formal mock debates and resisted reading the binders of research compiled by aides. Instead, Trump preferred to dial up an informal group of advisers and work on one-liners for his opponents. As he did in 2016, Trump sees the debates as the chance to shift his standing while once again trailing in multiple polls. He has still downplayed the necessity for practice debates, believing he doesn\u2019t require them to succeed against Biden. Like in other types of preparatory briefings, he has demonstrated a short attention span and little patience for extended deliberations over strategy. His practice sparring partner in 2016, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has participated in some of the early debate planning sessions with Trump, according to people familiar with the matter, and some of Trump\u2019s advisers assume he will reprise the role in some fashion this year, though a stand-in for Biden hasn\u2019t yet been formalized. Characteristically, Pence has been more methodical in his preparation. He is holding his own prep sessions with aides, sources familiar said, as their re-election effort has struggled to find a way to successfully define Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Notably, Trump did not mention her once during his convention acceptance speech at the White House Thursday, though he did say Biden\u2019s name more than 40 times. While Republicans South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem or Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is expected to play some role in helping Pence ready for his face-off with Harris, the vice president is also expected to rely on familiar faces from the team that prepared him for his debate in 2016 with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine. Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who played Kaine in previous mock debates, is again expected to be involved. The Trump campaign has requested that the candidates appear on stage with one another during the debates in hopes of thwarting any attempt to conduct the debates virtually. It\u2019s still unclear whether there will be an audience at any of them. Donald Trump recycles much of his 2016 message as he accepts renomination Heading into the fall, Trump\u2019s advisers describe a messaging strategy that works to extend the broad themes of their convention: framing Trump as a \u201claw and order\u201d president who fights to improve the lives of working Americans while also convincing voters he did not bungle the coronavirus response and isn\u2019t a racist. Trump\u2019s speech on Thursday, while delivered without much energy from a teleprompter, did provide a road map for his planned attack on Biden as an empty vessel of the far-left, a characterization that took months for Trump\u2019s campaign to arrive at and which the President himself hasn\u2019t always stuck to. The wide-ranging speech did not have a central theme, which aides said was because so many speechwriters were involved as well as the chief speechwriter \u2013 Trump. Biden\u2019s announcement Thursday that he planned to resume in-person campaign events after Labor Day also impaired one of Trump\u2019s persistent criticisms that his rival refused to leave his Wilmington, Delaware, basement. Biden told supporters he planned to target Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Minnesota. The type of voter Trump hopes to convince could be easily discerned by the convention lineup: suburban White women, working class men and \u2013 to an extent \u2013 Black men disillusioned by Democrats, though their role in the convention lineup seemed designed as much to convince White voters that Trump is not racist as it was to peel off Black voters from Biden. \u201cAfter Labor Day, you\u2019re going to see a really aggressive campaign all the way through to the finish,\u201d the President\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said this week in a Politico interview. \u201cWe know who the swing voters are and we\u2019ve been testing over the last six months a lot of the messages that help persuade them,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cObviously times change, so you have to continue to be nimble.\u201d Standing before small crowds without ever leaving the airport grounds is not how Trump envisioned running for reelection. The President had long held out hope that his signature arena rallies would be possible amid the pandemic, but after an embarrassingly small turnout in Oklahoma earlier this summer he came to acknowledge that his plans would require recalibration. The Tulsa episode proved an edifying moment for both the President and his campaign. Furious from before he left the White House until he returned late at night, tie loose and exhausted, the President emerged from the experience determined to never again find himself mocked for empty seats and entirely vacant overflow areas. Like his South Lawn convention spectacle, Trump\u2019s scaled-down rallies harness the images of incumbency. Crowds wait with anticipation for Air Force One to touch down, and watch as the iconic blue-and-white plane taxis into place. In some instances they watch as Trump emerges from the forward cabin and descends a set of air-stairs to his walkout song, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d by Lee Greenwood. It\u2019s hardly the ethically dubious use of the South Portico as convention hall, but the effect remains of projecting presidential power in a way his opponent cannot. Like his predecessors, Trump often combines official and political travel, which allows his campaign to pay only a portion of the travel costs with taxpayers footing the remainder. Being president also allows Trump to demonstrate leadership as part of his official duties, such as a trip to survey storm damage in Louisiana and Texas on Saturday and an upcoming White House signing ceremony for the normalization agreement he helped broker between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. At the same time, Trump is holding out hope for a race-altering development: a coronavirus vaccine, which he promised Thursday could come well before the end of the year, a timeline health experts say is not realistic. Trump\u2019s zeal to announce an effective vaccine already has medical experts concerned he will rush an unproven product onto market. What Trump hasn\u2019t necessarily contemplated is what a second term might look like should his efforts pay off. He\u2019s struggled to define his second-term priorities in interviews and during his convention acceptance speech on Thursday he spent scarily any time laying out what he would like to accomplish if reelection. People around Trump say he is superstitious about projecting beyond the election, believing it bad karma to presume victory. CNN\u2019s Sarah Westwood contributed to this report.",

It\u2019s getting harder to keep track of where Republicans stand on mail-in voting. President Donald Trump keeps raising the specter of widespread fraud, although there\u2019s no evidence it will occur. Just fine. South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the keynote speaker on the first night of the GOP convention, contradicted Trump Tuesday morning when he said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that mail-in voting isn\u2019t a problem.   While Trump keeps saying the only way he can be beaten is by fraud, Scott said he is \u201cconfident that we will have fair elections across this country.\u201d \u201cThis process of mail-in ballots will work out just fine,\u201d he said. That tracks with assurances from the postmaster general this week that ballots will be delivered on time by the USPS, although Democrats had harsh questions for him. The looming caveat is that people need to send ballots back as early as possible if they\u2019re voting by mail. Related: How to make sure your 2020 mail-in ballot is counted Where mail-in voting makes the Trump campaign most nervous. Trump\u2019s campaign manager Bill Stepien said Tuesday that universal mail-in voting, which Trump has questioned, is OK as long as this isn\u2019t the first year a state is using it. \u201cI think in the states in which mail-in voting has already occurred, that\u2019s fine by me,\u201d he said, adding it\u2019s been \u201cproven over years.\u201d \u201cI think our concern in the campaign is when, you know, 80 days, 90 days out from Election Day, you have Democrat governors changing the rules, that is, that\u2019s a scary proposition. My concern is that Democrat governors like my old own state, Phil Murphy, he\u2019s making promises to the voters of New Jersey that he can\u2019t guarantee the he can keep.\u201d That\u2019s Phil Murphy, governor of New Jersey, which switched to nearly all mail-in ballots this year. (The other jurisdictions that have also switched are California, Nevada, Vermont and the District of Columbia.) Trump has sparred with Murphy about the governor\u2019s order to conduct the election mostly by mail and his campaign has sued New Jersey. (Side note: New Jersey\u2019s two Republican congressmen voted with Democrats to increase funding for the USPS last week.) Other states are doing things their own way, and often with input and help from Republican secretaries of state, although Nevada\u2019s Republican secretary of state has asked for extra scrutiny of mail-in ballots for the general election. George Wallace was born August 25, 1919. Some people say it\u2019s Richard Nixon, but Trump is the true political heir of Wallace, as historian Douglas Brinkley recently argued. But Wallace wasn\u2019t a Republican. He was a Democrat. The Democratic Party is all about diversity today, but it actually wasn\u2019t that long ago that White Democrats ruled the South and pushed for segregation. Wallace, the Democratic governor of Alabama, would have been 101 today. He died in 1998. When he first became Alabama\u2019s governor in 1963, he promised, disgustingly, \u201cSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d He venerated the Confederacy and he worked hard to disrupt the Civil Rights movement, which Democrats in Washington were behind. Wallace\u2019s appeal extended outside the South, however, even if he represented an old version of a Democratic Party that was fast changing. He won states! He ran as an American Independent in 1968 and won five southern states. He\u2019s the last non-major-party candidate to win any votes in the #ElectoralCollege, which is why insurgent candidates these days try to change parties from within. He did that in 1972, back as a Democrat, pushing opposition to busing (ask Joe Biden about that). Nearly assassinated. But he was shot by a madman who\u2019d also tried to kill Nixon, paralyzed, and his campaign was cut short even as it was gaining steam. He spoke at the \u201972 Democratic convention from a wheelchair, however, and he still held power in 1976 when he ran again. So much power that when he finally endorsed Jimmy Carter, Carter flew to Montgomery to personally thank him. Wallace grew to regret the racism he had once exploited, expressed remorse and tried to rehabilitate his image. He even went to John Lewis, asking forgiveness. And Lewis wrote a truly incredible New York Times essay about why Wallace should be forgiven. \u201cGeorge Wallace should be remembered for his capacity to change,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cAnd we are better as a nation because of our capacity to forgive and to acknowledge that our political leaders are human and largely a reflection of the social currents in the river of history.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine that kind of grace today, when there is no forgiveness. But Wallace should also be remembered for tapping into White, working class frustration and anger, something better represented recently by Republicans than Wallace\u2019s Democrats. That\u2019s what Nixon took from Wallace with his silent majority. It\u2019s what Ronald Reagan took from him with his Reagan Democrats. It\u2019s what Trump has taken from Wallace \u2013 campaigns based in exploiting fears, promising to crack down on criminals, and other dog whistles to a racist populism that\u2019s won many US presidential elections. Trump\u2019s trying to use it now.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen will appear in a series of ads for the Democratic group American Bridge in the coming days, telling voters that Trump \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted\u201d and that they \u201cshouldn\u2019t believe a word he utters\u201d during the Republican National Convention this week. \u201cFor more than a decade, I was President Trump\u2019s right-hand man, fixer and confidant. I was complicit in helping conceal the real Donald Trump. In essence, I was part of creating an illusion,\u201d Cohen says in the roughly 90-second long video recorded for the group that will be cut down into shorter ads. \u201cLater this week, he\u2019s going to stand up at the White House and blatantly lie to you.\u201d Cohen adds: \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you he can\u2019t be trusted \u2013 and you shouldn\u2019t believe a word he utters. So, when you watch the President this week, remember this: If he says something is huge, it\u2019s probably small. If he says something will work, it probably won\u2019t. And if he says he cares about you and your family,  he certainly does not.\u201d The Trump campaign in a statement attacked Cohen\u2019s credibility. \u201cIf you believe anything Michael Cohen says,\u201d said Matt Wolking, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, \u201cI have a basement in Delaware to sell you.\u201d In a nod to the expected push back from Trump and the fact that most Democrats see Cohen as a contemptible figure, the former Trump adviser closes the video by saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me. But please, listen to me.\u201d The ads are an effort to counterprogram the Republican National Convention happening this week from a super PAC that supports Democratic nominee Joe Biden and other party candidates. They will begin running digitally on Monday night and on television starting Wednesday, as the convention enters its final two days. Cohen made the comments during an interview with American Bridge staffers. The video represents the highlights of the super PACs conversation with Cohen, comments that will soon be cut into 30- and 60-second clips for digital and television ads. Cohen\u2019s comments get to the heart of Trump\u2019s argument for reelection. The former fixer says Trump\u2019s promises to rebuild an economy hurt by the coronavirus aren\u2019t true, arguing that the economy will only get better for people like the President because \u201cif you think he cares about working class Americans, you\u2019re dead wrong.\u201d And Cohen says Trump\u2019s promises about law and order are \u201claughable.\u201d \u201cVirtually everyone who worked for his campaign has been convicted of a crime or is under indictment,\u201d he says. \u201cMyself included.\u201d A spokesperson for American Bridge declined to comment when asked if the organization had paid Cohen for the appearance. The group, which conducts opposition research and runs negative ads against Republicans, was founded in 2010 by David Brock, who began his career as a conservative journalist before becoming a Democratic operative with close ties to the Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cFrom family members to long-time confidants, those who know Donald Trump best are sounding the alarm about his character, honesty, and fitness for office. The American people deserve to hear the unvarnished truth: our country cannot take four more years of Donald Trump as president,\u201d said Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge. The effort is also aimed at getting under Trump\u2019s skin during a critical week \u2013 with Democrats believing that the sight of his former fixer on television slamming him could annoy a President who often vents his anger on Twitter. Cohen and Trump\u2019s relationship has gone from loyalty to acrimony over the span of a few years. The former lawyer who is now slamming Trump in ads used to tell reporters that he would take a bullet for the then-real estate developer. And the relationship has landed Cohen in legal trouble. Trump\u2019s former fixer admitted in February 2018 that he opened a limited liability company in 2016 to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, $130,000 to keep quiet about the alleged affair. Trump and the White House have denied Daniels\u2019 allegations of an affair. The FBI then raided Cohen\u2019s office, hotel room and residence in April, seizing information related to the Daniels payments. Cohen\u2019s fidelity to Trump began to falter after that, with the former Trump lawyer excoriating the President in an interview with ABC News in July 2018. He would later plead guilty in a Manhattan federal court to eight criminal counts in August 2018, including tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations. He later pleaded guilty to another charge \u2013 lying to Congress as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election. Cohen reported to a federal prison in Otisville, New York, in May 2019, where he was set to begin serving a three-year sentence. Cohen was released to furlough in late May as part of a release program undertaken by the Bureau of Prisons to address the coronavirus pandemic. Cohen was forced to return to prison on July 9 when he balked at a provision in his home confinement agreement that would have prohibited his use of social media and engagement with the media, including books. Cohen is slated to publish a memoir in September on his time working for Trump titled \u201cDisloyal: A Memoir. The true story of the former personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump.\u201d Cohen\u2019s lawyers alleged that he was ordered back to prison in retaliation for the tell-all book, a claim that a federal judge agreed with a few weeks later when he ordered Cohen released from prison and back to home confinement. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The contrast was jarring. In the space of 30 minutes at the Republican National Convention on Monday night, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the current President, and Tim Scott, the first African American Republican elected to the Senate from South Carolina, presented radically different views of what it means to be a Republican and a conservative in this American moment. In doing so, Scott offered up the stark choice the Republican Party will face either in 2021 or 2024: What does the post-Trump GOP look like, sound like and focus on? Trump Jr. spoke first at the RNC, and, as has become his trademark, offered up a muscular defense of his father\u2019s policies while sneeringly deriding those who oppose him. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cBeijing Biden is so weak on China that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden,\u201d said Don Jr. at one point. He called the former vice president the \u201cLoch Ness Monster of the Swamp.\u201d He said \u201cthe Left\u2019s trying to \u2018cancel\u2019 all of those founders,\u201d and are now \u201ccoming for our freedom of speech and want to bully us into submission.\u201d The Republican convention just proved this scary fact about the GOP Trump Jr. leavened the savaging of his father\u2019s political opponents with a sort of Joel Osteen-like aspirational promise of future prosperity and perfection \u2013 as long as voters re-elect Donald Trump. \u201cImagine the life you want to have \u2013 one with a great job, a beautiful home, and a perfect family,\u201d said Trump Jr. \u201cYou can have it. \u2026 Imagine a world where the evils of communism and radical Islamic terrorism are not given a chance to spread \u2013 where heroes are celebrated and the good guys win. You can have it.\u201d The message from DJTJ was simple: I have a great life. You can too. But only if you recognize that Democrats will destroy you and everything you love if given the chance. Or, to use Trump Jr.\u2019s own words: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work, and school vs. rioting, looting and vandalism.\u201d Then came Scott \u2013 and everything changed. The South Carolina Republican senator presented a very different face of the Republican Party than the one offered up by Trump Jr. Gone were the hard edges about Democrats\u2019 working to destroy society. In their place was Scott\u2019s powerful retelling of how he is \u201cliving my mother\u2019s American Dream.\u201d Trump's coalition is narrowing Scott spoke of his parents\u2019 divorce when he was young, his mother working 16 hours a day to provide, his own lack of focus in school. \u201cBut even while I was failing the 9th grade \u2026 my mother always said, \u2018When you shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you will be among the stars.\u201d Scott recounted. \u201cShe never lost faith in me, even when I lost faith in myself.\u201d Hopefulness and optimism virtually poured from Scott\u2019s words. \u201cWe live in a world that only wants you to believe in the bad news \u2026 racially, economically and culturally polarizing news,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cThe truth is, our nation\u2019s arc always bends back towards fairness. We are not fully where we want to be \u2026 but thank God we are not where we used to be!\u201d View 2020 presidential election polling Scott presented himself as the living embodiment of what it means to dream and how hard work is rewarded \u2013 especially by a Republican Party that believes that you can make of yourself whatever you can imagine. In a stunningly powerful line near the close of his remarks, Scott said this: \u201cOur family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime. And that\u2019s why I believe the next American century can be better than the last.\u201d Watching the back-to-back speeches, you could be forgiven for a bit of whiplash. The only thing that Trump Jr. and Scott seemed to have in common is the fact that they both identify as Republicans. Beyond that, the two speeches \u2013 and the two men giving them \u2013 felt like they were coming from different planets. Which, in a very real sense, they were. Trump Jr. represents a sort of Trumpism 2.0 \u2013 younger, edgier (yes, that is possible), more aggressive and entirely uncompromising. Scott, on the other hand, is symbolic of a future many in the GOP establishment hope for: A Black man \u2013 steeped in the fiscal and social conservatism that the GOP has leaned on for decades \u2013 carrying a message of opportunity and hope to a country that has stopped seeing Republicans in that light. Hits and misses from Night 1 of the Republican National Convention What\u2019s so fascinating about the dueling visions of the GOP on display Monday night is that this is only a preview \u2013 an early skirmish of the larger Republican war to come. Both Trump Jr. and Scott are already being mentioned as potential 2024 candidates for the Republican nomination \u2013 whether or not President Trump wins a second term in 70 days. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling it in,\u201d Scott said cryptically on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Tuesday morning when asked whether he would rule out a run for president. Which sounds a lot like what Trump Jr. told a Michigan rally of his father\u2019s supporters last year. \u201cRight now, I\u2019ll never rule anything out,\u201d Trump Jr. said. \u201cI do enjoy it. I like being in the fight. I like being in the mix. I like seeing, you know, the difference it\u2019s making to real working-class families all over the country.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Make no mistake: Neither Trump Jr. nor Scott will have a free run at the nomination if they do decide to seek it. Trump Jr. will be joined in the Trump 2.0 lane by the likes of Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Vice President Mike Pence. Scott\u2019s alternate vision of the GOP will be one shared by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, among others. Even though the 2024 race will get more crowded and less clear-cut as we get closer to it, what we saw on Monday night is a stark reminder that the post-Trump GOP will be faced with an fundamental choice over the next few years: More Trumpism, or a kinder, gentler version of the GOP. The choice the party\u2019s voters make will have implications that could last for decades.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This was excerpted from the August 24 edition of CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe. You can criticize Donald Trump for a lot of things. But he could never be accused of failing to toot his own horn. The US President plans to outdo even his own record for self-promotion this week at the Republican National Convention, where he and his family will rarely leave center stage. That ubiquity will feed his craving for attention and delight his supporters. But hours of Trump TV seems unlikely to win back disillusioned moderate Republicans and independents, and will play directly into Democratic claims that Trump\u2019s self-obsession and refusal to listen makes crises worse. Last week\u2019s smooth virtual Democratic convention raised expectations for the Trump show, not least since he portrayed his opponent Joe Biden beforehand as bumbling and senile, and then criticized the convention as boring. Trump wants a more spontaneous show, but any glitches in the live performance will add to his reputation for chaos and mismanagement. Still, Republicans have an opening: they can do a better job than Democrats of highlighting the anger and economic disenfranchisement of working class communities devastated by globalization and a technological revolution that destroyed blue collar jobs. Trump\u2019s campaign promises testimony from regular Americans who have been lifted by the President\u2019s policies. But he will have to rebrand his response to the coronavirus \u2014 which killed nearly 180,000 Americans so far \u2013 as a huge success, since Biden is promising a way out of the nightmare. And since he can\u2019t win the character contest, Trump needs to find a way to drive the Democrat\u2019s numbers down somehow. Brace for tales of radical \u201csocialists,\u201d \u201cleft-wing\u201d fascism, burning cities, and liberals who want to shut the economy, abolish (White) suburbs, grab Americans\u2019 guns, rewrite the country\u2019s history, open the borders to marauding immigrants and surrender to foreigners. Serendipitous satellite images taken Aug. 18 appeared to show a Chinese submarine entering an underground base in China\u2019s southern resort island Hainan \u2013 immediately drawing comparisons to scenes from a spy movie. There\u2019s one member of Trump\u2019s family who definitely won\u2019t be giving a speech at the RNC \u2013 his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, who warned \u201cDonald\u2019s out for Donald,\u201d in audio excerpts obtained by CNN. \u201cHis goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God,\u201d she said, according to the recording, first reported by the Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories. The lack of preparation. The lying. Holy shit.\u201d The sisterly rebuke was secretly taped by Mary Trump, a niece and fierce critic of the President, whose bombshell book contends he is unfit for office. \u201cIt\u2019s the phoniness of it all. It\u2019s the phoniness and this cruelty. Donald is cruel,\u201d said Barry, a retired judge. She also alleged that Trump got into college because he paid someone to take his exams. (The White House denies it.) \u201cYou can\u2019t replace the personal interactions,\u201d complained one ambassador in Washington. \u201cIt is just not the same thing.\u201d Foreign envoys normally enjoy schmooze fests of cocktail parties and breakfasts with party power brokers during the US nominating conventions. But as CNN\u2019s State Department reporter Kylie Atwood writes for Meanwhile, there are two problems: Social distancing has scotched in-person diplomacy; and Biden aides are skittish about giving face time to anyone from Embassy Row, wary of the slightest suggestion of courting foreign interference in the vote. \u201cDiplomats traditionally swarm the Republican and Democratic conventions \u2013 their cables back home buzz with intel on rising foreign policy players and hints about how a second term administration might behave. Not this year. \u201cThe fallout from the last election, when Trump campaign aides had multiple contacts with Russians and future national security adviser Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Moscow\u2019s ambassador during the transition has complicated efforts by foreign envoys to contact Biden\u2019s team. \u201cOne Democratic foreign policy official informally involved in the former VP\u2019s foreign policy orbit explained it this way. \u2018People are very, very wary of anything that would smack of passing information or conveying information at all to representatives from abroad.\u2019 \u201cA second foreign diplomat based in Washington said: \u2018It is more of a jigsaw puzzle than it would normally be.\u2019 And some diplomats aren\u2019t even in the US \u2014 a country that has mismanaged the pandemic more poorly than many others: If they\u2019re doing their jobs virtually anyway, they might as well be back home. \u201cStill, it could be worse. It\u2019s not as if Biden is an unknown quantity. He led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled the globe as Vice President and his likely diplomatic \u2018A team\u2019 is also well known.  The Democratic nominee has promised to rejoin the Paris climate accord, restore traditional American global leadership and convene a conference of the world\u2019s democracies early in his presidency if he wins in November. \u201cBut diplomats want answers about exactly how Biden would proceed on key issues like China and trade that are unlikely to follow the blueprint of the Obama administration.\u201d The modern Rose Garden \u2013 a regular stage for press briefings, bill signings and receptions at the White House \u2013 was inspired by the gardens of France, the UK and Austria, according to heiress horticulturalist Rachel Lambert Mellon, who recalled John F. Kennedy returning home from a state visit with disappointment that the White House \u201chad no garden equal in quality or attractiveness to the gardens that he had seen and in which he had been entertained in Europe.\u201d The resulting redesign transformed the Oval Office\u2019s backyard into a wide reception lawn \u2013 turning up Civil War horseshoes and a military hotline cable during planting. We\u2019d like to know what first lady Melania Trump found in her renovation of the famous garden, unveiled over the weekend and pictured below.",

            "article_content": "Read former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley\u2019s speech from the 2020 Republican National Convention, as prepared for delivery: Good evening. It is great to be back at the Republican National Convention. I\u2019ll start with a little story. It\u2019s about an American Ambassador to the United Nations. And it\u2019s about a speech she gave to this convention. She called for the re-election of the Republican President she served\u2026 And she called out his Democratic opponent\u2026 a former vice president from a failed administration. That ambassador said, and I quote, \u201cDemocrats always blame America first.\u201d The year was 1984. The president was Ronald Reagan. And Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick\u2019s words are just as true today. Joe Biden and the Democrats are still blaming America first. Donald Trump has always put America first. He has earned four more years as President. It was an honor of a lifetime to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Now, the U.N. is not for the faint of heart. It\u2019s a place where dictators-murderers-&-thieves denounce America\u2026 and then put their hands out and demand that we pay their bills. Well, President Trump put an end to all that. With his leadership, we did what Barack Obama and Joe Biden refused to do. We stood up for America\u2026 and we stood against our enemies. Obama and Biden let North Korea threaten America. President Trump rejected that weakness, and we passed the toughest sanctions on North Korea in history. Obama and Biden let Iran get away with murder and literally sent them a plane full of cash. President Trump did the right thing and ripped up the Iran nuclear deal. Obama and Biden led the United Nations to denounce our friend and ally, Israel. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem \u2013 and when the U.N. tried to condemn us, I was proud to cast the American veto. This President has a record of strength and success. The former Vice President has a record of weakness and failure. Joe Biden is good for Iran and ISIS\u2026 great for Communist China\u2026 and he\u2019s a godsend to everyone who wants America to apologize, abstain, and abandon our values. Donald Trump takes a different approach. He\u2019s tough on China, and he took on ISIS and won. And he tells the world what it needs to hear. At home, the President is the clear choice on jobs and the economy. He\u2019s moved America forward, while Joe Biden held America back. When Joe was VP, I was governor of the great state of South Carolina. We had a pretty good run. Manufacturers of all kinds flocked to our state from overseas, creating tens of thousands of American jobs. People were referring to South Carolina as \u201cthe beast of the southeast,\u201d which I loved. Everything we did happened in spite of Joe Biden and his old boss. We cut taxes. They raised them. We slashed red tape. They piled on more mandates. And when we brought in good-paying jobs, Biden and Obama sued us. I fought back\u2026 and they gave up. A Biden-Harris administration would be much, much worse. Last time, Joe\u2019s boss was Obama\u2026 this time, it would be Pelosi, Sanders, and the Squad. Their vision for America is socialism. And we know that socialism has failed everywhere. They want to tell Americans how to live\u2026 and what to think. They want a government takeover of health care. They want to ban fracking and kill millions of jobs. They want massive tax hikes on working families. Joe Biden and the socialist left would be a disaster for our economy. But President Trump is leading a new era of opportunity. Before Communist China gave us the coronavirus, we were breaking economic records left and right. The pandemic has set us back, but not for long. President Trump brought our economy back before, and he will bring it back again. There\u2019s one more important area where our President is right. He knows that political correctness and \u201ccancel culture\u201d are dangerous and just plain wrong. In much of the Democratic Party, it\u2019s now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country. This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. They came to America and settled in a small southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world. We faced discrimination and hardship. But my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor. America is a story that\u2019s a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress, and make America even freer, fairer, and better for everyone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s tragic to see so much of the Democratic Party turn a blind eye toward riots and rage. The American people know we can do better. And of course we know that every single black life is valuable. The black cops who\u2019ve been shot in the line of duty \u2013 they matter. The black small business owners who\u2019ve watched their life\u2019s work go up in flames \u2013 they matter. The black kids who\u2019ve been gunned down on the playground \u2013 their lives matter too. And their lives are being ruined and stolen by the violence on our streets. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this. It wasn\u2019t like this in South Carolina five years ago. Our state came face-to-face with evil. A white supremacist walked into Mother Emanuel Church during Bible Study. Twelve African Americans pulled up a chair and prayed with him for an hour. Then he began to shoot. After that horrific tragedy, we didn\u2019t turn against each other. We came together \u2013 black and white, Democrat and Republican. Together, we made the hard choices needed to heal \u2013 and removed a divisive symbol, peacefully and respectfully. What happened then should give us hope now. America isn\u2019t perfect. But the principles we hold dear are perfect. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America. It\u2019s time to keep that blessing alive for the next generation. This President, and this Party, are committed to that noble task. We seek a nation that rises together, not falls apart in anarchy and anger. We know that the only way to overcome America\u2019s challenges is to embrace America\u2019s strengths. We are striving to reach a brighter future\u2026 Where every child goes to a world-class school, chosen by their parents\u2026 Where every family lives in a safe community with good jobs\u2026 Where every entrepreneur has the freedom to achieve and inspire\u2026 Where every believer can worship without fear and every life is protected\u2026 Where every girl and boy, every woman and man, of every race and religion, has the best shot at the best life. In this election, we must choose the only candidate who has and who will continue delivering on that vision. President Trump and Vice President Pence have my support. And America has our promise. We will build on the progress of our past and unlock the promise of our future. That future starts when the American people re-elect President Donald Trump. Thank you. Good night. And may God always bless America.",

            "article_content": "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified in front of the Democrat-led House Oversight Committee on Monday in a contentious hearing where Democrats criticized his leadership at the agency and raised concerns over mail delivery delays. The issues have arisen during the coronavirus pandemic and in the run-up to the presidential election as President Donald Trump rails against mail-in voting. Congressional Republicans countered the accusations, arguing that the postmaster general is acting in good faith and that any problems plaguing the agency pre-date his tenure, while DeJoy defended his leadership and sought to reassure that the US Postal Service is equipped to securely handle election mail this fall. Here are seven takeaways from the hearing: The House hearing, where Democrats are in the majority, was notably more hostile than a hearing before a Republican-led Senate panel with DeJoy that took place Friday. In a sign of a potential escalation between House Democrats and the postmaster general in the weeks to come, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, warned DeJoy to \u201cexpect a subpoena\u201d if he withholds information from the committee in the future. 6 takeaways from the postmaster general's Senate hearing Maloney admonished DeJoy during the hearing, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re withholding information from us, concealing documents and downplaying the damage that you\u2019re causing.\u201d Referencing documents requested by the committee, Maloney warned, \u201cIf you continue to withhold information or otherwise fail to comply, you can expect a subpoena.\u201d The House Oversight chairwoman rebuked the postmaster general, saying that if any CEO had the kind of \u201cplummeting record\u201d that the Postal Service has had under his leadership so far, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why he would be kept on.\u201d DeJoy responded sharply, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s an unfair accusation.\u201d Later during the hearing, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York asked DeJoy for a commitment to submit records of his daily calendar to the committee. DeJoy said that if he is required to comply with the request he would. Ocasio-Cortez responded by raising the possibility of a subpoena, saying, \u201cThe details of this calendar are extraordinarily important to the committee\u2019s investigations and if we cannot receive them voluntarily, I would recommend consideration of a subpoena.\u201d Amid Democratic attacks, DeJoy defended his tenure at the agency, arguing that there is misinformation about what he has done since taking over as postmaster general and saying that he wants to correct the record. \u201cThere are many inaccuracies about my actions that I wish to again correct,\u201d DeJoy said in his testimony. DeJoy asserted that he did not direct the removal of blue mail collection boxes or mail processing equipment or the cutback in hours at any post offices. He also said he did not direct an elimination or cutback in overtime. \u201cI did, however, suspend these practices to remove any misperceptions about our commitment to delivering the nation\u2019s election mail. Any further assertions by the media or elected officials is furthering a false narrative to the American people,\u201d he said. A July 10 internal memo directed to all USPS employees did not explicitly state that overtime was ending. But it did create specific conditions that, union officials tells CNN, directly led to a significant majority of overtime opportunities being eliminated and prevented. As DeJoy described on Monday actions he has taken as postmaster general, he conceded that there has been a \u201ctemporary service decline.\u201d One action was to direct \u201ca plan to improve our adherence to the transportation schedule of our over 40,000 trips a day.\u201d DeJoy said the postal service \u201caccomplished this goal.\u201d But he noted, \u201cWe have had temporary service decline, which should not have happened,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are fixing this.\u201d The postmaster general said another change he made was \u201cinstalling a new organizational reporting structure,\u201d which he said would \u201cinstill greater accountability for performance and to focus the organization on service and growth.\u201d He argued that these changes \u201cwill be the catalyst for significant improvements in cost, performance and growth\u201d for the Postal Service. Reiterating what he said at Friday\u2019s Senate hearing, DeJoy insisted that the USPS stands ready to deliver election mail \u2013 a key concern for Democrats during the pandemic, which is expected to lead to a surge of mail-in ballots. \u201cThe Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation\u2019s ballots securely and on time,\u201d DeJoy testified, describing the charge as a \u201csacred duty\u201d and his \u201cnumber one priority between now and Election Day.\u201d DeJoy did, however, urge Americans who plan to vote by mail not to wait until the last minute to do so. \u201cI encourage all Americans who choose to vote by mail to request their ballots early and to vote early as a common sense best practice,\u201d he said. Later during the hearing, DeJoy said definitively, \u201cWe will be able to handle all election mail for the 2020 election.\u201d Pressed by Democrats over a mail slowdown, DeJoy conceded that the Postal Service is \u201cconcerned with the deterioration in service,\u201d but argued that the agency is recovering amid a focus on improvements. The assessment from DeJoy came after Maloney accused him of downplaying mail delays, saying, \u201cThis is just a disaster for the people who need their mail.\u201d In response, DeJoy said, \u201cWe are very concerned with the deterioration in service and are working very diligently. In fact, we\u2019re seeing a big recovery this week.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a nice recovery,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have a real good shot of getting to the stated metrics that we are supposed to be governed by.\u201d As he did during Friday\u2019s Senate hearing, DeJoy also discussed the toll the coronavirus crisis has taken on the agency and its employees. The postmaster general confirmed during Monday\u2019s hearing that 83 postal service workers have died from Covid-19. During the hearing, Democrats on the panel grilled the postmaster general in a series of tense exchanges. At one point, Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts questioned DeJoy over whether he would return mail-sorting machines that had been removed. \u201cIn the middle of a pandemic that has killed 170,000 Americans, and on the eve of a national election at a time when the CDC is advising people not to gather, limit outside contact, the Postal Service started removing 671 high-speed mail sorting machines across the country,\u201d Lynch charged. The Democratic congressman pressed DeJoy, \u201cWill you put the machines back?\u201d \u201cNo, I will not,\u201d DeJoy responded. As he testified during Friday\u2019s Senate hearing, DeJoy said Monday that the machines \u201care not necessary.\u201d At another point in the hearing, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California quizzed DeJoy on his knowledge of the agency in highly specific terms. First, Porter asked DeJoy the cost of a first-class postage stamp. He replied, \u201c55 cents.\u201d The congresswoman followed up by asking the cost to mail a postcard. He responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Porter then asked, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s, like, one of those greeting cards that\u2019s a square envelope \u2013 then what is the postage?\u201d He responded, \u201cI\u2019ll submit that I know very little about a postage stamp.\u201d During the hearing, DeJoy indicated that he has had contact with Trump campaign associates over the issue of attacks on vote by mail and the Postal Service. Asked if he told the Board of Governors that he has been in touch with the Trump campaign to ask them to stop attacks on the Postal Service and voting by mail, DeJoy responded, \u201cI have put word around to different people that this is not helpful.\u201d DeJoy elaborated, saying, \u201cI have not spoken to Trump campaign leadership in that regard. I have spoken to people that are friends of mine that are associated with the campaign, yes.\u201d The comments from the postmaster general come as Trump has repeatedly and baselessly attacked mail-in voting, falsely claiming that it is rife with fraud. During Friday\u2019s Senate hearing, DeJoy testified that he plans to vote by mail, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to vote by mail myself,\u201d when asked if he supports absentee voting and voting by mail. Mike Duncan, chairman of the USPS Board of Governors who was also a witness at the same hearing as DeJoy, testified virtually about how the board selected DeJoy to serve as postmaster general, calling it an \u201corganized, deliberate, through search process.\u201d Duncan said that the board agreed that \u201cthe Postal Service would benefit from a transformational leader.\u201d The testimony comes amid increasing scrutiny from Democrats over how DeJoy got the top job at USPS. Duncan, like DeJoy, argued that the USPS is prepared to handle election mail this fall. \u201cThe board has confidence in the postal service\u2019s ability to perform for the American people in this election season,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is emerging from obscurity and into a glaring hot spotlight lately, raising alarms with aggressive new strategies that have upended the United States Postal Service just as it heads into possibly the most consequential moment of its history \u2013 the great vote-by-mail election of 2020. DeJoy\u2019s administration has slowed delivery, removed high-speed letter sorters from commission and issued a stark warning to election officials that mail-in ballots will no longer automatically be moved as priority mail. On top of that, the USPS has started reducing post office operating hours across several states, cut overtime for postal workers and removed some of their iconic blue letter collection boxes. In the wake of what DeJoy is calling a \u201crestructuring,\u201d the agency\u2019s inspector general is now reviewing these policy changes. And DeJoy will testify in both the Senate and House in coming days following demands from Democrats he appear. On Tuesday, the embattled DeJoy suspended some of the changes until after the election. But Democrats say they want a full reversal of changes and are calling on DeJoy to prepare the USPS for the flood of mail-in ballots necessitated by the pandemic. Former President Barack Obama characterized the administration\u2019s approach to the postal service as \u201ca knee-capping\u201d \u2013 sabotage by an executive who dislikes mail-in balloting and also has power over the agency that makes it possible. Charged with securely shepherding millions of Americans\u2019 votes, the USPS is shouldering a growing sense of mistrust from all sides. Each day a bill payment is marked overdue or a birthday card arrives later than expected is another day for voters to wonder: Will the Post Office be up to the task this election? DeJoy appears sanguine amid the furor, acknowledging to employees this week that the slowdown is a direct result of his policies. In a memo to postal service staff and workers, he allowed there had been \u201cunintended consequences\u201d but promised that the changes will eventually mean \u201ctransformation into a financially stable organization\u201d \u2013 a longtime conservative goal for the fiscally-challenged agency. Election experts may be worried about the post office role in a free and fair election, but DeJoy revealed that he, like Trump, is focused on the bottom line. For the two months of his tenure, postal workers and election observers have been watching DeJoy closely and wondering to what extent he\u2019ll serve Trump\u2019s interests during the 2020 elections. The week\u2019s events served to highlight just how in sync with his boss he may be. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic man,\u201d Trump said when asked Saturday evening during his news conference at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, if he backs DeJoy\u2019s changes at the agency. \u201cHe wants to make the Post Office great again.\u201d A successful businessman and Republican donor, DeJoy is known among friends for his take-no-BS attitude. His wife, the Polish-born Aldona Wos, was the US ambassador to Estonia under George W. Bush and is currently awaiting confirmation as ambassador to Canada. Relatively unknown outside of GOP circles in North Carolina, DeJoy became a part of the President\u2019s large circle of unofficial advisers in his role as a prolific fundraiser for Trump. DeJoy had been tapped as the finance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention in Charlotte, a high-profile position generally reserved for confidants or financial bundlers. DeJoy was Trump\u2019s preferred pick when the agency\u2019s board of governors tapped him earlier this year to run the centuries-old Postal Service like a private enterprise, and one source close to DeJoy said he was easily convinced to accept it. Unlike several recent postmasters general who came up through the agency, DeJoy is a government novice whose connection to the mail is primarily commercial. His company, New Breed Logistics, contracted with the USPS for 25 years, providing supply chain services. Another Post Office contractor, XPO Logistics, acquired New Breed in 2014 and named DeJoy to its board. Ethics experts have raised conflict-of-interest questions about DeJoy continuing to hold a multimillion-dollar stake in XPO \u2013 questions similar to those about Trump\u2019s unclear financial interest in his own private company. The similarities between Trump and DeJoy don\u2019t end there. Both are New York natives who are known to speak their minds loudly and without regard for the rules. DeJoy\u2019s house in North Carolina, where Trump attended a fundraiser in 2017, resembles a castle \u2013 complete with a rotunda, a two-story kitchen wing, and a staircase painted with 24-carat gold leaf. Most importantly, DeJoy shares the President\u2019s view that government should be approached more like a business, and he seems to have little patience for bureaucratic niceties. That aspect comes through in DeJoy\u2019s memo to Post Office employees, which is remarkably blunt in its assessment of the agency\u2019s problems (\u201cOver the years we have grown undisciplined in our mail and package processing schedules\u201d) and asserts with Trumpian fanfare the changes are part of a \u201ctransformative initiative.\u201d That my-way-or-the-highway attitude has permeated the office of the Postmaster General. In a change from previous practice, the USPS is telling elections officials that election-related mail will not be treated as first class even when states pay for bulk rates \u2013 a costly policy change as states prepare for a bigger-than-expected number of mail-in ballots. And in letters from DeJoy\u2019s general counsel to elections officials in nearly every state and the District of Columbia, USPS claims those state\u2019s deadlines for casting mail-in or absentee ballots are \u201cincongruous with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards.\u201d The letters state that the Post Office \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d states send out request forms, applications and ballots on a timeline outlined in the letter. The problem, according to the letters, lies with the states\u2019 schedule, not with the Post Office itself. The up-front approach has already spurred action from several states, illustrating the impact DeJoy is having on officials across the country worried about conducting an election in unusual times. In a court filing related to this warning, Pennsylvania said it is willing to extend its deadline to receive ballots to up to three days after the election, provided they are mailed by Election Day. Final details of the state\u2019s postmark policy for November are still in flux, as the court case continues. Other states told CNN they were already revising their practices following what were essentially test-runs of a mail-in voting system during primary elections earlier this year. Jon Keeling, spokesman for the Ohio Secretary of State, said the letter \u201creinforces reforms we\u2019ve been working on since the primaries,\u201d which include the design of the mail-in ballots so they stand out among other pieces of mail. But not every state is taking DeJoy\u2019s actions in stride. Last week, Arizona secretary of state Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, wrote a letter to the state\u2019s Republican attorney general encouraging an investigation into the USPS changes, noting that it\u2019s against the law to \u201cdelay the delivery of a ballot.\u201d That combative tone reflects the way Democrats have zeroed in on DeJoy as a partisan stalking horse for suppressing the vote. Democrats in Congress have expressed their objections with the USPS cutbacks following what were described as \u201cheated\u201d discussions with DeJoy earlier this month. In that meeting Democrats demanded the cuts be reinstated, citing the need for a fully functioning Post Office ahead of the election. \u201c[T]he President, his cronies and Republicans in Congress continue to wage their all-out assault on the Postal Service and its role in ensuring the integrity of the 2020 election,\u201d said House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer in a joint statement Friday. DeJoy and the Post Office have also received criticism from the NAACP for \u201cdisrupting the machinery of democracy. A top postal-workers union, the National Association of Letter Carriers, also took a swipe at Trump\u2019s USPS. In a Friday statement endorsing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, NALC president Frederic Rolando said their decision was \u201cpartly informed by what we have seen from the current administration with regards to the Postal Service.\u201d But DeJoy still has the most important voice in his corner: the President\u2019s. Despite Trump\u2019s claim last week that he didn\u2019t speak to his postmaster general, the White House confirmed the two did meet in the Oval Office early in August \u2013 two days before DeJoy\u2019s contentious meeting with congressional Democrats. At the August 7 meeting of the postal service\u2019s board of governors, DeJoy dismissed the idea he was a puppet of the President. \u201cWhile I certainly have a good relationship with the President of the United States, the notion that I would ever make decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President, or anyone else in the administration, is wholly off-base,\u201d he said. Still, Trump appears willing to stand by his appointee and his decisions at the Post Office. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good businessman. He\u2019s very successful. And I know he wants to make the Post Office at least somewhat lose a lot less money than \u2013 they\u2019ve lost so much money over the decade. Nobody has ever \u2013 nothing loses money like the Post Office. And he wants to make it successful,\u201d Trump told reporters at his Bedminster club last week, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s see what he can do.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: This story was originally published August 16, 2020. It has been updated to note that Louis DeJoy will testify before Congress. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen and Ellie Kaufman contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Given the crisis facing the United States Postal Service before a presidential election, the last thing John Herter expected to receive in the mail Saturday was an absentee ballot request form with President Donald Trump\u2019s face on it. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d Herter said his wife told him as she opened up the mailer to reveal a photo of Trump grinning underneath the words, \u201cAre you going to let the Democrats silence you? Act now to stand with President Trump.\u201d Herter, of Lincoln County is among a group of voters in North Carolina to receive the mailer over the past few days after Trump said that he opposed crucial USPS funding because he doesn\u2019t want to see it used for mail-in voting this November. During an interview on Fox News last week, Trump said that if USPS does not receive the additional $25 billion funding request that Democrats included in the ongoing stimulus negotiations, then he believes the Post Office won\u2019t be able to handle the influx of mail-in ballots in the upcoming election. The pandemic has led to high levels of voting-by-mail, but the President has tried to restrict this method because he said it is filled with fraud and abuse, claims that CNN has fact-checked multiple times and which are largely without merit. Trump has criticized mail-in voting for months, baselessly asserting that it will lead to voter fraud. There is not widespread voter fraud in US elections, and nonpartisan experts say neither party automatically benefits when states expand access to mail-in voting. This is why Chandler Carranza, of Gaston County, North Carolina, said he laughed after receiving the absentee ballot request mailer on Thursday. \u201cThe irony is very thick and definitely not lost on me,\u201d Carranza told CNN. \u201cTrump has been saying mail-in ballots will bring fraud to the election but absentee ballots are legit. Which is it? It can\u2019t be both ways. I laughed because if the campaign actually took information from other times they have reached out to me, they\u2019d know I won\u2019t vote for Trump despite being a registered Republican.\u201d Got my mail in absentee ballot request form from @realDonaldTrump that will allow me to mail in my vote if I need to... but I can\u2019t remember if this is a good thing or bad thing. Mail in is bad but absentee is good??? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 pic.twitter.com/fbdgiq4hwc The Trump campaign said the mailer shows how it \u201cis working to ensure voters in every state know how their state\u2019s sorting system works so that every eligible voter can cast their ballot and have their vote counted,\u201d Thea McDonald, deputy national press secretary, told CNN over email after she was shown the mailer. \u201cPresident Trump has consistently and rightly said that where a voter cannot make it to the polls, they should request an absentee ballot,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe President has also correctly distinguished between chaos-ridden universal mail-in voting systems, like the one that led to California\u2019s train wreck primary, and traditional absentee mail voting systems, like the tried and true system in North Carolina\u2014a distinction Democrats and many in the mainstream media purposely ignore to sow confusion.\u201d The mailer was sent out by the North Carolina Republican Party, press secretary Tim Wigginton told CNN. The state party has sent several statewide mailers \u201cto make it easier for interested voters to participate,\u201d Wigginton said. \u201cWe want our voters to know they can utilize this tool to cast their ballot in an easy, safe and secure manner. It is important to note that the North Carolina system requires a voter to actively solicit a ballot and go through an easy but important verification process to request a ballot,\u201d he added. \u201cWe along with President Trump oppose an all-mail election process where voters are mailed ballots without a prior request and authentication.\u201d The USPS has come under criticism recently. Newly released letters from the USPS have warned nearly every state that slowdowns in delivery could cause ballots to show up late and not be counted. CNN and other news organizations also reported that in the last week that USPS has removed letter collection boxes in at least four states: New York, Oregon, Montana and Indiana. The USPS announced Sunday it would stop removing postal collection boxes through late November following complaints about how some had been taken away. While Trump is railing against vote by mail, his campaign sends out absentee ballot request forms here in NC. (Something he complained about that governments in some states were doing) pic.twitter.com/48TIBRgVog House Democrats said Sunday they are \u201cramping up\u201d their investigation of the United States Postal Service and as Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, called on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and Chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors Robert Duncan to testify. Possible action by the House could include forbidding the Postal Service to change sorting devices, prevent the closure of facilities, stopping any effort to end overtime pay or changing the timing of mail delivery, one of the sources said. Democrats also may push language requiring all ballot deliveries to have first class status. While it is common for candidates and political parties to send mail to voters, especially those who don\u2019t have access to TV or the internet, Real Facts NC, a non-profit dedicated to researching and telling the stories about issues facing North Carolinians, has never seen a mailer like this before, messaging director Jazmynne Williams told CNN. One voter concerned over the problems facing the USPS is Taylor Alexander, of Wake County, North Carolina. She received the absentee ballot request form on Wednesday. \u201cMy initial reaction was that I was kind of shocked, and laughed because of the irony of it, because Trump had been railing against mail-in voting, but here his party was, promoting it, and sending out an absentee ballot request form,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous that the funding is being cut and processes are being changed in the post office. People\u2019s life saving medication are days late, bills aren\u2019t being paid on time, and all for what? It\u2019s rigging the election.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Paul P.

            "article_content": "The US Postal Service warned almost all of the 50 states and Washington, DC, that voters could be at risk of not getting their ballots back to election offices in time to be counted because election rules are not compatible with the time needed for delivery and return of absentee ballots through the mail, according to letters released on Friday night. The letters provide a stark reminder that the expansion of mail-in voting due to the pandemic is colliding with a slowdown in postal delivery because of controversial changes made by the new postmaster general. Most states were informed in late July by the service\u2019s general counsel that postal service analysis suggests local deadlines for requesting and returning ballots did not allow for enough time based on delivery estimates. The letters varied based on state rules, with a few states deemed to having sufficient time built in, according to the postal service assessment. Only Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Rhode Island were informed by USPS that they shouldn\u2019t expect problems, according to the letters. But in total, the letters portray a last-minute warning some votes could be at risk, leaving some states scrambling to consider whether they have the ability to even adjust rules in time for the election. The letters predate President Donald Trump\u2019s most recent attacks on mail-in voting, including on Thursday when he said he opposed giving billions in funding to the postal service because doing so would allow increased mail-in voting. The changes are a result of previously planned cost-cutting measures, put in place partly as a reaction to the President\u2019s extensive criticism of the US Postal Service as a money loser that does not charge enough for its services, combined with the coronavirus pandemic. Union officials have been warning that newly implemented measures would affect mail-in voting in November. The popularity of voting by mail has exploded during the pandemic and it\u2019s expected that Democratic voters plan to take advantage of expanded mail-in voting access more than Republicans. News of the letters comes a little less than two weeks after the US Postal Service definitively said in a statement that it had the capacity to handle the added volume of mail-in voting anticipated in November. READ: Letter from US Postal Service warns North Carolina it may not be able to deliver ballots on time \u201cCertain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots, particularly with respect to new residents who register to vote shortly before Election Day, appear to be incongruous with the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards,\u201d USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall wrote to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. \u201cThis mismatch creates a significant risk that some ballots will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as we understand them.\u201d The letters list standard mail delivery times and prices for first class and marketing mail, the two types of mail USPS sends. Many states use the nonprofit marketing mail rate to send election mail, including absentee and mail-in ballots and ballot applications to voters. The letters state that election mail must be sent from voters by first class mail, which is more expensive than the nonprofit marketing rate. \u201cState or local election officials may generally use either First-Class Mail or Marketing Mail to mail blank ballots to voters,\u201d the letters state. First class mail takes between two and five days to be received, while marketing mail takes between three and 10 days to be received, according to USPS. That, according to Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of commonwealth, is a longer a delivery time than what was factored in for the primaries in June, according to a filing in a related court case. The slower delivery is, according to the court filing, a likely outcome of recent changes put in place by the post office that have been criticized for putting at risk the ability to conduct vote by mail across the country. As a result, Pennsylvania said it is willing to extend its deadline to receive ballots to up to three days after the election, provided they are mailed by Election Day. USPS said the letters were intended to advise \u201celection officials to be mindful of the potential inconsistencies between the Postal Service\u2019s delivery standards, which have been in place for a number of years and have not changed, and the provisions of state law,\u201d in a statement. \u201cDuring every election cycle, the Postal Service conducts regular outreach with state and local election officials regarding our mailing requirements, delivery standards and best practices for enabling voting by mail,\u201d a USPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Postal Service is well prepared and has ample capacity to deliver America\u2019s election mail. However, the increases in volume and the effect of when volumes were mailed in the primary elections presented a need to ensure the Postal Service\u2019s recommendations were reemphasized to elections officials.\u201d Both Michigan and Ohio\u2019s secretaries of state offices said the letters reflect changes the states were already implementing to ensure that mail-in and absentee ballots would be mailed and received in time to be counted in the election. Jon Keeling, spokesman for the Ohio Secretary of State, said the letter \u201creinforces reforms we\u2019ve been working on since the primaries,\u201d which include the design of the mail-in ballots so they stand out among other pieces of mail. Michigan Secretary of State spokeswoman Tracy Wimmer said the letter \u201creiterates the importance of a number of things we are already doing,\u201d like \u201cworking with USPS officials in Michigan to ensure that election mailings are prioritized in their system.\u201d Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman was the first secretary to publicize that she had received the USPS letter. Wyman was initially concerned when she received the letter, because Washington has historically sent mail-in ballots to every registered voter by first class mail at a nonprofit bulk mail price. She was concerned the letter indicated that if they sent their election mail at the nonprofit rate, they would have longer delivery times. Wyman clarified with USPS officials in a call earlier this week that the state would still receive the nonprofit marketing bulk rate but get first class mail service when sending ballots to voters. \u201cI was certainly concerned that this was maybe some sort of messaging to let us know that if we did our mailing at a nonprofit low rate that we would have very long delivery times,\u201d Wyman told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cThey chose their words carefully \u2026 they basically said, yeah, the mail delivery times would be what we\u2019re used to.\u201d If Wyman had to change from paying the nonprofit bulk rate to paying the first class rate, it would have cost her $2.64 million to send 4.8 million ballots, as opposed to the $432,000 it will cost her to send the ballots at nine cents apiece via the nonprofit bulk rate. As a state that has sent ballots to every registered voter before, Wyman and her office have a close relationship with their USPS counterparts. Wyman said she worries for states that are new to mail-in voting options who don\u2019t have as strong relationships already established with the post office. Wyman said she had a call \u201cevery day with the postal service\u201d leading up to Washington\u2019s primary. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just our relationship that we have with the postal service,\u201d she said. News of the letters also comes as top congressional Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are pushing Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to answer what they call \u201cgrave questions about sweeping changes\u201d he is instituting at hundreds of postal facilities. In a 10-page letter sent Friday to DeJoy, the Democrats charge these changes are slowing the mail delivery and \u201ctherefore jeopardize the integrity of the election.\u201d \u201cRather than strongly advocating for the Postal Service\u2019s request for emergency funding, it appears that you are now using funding shortfalls\u2014which are being aggravated by the President himself\u2014to justify sweeping operational changes that experts warn could degrade delivery standards, slow the mail, jeopardize crucial deliveries such as prescription medicines and essential goods, and potentially impair the rights of eligible Americans to cast their votes through the mail in the upcoming November elections,\u201d the Democrats wrote. The Postal Service has asked for $25 billion to help with budget shortfalls. That money is part of the negotiations between the White House and Democrats over a new Covid-19 stimulus bill. Democrats also released two letters from Marshall, the USPS general counsel, to congressional leaders. \u201cWe are currently unable to balance our costs with available funding sources to fulfill both our universal service mission and other legal obligations,\u201d Marshall said in one of the letters. It outlined a number of operational changes the postal service is looking to implement. In the second letter, Marshall said, \u201cThe Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process by doing everything we can to handle and deliver Election Mail, including ballots, in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.\u201d The Democrats are asking for more details and documents about specific changes being proposed, the reason and the potential impact and asked for responses within a week. According to the Democrats, DeJoy wrote a separate letter Friday to Pelosi and Schumer saying: \u201cI also recognize that there have been unintended consequences related to these efforts that have impacted overall service levels.\u201d He added in that letter: \u201cthe Postal Service is working feverishly to address service problems.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comment from USPS, secretaries of state offices and top congressional Democrats.

            "article_content": "The US Postal Service plans to remove hundreds of high-volume mail-processing machines from facilities across the country, leading some postal workers to fear they may have less capacity to process mail during election season. Documents obtained by CNN indicate 671 machines used to organize letters or other pieces of mail are slated for \u201creduction\u201d in dozens of cities this year. The agency started removing machines in June, according to postal workers. While the reductions come amid decreased mail volume this year and are described by some postal officials as making the service more cost-effective, the effort overlaps with other actions implemented by the Postal Service that workers have blamed for delivery delays. The new procedures were described in a July memo and include staff hours being cut. The news was earlier reported by Vice. The removals are also occurring as President Donald Trump has relentlessly attacked voting by mail, falsely claiming that the practice leads to mass fraud. Amid the pandemic, a record number of voters are expected to cast their ballots by mail this fall. Trump said Thursday that he opposes additional funding for the Postal Service because he doesn\u2019t want to see it used for mail-in voting this November, though he later said at a news conference that he would not veto a bill that included the funding. Send a tip:\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely. The Postal Service said in a statement that it \u201croutinely moves equipment around its network as necessary to match changing mail and package volumes. Package volume is up, but mail volume continues to decline. Adapting our processing infrastructure to the current volumes will ensure more efficient, cost effective operations and better service for our customers.\u201d But the Postal Service\u2019s own document calls the move a \u201creduction\u201d of equipment. Postal workers in various locations said machines have been dismantled and that it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the agency was doing with the parts. Some of these machines have the capacity to sort up to 30,000 mail items and take only two Postal Service workers to run, according two machine technicians CNN spoke with. They estimate it would take about 30 employees over their entire shifts \u2013 they have to have scheme training to do the work \u2013 to do that amount of work by hand. The reduction effort has prompted questions and concerns among some postal union leaders. A letter sent Wednesday from the National Postal Mail Handlers Union to the Postal Service headquarters asked, \u201cWhy are these machines being removed?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the anticipated staffing impacts in the facilities that are losing equipment?\u201d The letter also asked if it\u2019s true that all equipment planned for removal has not been used since early May. Chris Bentley, president of the National Postal Mail Handlers Union Local 297, which covers Kansas and part of Missouri, told CNN that postal management has already taken out four machines in Kansas City, two machines in Springfield, Missouri, and one machine in Wichita, Kansas. Bentley said that even though total mail volume is currently down, he didn\u2019t understand why the machines were being removed rather than simply turned off and kept in place in case they are needed in the fall, when the Postal Service expects volume to increase with mail-in ballots, campaign materials and other mail. \u201cThe comparison would be that if you have a room in your house that you are not using much anymore, you might turn the light switch off to that room, but you wouldn\u2019t call an electrician and have all the wiring removed from that room,\u201d he said. Lamont Brooks, director of the clerks division of the American Postal Workers Union, said the Postal Service hadn\u2019t informed the union it was removing machines until the union asked about the issue in June, when it started getting calls from mail clerks about the dismantling of machines. He echoed concerns about potential delays for mail-in ballots. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s not going to be a problem [for] Election Day,\u201d Brooks said. Still, Paul Hogrogian, national president for the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, said he does not expect the dismantling of processing equipment to have a widespread impact on mail delivery time across the country, including in election season. \u201cA lot of the machines they are taking out \u2026 a lot of them haven\u2019t been used in a while anyways,\u201d he said. But he said it may be too early to tell if the Postal Service is taking out too many and that he has heard that plans to remove a few dozen of the machines are on hold. \u201cMaybe they are jumping the gun. Maybe they are not,\u201d he said. While Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump loyalist, began his job in June, Hogrogian said he understands that plans to reduce equipment were in place before DeJoy started. Last Thursday, the Postal Service told Democratic senators in a letter that the service is working to maximize the efficiency of processing and sorting equipment. \u201cIn some instances, we may be able to shift or remove equipment as appropriate,\u201d the letter said. It came in response to questions raised during a meeting of DeJoy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Democratic lawmakers last week called on the Postal Service inspector general to investigate operational changes at the agency. Keith Combs, an American Postal Workers Union local president for the Detroit district, said that not only does the machine removal slow down the operation, but it also makes it a lot more difficult to keep the mail-sorting operation going  There\u2019s a smaller pool of secondary machines available if another machine breaks down. Combs said four machines have been removed in his area, and the remaining machines need to be reprogrammed to run more routes, which also increases the time it takes to process and sort the mail. As a result, Combs says, workers are being told they need to stop running the mail-sorting machines at a certain time \u2013 to stop any overtime accrual. Combs has received reports from his union members that they\u2019re being told to not worry about delayed mail and to \u201clet the mail wait to another day.\u201d A Postal Service spokesperson did not specifically respond to a question about that allegation but repeated the agency\u2019s commitment to fulfill its role in the election process. That also occurred in Maine, according to American Postal Workers Union Local 458 President Scott Adams. Sorted mail was 10 minutes late to the mail trucks, according to Adams, and was left because of new Postal Service protocols to not hold trucks for late mail. While most of these delays center on second- and third-class, or bulk, mail, union members have told Combs this has, at times, included first-class mail. \u201cThe Postal Service must complete the mission,\u201d he says.  \u201cEvery piece of mail must go.\u201d This story has been updated to note that Vice previously reported the story.",

            "article_content": "With Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris, the senator from California becomes just the third woman to be selected as the vice president on a major party ticket and the first Black woman to be nominated. Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, ran for president in 2020 but ended her bid in December. She has been a senator since 2017, and was previously California\u2019s attorney general. In photos: Vice presidential pick Kamala Harris Biden\u2019s announcement on Tuesday came after months of speculation and after his vetting team looked at more than a dozen women. Biden pledged earlier this year to choose a woman as his vice president, and was under pressure to select a woman of color. Next week at the Democratic National Convention, Harris will become the third woman to accept the nomination for vice president of a major party. In 2008, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was the Republican vice presidential nominee, and in 1984, then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York, a Democrat, was the first woman to be on a major party ticket. In 2008, Palin was plucked out of obscurity by Sen. John McCain of Arizona to be on the Republican ticket, stunning those in the political world. Palin, a social conservative, was 44, had been governor of Alaska for less than two years and had almost no foreign policy experience. She was chosen the same year Biden was selected as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate. Palin started her political career when she was elected to the city council of Wasilla, Alaska, in 1992. She later became mayor of Wasilla, which had a population of more than 5,000 at the time. She ran unsuccessfully for state lieutenant governor in 2002, and was later appointed chairwoman of Alaska\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates oil and gas resources. In 2006, Palin defeated incumbent Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary and went on to defeat former Gov. Tony Knowles in the general election. She became the youngest person and first woman elected governor of Alaska. Palin, a self-described \u201chockey mom,\u201d joked in her fiery acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in 2008, \u201cYou know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.\u201d Her speech, an instant success, propelled her onto the national stage and made her an overnight celebrity. After a flurry of national attention, Palin began receiving heightened scrutiny and criticism. About $150,000 was spent on her wardrobe after McCain announced her as his pick, which drew questions about her image among working-class voters. Palin also had a series of missteps and gaffes in media interviews. She said in an interview that one could see Russia from land in Alaska, and that moment was re-created on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by comedian Tina Fey, who delivered the infamous line, \u201cI can see Russia from my house!\u201d while in character. Palin was also mocked by some after not naming a newspaper or magazine that she reads regularly when pressed by CBS\u2019 Katie Couric. Following McCain and Palin\u2019s loss, Palin announced in 2009 that she would step down as governor of Alaska. She was the keynote speaker at the first national tea party convention in Nashville in 2010. She became a political commentator on Fox News, and starred in reality TV shows about her and her family. Palin remained open to a 2012 White House bid but announced in late 2011 that she would not run. Twenty-four years prior to Palin\u2019s nomination, Ferraro, a Democratic congresswoman from Queens, New York, shattered political barriers by becoming the first woman on a major party ticket. Ferraro grew up in New York City and worked as a public school teacher and then a lawyer. In the 1970s, she joined the Queens County District Attorney\u2019s Office and later led a new special victims bureau she helped form that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse and domestic violence. In 1978, Ferraro was elected to the US House of Representatives. While in Congress, she focused on legislation fighting for economic equality for women. When Walter Mondale, who had served as vice president under President Jimmy Carter, chose Ferraro to be his running mate, she became not only the first woman on a major party ticket, but also the first Italian American. Ferraro was a dynamic presence on the campaign trail and her nomination energized Democrats at the national party convention. But during the campaign she faced damaging questions about alleged financial misconduct by her husband, John Zaccaro. Ultimately, the ticket did not garner enough widespread support and Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H.W. Bush. Ferraro ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 1992 and 1998, both times losing the Democratic primary in New York. She served as the ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. In 1996 and 1997, she was a co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d and later appeared as a commentator on Fox News. Ferraro died at age 75 in 2011 while she was being treated for blood cancer.",

            "article_content": "The Working Families Party, a New York-based progressive organization with growing national influence, will endorse and put resources behind Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey\u2019s re-election campaign and Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse\u2019s bid to unseat a 30-year incumbent in the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District. The double-endorsement, of a sitting senator and an insurgent House candidate, signals both the success of the progressive movement over the past few years and a new charge to defend lawmakers, like Markey, who have embraced the left\u2019s agenda and led the way in pushing it forward on Capitol Hill. The Working Families Party\u2019s independent expenditure group was among those that backed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib against a moderate primary challenge in Michigan\u2019s 13th District this week, a race she comfortably won on Tuesday night. Morse is challenging Rep. Richard Neal, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has come under fire from the left \u2013 and other more moderate factions of the party \u2013 for not pursuing oversight efforts into President Donald Trump and his administration with sufficient urgency. The 31-year-old, four-term mayor\u2019s campaign is also backed by Justice Democrats, the group that helped launch a series of successful progressive challengers, from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, to 2020 primary winners Jamaal Bowman in New York and Cori Bush in Missouri. Markey, who co-wrote the Green New Deal resolution with Ocasio-Cortez in 2019, has been in Congress for decades and is the Commonwealth\u2019s junior senator by a few months. Rep. Joe Kennedy III is giving up his House seat in a bid to replace Markey in the Senate. In Massachusetts, the Working Families Party says it plans to mobilize 16,000 members and call on its \u201cnational texting team\u201d to work the phones in support of Morse and Markey ahead of the September 1 primary. Working Families Party national director Maurice Mitchell said in an interview that Markey, unlike other liberal incumbents who have been defeated by the left, including former Reps. Joe Crowley in New York and Massachusetts\u2019 Mike Capuano, had distinguished himself \u2013 becoming a cause and not a target \u2013 because of his leadership on issues like the Green New Deal. \u201cA lot of members co-endorse pieces of legislation, but there\u2019s a difference between having your staff put your name next to other names and those who are actually organizing within their caucus, and also organizing on the front lines of the fight,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant distinction. (Markey\u2019s) been one of the better champions on that and a host of other progressive issues.\u201d Defending Markey\u2019s seat will be a formidable test for the progressives, who are working in 2020 to both grow their presence in Congress and consolidate the gains of two years ago. That the challenge, in this contest, comes from a Kennedy \u2013 in Massachusetts \u2013 further complicates the task, but offers the movement an opportunity to show its strength and potentially embolden other incumbent legislators to buck leadership and advocate more aggressively for left-wing priorities. \u201cThe message (to other liberal lawmakers) is that if you\u2019re a real partner and truly accountable and demonstrate that, not in a transactional way, but in a way where you really have skin in the game, then that partnership extends throughout the year and during election time,\u201d Mitchell said. The Morse race comes with a more familiar set of hurdles \u2013 the kind that progressives like Bowman and Mondaire Jones in New York, Bush, and Marie Newman in Illinois, have all cleared this primary season. Neal does not support \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d has been hesitant to back the Green New Deal and faced criticism for not aggressively seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns when Democrats took over the House majority and he was handed the Ways and Means Committee gavel. Morse, who is gay, launched his campaign last summer. This February, his brother Doug, who had struggled for years with heroin addiction, was found dead after a drug overdose. In an ad last month, Morse spoke about his brother and accused Neal, who has been in Congress since 1989, of \u201cusing his power and seniority to fight for the same drug companies that are fueling this crisis.\u201d (Neal\u2019s campaign disputed the charge and accused Morse of using his brother\u2019s death as a \u201cpolitical football.\u201d) Mitchell touted Morse\u2019s record during four terms as Holyoke\u2019s mayor, a position he was elected to at the age of 22 in 2011. \u201cHe has run and governed as a progressive in a very diverse community that has all different types of really deep challenges that any city, any diverse city in this particular moment, will have,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe is an up-and-coming progressive, openly gay elected official, who is, I think, based on his identity, very, very partial to people of marginal identities and making sure that people of marginal identities are in the center of the conversation.\u201d In a pair of statements, Morse and Markey thanked the Working Families Party for its support. \u201cAs someone who comes from a working family in a working class town, I am proud to be a Working Families Democrat,\u201d Morse said. Markey, who, like the Working Families Party, backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary, said, \u201cI\u2019m grateful they\u2019ve chosen to endorse me in this race. Throughout my career, I have worked to challenge the wealthy and powerful, from big oil to the NRA, and fight for the needs of working families.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday was photographed holding handwritten notes with Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 name at the top along with a set of talking points about her, fueling fresh speculation about the California Democrat\u2019s standing as a vice presidential running mate. The notes, which were photographed at a speech in Wilmington, Delaware, feature Harris\u2019 name followed by five talking points: \u201cDo not hold grudges,\u201d \u201cCampaigned with me & Jill,\u201d \u201cTalented,\u201d \u201cGreat help to campaign\u201d and \u201cGreat respect for her.\u201d The Biden campaign declined to comment to CNN on Tuesday night. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The prominence of Harris on Biden\u2019s notes follows a Politico story in which former Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, a member of Biden\u2019s team vetting potential vice presidential picks, is reported as being critical of her. His criticism stems from Harris\u2019 attack on the former vice president in a June 2019 Democratic primary debate. She criticized Biden for having touted his \u201ccivil\u201d working relationship with segregationist senators, and launched a scathing and personal attack on his opposition to federally mandated school desegregation busing. \u201cVice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you, when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,\u201d Harris had said on the debate stage. \u201cBut I also believe \u2013 and it\u2019s personal \u2013 it was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d \u201cIt was not only that \u2026 ,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.\u201d Her attack stunned Biden, who noted that she\u2019d had a good relationship with his son, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, before he\u2019d died. And it rocked the Democratic race, sending Harris into the primary\u2019s top tier of contenders and damaging Biden. Harris could not sustain that momentum, and she dropped out before the Iowa caucuses. But with Harris now widely seen as a top contender for the vice presidential nomination, one key question is whether the wounds from that attack have healed. View 2020 presidential election polling Dodd, according to Politico\u2019s account, reportedly told a longtime Biden supporter that when he asked Harris about that debate-stage attack, \u201cShe laughed and said, \u2018That\u2019s politics.\u2019 She had no remorse.\u201d Biden said after his speech in Wilmington on Tuesday that he will choose his vice presidential running mate next week. Asked by CNN whether he will meet in person with finalists for the role, Biden said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is kicking up its advertising investments in key battleground states, announcing a new $15 million ad buy in broadcast, radio and digital over the next week. The new ad campaign, which features three new TV spots, marks an escalation in the campaign\u2019s ad spending heading into the general election against President Donald Trump. By comparison, the Biden campaign\u2019s first major ad buy also totaled $15 million but was spread over a five-week period beginning in June. Television and digital commercials will continue to run in six states Trump won in 2016, including Pennsylvania and Arizona, and in expanded markets in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida. The campaign said that it is broadening its national buys to include sports and news channels, and it intends to run ads during the Major League Baseball opening games this week. The investment and the ads are part of the campaign\u2019s continued effort to draw a sharp contrast between Trump and Biden\u2019s style of leadership. \u201cThese new ads make the positive case for Joe Biden,\u201d TJ Ducklo, Biden campaign national press secretary, told CNN, \u201cand emphasize his trusted and tested experience during a crisis.\u201d The first ad, \u201cTruth\u201d uses Biden\u2019s own words speaking about the coronavirus pandemic and the type of leadership needed in this moment, trying to present a contrast with Trump without naming him by name. Biden encourages Americans to take preventive measures to help curb the spread of the virus, including wearing mask as the former vice president is seen doing several times in the ad. \u201cToday we\u2019re facing a serious threat. We have to meet it as one country. Numbers don\u2019t lie. Infection rates are now going up in more states than they are going down. We\u2019ve got to fight this together,\u201d Biden says in the ad. \u201cWear a mask. Keep your distance. Limit the size of crowds. It may be inconvenient. It may be uncomfortable. But it\u2019s the right thing to do as an American.\u201d He adds, \u201cWe need a president who will level with the American people, a president who will tell us the unvarnished truth, a president who will take responsibility instead of always blaming others. A president who will listen to the experts, follow the science, allow them to speak. A president who will lead and be an example for the nation. We have to do all we can to keep our fellow Americans safe and healthy.\u201d The second minute-long spot, \u201cTested,\u201d features a narrator arguing Biden\u2019s experience as vice president, including his work on the Recovery Act and the Ebola crisis, has prepared him for this moment. \u201cIn a crisis you\u2019re tested. As a nation, we\u2019ve been tested before and he has too,\u201d the narrator says, adding \u201cNow we\u2019re being tested again.\u201d The ad shows images of Trump, including his photo-op outside at St. John\u2019s church after peaceful protestors were forcefully cleared from the area as the narrator says, \u201cJoe Biden knows the answer is not ignoring the crisis, bailing out big corporations, and dividing a nation in pain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s working together to protect the workers who keep us strong, rebuild the middle class, pay people what they deserve and give every American the path to a good paying job, a quality education and affordable health care,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cThat\u2019s Joe Biden \u2013 tested and ready on day one.\u201d The campaign is also releasing a new Spanish language ad, called \u201cSo\u00f1ar es lograr,\u201d which will run in Arizona and Florida. Over the past month, the Biden campaign has run ads in the major television markets in key battleground states. The new ad buy will continue in those markets but it also includes expansions into Lansing, Michigan; Wilmington, North Carolina; Wausau and Madison, Wisconsin; and several new markets in Florida \u2013 Gainesville and Panama City as well as Mobile, Alabama, which borders Florida. Earlier this month, the Biden campaign launched a six figure ad buy focusing on the coronavirus pandemic in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and Texas \u2013 the first time the campaign put money into television in the Lone Star State.",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump\u2019s aides surveyed a virus-stricken political landscape earlier this summer, one area stuck out as a potential win: schools. Reopening them could allow parents to return to work, Trump\u2019s advisers reasoned. Without kids in classrooms, no other area of the economy could really bounce back. Anecdotally, many aides knew parents \u2013 and especially moms \u2013 who felt stretched by home-schooling and child care. And many believed a focus on kids and classrooms would play well with a group of Trump voters whose support was beginning to soften: White suburban women. Yet as Trump pushes to fully open schools in a matter of weeks, his efforts are being met by defiant districts, worried parents and teachers, and confusion about what exactly his administration is recommending schools do to keep students safe should they open their doors. Now, an effort that many inside the White House expected would prove widely popular has come to typify Trump\u2019s halting efforts to confront the pandemic. He has undercut his administration\u2019s public health experts in the name of returning the country to normal. Instead of providing clear instructions or mandates for how to combat the virus, Trump is issuing sweeping directives without saying how they should be achieved. And, through Trump\u2019s own making, the issue has become a political litmus test alongside mask-wearing and public gatherings. Additional guidance promised by the administration has been delayed. Internally, aides are scrambling to compile additional research to convince Americans that keeping kids at home poses more danger than sending them into classrooms after encountering unexpected resistance to their plans. This week, White House officials and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sparred over the rollout of additional guidance meant to encourage school reopenings, creating another point of friction in a relationship that has remained tense throughout the pandemic response. To some inside the White House, the urgency is months or weeks too late \u2013 coming well after administrators began determining plans for the fall and behind initiatives to open places viewed by some as less important drivers for the economy, such as gyms, restaurants and churches. \u201cWe should have started with schools,\u201d one senior administration official said this week. \u201cNothing can really reopen until the schools open.\u201d Trump ignores recent calamities in his push to open schools For much of the spring \u2013 as coronavirus raged the first time and Trump began insisting states reopen their churches, restaurants and shops \u2013 a small group of his advisers urged him to focus on reopening schools instead. But those arguments did not appear to register with the President. While he made a vocal push to reopen houses of worship and convened roundtables with restaurant owners and retailers, Trump did not turn his attention fully to schools until earlier this month. By then, another surge in cases (prompted, in part, by the early reopenings) was spreading across the country. And districts \u2013 using guidance from the federal government that Trump later deemed overly burdensome \u2013 had already begun making decisions about their plans for the fall. At the start of July, White House aides presented the school reopening push to Trump as a move likely to play well with working families \u2013 including the suburban moms Trump will need on his side to win a second term \u2013 and as a necessity for the country\u2019s economic recovery to continue. A report drafted by Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and circulated among West Wing aides this month suggested students could suffer dire future consequences \u2013 including reduced earning potential and stalled career growth \u2013 if schools remain closed. The report also suggested that women, as primary caregivers, would suffer if students don\u2019t return to in-person learning. Trump\u2019s visions for fully reopened schools have been threatened this week by a series of school closure announcements \u2013 including in the nation\u2019s largest urban school districts \u2013 and polls showing concerns about in-person learning ran far deeper than previously known. Some aides said they were surprised by the backlash against opening schools because they believed the issue would be popular among a large set of the population. Instead, an Axios-Ipsos poll this week showed seven in 10 parents viewed it as risky for schools to reopen in the fall \u2013 including 53% of Republicans. Still, the White House has remained adamant \u2013 and largely inflexible in the types of reopening they view as acceptable. \u201cWhen (Trump) says open, he means open in full, kids being able to attend each and every day at their school,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at the press briefing on Thursday. \u201cThe science should not stand in the way of this.\u201d She said the \u201cscience is on our side\u201d with regard to bringing back students \u2013 a claim experts, teachers and parents have fiercely debated in recent weeks amid sparse data on the subject. Trump himself has been among the loudest critics of the guidelines put forth by the CDC, which were released on June 30. Just days after CDC Director Robert Redfield announced the guidance \u2013 which calls for potentially challenging and expensive changes like spacing out desks, staggering drop-off times and installing physical barriers in close quarters \u2013 his team was planning for additional documents that they said would help address any confusion about what schools were being asked to do. The development of those supplemental guidelines \u2013 expected to be roughly five pages long \u2013 hit snags internally, people familiar with the matter said, and the CDC delayed the release of them late Thursday evening after previously touting a release sometime this week. \u201cThey\u2019re not ready to come out this week,\u201d a CDC spokesman told CNN on Thursday evening, adding there wasn\u2019t a \u201cclear picture at this point\u201d on when the agency might release the documents. Redfield recently briefed members of the White House coronavirus task force on the supplemental guidance, a person familiar with the conversion said, but the guidelines were not ready for wide distribution to the task force for a language review in time to meet the CDC\u2019s self-imposed deadline. Florida schools say they are ready but many parents and teachers are not Despite the White House\u2019s push to get students back in classrooms, some of the nation\u2019s largest school districts have already announced plans to keep kids learning at home in the fall. Los Angeles Unified School District and San Diego Unified School District, California\u2019s two largest districts, both announced on Monday there would be no in-person learning at the start of the school year. San Francisco, too, announced this week that all learning in the fall will be remote. And New York City schools have said they won\u2019t reopen fully in September. In Atlanta, schools will conduct classes virtually for the first nine weeks. In Houston, classes will be virtual for the first six weeks. And in major districts across the country, local officials are considering models that blend in-person and online learning \u2013 an option that Trump administration officials still oppose. Trump\u2019s team has argued, in addition to what they describe as the benefits for students, that school reopenings are necessary for the economic recovery to continue because working parents can\u2019t return to the office if their children are not returning to the classroom. Although the President repeatedly threatened to slash funding for schools that refuse his orders \u2013 something he has no authority to do \u2013 White House officials are working now on a plan to create financial incentives instead for districts that open. Officials hope to include supplemental funding for schools in the next stimulus package and stipulate that schools can\u2019t access the new money unless they take steps to reopen. The CDC is working with the White House budget office on incentivizing schools within the framework of reopening guidelines, an aide said, but it remains unclear whether congressional Democrats would get on board with a plan that could put closed schools at a disadvantage. White House aides are also looking at whether they can redirect money included in the previous stimulus bill toward things necessary for school reopenings, such as PPE and sanitizing for districts. Trump pitches White suburban voters in blatantly political White House event Trump\u2019s political advisers believe the push to reopen schools will prove popular among suburban woman, a group he is struggling with amid the pandemic and his unpopular views on race. His campaign has sought to contrast his push with rival Joe Biden, who has been more cautious in how schools should reopen. A senior White House official called the school push the \u201cobvious play,\u201d beyond whatever politically advantageous groups might benefit. Aides have sought to downplay polling that shows the majority of parents have concerns about sending their children back into classrooms with the virus still raging \u2013 with one comparing that level of concern to the worries parents tell pollsters they have about gun violence in schools, before sending their kids to class anyway. Yet the White House is still seeking to bolster its case. Amid criticism of the CDC guidelines as too light in science, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx has led a separate effort to put out more data backing up the drive to get students back to school, people familiar with the effort said. Individual administration officials have argued at various points that there are academic, mental health and child safety considerations behind the argument for schools to reopen, but Birx and other White House officials have been working to collect those in one place to present to the public, the people familiar said. Trump, meanwhile, has claimed in public that politics have tainted the school reopening debate. \u201cWe have to open the schools. We have to get them open.  And I think there\u2019s a lot of politics going along,\u201d he said at an event this week. \u201cI think they think they\u2019ll do better if they can keep the schools closed in the election. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to help them, frankly, but I think they feel that by keeping schools closed, that\u2019s a bad thing for the country and, therefore, that\u2019s a good thing for them.\u201d Some White House aides have downplayed announcements in individual districts that schools would remain shuttered, arguing they were never going to win the debate in Democratic strongholds. And top administration officials, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, have spent the past week arguing that the benefits of in-person learning should outweigh the risks at schools across the country, regardless of a specific district\u2019s coronavirus infection rate. But pressed on specifics on how schools can accomplish reopening safely, DeVos has stumbled. \u201cKids need to be back in school, and school leaders across the country need to be making plans to do just that,\u201d DeVos said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d making clear that more specific \u2013 and politically precarious \u2013 decisions would be left to state and local officials. \u201cThere is going to be the exception to the rule. But the rule should be that kids go back to school this fall. And where there are little flare-ups or hotspots, that can be dealt with on a school-by-school or a case-by-case basis.\u201d DeVos, a billionaire who was a top donor to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, has long been a lightning-rod figure in the Trump administration, reviled by progressives who have accused her of trying to privatize education and a heroine of school voucher proponents, because of her many years bankrolling school choice efforts that opponents say would draw money away from public education. While supportive of those efforts, Trump has also privately questioned DeVos\u2019 ability to relay his message, believing she isn\u2019t strong in interviews. Still, the White House has relied on her over the past week to transmit the reopening message even as she remained largely absent during the earlier phases of the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. If this year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no way to predict what will happen between today and November 3, now less than four months away. But we can and should do everything we can to take the pulse of the nation. We went to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\u2019s director of Polling and Election Analytics, who runs CNN\u2019s decision desk on Election Night and knows as much or more about how to actually read polls than anyone else. Her tips on what to look for when you read a poll are worth reading (and bookmarking). Our email conversation is below. What Matters: Polling consistently shows Joe Biden with a clear lead over Donald Trump. Is there any precedent for a presidential candidate coming back from that kind of deficit four months from Election Day? JA: It is a strikingly large deficit this close to the election, but as close as we are to the election, there is still a lot of time for opinions to shift, and if 2020 has proven anything it\u2019s that the news can give you whiplash at just about any moment. And large shifts in the presidential horse race can happen late in the game if the news is big enough. In 2008, for example, CNN polling found a near neck-and-neck race for much of the year, until the financial crisis really hit in mid-September. Just after Labor Day and the Republican convention, the race stood at 48% for Barack Obama to 48% for John McCain among registered voters. After the stock market crash, Obama quickly gained a double-digit advantage over McCain among that same group, maxing out in CNN\u2019s polling at a 14-point Obama lead in an October 3 through 5 poll. That poll came less than a month after the tied result. There wasn\u2019t a single reputable national poll which found Obama behind McCain for the remainder of the campaign. Beyond the ability of news to change voters\u2019 perspectives, it is important to remember that much of the polling which shows Trump lagging so far behind Biden is national polling, while US presidential elections are decided state-by-state via the electoral college. Running up the score in population centers like California and New York wouldn\u2019t do Biden much good in his bid to take the White House. Recent polling in critical battlegrounds seems to confirm what the national polling is showing at the moment, however, with Biden holding edges in several of the states he must win in order to gain an electoral college advantage and competitive in states where the President won handily last time around. That all suggests that Biden\u2019s current edge is a meaningful one. But polling in some of those same states just a few months ago found much tighter contests, so again, there is room for things to change. Visit CNN\u2019s 2020 presidential polling center It is also worth noting that at this point in the race, pollsters are largely measuring the opinions of registered voters. Typically, looking only at those who are likely to vote rather than the full pool of registered voters yields results which are slightly more favorable to the Republicans. Polling in 2018 found a different pattern, though, and it\u2019s possible that 2020 would continue that shift. At this point in time, it is really too early to say with any certainty who is a likely voter and who is not. That\u2019s true in a normal year, but in the midst of a pandemic, many Americans don\u2019t even know yet how elections will be administered where they live, let alone whether they are comfortable participating in them. What Matters: How is coronavirus, which has touched every part of American life, affecting voters? JA: For one thing, it\u2019s changing the way Americans vote and the way that election results are reported. Recent primary elections in New York, New Jersey, Kentucky and elsewhere have featured a sharply increased share of the public choosing to vote by mail rather than in-person at a polling place. Given the complexities of counting and verifying by-mail votes, election officials are taking longer periods of time to release results from those elections. What we normally think of as Election Day might stretch out in to Election Week or Election Month if similar changes in how people cast votes happen in November. I think the impact it could have on who they choose to vote for is still unknown depending on what happens with the outbreak between now and November, though our colleague Harry Enten has some theories. What Matters: One theme a lot of people took out of the 2016 election was that Trump won because he consolidated the support of White, working-class voters. That helped him win the Rust Belt and the White House. Has that group, broadly speaking, stayed with him? JA: White voters without college degrees remain one of the groups most apt to back Trump in most polling. There are several question marks around this group, however. The first is whether Trump can maintain his support among White women who do not have college degrees. The President\u2019s ratings among women generally are abysmal, and if that carries over to White women without degrees, it could be enough to sink the President in some places. The second is how large a share of the electorate they will be in critical states this fall. States across the Sun Belt which previously were reliably Republican are seeing their share of White voters without college degrees decline, a shift which may make some of those states more competitive. In the Rust Belt, Whites without college degrees generally remain a large share of the voter base, so can have more of an impact on the outcome of elections there. What Matters: I\u2019m always very focused on the horse race numbers in polling, but I\u2019ve heard you say that\u2019s not the best way to think about polls. What broad themes should people be pulling out of recent polls? JA: The horse race isn\u2019t the worst thing one could look at in a poll, so if you\u2019re going to pay attention to it, do yourself a favor and look for a few things beyond the margin between the two candidates: Does the leading candidate have majority support? If neither candidate is over 50%, that suggests their support is a little softer than it may need to be to win. How many voters are undecided? It could be a sign of a volatile electorate (and I think was underplayed in 2016) but it can also vary based on methods (many online polls have higher undecided shares than phone polls). What\u2019s the general trend for an individual candidate\u2019s support across quality polls? One notable thing in recent polling has been how consistent support for the two candidates has been. Across the nine national phone polls which meet CNN standards that have been released since June 1, seven pegged his support between 41% and 44%, Biden\u2019s support has a slightly wider range, but generally hovers between 50% and 55% in those same polls, with two placing his support at 49%. Looking outside the horserace. Watch to see which of the most pressing issues facing the country right now hold on as meaningful for voters this fall, whether Trump\u2019s approval rating for handling the economy remains in positive territory, and whether any of the attacks on Biden dent his strong ratings for leadership. On the issues that matter most to voters, notably, CNN\u2019s June survey found two-thirds of Americans considered racism in our society a big problem. That was up sharply compared with the 2016 presidential election cycle, while 42% of registered voters called race relations extremely important to their vote for president, the highest number for any of the four issues tested in the poll and also well ahead of the share who said the same in the previous presidential cycle. Coronavirus rated below race relations (31% called that extremely important). What Matters: I don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about Trump. Is there a universe of undecided people who will decide the election? JA: Not very many. And the downside for Trump is that as an incumbent, views on him are likely to matter far more than views on Biden. One of the most fascinating things about the 2016 exit poll results was that voters who view both Trump and Hillary Clinton unfavorably broke heavily toward Trump, and there were even a decently sized set of voters who felt Trump was not qualified to be president, but still voted for him. As a sitting President, it\u2019s unlikely that Trump would get the benefit of the doubt from those voters again has he not convinced them he deserves to remain in office. What Matters: My former colleague Amy Walter has said pollsters should not only ask who voters support, but also if they\u2019re enthusiastically voting against someone (Trump). What\u2019s your thought on that? JA: The last CNN poll conducted by SSRS included a very similar question. Biden supporters were asked whether their preference was more a vote for Biden or against Trump, and Trump supporters were asked the same about their support. Among Biden\u2019s backers, 60% said their vote was against Trump, while among Trump supporters, 70% said their backing was to vote for the president. Looking at Biden supporters by their enthusiasm to vote, those who are most fired up about going to the polls in November are a bit less likely to say that their vote is in opposition to the President (56%) than are those who say they are somewhat enthusiastic about voting or less (69%). Whether that anti-Trump sentiment is enough of a motivator for that group to show up at the polls (or mail in their ballots) will be a key question to watch through the fall. What Matters: I\u2019m asking for a wild guess here, but what are the odds we know the identity of the next President on Election Night? JA: Oh to know the answer to that question! At this point, it seems unlikely that we\u2019ll know the outcome on Election Night itself. While a number of key battlegrounds are used to processing a lot of absentee or early votes (Florida and Arizona most notably, where majorities typically vote absentee or early), several other critical states for the electoral college count are relatively new to the absentee ballot process. In Pennsylvania, for example, just 8% of voters cast ballots absentee or early in 2016, in New Hampshire, it was 10%, in Virginia, 13%, and in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, it was around a quarter of voters \u2013 which suggests their counts could be slower than usual if those numbers spike dramatically. One growing trend in recent elections is that vote preferences among those who vote in-person are often different from those who vote absentee or early, and the politicization of behavior in the coronavirus era seems as if it could exacerbate those differences, making it difficult to project races until there is a solid number of reports from both groups of voters.",

            "article_content": "A group of anti-Trump Republicans is spending $2 million on new TV and digital ads supporting former Vice President Joe Biden in two states President Donald Trump won in 2016 \u2013 the latest in a blitz of ad buys in red states from both sides of the presidential race. Republican Voters Against Trump, which launched last month and announced a $10 million ad campaign, told CNN it is allocating a fifth of that budget to ads that target Republican or Republican-leaning voters in both Arizona and North Carolina. Both states have voted for the GOP presidential nominee all but once in every election since 1980, but recent polling shows Biden leading Trump in Arizona and with a smaller lead over Trump (but within the margin of error) in North Carolina. The two states also have competitive Senate races with Republican incumbents. The new ads are aimed specifically at disaffected Republicans. They feature a series of stark, spare testimonials from longtime GOP voters and former elected officials explaining why they do not or can no longer support the President. A longtime voter in North Carolina in one ad says that he wishes he could put a sign in his yard to tell people to \u201cvote against Trump.\u201d The new ad purchases reflect how the 2020 political landscape has shifted in ways that have narrowed Trump\u2019s path to a second term. While both parties expected to battle over the three crucial blue states that flipped to the GOP in 2016 \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 Trump is having to play defense in states that are crucial to his reelection, including Arizona and North Carolina. In June alone, the Trump campaign spent more than $14 million in seven states Trump won in 2016. According to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG, in June the President\u2019s campaign doubled what it had already spent this year on TV and digital ads in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. It has also increased spending in three more Trump states: Iowa, Ohio and Texas. The Trump campaign declined to comment for this story. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent nearly $4 million on ads across those same seven states Trump won in 2016 \u2013 including more than $2 million in Florida and $500,000 each in Arizona, Texas and North Carolina since the beginning of June. According to a Biden campaign memo obtained by CNN, some of those ads are aimed at potential red-state voters, and airing during NASCAR races or on Fox News during the daytime. The memo also claims to plan on targeting white working-class voters in Florida\u2019s Panhandle region, a staunchly Republican part of the state. Outside groups opposed to Trump seemed to have smelled blood in the water in these states, too. \u201cWinning in traditionally GOP states like North Carolina and Arizona requires winning over voters who might not align with the Democrats politically, so RVAT is employing fellow conservatives who aren\u2019t used to voting for Democrats to help convince their peers to make the switch to Biden this November,\u201d said Sarah Longwell, a longtime conservative and Republican consultant who is the executive director of Defending Democracy Together, a conservative anti-Trump nonprofit that sponsors the Republican Voters Against Trump project. Other anti-Trump groups are doing likewise. The Democrat-aligned super PAC Priorities USA has spent hundreds of thousands more on advertising in June in Arizona and Florida. And the Lincoln Project (another group of Republicans disaffected with Trump) has also dropped five- and six-figure buys in some of these states in the same period. On top of that, the Trump campaign has reserved $69 million in television ads beginning in September through Election Day in Arizona, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That\u2019s as clear a signal as possible that the Republican president\u2019s team expects to need to boost its position in states that should normally be given. \u201cBiden picks off any one of them and it\u2019s over,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist. \u201cBarring a big surprise.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The episode repeated itself like clockwork during the Democratic primary: Bernie Sanders\u2019 staff, and sometimes the candidate himself, would telegraph \u2013 often in the lead-up to a debate night \u2013 a hot new round of attacks on former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, just as surely, Sanders would pull up short. \u201cJoe is a friend of mine,\u201d he would offer as a caveat, \u201cand a decent guy,\u201d before going on to lament Biden\u2019s voting record or prospects in the general election. Nearly two months after the primary effectively ended, Biden\u2019s campaign and Sanders\u2019 senior leadership have successfully crafted a ceasefire in the ideological warfare that has dominated the Democratic Party, and its emboldened left wing, for the past five years. Deep and abiding divisions on major issues make the peace a tenuous one, but the personal bond between Sanders and Biden, set against the party\u2019s evolving power dynamics and a country veering from crisis to crisis under President Donald Trump, has set the stage for Democrats to enter the general election this fall with a unity of purpose they lacked in 2016. View 2020 presidential election polling The d\u00e9tente is being quietly shepherded by Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir and top Biden aides Anita Dunn and Ron Klain. Shakir and Dunn, who ruffled Bernieworld when she compared Sanders\u2019 performance to that of a \u201cprotester\u201d after his and Biden\u2019s final debate, speak regularly. And in an interview last week, Shakir praised her for setting a \u201ctone and tenor\u201d in private conversations that encouraged the relationship. \u201cThey\u2019re operating with the best of intent. Now that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to get all the outcomes that you want,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cObviously we have to see where the outputs are in terms of these task forces (created by the campaigns), but we\u2019re operating with full reality, understanding that we\u2019re not going to get everything we want.\u201d In May, the campaigns announced the creation of six policy-focused \u201cunity\u201d task forces and charged them with hashing out recommendations for Biden and the party to consider and potentially add to the platform. The meetings began this month, remotely via tools like Zoom, and the groups are expected to present their work to Biden by the end of June, Shakir said. Participants have been mostly tight-lipped about the details of the conversations, but Varshini Prakash, the executive director of the Sunrise Movement and member of the climate task force co-chaired by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tweeted out a video last week describing herself as \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d after two meetings. \u201cI\u2019ve also seen the Biden folks bringing a lot,\u201d Prakash said, after praising Ocasio-Cortez and environmental justice activist Catherine Flowers. \u201cRep. (Donald) McEachin from Virginia has been bringing a ton of ideas for how to do bottom-up policy making where we listen first and craft policy out of what communities need. (Former EPA administrator) Gina McCarthy has been stressing the importance of timelines and urgency \u2013 that the benefits of this transition need to get to people today and by tomorrow, not by 2050. So, it\u2019s been encouraging.\u201d That progressive leaders, some more accustomed to occupying lawmakers\u2019 offices than sitting across from them at a virtual conference table, have chosen private negotiations over public spats is both a marker of the movement\u2019s success and a testament to Biden\u2019s unique political talent. In photos: Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders A number of Sanders aides were quick to note, as they have in the past, that Biden was one of the few Democratic establishment figures to connect with Sanders back when the democratic socialist from Vermont was still perceived as a Capitol Hill curiosity, an eccentric on the margins of the mainstream. \u201cVery few people in the Senate went out of their way to say, \u2018Hey Bernie, how you doing?\u2019 I\u2019m not saying they went out for beers every Friday, but Biden made an effort to build a relationship of Bernie, to reach out to him, that made an impact on Bernie,\u201d said Sanders campaign pollster Ben Tulchin. Tulchin described himself as a \u201cleading advocate\u201d during the primary for Sanders to more aggressively \u201cmake the contrast\u201d with Biden on the trail and in debates. \u201cBernie consistently was reluctant to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn part because he had a rapport with Biden. He would do it, but he never liked doing it. He didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Another former aide to Sanders, who worked closely with him on both campaigns, remembered that the relationship extended beyond the Senate, where they only briefly overlapped, through Biden\u2019s years in the White House. That included conversations during the 2016 primary, when the two would occasionally talk on the phone at a time when most establishment figures were steering clear. But other Sanders allies believe the stories of the pair\u2019s personal affinity are either overblown or overestimated in the current context. What\u2019s changed, they argue, is simple: Sanders has a robust political base and his signature policies, like \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d are popular. \u201cI think a lot of people might turn to talking about who these two people are, what kind of relationship they have, all that kind of stuff. I think none of that matters,\u201d said Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cThat\u2019s all sort of nuance, sure, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. The significant difference here is that Bernie Sanders has way more power in 2020 than he had in 2016.\u201d Going back to 2015, during Sanders\u2019 first presidential bid, his top advisers saw in Biden a potential competitor \u2013 had he decided to run \u2013 whose \u201cstrong connection with working-class voters,\u201d as 2016 campaign manager and former senior adviser Jeff Weaver wrote in his 2018 book, \u201ccould have created competition for rank-and-file labor votes.\u201d Biden\u2019s opting to stay out of the race wasn\u2019t a surprise, Weaver wrote, as he recalled watching the vice president make that decision official in a Rose Garden speech, President Barack Obama at his side, in October 2015. Listening to Biden\u2019s remarks during lunch at a Washington bar that day with Tad Devine, a top consultant to Sanders in 2016, Weaver was struck by Biden\u2019s messaging. \u201cHe decried income inequality, called for free college tuition, criticized the political establishment, and on and on,\u201d Weaver wrote. \u201cTad looked at me and said, \u2018Holy sh*t! That\u2019s our message. That\u2019s what we\u2019re running on.\u2019 Indeed it was.\u201d Nearly five years later, after Sanders came up short a second time, Weaver and other former aides announced in April the formation of a new super PAC dedicated to growing support for Biden with Sanders\u2019 diverse young base of progressive voters. \u201cIn 2016, I think those of us who thought Trump could win still thought that he would lose. That obviously turned out not to be the case,\u201d Weaver told CNN on Friday, adding he expected the 2020 race would, similarly, be decided on the margins. He also offered an assessment shared across much of Bernieworld: that Biden was more malleable, on policy particulars, than many on the left appreciated. Weaver\u2019s successor as campaign manager, Shakir, argued the same \u2013 that Biden, hardly an ideologue, had room to maneuver as he worked to grow his coalition. \u201cBiden, in the manner in which he campaigned and who he is, has left a lot of room for policy development. He did not campaign on a robust policy platform,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how he won.\u201d Before Weaver left the Sanders campaign to launch his new group, he and Shakir were dispatched by Sanders \u2013 who was still in the race \u2013 as emissaries to the Biden camp. \u201cWhen Bernie was talking about suspending the campaign, he hadn\u2019t made his decision, he asked me and Jeff at the time to go and start conversations with Biden\u2019s crew to figure out how much progress we could make,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cAnd I said (to Sanders), \u2018OK, what are your chief objectives here?\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s very simple, We need progressive policies and progressive personnel adopted by Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d The conversations that followed ultimately yielded the task forces and the kind of working relationship that Sanders and Clinton, despite some successful efforts to find compromise positions on issues like higher education, never achieved. \u201cThis is all set against 2016, where I think that Hillary\u2019s campaign was not interested in Bernie\u2019s input and had a chip on its shoulder,\u201d a top Sanders aide said. \u201cIn this case, that\u2019s never been the attitude at any point or juncture.\u201d A former Clinton aide from 2016 conceded that Biden has been more successful in bringing along Sanders and his allies, pointing to the public rollout of the working groups, but said there had been \u201cgenuine efforts\u201d on Clinton\u2019s behalf \u201cto do everything in our power to squash the dynamic that had grown during the primary.\u201d \u201cThe Biden people went about it in a really smart way. But we tried to do that stuff in 2016 and their total resistance to playing ball just bred more and more resentment from both sides,\u201d the former Clinton aide said. \u201cAnd at a certain point, the feeling (among some in the Clinton campaign) was, \u2018You don\u2019t get to set all the terms. The people voted for her agenda and not your agenda.\u2019\u201d In a statement, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates touted the former rivals\u2019 relationship and praised Sanders and his campaign for their work. \u201cJoe Biden and Bernie Sanders are friends and share a steadfast belief that we need a government that will deliver for working families,\u201d Bates said. \u201cSen. Sanders and his team have been extraordinary partners in offering advice and support on the biggest challenges of our day, such as overcoming climate change and rebuilding the American middle class \u2013 especially after the COVID-19 outbreak.\u201d Sanders aides and allies are reluctant, still, to concede any role in Clinton\u2019s defeat. But in interviews for this story, they almost unanimously cited, in a list alongside the candidates\u2019 personal ties and the coronavirus crisis, \u201cthe lessons of 2016\u201d \u2013 as Tulchin put it \u2013 as a key factor in the shaping relations this time around. The fruits of the task forces, and whether Biden and his team decide to embrace them, will also go a long in way in setting an expiration date on this era of good feelings. Sanders and his inner circle are clearly committed to seeing it out, at least through the election. But the activist leaders now at the table with Biden\u2019s campaign have more complicated questions to answer \u2013 their efforts potentially coming at the cost of credibility within their movements. Nelson, the union leader, is a co-chair of the economic task force, said her decision to take part was simple: Sanders asked and \u201cyou never say no to being at the table.\u201d \u201cLook at the people who have been appointed to these committees,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you see is the bringing together of the most diverse group of Democrats that you\u2019ve seen in any other space. And that is Bernie\u2019s coalition. He talked about building a new Democratic coalition and I think the task forces, whether you look at Bernie or Biden appointees, reflect that.\u201d Karthik Ganapathy, a progressive strategist and Sanders aide in 2016, credited the Biden campaign for having the humility to openly engage and try to win over a bloc of voters \u2013 young progressives \u2013 that they struggled with during the primary. Still, he warned, there are murky waters up ahead. \u201cAre (Biden\u2019s team) going to bring on key progressive staff? Are they going to make key commitments to the Sunrise Movement and to AOC and other folks on that task force?\u201d Ganapathy said. \u201cThose decisions will show me if they\u2019re seriously interested in building an on-ramp for Bernie folks to get on the train.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Top Republicans had been working closely with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and other state Democratic officials as recently as Friday to plan the upcoming GOP national convention amid the coronavirus pandemic. Then President Donald Trump threatened to pull the convention from Charlotte. Trump\u2019s tweet not only came as a surprise to Republican officials on Monday, but it also was completely at odds with the position that top convention officials expressed during the Friday meeting, CNN has learned. View 2020 presidential election polling Marcia Kelly, the president and CEO of the convention, spoke with Cooper and the state\u2019s secretary of health and human services, Dr. Mandy Cohen, in a telephone meeting Friday. A person familiar with the call said that Kelly outlined a range of options for the Republican convention in August \u2013 \u201cfrom a full in-person convention to a virtual or online convention.\u201d Kelly, who was selected by Trump for the position, did not mention a timeline for a decision to be made about the convention, the person familiar with the call said, who described the conversation as cordial and productive. All major organizations, from the Charlotte Hornets to the Carolina Panthers to NASCAR, have been asked to submit plans to the state for holding their large-scale events. The Republican convention has not yet submitted its own plan for how the gathering, set for August 24-27, would be held safely. Cohen sent a letter to Kelly on Monday, reiterating that Republican convention planners need to outline a plan for different levels of the pandemic and how it would impact the event into the convention planning. \u201cA written plan provides a necessary and valuable starting point to planning discussions with our public health teams at the county and state levels,\u201d Cohen wrote. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also spoke with Cooper last week, a person familiar with the call said, and a range of options about the convention was discussed. Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, did not demand an urgent decision be made about the convention, the source said. A source familiar with the conversation between Meadows and Cooper said that the White House chief of staff asked the governor to give them a firmer idea of how he envisioned the convention by the first or second week of June. The Republican National Committee said in a statement on Monday that it supported the President\u2019s demand for the governor to provide assurances that \u201ca full in-person convention\u201d could be held \u2013 even as convention officials have said Trump\u2019s threat during a series of tweets on Memorial Day caught them off guard. A spokeswoman for the convention told CNN that Kelly had not said Republicans would hold a virtual or online convention. \u201cWe\u2019re planning for an in-person convention just as we have been all along,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The coronavirus has upended American life, including the ongoing presidential election, which has been devoid of in-person events since early March. Both Democrats and Republicans have grappled with how to hold a traditional nominating convention during a pandemic, especially given the virus is transmitted by close human-to-human contact. The two parties, as evidenced by Trump\u2019s recent tweets, are handling the issue differently, however. Democrats moved their planned event in Milwaukee from July to August and are moving ahead cautiously with planning, openly acknowledging that this year\u2019s event may need to be virtual. Republicans, by comparison, have plowed full speed ahead with plan for an in-person event. \u201cI love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets on Monday. \u201cUnfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena.\u201d He added: \u201cThey must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site.\u201d Cooper told reporters Tuesday that he was not surprised by Trump\u2019s unexpected tweets \u2013 \u201cI am not surprised by anything that I see on Twitter,\u201d he said \u2013 but added that he and his health officials are still waiting for health plans from Republican officials. \u201cIt is OK for political conventions to be political but pandemic response cannot be,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAlready we have been in talks with the RNC about the kind of convention that they would need to run and the kind of options that we need on the table. \u2026 We want to see from the RNC what their plans are, and we have asked them to submit those plans to our public health officials.\u201d The governor said his discussions with Republican planners have been similar to those he has had with top sports teams. \u201cEverybody knows we have to take some steps to make sure that people are protected because this virus is still going to be with us in August and we are going to have to take steps to protect people,\u201d Cooper added. To some top Republicans, Trump\u2019s decision to publicly call out Cooper was a strategic attempt to make the Democratic governor \u2013 who is up for reelection in 2020 \u2013 the scapegoat for any changes that need to be made to the convention. Trump was attempting to force Cooper \u201cto be the bad guy,\u201d a Republican operative familiar with the convention process told CNN. Another source familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking told CNN that the President\u2019s goal with his tweet was to try to force Cooper to define what the rules of the road will be for the convention and underscored that Trump does not want to pull out of North Carolina. Trump on Tuesday said that Cooper has about \u201d a week\u201d to decide whether convention could take place in Charlotte. \u201cNow if he can\u2019t do it, if he feels that he\u2019s not going to do it \u2013 all he has to do is tell us and then we\u2019ll have to pick another location,\u201d the President said. He also insisted that \u201cthousands of people\u201d should be able to get into the arena. \u201cBut he\u2019s got to say that when thousands of people come to the arena that they\u2019ll be able to get in \u2026 we\u2019ll spend millions and millions of dollars on this magnificent design but in the end they have to be able to get in.\u201d The uncertainty around the North Carolina convention has led other states to attempt to woo Trump and the Republican committee away from North Carolina. \u201cWith world-class facilities, restaurants, hotels, and workforce, Georgia would be honored to safely host the Republican National Convention,\u201d Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cWe hope you will consider the Peach State, @realdonaldtrump!\u201d Republican officials from Texas and Florida also made public offers to Trump, hoping he will grow fed up with North Carolina and consider the two Republican-controlled states. During a press conference on Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state would \u201clove to have the RNC\u201d and would be open to hosting the DNC as well. \u201cThe door is open. We want to have the conversation whether it\u2019s RNC or DNC because I think it would be good for the people of Florida,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cFlorida wants to work with you if you\u2019re a business, if you\u2019re a sports team, if you want to have some of these events, we want to work with you to get to yes.\u201d Cooper did not say on Tuesday whether he is worried about the convention leaving Charlotte. \u201cI supported having the convention in North Carolina, but we have to put the health and safety of North Carolinians as the guiding star in this process,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe hope to continue the discussions\u201d with the RNC.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is adopting some of his former Democratic presidential primary rivals\u2019 best-known tactics as he seeks to bridge the party\u2019s gaps headed into his general election match-up against President Donald Trump. He consulted with Pete Buttigieg as his campaign turned the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor\u2019s \u201cRules of the Road\u201d \u2013 a set of values for his campaign and its supporters \u2013 into Biden\u2019s own new \u201cCampaign Code.\u201d Last week he dialed supporters with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for whom the tactic \u2013 and the videos it helped produce on social media \u2013 was a keystone as she shunned traditional high-dollar fundraisers. And he and Buttigieg hosted a virtual \u201cgrassroots\u201d fundraiser, a small-dollar event modeled after the events Buttigieg often held, on Friday. The efforts offer Biden a chance to tap into the popularity and excitement surrounding his former rivals. Part of the aim, a Biden adviser said, is to appeal to the cultural components of past campaigns that are important to those supporters while also maintaining an authentic feeling for Biden and his campaign. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race It all comes as Biden\u2019s campaign morphs from a largely offline primary effort, where support from older voters, especially African Americans, catapulted him to the Democratic nomination, into one that is attempting to unite the party and gear up for what the coronavirus pandemic could force to be a general election battle that\u2019s fought over the internet and airwaves. \u201cOur campaign continues to grow stronger because we are adopting some of the smartest, most effective tactics used during the primary, and we\u2019re grateful to our friends on other campaigns who have helped us do that,\u201d said TJ Ducklo, national press secretary for the Biden campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s because of this kind of cooperation and unity that we will beat Donald Trump this November.\u201d Joe Biden's running mate list is shorter than you might think -- for now, at least The calls with Warren and the code borrowed from Buttigieg both align with the image of Biden that his campaign has sought to portray: an empathetic figure who is motivated by the personal connections he makes and stories he hears on the campaign trail. \u201cThese tactics work because they\u2019re authentic to Joe Biden,\u201d said Lis Smith, the Buttigieg strategist who said she and other former staffers have been in contact with Biden\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come across as pandering. He\u2019s doing it in a way that is authentic to him and that is authentic to his campaign, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so powerful,\u201d she said. Adopting some of his former rivals\u2019 tactics is part of Biden\u2019s broader effort to bring Democrats together after a bruising primary campaign. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his strongest rival in the party\u2019s primary, have assembled a series of working groups on policy issues. Biden\u2019s team has been deliberate in welcoming supporters of past opponents. This includes helping produce graphics for members of Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cTeam Pete\u201d and Kamala Harris\u2019 \u201cKHive\u201d now on board with the former vice president\u2019s campaign \u2013 a move that allows those people to maintain their identities as supporters of Biden\u2019s former rivals while lining up behind the party\u2019s choice to take on Trump. As a gesture of thanks to Buttigieg\u2019s supporters on Super Tuesday, the Biden campaign\u2019s press shop learned a dance to the song \u201cHigh Hopes\u201d by Panic! at the Disco, which had become a light-hearted joke among Buttigieg\u2019s followers. And Biden himself sought to extend olive branches to Sanders\u2019 supporters as the primary wound down, frequently praising the Vermont senator and courting his supporters in speeches. Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cRules of the Road\u201d were the first prominent example of Biden \u2013 who has had to grow his staff for the general election while at home in Delaware, with aides working from their homes, as well \u2013 adopting a former rival\u2019s tactics. Biden and Buttigieg have spoken several times in recent months, and Biden\u2019s campaign asked for Buttigieg\u2019s feedback and sign-off before making public its \u201cCampaign Code.\u201d \u201cIt was really smart to have Pete that involved in this process, because it signals to Pete\u2019s supporters that the Biden campaign wasn\u2019t just paying Pete\u2019s campaign and Pete\u2019s supporters lip service,\u201d Smith said. This week Buttigieg emailed his campaign\u2019s list to invite them to his first grassroots fundraiser with Biden. It\u2019s the sort of event that could bring new online donors into Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 and allow the campaign to hit those donors again and again for contributions. \u201cGrassroots fundraisers are really important to me. They are based on the idea that the experience of a political fundraiser, often regarded as high-dollar closed-door events in the past, should be equally available to folks chipping in $5, $25 at a time,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s embrace of his rival\u2019s campaigns extends to policy and staffing as well. Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, who took over leading the team in March, initially ran former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s presidential bid. And several other O\u2019Rourke staffers now fill prominent roles in Biden\u2019s campaign. This week, Biden\u2019s campaign announced the hiring of Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the former co-national political director for the Harris campaign, as a senior adviser focusing on Latino outreach and state operations. The campaign recently beefed up its digital team by adding senior advisers from the campaigns of Harris, O\u2019Rourke and Warren. Biden\u2019s advisers maintain frequent contact with the teams of former opponents. Rob Flaherty, Biden\u2019s digital director who is an alum of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, has coordinated digital and social media efforts, and a trio of top advisers \u2013 Crist\u00f3bal Alex, Stef Feldman and Symone Sanders \u2013 work with outside groups and former rivals\u2019 teams on policy issues. The Top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as vice president, ranked Biden has already made policy overtures to past campaigns, including embracing Warren\u2019s bankruptcy plan and teaming up with the Massachusetts senator to highlight possible corruption in the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus relief efforts. He\u2019s credited Sanders and his supporters for \u201claying the groundwork\u201d on two of Biden\u2019s recent policy commitments \u2013 lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and forgiving student loan debt for low-income and middle-class borrowers who attended public colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and other institutions geared toward students of color. The Biden and Sanders\u2019 teams have set up unity task forces aiming to work together on six key policy areas. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an ardent Sanders supporter, is co-chairing the group focusing on climate change along with Biden backer former Secretary of State John Kerry. As Democrats turn their attention to the general election, the Biden campaign is working to maximize the use of former rivals in virtual fundraising and events. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Buttigieg, Harris and Klobuchar have all participated in recent fundraisers for the former vice president. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke, have headlined virtual campaign events and calls for the campaign. Klobuchar, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee and Andrew Yang have appeared on Biden\u2019s podcast \u201cHere\u2019s the Deal.\u201d Biden made his own calls to grassroots donors occasionally during the primary, but he\u2019s aimed to make those personalized calls more frequently since he became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Like Warren once did, his team dangles the possibility of a call from Biden in many of its fundraising pitches. Biden and Warren recently teamed up to call those grassroots donors together. \u201cI wanted to call to say thank you for contributing to Vice President Biden\u2019s campaign. You\u2019re one of the people we\u2019re counting on,\u201d Warren said in a video of the calls. \u201cToday I\u2019ve got a special guest \u2026 take it away Joe.\u201d \u201cCarroll, this is Joe Biden,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cI was kidding with the senator a moment ago. I said, you know I used to call my contributors, but I never had as many until she endorsed me,\u201d said Biden. \u201cI\u2019m counting on her a great deal not just for her endorsement, but for her ideas and her leadership.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama\u2019s harsh criticism of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic this weekend brought renewed scrutiny of President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, but administration officials defended the response as \u201chistoric\u201d Sunday as deaths neared 90,000. During a Sunday morning appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar touted the fact that the US has conducted 10 million tests over the last few months (a number that many health experts say is insufficient in a nation with 328 million people) and noted that the current coronavirus positivity rate is at 9%. \u201cThanks to the President\u2019s historic response efforts here and the collaborative work of governors and heroic health care workers on the frontlines, we are in a position to reopen,\u201d Azar said. But Obama offered a very different take on Saturday when he broke with the longstanding tradition that former presidents should avoid criticizing the current occupant of the office. In two different graduation speeches Saturday, Obama told graduating high school seniors that the crisis has revealed the glaring inadequacies of America\u2019s current leadership. \u201cAll those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing? It turns out that they don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d the former President said during Saturday night\u2019s special broadcast of \u201cGraduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020.\u201d \u201cA lot of them aren\u2019t even asking the right questions. So, if the world\u2019s going to get better, it\u2019s going to be up to you.\u201d In an implicit rebuke of the President during a week when Trump marshaled an intensive PR campaign from the White House to improve Americans\u2019 perceptions of his pandemic response, Obama urged the graduating class to dedicate themselves to their communities, instead of self-serving pursuits. \u201cDoing what feels good, what\u2019s convenient, what\u2019s easy \u2014 that\u2019s how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way \u2014 which is why things are so screwed up,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI hope that instead, you decide to ground yourself in values that last, like honesty, hard work, responsibility, fairness, generosity, respect for others.\u201d His remarks came a week after he criticized the administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic response as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d on a private phone call with alumni from his administration. Returning to the White House from Camp David on Sunday, Trump called his predecessor \u201cgrossly incompetent.\u201d The contrast of Obama\u2019s sharp critique and Trump\u2019s vigorous efforts to reshape the narrative about his administration\u2019s haphazard response to the virus offered a preview of the arguments the two sides will make in the general election campaign. Obama is increasingly stepping off the sidelines to become a forceful advocate for his former vice president, Joe Biden, while Trump and his allies risk sounding tone deaf as they herald the response at a time when American deaths are nearing six digits. The former President\u2019s public comments capped a solemn week when US coronavirus cases neared 1.5 million and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tweeted that all of the forecasting models tracked by the CDC now predict that US deaths will exceed 100,000 by June 1. But Trump has continued his unrelenting push for states to open their economies. During a Rose Garden event this week where he reiterated his hope that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready by the end of this year \u2013 a goal many medical experts view as highly optimistic \u2013 Trump declared that \u201cvaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d Asked what the President meant by that phrase, Azar said Sunday that a potential vaccine is just one component of the administration\u2019s response effort that will include increased testing, greater surveillance to find cases and the investigation of coronavirus treatments like convalescent plasma, which involves doctors testing for antibodies to the virus in the blood plasma of a person who recovered and then injecting the plasma, or a derivative, into the person infected with coronavirus. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper noted the American death toll \u2013 saying that \u201cthe US has less than 5% of the world\u2019s population but has 30% of the world\u2019s officially reported coronavirus deaths\u201d \u2013 Azar pointed to the high level of complicating medical factors like obesity, hypertension and diabetes in the United States: \u201cEvery death is a tragedy, but the results could have been vastly, vastly worse,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the American population is a very diverse and it is a population with significant unhealthy comorbidities that do make many individuals in our communities, in particular, African Americans and minority communities, particularly at risk here, because of significant underlying disease health disparities and disease comorbidities and that is an unfortunate legacy in our health care system that we certainly do need to address.\u201d \u201cThe response here in the United States has been historic to keep this within our health care capacity,\u201d Azar added. When asked whether he was alarmed by images of crowded bars and restaurants in states like Wisconsin and Ohio this weekend, Azar said it was inevitable that people would do things that are \u201cirresponsible.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s part of the freedom that we have here in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an area that has ongoing community spread of disease, there are steps you should take,\u201d Azar said. \u201cWe count on local leaders to implement and interpret that according to the local situation. But we\u2019ve got to get this economy and our people out and about \u2013 working, going to school again, because there are serious health consequences to what we\u2019ve been going through.\u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro, the Defense Production Act policy coordinator, said criticism that the White House should have made greater use of the Defense Production Act to obtain medical supplies and personal protective equipment is \u201cdead wrong.\u201d He also argued that keeping people under \u201clockdown\u201d could ultimately \u201ckill a lot more people.\u201d \u201cAs we\u2019ve basically locked down our hospitals for everything but Covid, women haven\u2019t been getting mammograms or cervical examinations for cancer. We haven\u2019t been able to do other procedures for the heart or the kidneys. And that\u2019s going to kill people as well,\u201d Navarro said Sunday. \u201cSo if you contrast like this complete lockdown \u2013 where some of the people in the medical community want to just run and hide until the virus is extinguished \u2013 that\u2019s going to not only take a huge toll on the American economy, it\u2019s going to kill many more people than virus, the China virus, ever would.\u201d Navarro also sought to blame the early problems with coronavirus testing on the CDC. The agency, he said Sunday, \u201creally let the country down with the testing. Because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test.\u201d With Americans distracted by the toll of the pandemic, the President seized the moment to execute a Friday night firing of the inspector general at the State Department who aided lawmakers during the impeachment inquiry \u2013 a move that drew outrage from Democrats and admonishments from Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Mitt Romney of Utah. State Department Inspector General Steve Linick was investigating whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a staffer perform a variety of personal errands, including walking his dog, picking up dry cleaning and making a dinner reservation for him and his wife, a Democratic aide told CNN Sunday. Linick was the fourth independent government watchdog that Trump has either fired or moved to replace in the months since his impeachment acquittal in February, maneuvers motivated by his perceptions that the officials were disloyal, critical of his administration, or simply holdovers from Democratic administrations. Romney, the only GOP senator who voted to convict Trump of abuse of power, tweeted that \u201cthe firings of multiple Inspectors General is unprecedented; doing so without good cause chills the independence essential to their purpose. It is a threat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power.\u201d Linick\u2019s dismissal was similar to the Friday night firing in April of Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community who alerted Congress to the anonymous Ukraine whistleblower complaint. In both cases, Trump told Congressional leaders he needed to have the \u201cfullest confidence\u201d in appointees serving as inspectors general and that he had lost that confidence. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 echoing his Democratic colleagues who have opened an investigation into the firing \u2013 was sharply critical of Linick\u2019s dismissal Sunday during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThis President thinks he\u2019s above the law, he is above criticism. He wants to get away with anything that he can, and he does not understand that in the function of government you have a Congress, you have inspector generals who say, by the way, Mr. President, what you\u2019re doing is wrong, and it may be illegal. This has been his modus operandi from day one,\u201d Sanders said. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that the White House has not provided reasons for the State Department Inspector General\u2019s removal beyond the letter she received from Trump on Friday. Removing an inspector general who has opened a potentially damaging investigation could be \u201cunlawful,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ceven Republicans in Congress are concerned.\u201d But if that is true, only a few have spoken up, including Grassley, Romney and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, told CNN\u2019s Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he was satisfied with the administration\u2019s explanation for removing Linick. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re going to provide any more robust rationale for doing it,\u201d Johnson said. He also said he and Grassley had a \u201creal problem\u201d with Linick\u2019s \u201cresponsiveness\u201d to one oversight request, though he did not provide any more detail. In a statement Saturday, Grassley said the President was required to provide lawmakers with a written explanation for removing inspectors general and said, \u201ca general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient detail to satisfy Congress.\u201d This story has been updated with details about Linick\u2019s investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Trump\u2019s calculation to reject science and push to swiftly crank up an economy with the nation still ravaged by Covid-19 could kill many more than the 85,000 Americans who have already died. That seems a price Trump is willing to pay as he appeals directly to the many millions of Americans who are also victims of the pandemic, but who have paid with their jobs, not their lives. That\u2019s a message that could resonate. In states where the virus has not caused massive death tolls, it can seem remote. But economic blight is everywhere and may brew a political storm that could punish Democrats if Trump can paint them as stubborn enemies of a return to work or responsible for furloughs turning into long-term job losses. In 2016, Trump confounded the political class by seizing on the \u201cforgotten Americans\u201d who had seen their jobs in industrial heartlands disappear to low-wage economies in Asia and were contemptuous of the promises of what they saw as politically correct, \u201cglobalist\u201d politicians in both parties. Four years later, the President, whose refusal to wear a face mask sends a message of defiance and outsider authenticity to his supporters, is again choosing a path that ignores the warnings of experts. Public health officials and many of Trump\u2019s critics argue that opening shops, restaurants, hair salons, movie theaters and bars \u2013 even at reduced capacity \u2013 risks igniting new epidemics even ahead of an expected resurgence of the virus in the fall. Trump has acknowledged that lives will be lost but says there is no alternative to reviving the economy on which so many lives rest \u2013 and on which his reelection depends. \u201cWill some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said earlier this month. But he added: \u201cWe have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d Or as Trump\u2019s economic adviser Peter Navarro put it on a CNN town hall on Thursday night: \u201cIf we don\u2019t open this economy back up, we\u2019re not going to have an economy.\u201d The success or failure of Trump\u2019s gamble will at least partially be up to a virus that is highly transmissible and has no current vaccine or proven therapy. If the pandemic wanes, and states that are opening create a semblance of normal life, the President could get credit for his early call to restart the economy. If, by November, the election turns on mostly economic questions, he may have maneuvered himself onto a launch pad for a victory that looked unlikely as the pandemic spread in recent weeks. On the other hand, if state openings spark a resurgence of the virus ahead of a deadly winter, new questions will be raised about Trump\u2019s leadership and squandering of human life. After being in denial about the virus in the first place and failing to properly prepare, he will have botched the reopening, potentially causing even more economic damage. The conundrum reveals the most intriguing political questions of the coming months: How will the trauma from the pandemic shape voter sentiment? Have Trump\u2019s repeated missteps already alienated sufficient swing voters \u2014 especially the crucial bloc of suburban women \u2014 to make Joe Biden president? Or are the Washington pundits missing something. Does the incessant Beltway focus on Trump\u2019s lies, organizational disasters and distractions obscure the possibility that he has again identified a latent political force with his reopening campaign that could reassemble his 2016 coalition and engineer an even more surprising victory night in November? Or is there an unknown, anti-Trump counter wave building, fueled by dissatisfaction with his performance? Trump\u2019s gut call on the economy reflects how he has exploited the country\u2019s deep ideological and cultural split. He has strongly supported conservative protesters who have targeted Democratic governors who ordered lockdowns, despite polls showing the malcontents are in a minority. He never shared former President Barack Obama\u2019s vision of a unified America. Trump, instead, has worked to electrify the conservative half of the country. In pushing openings he is lining himself up among often blue collar conservatives in the Midwest and the South who populate his political base. Suburban, middle class voters on the coasts and in the cities are more likely to vote Democratic, and also may work in office jobs and so can log on to the laptop at home. But the economic crunch has disproportionately hit lower-paid workers who are more likely to be laid off and need to get back to the workplace. For instance, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that 40% of people laid off in March came from households making less than $40,000 a year. Still, workers in manual and low-paid service jobs, which are disproportionately filled by minorities, are also among the most at risk of infection, so it doesn\u2019t follow that every worker agrees with the President. Trump, for instance, ordered meat-packing plants to reopen across the country. He ignored pleas from workers who complained that their employers failed to provide protective gear and social distancing to minimize the risk of infection. In Pennsylvania on Thursday, Trump boosted conservatives furious that Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will not allow some southeastern Republican counties to open. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get your governor in Pennsylvania to start to open up here,\u201d Trump said. The counties concerned do not yet meet the governor\u2019s standards of 50 cases per 100,000 people that he says can allow a safe reopening. Trump\u2019s hunch to go all-in on opening the country explains why he has now turned on experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who warned Wednesday that opening too fast could cause unnecessary suffering and death. In recent days, there is evidence that overall, the trend of national infections may be on a downward swing. New cases have been falling in Georgia and Florida for instance \u2013 two of the states most aggressive at reopening. Still, Texas, another opener, is rising quite sharply, and many major population centers in Florida and Georgia are still closed. It will probably be at least another two weeks, given the incubation period of Covid-19, before the impact of state openings on infections can be properly assessed. But with 36 million people jobless in the most horrendous crash in the everyday economy since the 1930s, public tolerance for lockdowns is surely on borrowed time \u2013 one reason why the President may be so aggressive in pushing to open up. Biden seems aware that flatly opposing an economic opening in such extreme times is a political liability. \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether or not to reopen. We all want to reopen. It\u2019s how to reopen safely and effectively,\u201d the former vice president said in a statement on Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania. \u201cThe Trump administration simply hasn\u2019t done the work to make that happen \u2014 except to take care of themselves at the White House,\u201d Biden said, referring to the comprehensive diagnostic testing at the White House Trump has not offered all Americans. Democrats have a strong case to make that Trump\u2019s erratic leadership has made the pandemic in the US far worse than it needed to be. The President spent months arguing it would never be a problem in the United States and has consistently spread misinformation about its scale and threat. He did nothing to prepare businesses, school systems or America\u2019s transportation infrastructure for the shock of the closures. His failure to put in place a strong testing, tracing and isolation regime \u2013 except at the White House \u2013 means most Americans lack sufficient safeguards to go back to work \u2013 a factor that could slow Trump\u2019s hoped-for partial economic recovery by November. And Trump also sided with big business interests in refusing to fully use the Defense Production Act to mass produce protective equipment for medical workers on the front lines, a factor that undercuts his claims to be a champion of the working class. Democrats can also argue that Trump\u2019s aggressive opening push will cost tens of thousands of lives. A new model often used by the White House put the likely toll by August 4 alone at 140,000 because of state openings. Hopefully it will not get that bad. But if it does, Biden will be in a position to claim that Trump let people die to win a second term and to benefit his friends in big business. So far, Democratic governors who have faced a fierce challenge from the pandemic have been winning strong support from voters in polls. Yet they will face a delicate task in pivoting toward an economic message when the pain of the lockdowns begins to bite ever deeper. Still, in the new political era of compromised truth, basing a campaign message against Trump on facts and details and science is a risk in itself. Truth has never yet brought him down.",

            "article_content": "The Human Rights Campaign, the largest civil rights organization working to achieve LGBTQ equality in the United States, is endorsing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden for president. \u201cJoe Biden has been a staunch supporter of equality, and a supporter of LGBTQ issues for most of his political career,\u201d HRC president Alphonso David told CNN in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s actually been quite instrumental in changing the public discourse on many issues, including marriage equality.\u201d The endorsement comes on the eighth anniversary of then-Vice President Biden\u2019s endorsement of same-sex marriage in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d an announcement that, at the time, caused considerable angst among aides to President Barack Obama, who had not yet supported same-sex marriage. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cI am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women \u2026 are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don\u2019t see much of a distinction,\u201d Biden said at the time. The HRC board voted late Tuesday night and came to a unanimous decision to throw its support behind Biden. \u201cLGBTQ people will be treated with dignity and respect,\u201d David told CNN of what it would mean to have Biden elected president. \u201cRight now, under the Trump administration, we\u2019re treated like second-class citizens. Better yet, the Trump administration is looking to erase us,\u201d he said, citing as examples the Trump administration\u2019s transgender military ban and its proposed rule to allow adoption and foster care agencies to receive federal grants, even if they choose to reject LGBTQ couples as potential parents for religious reasons. Biden joined the Human Rights Campaign for a virtual event later Wednesday to accept the endorsement, saying, \u201cWhat I did eight years ago took no courage. What took courage, was 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, when people had the courage to stand up and speak out.\u201d He emphasized the importance of continuing to fight for civil rights amid the coronavirus pandemic, a health crisis that is also causing economic strife. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any question that they\u2019re going to use this crisis to try to further divide and attack our community, even more than they have,\u201d Biden said of the Trump administration. \u201cThe White House shouldn\u2019t be a source of oppression and fear. It should be a source of moral courage,\u201d he continued. Biden on Wednesday reiterated his pledges to make passing the Equality Act a top priority in his first 100 days in office, to restore the full Voting Rights Act and to support state and federal efforts to allow transgender and non-binary citizens to choose \u201cx\u201d as a gender marker on documents like passports. As part of its endorsement, the HRC has also announced a plan to target seven battleground states in an effort to mobilize voters who prioritize LGBTQ equality issues to go to the polls come November. The organization has identified 3.4 million so-called \u201cequality voters\u201d across Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. At least 45 full-time staff in these seven states, combined with an additional 20 staff focused on a second tier of states and districts, will concentrate their attention on these voters who are at risk of not turning out. The organization has identified that of these 3.4 million at-risk voters, 60% are women, 48% are people of color, and 30% are under the age of 35. \u201cThese folks hold the keys not only to this election but to the future,\u201d David said. Amid the Covid-19 outbreak, outreach will include a weekly phone bank in lieu of door-knocking, virtual voter training and the use of a new advocacy app called \u201cTeam,\u201d which allows users to engage with its personal contacts on social media. The Human Rights Campaign did not endorse a candidate in the primary, unlike in 2016, when the organization threw its support behind Hillary Clinton in January of that year. Alphonso cited a different political landscape in 2020 in explaining the decision to hold off this time. \u201cWhen Hillary Clinton ran, we didn\u2019t have 20-x pro-equality candidates running for president,\u201d David said. In making its decision about who to endorse, the organization issued questionnaires to all pro-equality candidates in the primary in either January or February. \u201cAt this point, Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee, which means that we only needed to focus on his application and his record. And as we did that, we determined that May 6 was really the appropriate day to endorse him,\u201d David told CNN, citing the date as both \u201csymbolic\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d for the LGBTQ community. This story has been updated with comments from Joe Biden during the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s virtual event Wednesday night.",

            "article_content": "New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez signaled in an interview published Monday that she will support Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid in November but said that the process of uniting the party behind his campaign should be \u201cuncomfortable for everyone involved.\u201d \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough,\u201d the freshman congresswoman told The New York Times. Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 bid in October, but the Vermont independent dropped out of the race last week, clearing the way for Biden\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination. The New York Democrat told the Times that Biden\u2019s campaign has yet to reach out to her and that his outreach to Sanders\u2019 supporters and the more progressive wing of the party must go further. It\u2019s up to Biden how enthusiastic her support will be, Ocasio-Cortez told the paper. She told the Times that a Biden rally with her could be a possibility, but noted she has never spoken to the former vice president. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to needle as a way of making a point or to score points. I want to win. And I want to make sure that we win broadly.\u201d The Point: Bernie Sanders didn't win. Here's what he did do. The party\u2019s 2016 nominating process dragged on until the convention, when Hillary Clinton claimed the nomination, but much of Sanders\u2019 progressive base was still reluctant to support the former secretary of state during the election. Clinton told Howard Stern late last year that Sanders \u2013 who waited until mid-July of that year to back the nominee \u2013 \u201churt me\u201d with his late endorsement. Ocasio-Cortez described the 2020 primary as \u201cmuch less painful and nasty and fraught as it was in 2016,\u201d appearing to open the door to the potential for a smoother unification process between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. Ocasio-Cortez also said the process of unifying the party should be \u201cuncomfortable for everyone involved \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s working.\u201d \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough,\u201d she told the Times. Instead of \u201cthrowing the progressive wing of the party a couple of bones,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez says the conversation should be about \u201chow we can win.\u201d After Bernie Sanders: Progressives take stock after they fall short again \u201cI think people understand that there are limits to what Biden will do and that\u2019s understandable \u2014 he didn\u2019t run as a progressive candidate,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cBut, at the bare minimum, we should aspire to be better than what we have been before. And I just don\u2019t know if this message of \u2018We\u2019re going to go back to the way things were\u2019 is going to work for the people for who the way things were was really bad.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez also said she\u2019s flagged Biden\u2019s underperformance among Latinos and young people as a pattern that needs attention. The congresswoman also took aim at Biden\u2019s new policy proposal to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60, saying it\u2019s \u201calmost insulting.\u201d The Biden campaign announced the new Medicare proposal last week, along with a proposal to forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families who attend public colleges and universities and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as an olive branch to Sanders\u2019 supporters.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders launched his first presidential campaign in near obscurity. He ended his second on Wednesday having inspired a movement that changed American politics. Sanders never fully embraced the Democratic Party, even as he sought its nomination. But many in the party \u2013 including the voters who cast a ballot for another candidate this year \u2013 have largely embraced his ideas. Ultimately, however, Sanders\u2019 message outperformed his campaigns. Now it\u2019s up to a new generation of progressive leaders to do what he could not: win. One of their first tasks will be to look back and determine what the next standard bearer can learn from Sanders\u2019 efforts \u2013 identifying what worked, what didn\u2019t, and how to tell the difference. In photos: Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders It is a big question. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joked to CNN that you could fill a \u201cthesis\u201d trying to answer it. Still, she took a stab \u2013 offering five lessons. \u201cThe electorate is quite willing to support so-called \u2018radical\u2019 policies when they are properly framed and explained; there is enormous potency in movement candidacies; intersectionality is only going to get more important as the electorate diversifies; we can and should lean into building stronger, broader multiracial and intergenerational coalitions.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race She concluded, pulling it all together: \u201cWho the candidate is and when they\u2019re running shapes all of that.\u201d Pieces of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s outline popped up in interviews about Sanders\u2019 exit, and what it means for the movement he galvanized, with more than a dozen leading progressive activists, operatives, writers and elected officials. Like Ocasio-Cortez, they all drove \u2013 by one route or another \u2013 toward the same point: the importance, from the candidates to the voters, of broadening and diversifying the new progressive coalition. Sanders, as a candidate, ultimately failed to translate the popularity of his politics into electoral success. And in a year when Democrats routinely put denying President Donald Trump a second term as their top priority, Sanders \u2013 by his own admission \u2013 failed to convince primary voters that he was the best positioned to do it. Sanders the candidate often struggled to keep pace with public support for his signature policies. But for a week in late February, after he won the Nevada caucuses, the gap appeared to be closing \u2013 the nomination coming into reach. But the tide would turn fast, and Sanders was beaten back again from the shore. The week between Nevada and the next primary, in South Carolina, presented an opportunity for Sanders \u2013 whom many at the time believed was cruising to victory \u2013 to reach out and attempt to bring on board, or at least give pause, to some of the same figures who would ultimately rally behind Biden. Instead, Sanders doubled down on his rhetoric attacking the party establishment. A source close to the campaign, frustrated after an underwhelming showing on Super Tuesday, boiled over in frustration at Sanders\u2019 refusal to step out of his comfort zone and attempt to persuade potential allies. \u201cI think a big part of what it could be doing, that he\u2019s not doing, is leaning into a lot of the stuff that makes him uncomfortable, which is obviously media and politics. There\u2019s a rejection of doing, the typical political game. Calling people, doing the work that needs to be done to get endorsements, to get momentum,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe need more people involved. We need more people to feel connected to this thing.\u201d Ahead of the South Carolina primary, Sanders did not personally ask for influential Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s support, which eventually \u2013 and perhaps inevitably \u2013 went to Biden shortly before the primary. Asked by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow why he did not even attempt to court Clyburn, Sanders suggested it would have been a futile effort. \u201cJim is a very nice guy, I like him and respect him \u2013 his politics are not my politics,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I respect him, but there\u2019s no way in God\u2019s earth he was going to be endorsing me.\u201d The episode underscored one of the Sanders campaign\u2019s fatal flaws \u2013 an inability to expand its base of support by means of persuasion. Though his coalition was more diverse than in 2016, due in large part to the campaign\u2019s targeted and sustained outreach to Latinos, it again fell short of its own rhetoric. A week after Nevada, Biden stormed to victory in South Carolina by nearly 30 percentage points over Sanders, whose campaign kicked in a late half-million dollars in ad spending hoping to keep the margin in single digits. Like in 2016, black voters down South asserted themselves and rejected the senator from Vermont. \u201cThe most urgent task for the progressive movement is to build a deeper relationship with the African-American community and leaders who have been the true agents of social change in American history,\u201d California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Sanders campaign co-chair, told CNN. \u201cWe need to sit down with people like Jim Clyburn, Karen Bass, Cedric Richmond, Bennie Thompson, Robin Kelley, Maxine Waters and Barbara Lee with humility and respect to understand how we strengthen the bonds between progressives and the black community.\u201d Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders, offered a similar prescription. \u201cIt is possible to build a progressive, multiracial coalition of working class people of all races,\u201d Archila said. \u201cBut in order to win a national election, progressive coalitions need to resonate and have authentic and deep relationships with black communities and leaders, especially in the South. We will not win if we cannot win in black communities.\u201d Biden\u2019s dominance with black voters underscored the persistence of a problem the new leftists will have to untangle in the months and years to come. \u201cThe progressive wing of the party,\u201d Archila said, \u201cneeds to be more serious about nurturing and supporting women and people of color to run at all levels.\u201d In the meantime, Biden used those shortcomings to cast Sanders\u2019 anti-establishment message as an affront to voters of color in South Carolina. \u201cThe establishment are all those hardworking middle-class people, those African Americans,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey are the establishment!\u201d Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Biden campaign co-chair, hammered home the message: \u201cI just did not know that African Americans in the South were considered part of the establishment,\u201d he said. As the Sanders campaign learned during the unraveling after South Carolina, there is no path to power without winning over open-minded moderates. But by then, the time for aggressive outreach had long passed. Sanders was attempting to complete a hostile takeover of the party and his derisive references to its \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2013 an amorphous term that means different things to different people \u2013 turned off voters who might have been willing to give him a hearing. In a tweet on April 1, as the window was closing on the campaign\u2019s hopes, its deputy distributed organizing director, Jack Califano, zeroed in on a tendency that has undermined the left\u2019s work to grow its ranks. \u201cIn order to win, we will need to communicate our ideas in a way that feels both safe and exciting to people who don\u2019t self identify as \u2018socialists,\u2019\u201d Califano wrote. \u201cIf we mistake that effective messaging for a betrayal of our cause, we will never expand our base, & we will never win.\u201d Sanders himself repeatedly acknowledged that the popularity of his ideas were not translating to electoral success. \u201cWe are losing the debate over electability,\u201d Sanders said at a press conference in Burlington, Vermont, on March 11, a day after losing five out of six contests. \u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, and I quote, \u2018I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have heard that statement all over this country. Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion. But that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.\u201d Ultimately, Sanders\u2019 strengths as a political figure \u2013 his consistency and stubbornness in support of progressive ideals \u2013 also manifested as weaknesses on the campaign trail. He acknowledged that his inability to \u201ctolerate bull**** terribly well,\u201d do the common political \u201cbackslapping,\u201d or offer the most mundane \u201cpleasantries\u201d was a source of \u201cself-criticism.\u201d But the campaign\u2019s difficulty in coalition-building was also frequently outside of its control. From the outset of the campaign, Sanders, in private and publicly, pushed for his supporters and surrogates \u2013 especially online \u2013 to take a more civil tone with opponents. Too often, though, they ignored his entreaties and actively sought to kick off feuds that would, over time, create a self-defeating cycle that obscured the candidate\u2019s message and alienated would-be allies. In January, Sanders supporters angry at Warren for maintaining, over his denials, that he told her a woman could not win the presidency, launched a Twitter campaign that included hashtags like #WarrenIsASnake and filled her replies with snake emojis. When Warren dropped out of the race less than two months later, she decided not to endorse his campaign \u2013 or absolve Sanders of personal responsibility for his supporters\u2019 behavior. \u201cYou know, I shouldn\u2019t speak for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something he should speak for himself on.\u201d The Sanders campaign kept a respectful distance from the endorsement question, but segments of the pro-Sanders media and high profile online supporters pilloried her for the decision \u2013 unwilling to accept any role in poisoning the waters, while turning indignant at the suggestion that the episode might have affected Warren\u2019s thinking. When Ocasio-Cortez sent Warren a friendly tweet after the Massachusetts senator\u2019s appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d she too came under criticism from segments of the online left. Biden, no longer competing with other moderates to establish himself as their pick, has over the past few weeks sought to make inroads with Sanders\u2019 supporters. On Wednesday, he put out a statement \u2013 a 758-word Medium post \u2013 applauding Sanders (\u201che doesn\u2019t get enough credit\u201d) and his supporters (\u201cI see you, I hear you\u201d) for their work. Biden\u2019s team is clearly intent on forging a peace with the left, which has already begun its efforts, independent of Sanders, to extract commitments going forward \u2013 a key test that could, if Biden wins, allow progressives to get a toehold in the halls of power. On Wednesday afternoon, eight leading progressive groups sent an open letter to Biden, pledged their commitment to \u201cending a presidency that has set the clock back on all of the issues that impact our lives,\u201d while warning the former vice president that campaigning against Trump on a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d message would be a loser with young voters. They appended a corresponding list of requests focused on policy, but also personnel \u2013 asking Biden to \u201cappoint elected leaders who endorsed Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as co-chairs of his transition team.\u201d Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Khanna, from Sanders\u2019 camp, and Warren-backing Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Katie Porter were the specific names given. Philip Agnew, co-founder of the Dream Defenders and a senior adviser to Sanders during the campaign, suggested that an enduring legacy of the Sanders campaigns is the normalization of ideas that had been dismissed in mainstream politics for decades. \u201cWe now know that we are actually not in the minority. That the left and the left values are embraced and appreciated and demanded really by more than half of this country,\u201d Agnew said, pointing to the poll numbers showing the popularity of policies like Medicare for All. \u201cSo we can\u2019t unknow that now. And I think the organizing is only going to get stronger from there.\u201d That the left is able to make credible demands of the establishment center, in this case a former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee, is a remarkable achievement in its own right. Micah Uetricht, managing editor of Jacobin magazine and co-author, with Meagan Day, of the book \u201cBigger than Bernie,\u201d argued that defeat in the primary should not overshadow a fundamental shift authored, in large part, by Sanders\u2019 successes. \u201cMillions of Americans got behind a grouchy, rumpled old democratic socialist who wouldn\u2019t stop talking about class struggle,\u201d Uetricht said. \u201cProgressives, Berniecrats, socialists, and everyone who makes up the broad left shouldn\u2019t shy away from that kind of rhetoric in the future.\u201d Sanders, too, has shown no signs that he plans to pull back from the fight over the party\u2019s platform in 2020. When announcing his departure from the race, Sanders said he would remain on the ballot going forward as a means of amassing delegates in order to \u201cexert significant influence over the party platform and other functions.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not going to adopt my platform,\u201d Sanders said of Biden in an interview Wednesday night with Stephen Colbert. \u201cI got that, alright? But if he can move in that direction, I think people will say, you know what, this is a guy I think who we should support and would support.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Thirty-three years after launching his first presidential bid, Joe Biden will finally see his name at the top of the Democratic ticket. Bernie Sanders\u2019 departure from the 2020 race Wednesday opened a new chapter in Biden\u2019s three-decade-long pursuit of the presidency, clearing the former vice president\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination and a face-off against President Donald Trump in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great milestone in his life. The fact that he won the nomination is a great accomplishment,\u201d said former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant. \u201cBut I think it comes knowing that there are very, very difficult substantive problems and challenges ahead.\u201d Among the general election tasks at hand for Biden and his team: selecting a running mate, setting up operations in battleground states and uniting the Democratic Party after a grueling primary process. The early stages of the general election are now taking place against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has altered life for millions of Americans and completely transformed campaigning. Sidelined from the campaign trail, Biden spends his days receiving briefings about the coronavirus from his public health and economic advisers strategizing with his campaign team over the phone, and broadcasting live from a studio in the basement of his Delaware home. His staff, which has celebrated their victories at campaign headquarters in Philadelphia, is scattered across the country. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cThese are hard times and I certainly never imagined not being able to hug my teammates on the day we became the nominee,\u201d tweeted Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager. \u201cBut for just a second here I want to express pure gratitude to my beloved colleagues who make this journey a joy and an adventure. Onward to November.\u201d Some advisers to Biden expressed a sense of relief after Sanders ended his bid, saying the campaign can now turn its full attention and resources to the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of we thought this could happen in June, not April. There\u2019s a sense of \u2018hey we did this,\u2019\u201d one Biden ally said. \u201cThis was along road. Think about where we were 40 days ago. That\u2019s remarkable if you really think about the context of this.\u201d Biden\u2019s victory in the Democratic primary marks one of the greatest political comebacks in US history. After waging two failed White House runs during the 1988 and 2008 elections, Biden entered this year\u2019s race never having won a presidential primary contest. He then lost the first three states in the 2020 race, outcomes that made many believe his campaign was over. But in late February, Biden started what became an unstoppable turnaround with a decisive victory in South Carolina fueled by his support among African American voters \u2013 a moment that prompted many moderates to coalesce around the former vice president and led to a tidal wave of wins on Super Tuesday days later. How Joe Biden bounced back \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for almost 50 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. But you know these are things that happen to him \u2013 like the way he got elected in 1972,\u201d said Kaufman, who joined Biden\u2019s staff in his first year as a senator. \u201cHe\u2019s had really difficult things happen to him, but he\u2019s also had some incredibly positive things happen to him.\u201d At the age of 29, Biden won a long-shot bid for Delaware\u2019s Senate seat against the state\u2019s incumbent Republican Sen. Caleb Boggs. But weeks later, tragedy struck when he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident that also injured his two sons. Four decades later, one of those sons, Beau, passed away after a battle with brain cancer. Despite the personal tragedy, Biden worked in the US Senate for 36 years and served two terms as vice president with President Obama. He decided against a presidential bid in 2016 but moved forward with his third run for the White House one year ago. The 77-year-old Biden now faces the challenge of uniting the Democratic Party as he prepares for a general election fight against Trump. Biden refrained from publicly pressuring Sanders to leave the race, repeatedly saying it was a decision for the senator to make. But as the delegate math moved in his favor several weeks ago, Biden began making overtures to Sanders and his supporters, aware of the need to win over progressive voters to have a united front heading into the general election. \u201cBernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn\u2019t just run a political campaign; he\u2019s created a movement. And make no mistake about it, I believe it\u2019s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday,\u201d Biden wrote in a Medium post Wednesday. To Sanders supporters\u2019, Biden said, \u201cI see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You\u2019re needed.\u201d Sanders said he plans to remain on the primary ballot in order to amass \u201cas many delegates as possible,\u201d in the hopes of \u201cexerting significant influence over the party platform and other functions\u201d at the Democratic National Convention. Biden and Sanders most recently spoke on Wednesday, but top advisers for the two candidates, including Anita Dunn and Ron Klain on the Biden side and Faiz Shakir and Jeff Weaver from the Sanders camp, engaged in a series of conference call discussions over the past week, according to a source familiar with the conversations. An adviser to Biden\u2019s campaign says the two teams plan to stay engaged on a \u201crange of topics that would build on Vice President Biden\u2019s existing policy proposals and further our shared goals to move the country forward.\u201d Two substantive policy overtures came Thursday when Biden made commitments to lower the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60 and to forgive student loan debt for low-income and middle-class borrowers who attended public colleges and universities, historically black colleges and universities, and other institutions geared towards students of color. Though the policies don\u2019t go as far as Sanders\u2019 plans for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d or forgiving all student debt, the shift marks a direct appeal to progressive voters. \u201cSenator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I\u2019m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Biden said in a statement Thursday. The campaigns are working on a highly-choreographed rollout plan focused on trying to make Sanders supporters more comfortable with Biden, two people familiar with the plan told CNN. The next few days are aimed at this \u201ctransition,\u201d a time Sanders and Biden advisers see as a critical step in starting to smooth over any lingering tensions between the two campaigns. At some point, Biden is expected to bring aboard visible Sanders supporters in some capacity. Joe Biden said he would pick a woman as his running mate. Here's who could be on his list The Biden campaign is also working to bring progressive organizations into the fold with Biden advisers Crist\u00f3bal Alex, Stef Feldman and Symone Sanders running outreach to progressive groups and leaders. On Wednesday, a coalition of leaders from millennial and generation Z-aligned groups sent an open letter to Biden urging him to embrace many of their platform positions and commit to specific personnel moves on his campaign in order to win support of young voters. \u201cWith young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next President, you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Trump,\u201d the letter from progressive groups, including Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, says. \u201cThis division must be reconciled so we can unite the party to defeat Trump.\u201d One overt sign of party unity is likely to come when former President Barack Obama issues his expected endorsement of his former vice president. The timing and choreography of that endorsement is undetermined, but Obama could soon become an active player in the campaign to defeat his successor, President Trump, after waiting for the Democratic primary to settle. Biden is also on the brink of officially starting the vetting process for his vice presidential pick. As he works to assemble his team to run the operation, Biden has sought advice from President Obama, who counseled him to select a partner who can balance his traits. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m going to need a woman vice president who has the capacity, has strengths where I have weaknesses,\u201d Biden recently told donors of his conversation with Obama. Biden has committed to selecting a woman as a running mate and said he wants a partner who is \u201csimpatico\u201d with him. He\u2019s floated several of his former rivals, including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as possible picks, as well as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia state House minority leader. Biden told donors there has been a discussion within his campaign about announcing his VP pick before \u201cthe usual time,\u201d suggesting he could do so well before his party\u2019s convention, which has been pushed back to August. From the outset of his campaign, Biden attempted to frame the race as a contest between himself and President Trump, describing the election as a \u201cbattle for the soul of this nation.\u201d In the coming months, the Biden campaign plans to argue that Biden\u2019s experience coupled with his compassion and empathy make him best suited to serve as president, particularly as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cDonald Trump lacks empathy and has demonstrated through this crisis that he lacks the competence and experience to lead,\u201d said TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden. \u201cJoe Biden has built his career on connecting with Americans and has a proven track record of leadership in times of crisis. We will be clear in drawing this distinction for the next seven months.\u201d Though coronavirus has halted traditional campaigning, Biden is now readying for that new phase with his position at the top of the ticket settled and bracing for that final match-up between himself and Trump. \u201cSometimes when a team has a really rough schedule and they win their conference championships and you see it on TV, they cut the nets down,\u201d Kaufman said, referencing college basketball. \u201cHe is not cutting any nets down. He knows this is the beginning of a very difficult race.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "For more than a year on the campaign trail, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic presidential contenders spoke at nearly every event about the number of families in America who were living at the precipice, one paycheck away from losing everything \u2013 even as the economy was booming. Now that scenario is playing out in real time across the country, exposing the threadbare social safety net in America for minimum-wage workers and amplifying the drumbeat from labor unions for policies that would do more to protect the working class. The monumental job losses sweeping the country are already reshaping the presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders over universal health care coverage and how much more the government should be doing to help lower-wage workers. As laid-off workers wait for unemployment checks and the promised relief from the stimulus bill passed by Congress, many are barely scratching out an existence. They\u2019re dipping into the last of their savings and counting on the patchwork of orders barring evictions of coronavirus-impacted families while facing the reality that these stay-at-home orders could last for another month or longer. The country lost 701,000 jobs in March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. But the March jobs report does not capture the soaring jobless claims data from the past two weeks. The cataclysmic effect of layoffs in the hospitality and tourism industries is especially pronounced in California, where a new Department of Labor report shows that 878,727 people filed for unemployment last week. A mid-March study for the American Hotel & Lodging Association by Oxford Economics predicted that California would have more hotel-related job losses (414,069) than any other state, followed by Florida, Texas and New York. (Overall, the American Hotel & Lodging Association estimates that as many as 44% of hotel employees have or will lose their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic). Labor leaders in California, who have been at the forefront in pressing for some of the most progressive policies in the nation hope the silver lining of this pandemic will be to convince more Americans that low-wage workers need more assistance. That includes the push for a national $15 dollar-an-hour minimum wage, a move supported by Biden and Sanders. Among those teetering on the edge of financial disaster is Walter Almendarez, who worked for 23 years as a bellman in the elegant corridors of the famed Chateau Marmont, the landmark Los Angeles hotel where the likes of Charlize Theron and Marion Cotillard were routinely spotted on the patio. The 43-year-old made enough on a salary of $15.45 an hour and tips to take care of his wife and his 7-month-old baby, while helping to support his 77-year-old father and 67-year-old mother, who both receive Social Security and live with Almendarez and his wife. Then coronavirus swept into California. In early March, Almendarez was asked to take a week\u2019s vacation, then a second. Finally on March 19, he was fired with no guarantee that he would be rehired after the crisis passed. For now, Almendarez and his wife are trying to make each pack of diapers last as long as possible. Last week, Almendarez was among 2,500 workers who drove to a mobile pantry distribution organized by the Los Angeles Federation of Labor to pick up a box filled with rice, pasta, powdered milk and plums, provided by the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. He wasn\u2019t able to make the $1,500 payment due Wednesday on the family\u2019s rent-to-own house in Palmdale. And Tuesday brought a new anxiety for his wife: he said it was the last day the family had health insurance through his job. As he waits in this excruciating period of uncertainty, Almendarez is joining forces with UNITE HERE Local 11, the union that represents many hotel and tourism workers in Los Angeles, to push for a city-wide law that would require hotel and tourism companies to hire back the workers they laid off first once the economy gets going again. \u201cI\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m fighting to help pass a law to give workers protections in the hopes that when the crisis is over I\u2019ll be able to get back to my job,\u201d Almendarez said. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019m very, very worried. Honestly, we\u2019re really worried\u2026. A baby not having health care?\u201d UNITE HERE Local 11 and the Los Angeles Federation of Labor want to see worker recall laws implemented more broadly in Los Angeles and across the country. They believe they could be modeled on an ordinance that exists in Los Angeles for hotels in a certain geographical zone around LAX airport (which requires fired workers to be rehired if the hotel changes ownership), as well as a tourism employee recall law in Santa Monica that was passed after 9/11. The Santa Monica ordinance \u201cworked great \u2013 everyone got their job back after 9/11 and the Santa Monica tourism industry didn\u2019t miss a beat,\u201d said Kurt Petersen, a co-president of UNITE HERE Local 11. \u201cThese ordinances are smart for industry,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe smart companies\u201d are \u201ccontinuing to pay people, keeping them on payroll. Why? Because they\u2019re hoping this is going to turn around and they want to have their workers ready to go.\u201d Petersen noted that his union, which is a part of the LA Federation of Labor, represented more than 30,000 workers before the crisis. This month they will be down to 500 workers. \u201cNinety-five percent of our membership is laid off,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThis makes 9/11 look like the good times. This is the worst, by far, catastrophe for the tourism industry that has ever happened, certainly in our modern times and I\u2019m worried about how long it\u2019s going to take to come back.\u201d As workers wait for help from the stimulus bill and hope the state can quickly process unemployment claims, several said in interviews they simply don\u2019t know yet how they will get by. They viewed the fact that the Trump administration agreed to enhanced unemployment benefits in the $2 trillion federal stimulus package as a positive sign there might be bipartisan collaboration on a phase-four relief package as the nation deals with the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Beyond that, the presidential election in November and the change it could bring feels a long way off. Smaller incremental policy changes, like the one under consideration by the Los Angeles City Council, feel potentially more impactful to some in the short term. In Sanders\u2019 proposal to deal with Covid-19, the Vermont senator has argued that big hotel companies or airlines receiving government bailouts or loans as a result of Covid-19 must be required to protect and retain their workers. The Vermont senator would place conditions on the federal assistance to ensure any corporation receiving aid \u201cdoes not lay off workers, pays workers a livable wage, provides equity to the government, puts workers on corporate boards, and does not rip-off consumers.\u201d Biden\u2019s \u201cemergency action plan to save the economy\u201d advocated for expediting aid to businesses who commit to helping workers stay employed through the crisis and said he favored making \u201cAmericans whole for lost hours and wages.\u201d The former vice president has also criticized President Trump for refusing to reopen the federal Affordable Care Act marketplace, which could help laid off workers find health insurance. As fired hospitality workers strategize about how to get by in the near term, they are facing the fact that the job market has dried up while wondering whether it\u2019s safe to work at all in California, which is under a stay-at-home order for all but essential workers. Almendarez considered picking up some extra cash by helping a neighbor move, but then was too worried that he would risk exposing everyone in his household to the coronavirus. Francisco Gonzalez, a 39-year-old airport cargo driver at LAX, applied for unemployment after he was laid off on March 24. He considered looking for other work, but he still wants his old job back. And he doesn\u2019t feel that any industry is safe from the pandemic right now. Even after a brief trip to shop for groceries, he noticed that the latex gloves he was wearing were filthy after touching the cart. \u201cI thought, Oh my god, I better throw these away immediately as soon as I get home and wash my hands,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI watch everything I bring into the house. I\u2019m very worried still, because the coronavirus could be up in the air, not even where all the hands were touching. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m concerned for everyone in my family, my mom, my brother, everybody in the community and especially my co-workers that are putting themselves at risk at the (airport) terminals.\u201d Gonzalez, who was making $15.25 an hour, keeps checking online for clues as to when an unemployment check might arrive, but there are no signs of a deposit yet. His savings might get him by for a few months, he said, \u201cbut with food, I\u2019m going to run out eventually.\u201d He heard about the food distribution organized by the LA Federation of Labor, but he had no transportation to get there. \u201cEvery day I have to eat. But I limit myself,\u201d Gonzalez said. He bought a bag of potatoes, rice and beans, and some eggs to boil. \u201cOnly two bags of tortillas \u2013 that\u2019s how worried I am. When I run out, that\u2019s when I\u2019m afraid. Because I don\u2019t know what kind of resources I am going to get.\u201d",

            "article_content": "No one is beyond the novel coronavirus\u2019s reach: From social-distancing measures to virtual lockdowns, the current crisis demands that, whenever possible, Americans stay home. But while the global pandemic is leaving no one untouched, it\u2019s affecting us in different ways \u2013 including by forcing some groups to reimagine how to maintain a sense of kinship at a moment when in-person gatherings are all but impossible. Already, the toll that the virus has inflicted on America\u2019s public areas is unmissable. Even before states began ordering residents to stay home in recent days, cities including New York and Los Angeles had made moves to contain the rapidly spreading virus by closing all their bars and restaurants, except for delivery and takeout; Broadway also had decided that this is one time when the show mustn\u2019t go on. And after initially just shrinking their seating capacities, AMC and Regal, the country\u2019s two largest cinema chains, ultimately shut down all their US locations. In certain situations, however, the requirement to separate has had a particular sting in its tail. That\u2019s in part because, for a number of Americans, congregating isn\u2019t only a means of entertaining or socializing \u2013 it also provides a distinct sort of communal succor. Take the centrality of gathering in numerous religious traditions, including Catholicism, Islam and some Jewish practices. Over the past few weeks, many houses of worship across the country have canceled their live services. That\u2019s no small thing, considering that people often seek out the comfort of religion during crises, looking for connection as fear permeates the world around them. (There\u2019s also a technical dilemma: How do you reproduce, say, church music \u2013 group expressions of faith, essentially \u2013 without a congregation or choir?) Yet the disruptions have revealed little pockets of ingenuity. \u201cWe still come together, but we\u2019ve modified our togetherness,\u201d the Rev. Amos Brown told CNN. Since 1976, the civil rights-minded Brown has been the pastor of San Francisco\u2019s predominantly black Third Baptist Church \u2013 which was founded in 1852 and was the first black Baptist church west of the Rocky Mountains. Established in response to the inveterate racism in the area, the church has long been a pillar of San Francisco\u2019s black community. Brown said that he and his congregation have turned to technology \u201cto stay in touch with one another in spirit and in truth,\u201d especially since California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home executive order last week. Brown described how, using only a skeletal ministerial staff, Third Baptist Church is livestreaming sermons and music; it also has a robocall system that\u2019s always in operation, and the church is maintaining its food bank services. \u201cWe\u2019re still being a visible institution and a nation within a nation \u2013 making a way out of no way,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been the profile of the black church in this country.\u201d Other kinds of de facto community centers are attempting to chart paths forward, too. Zachary Clark, the executive director of 826DC, the Washington chapter of the 826 National network, an educational nonprofit organization that works largely with minority and low-income students from ages 6 to 18, described some of the challenges brought on by the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re about amplifying youth voices by creating community between them and authors,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cWriting can aid us in handling anxiety \u2013 it\u2019s a comfort and an escape. The students who came into our after-school program as the news about the virus intensified, they were nervous. They were afraid. They were uncertain. And they wanted facts. Writing is an opportunity to get to those facts.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis requires a lot of in-person work, which we do in DC schools in all eight wards and in our writing class in Columbia Heights. But because we follow DC Public Schools and DCPS announced that all its schools will be closed through April 24, that means that our programs also are on pause for the time being.\u201d In light of the closures, Clark said that 826DC has had to be nimble and adaptive in order to continue distributing resources to students \u2013 many of whom might desperately need the help, given that the pandemic will likely only supercharge educational inequity. \u201cOne of the benefits of writing is that it\u2019s a practice that you can take on your own if you have to,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cWe\u2019re checking in regularly with our students, making sure that they have writing packets and prerecorded workshops. In addition, our staff members are working remotely to turn some students\u2019 work into professional publications.\u201d He emphasized that his chief ambition is for the organization to meet students where they are \u2013 figuratively speaking, of course. \u201cWhenever it is that we\u2019re on the other side of all this, students will need more than ever high-quality educational programs that are in line with their social, emotional and academic needs,\u201d Clark said. The social-isolation measures that have been taken to curb the virus\u2019s spread have dealt a devastating blow to other sustenance-providing spaces as well, even if the impact hasn\u2019t been as obvious to mainstream observers. For decades, gay bars have been the lifeblood of LGBTQ communities \u2013 functioning both as sites of activism and as portals of possibility for people hoping to make sense of their identities in the face of hostile realities. As former President Barack Obama described such gathering places in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016: \u201c(It) is more than a nightclub \u2013 it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil rights.\u201d Nicci B., the co-owner of The Back Door, a queer bar in Bloomington, Indiana, where on Monday Gov. Eric Holcomb instructed residents to \u201chunker down\u201d via a stay-at-home executive order, underscored just how unprecedented the situation is. \u201cIn past times (of distress), there was consolation in being able to physically come together. Two instances I\u2019m thinking of are the moments following the Pulse massacre and President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election,\u201d Nicci told CNN. \u201cHistorically, joining in physical solidarity has meant so much. But now we don\u2019t have that.\u201d (Does that sentiment sound familiar? There\u2019s a reason that some refer to such establishments as \u201cthe gay church.\u201d) On top of stabilizing their hard-hit service-industry employees through a variety of crowdfunding platforms, some gay bars are maintaining a semblance of connectedness by encouraging their artists to take the show to newly homebound fans and patrons. Rachel Ryan, the co-owner and business operations manager of The Stud, a San Francisco gay bar that opened in 1966 and is known for its mesmerizing drag shows, described what this transition has looked like. \u201cLast Friday, a group of drag queens\u201d \u2013 a handful of them hometown Stud girls \u2013 \u201cdebuted \u2018Digital Drag: An Online Drag Show\u2019 using the video game streaming website Twitch,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAbout 10,000 people tuned in. It was hilarious. The performers used bedsheets and home lighting in their apartments. And as each queen did her number, her Venmo information was on the screen so that viewers could tip as if they were at an actual show.\u201d Ryan added: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to tap into a national conversation \u2013 a wider notion of community \u2013 through platforms we hadn\u2019t used before.\u201d Are the aforementioned course corrections perfect replacements for in-person gatherings? Hardly. For some groups in particular, there\u2019s a special feeling of belonging \u2013 of purpose \u2013 forged through human contact, and it can\u2019t be replicated just by putting everything online or working from a distance. Still, these early efforts at least do something to fight against the impulse to fall into pessimism in these bleak, almost anarchic times. Or as Nicci put it: \u201cThe present moment has created a sense of despair that many people haven\u2019t dealt with before. But we\u2019re all learning new lessons in empathy for our fellow people and the communities they belong to.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders said he will assess his presidential campaign after his poor showing in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries. \u201cAs I said yesterday, we are assessing the state of our campaign, there\u2019s not going to be an election for another three weeks,\u201d the Vermont senator told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe are talking to our supporters. Anybody who suggests that at this point we are ending the campaign is not telling the truth.\u201d Sanders did not answer questions on whether he has a timeframe for making a decision or if he thinks there\u2019s a pathway for him to win the Democratic nomination. Earlier Wednesday, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir made a similar comment about the future of the senator\u2019s bid. \u201cThe next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Sen. Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement Wednesday morning. \u201cIn the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.\u201d Shakir\u2019s statement came as parts of the campaign appeared to halt. An aide confirmed to CNN that the campaign had stopped running digital ad and had not booked TV ads past last week. The campaign has also issued no new fundraising appeals. Former Vice President Joe Biden substantially expanded his delegate lead over Sanders with his sweep of all three of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries in Arizona, Illinois and Florida. As of Wednesday, Biden had racked up a near 300-delegate lead over Sanders, according to CNN\u2019s estimate. \u201cNo sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,\u201d Shakir wrote in a campaign email to supporters Wednesday. \u201cAnd while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.\u201d Chances of Sanders winning the nomination appear mathematically slim and pressure from some Democrats has mounted on the senator to drop out of the race to avoid a lengthy primary and coalesce the party. Sanders backers believe that the senator needs to remain in the race to push Biden in a more progressive direction. In the campaign\u2019s email, Shakir told supporters that Sanders will vote on the coronavirus relief bill in the Senate Wednesday and afterward head back home to Vermont with his wife Jane. \u201cOnce there, they\u2019ll begin holding conversations with supporters to get input and assess the path forward for our campaign,\u201d the email read. A senior aide to Sanders told CNN he\u2019s in a phase of deliberation about not only the next stage of his campaign but also the movement itself. The aide said \u201cno decision has been made\u201d as of late Wednesday morning about his future and that Sanders will take time to huddle with not only his wife but also engage with a wide range of supporters to get their take on how he should proceed. \u201cSen. Sanders legitimately feels the \u2018US not me\u2019 statement is not just a slogan it is the backbone of the movement,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe won\u2019t make a decision about the future of his campaign without receiving the input of those who have been by his side.\u201d This aide said Sanders will use a variety of forms of communication to reach out to supporters, including making phone calls, reading emails and seeking feedback through his massive social media network. In addition to assessing the future of his campaign, Sanders remains very focused on the Senate\u2019s efforts to confront the coronavirus crisis and in particular the economic impact on the working class of America. \u201cHe cares a lot about the work of the Senate right now in dealing with this crisis,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThat is his priority right now.\u201d As questions continue to grow about the path ahead for Sanders, an aide for the Sanders campaign confirmed to CNN that they have deactivated all digital ads and do not have TV ads booked past last week. The aide said the decision was made \u201cin an effort to conserve resources.\u201d According to Facebook\u2019s ad analytics tool, the campaign had ads on Facebook as recently as Tuesday. As of Wednesday, those ads were inactive. The campaign also has not put out any new fundraising appeals. A Democratic strategist involved in Sanders campaign fundraising tells CNN this is the first time they can recall there wasn\u2019t a fundraising appeal after primaries \u2013 win or lose. The most recent fundraising pitch from the campaign came before the polls closed. But this strategist also warned against reading too much into that \u2013 it would be tone deaf to raise small dollars now, given the economic stress many people on Sanders\u2019 list are currently experiencing. The coronavirus pandemic has upended the election, leading many states to postpone their primary dates over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendations about large gatherings. The two candidates, both in their 70s, have stopped campaigning on the trail, suspended large rallies, ordered aides to work from home and moved their pitch to voters online. Before polls closed, Sanders spoke to supporters early Tuesday night but didn\u2019t mention the elections, instead focusing his message on the need to help working families struggling amid the coronavirus crisis. This story has been updated to include additional details and background information. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Maeve Reston, Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The coronavirus pandemic is disrupting the United States\u2019 political calendar, sidelining presidential campaigns and forcing Americans to weigh the risks to their health if they go vote. Under unprecedented circumstances, three states \u2013 Arizona, Florida and Illinois \u2013 are set to hold their primaries Tuesday. Combined, they account for 441 pledged delegates \u2013 or 11% of all Democratic delegates. A fourth state, Ohio, was also scheduled to vote Tuesday. But Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, after having his request to delay the primary until June denied by a judge, announced late Monday night that Ohio Health Director Dr. Amy Acton will order the polls there closed as a public health emergency. \u201cDuring this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at a unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,\u201d DeWine said in a statement. Polls and 2016 primary results suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is the heavy favorite over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders across Tuesday\u2019s map. If he sweeps all three primaries, he could lock in an insurmountable lead, all but clinching the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The crisis has added a degree of unpredictability, though, to the contests. And with both candidates knocked off the trail in recent days, their campaigns are unsure what to expect. Here are six things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s primaries: Ohio\u2019s primary appeared poised to be postponed when DeWine said Monday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s new guidance to limit gatherings of 50 people or more meant the state couldn\u2019t safely conduct its primary. Then it was back on again, when a judge rejected DeWine\u2019s bid to delay it until June. Then, late Monday night, it was off again \u2013 as DeWine\u2019s state health director, Dr. Amy Acton, issued a special order closing polling places, declaring it a public health emergency. Where things stood in Ohio was, as of late Monday night, unclear. Early Tuesday morning, Ohio\u2019s Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the state\u2019s move to close the polls. DeWine hasn\u2019t yet faced partisan criticism for his moves. But the last-minute nature of the rapidly unfolding situation, and his decision to go around a judge\u2019s ruling, has left uncertainty over what Ohio will do next. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who backed DeWine\u2019s move, said on CNN late Monday that he will seek Tuesday to officially move the primary date to June 2 \u2013 counting absentee ballots that have already been returned, extending the window for others to be requested and returned until then, and allowing in-person voting that day. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what legal obstacles that plan could face. The White House advised all Americans to avoid groups of more than 10, which could be hard for polling places to follow Tuesday. Some states have closed certain polling locations, especially those in nursing homes, leaving voters to figure out where to go at the last minute. It could all add up to lower voter turnout Tuesday than other states have experienced. If one demographic group \u2013 such as older voters, who have overwhelmingly backed Biden and are at the highest risk of coronavirus; or younger voters, who may have left the college campuses where they are registered \u2013 is most significantly affected, it could impact the results in key places. Arizona and Florida might not be affected as much as Illinois. Large majorities of both states\u2019 votes are cast early or by mail. In Illinois, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker made a different decision than DeWine did in Ohio. Pritzker told reporters Monday that every polling place would have hand sanitizer and that voting machines would be wiped down after every vote that\u2019s cast. \u201cI feel good about the decision to have the election go on tomorrow,\u201d he said. Over the last two weeks, Biden has demonstrated an unbeatable coalition of support: African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white women are overwhelmingly backing him over Sanders, while he\u2019s fighting the Vermont senator to parity among non-college-educated men. That electorate carried him in Michigan last week and, if it holds, could similarly deliver Illinois on Tuesday. Sanders\u2019 advantage with Latinos could be muted in Florida, where his past comments praising Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuban regime for its literacy efforts could prove damaging and the state\u2019s larger share of older voters gives Biden a clear edge. Arizona might be Sanders\u2019 best chance at a win Tuesday \u2013 but even it appears to be a long shot according to recent polling. If Tuesday goes according to Biden\u2019s plan, his campaign by Wednesday morning will tout a delegate lead would be all but insurmountable for Sanders in the remaining contests. Sanders may be girding for a tough Tuesday. The three states set to vote are all places where Hillary Clinton beat him in 2016. And in Florida, the former secretary of state nearly doubled up the Vermont senator, with a 64% to 33% win. If Sanders loses all three states, how he responds could say a great deal about how he will approach the rest of the primary. Will the senator downshift his attacks on Biden and lay the groundwork for getting out? Or will he continue the same aggressiveness he brought to Sunday night\u2019s debate? Sanders, following that debate, raised questions about whether Tuesday\u2019s primary elections should continue as the coronavirus spreads \u2013 a statement that implies he could be looking for a way to minimize their results and extend the primary fight. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, doing all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes that make a lot of sense? I\u2019m not sure that it does.\u201d President Donald Trump has loomed over the Democratic primary contest from the very beginning, with questions of electability driving the race for more than a year. Now, the White House response to the coronavirus pandemic offers a fresh, moment-by-moment reminder to Democratic (and independent) voters of the choice before them. Biden\u2019s advisers believe that benefits their campaign. And, at least in the short term, there\u2019s some reason to believe it\u2019s true, with the former vice president suddenly being handed a dual political boost: Showcasing one of his greatest strengths, which is being presidential, and avoiding one of his most nagging challenges, which is competing with Sanders for his trademark enthusiastic rallies. There\u2019s no question the unprecedented global outbreak has overshadowed Biden\u2019s presumed march to the Democratic nomination and sapped his campaign of some of its momentum over the last two weeks. But it\u2019s a trade-off the campaign will gladly accept, if the uncharted terrain helps refocus the race into a head-to-head match with Trump. The crisis almost certainly handed Sanders more time, with several states rushing to push back their primary dates, but it also is shining an even brighter spotlight on the man in the Oval Office. While most Democrats hardly needed a reminder of their desire to defeat Trump, there are plenty of voters who are still sizing up the Democratic challenger and Trump. And for Biden, that would seem to be an advantage. Yet even Biden\u2019s political advisers acknowledge the uncertainty that now surrounds the election means that any assumptions from the beginning of the campaign hardly apply. Presidential races often turn on far different topics than they began. What will November look like? It\u2019s foolhardy to guess. The future of this year\u2019s primaries beyond the three primaries on Tuesday is uncertain. Coronavirus has election officials across the country scrambling, trying to figure out how to hold in-person elections while complying with Trump administration guidelines about gatherings of no more than 10 people. Contests in Kentucky, Louisiana and Georgia have all been moved and elections officials in other states have said they are closely monitoring the situation. The political implications are significant. Biden was expected to run up the score when Georgia voted on March 24, and the further that Biden-friendly states like it move in the calendar, the easier it is for Sanders to extend the primary. The next major contest on the calendar is Wisconsin \u2013 a marquee general-election state \u2013 on April 7. This story has been updated to reflect the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision Tuesday morning.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign on Wednesday argued it would be \u201cnearly impossible for (Vermont Sen. Bernie) Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage\u201d in a campaign memo obtained by CNN. In the memo, Biden\u2019s campaign states its internal count has his delegate lead at approximately 160, including between 70 and 80 netted in this Tuesday\u2019s primary. The Biden campaign\u2019s estimate does not match CNN\u2019s estimate, which has Biden\u2019s advantage at 142 delegates, with the former vice president at 803 and Sanders at 661. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for the latest 2020 news and updated delegate count The memo argues that next week\u2019s primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, and then the following week in Georgia, are in \u201csome of our strongest\u201d states and that the campaign expects to \u201csignificantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign also argues that Sanders\u2019 delegate gains in Vermont, Colorado and Utah pale in comparison to what Biden netted in Alabama, Mississippi and Virginia. Bernie Sanders says he plans to debate Joe Biden \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Sanders has failed to win a large number of states, it\u2019s also that these wins have not netted significant delegates for him in the way they have for us,\u201d the memo says. The memo later adds, \u201cShould our broad base of support remain \u2013 and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise \u2013 it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d The memo comes after Biden notched massive wins Tuesday in Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, and is in a close race with Sanders as Washington continues counting votes. The Vermont senator won only North Dakota among states contested on Tuesday. As some Democratic officials and groups called Biden\u2019s delegate lead insurmountable, and the super PAC Priorities USA said it would begin backing Biden as the party\u2019s general election candidate, Sanders on Wednesday in Burlington, Vermont, pledged to continue in the race \u2013 saying he would debate Biden on Sunday night in Arizona. While speaking in Burlington, Sanders acknowledged that he\u2019s not doing well in the delegate count. \u201cLast night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,\u201d Sanders said, pointing out that he lost in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho. But, he added, \u201cWhat became even more apparent yesterday is that while we are currently losing the delegate count, approximately 800 delegates for Joe Biden and 660 for us, we are strongly winning in two enormously important areas which will determine the future of our country. Poll after poll, including exit polls show, that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda.\u201d The race is in the midst of a stunning two-week stretch in which Biden knocked out several leading competitors with his blowout win in the South Carolina primary, won 10 of the 15 contests on Super Tuesday and then scored a demoralizing victory Tuesday night in Michigan \u2013 the state where Sanders had stunned Hillary Clinton four years earlier. The veteran Democrat has rapidly consolidated a coalition of African Americans, suburban voters and working-class whites. Sanders, meanwhile, has been stronger among young voters \u2013 but those voters have turned out in smaller numbers. Biden in a speech Tuesday night in Philadelphia extended an olive branch to Sanders and his supporters. \u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\u201d Biden said. He echoed a common Sanders line on health care, touted their \u201ccommon goal\u201d and said they would work together to defeat President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign memo states that attacks on the former vice president\u2019s record on Social Security and trade \u2013 a key line of criticism from Sanders \u2013 had \u201clittle impact,\u201d arguing Biden won union households and voters over 65 by wide margins in Michigan and Missouri. The campaign also says it expected Tuesday to be the toughest priamry day in March. The memo touts Biden\u2019s \u201cbroad coalition\u201d and points to the suburbs and diverse counties \u2013 St. Louis County, Missouri; Wayne County, Michigan, which houses Detroit; and Hinds County, Mississippi, which includes Jackson, in particular \u2013 as places Biden \u201cran up the score.\u201d \u201cTurnout was up among the voters and in the states where we performed best. These are the kinds of states and voters who will deliver a victory in November,\u201d the memo states.",

            "article_content": "Voters went to the polls in six states across the country Tuesday night, with the results cementing the new reality in the 2020 Democratic race: Joe Biden is the clear front-runner and Bernie Sanders is fighting for his political life. Biden swept to wins in Missouri, Mississippi and most critically Michigan, where Sanders had hoped to reproduce an upset like he scored over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 contest. Sanders won in North Dakota, and Washington state was still too early to call Wednesday morning. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Below are my winners and losers from Super Tuesday II. * Joe Biden: If Super Tuesday was the night that the former vice president surged into the lead in this race, Super Tuesday II is the night that it became clear that, barring some sort of wildly unforeseen circumstance, Biden is on the path to the nomination. Biden\u2019s massive win \u2013 and massive margin among black voters (more on that below) \u2013 in Mississippi would have made for a good night. His wide margin of victory in Missouri, a state that Sanders nearly beat Clinton in in 2016, would have made it a very good night. His clear victory in Michigan makes it a great night for Biden. Biden\u2019s ability to win suburban voters, black voters and white working class voters in Michigan suggests that he now has put the coalition together not only to win the Democratic nomination, but also to be well-positioned to retake the state for Democrats in the fall. * Black voters: Starting in South Carolina, continuing through Super Tuesday states like Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia and culminating on Tuesday night in Mississippi and Michigan, black voters were the bedrock of the Biden comeback. In Mississippi, where Biden is poised to sweep up almost all of the state\u2019s delegates, black voters comprised two-thirds of the Democratic primary electorate \u2013 and the former vice president won that group by 76 points(!). In Michigan, where black voters made up roughly 1 in 5 Democratic voters, Biden beat Sanders by 37 points. Biden\u2019s rise from near-political death is a) entirely attributable to his extremely strong support among black voters and b) a reminder that the path to the Democratic nomination goes through winning black voters. (Former President Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in 2008 because of his support among black voters. Clinton beat Sanders in 2016.) * Andrew Yang: My dude has a sense for the moment. Soon after CNN called Michigan for Biden, Yang announced \u2013 live on CNN! \u2013 that he was endorsing the former vice president. He also revealed that he had had a long conversation with Biden over the past week about why big change, not incremental change, was necessary in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 which was an interesting note! Plus, Yang had, to my mind, the quote of the night (that Biden should immediately steal): \u201cNothing makes you appreciate a functioning government like a global pandemic.\u201d * Electability: I\u2019ve been on record as skeptical of the idea of a sort of objective ideal of electability, believing that electability is in the eye of the beholder. As evidence, I\u2019ve always cited the fact that Donald Trump is the current president despite being the least supposedly electable candidate in the 2016 race. But exit polling in state after state \u2013 particularly on Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday II \u2013 suggest that Democratic voters a) hugely valued a candidate they believed could beat Trump and b) settled, in large numbers, on Biden as that guy. In Michigan, 6 in 10 voters said nominating a candidate who can beat Trump was more important than choosing a candidate they agree with on issues. In that group, Biden beat Sanders by 31 points. Why did electability matter in this race when it seemed to be WAY overrated in 2016? Three words: President Donald Trump. * Bernie Sanders: The Vermont senator\u2019s campaign insisted as it became clear that Michigan had slipped from his grasp that he was continuing on with the campaign no matter what else happened on Tuesday night. And, because of his fundraising ability and his lack of care about what the party establishment thinks about him, Sanders can stay in the race for basically as long as he wants. But it\u2019s not clear \u2013 at least to me \u2013 what the path forward looks like for Sanders. The loss in Michigan is huge \u2013 given that the campaign went all-out in the state. And the primary calendar doesn\u2019t get any better for him. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio all will vote next Tuesday \u2013 and Biden is a favorite in all four. (Sanders lost all four states to Clinton in 2016.) If Sanders loses those four states again, he will effectively be so far behind Biden in the delegate chase that catching up is out of the question So then what? And if Sanders sees all of that coming down the line, does he stay in the race for another week only to suffer a series of likely embarrassments? His decision not to address supporters at all on Tuesday night suggests he may see the end is here. * Donald Trump: It doesn\u2019t take a super genius \u2013 like Dr. John Trump! \u2013 to understand that the President would rather run against Sanders than Biden this fall. Trump and his surrogates have done everything they can to stoke the unproven conspiracy theory that the Democratic establishment has somehow conspired against Sanders to keep him from the nomination. And within the last few days, Trump\u2019s forces have begun to work overtime to suggest that Biden isn\u2019t mentally up to the race for president. None of that is a coincidence. Nominating Biden is no guarantee that Democrats will retake the White House this fall. But polling suggests Biden runs very strongly against Trump in the key Midwestern states that will almost certainly decide who wins this fall. And Biden is now almost certain to be the nominee, which is plain bad news for Trump\u2019s chances. * Contested convention fans: Right up until the South Carolina primary on February 29, the odds of a convention in which no candidate would have enough delegates to claim the nomination on the first ballot were going up, up, up. Then Biden won South Carolina. And stunned Sanders on Super Tuesday. And very nearly finished the job on Super Tuesday II. Now the chances of a contested convention are roughly equivalent to my chances of being elected People\u2019s Sexiest Man of the Year in 2020. Fun fact: The last time there was a contested Democratic convention was 1952 \u2013 when Adlai Stevenson was eventually chosen as the nominee on the third ballot. * Political junkies who love \u201cThe Bachelor:\u201d It was a nightmare of timing for these folks. The live finale of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d up against the night that Biden effectively seals the nomination. It was like election night being on the same night as the Super Bowl. Or as a Georgetown Big East tournament game. (Hoyas vs. St. Johns on Wednesday at 7 p.m.!)",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is marching to the Democratic presidential nomination. The former vice president handily defeated Bernie Sanders on Tuesday in Michigan\u2019s primary \u2013 halting the Vermont senator\u2019s hopes of a comeback in the state where he\u2019d stunned Hillary Clinton four years ago. Biden also notched massive wins in Idaho, Mississippi and Missouri. Sanders won in North Dakota. Washington hadn\u2019t been called yet, but as of Wednesday morning, Biden was in a tight race there with Sanders, another state Sanders needed to win. Tuesday marked a clear turning point in the Democratic race. Biden is building a powerful coalition of African Americans, suburbanites and rural white voters who previously backed Sanders, while Sanders is failing to produce the electorate-changing turnout of young voters that he\u2019s promised. Democratic figures, from one-time 2020 candidate Andrew Yang to the party\u2019s biggest super PAC, Priorities USA, lined up behind Biden after his Michigan win. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden and Sanders are scheduled to debate Sunday night in Arizona. But Sanders is entering a brutal stretch, with primaries next week in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio \u2013 all states he lost in 2016. There\u2019s also the reality that coronavirus could crowd Sanders out of national headlines and make it impossible for him to leverage something that separates him from Biden: his ability to turn out massive crowds at rallies. It all makes a comeback even more difficult. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s contests: Speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Biden delivered a message of Democratic unity, extending an olive branch to Sanders and his supporters \u2013 almost as if the Vermont senator had already exited the race. \u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\u201d Biden said. He echoed a common Sanders line on health care, touted their \u201ccommon goal\u201d and said they would work together to defeat Trump. It capped a 10-day stretch in which a largely counted out Biden completed one of the most sudden and dramatic reversals of fortune in modern political history. It started with his massive win in South Carolina\u2019s primary, built with his wins in 10 of the 15 Super Tuesday contests and was capped off with a victory over Sanders in Michigan, a crucial general election battleground. Biden has shown some vulnerabilities \u2013 most urgently, his lack of support from young voters. But he is also outperforming Clinton in the primary race with suburban and white working-class voters, giving Democrats a clear potential path to victory in November. Biden made clear Tuesday night he is eager to turn his attention to a general election match-up with President Donald Trump. Sanders, meanwhile, countered Biden\u2019s unity message with nothing at all. At home in Burlington, Vermont, he did not speak Tuesday night. Michigan delivered Sanders his best night of the 2016 primary, reviving his campaign as Clinton threatened to run away with the nomination. In 2020, the state might have done the opposite \u2013 beating down his campaign and opening the path for Biden to break clear in the delegate race. Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan is both a mathematical and psychological wound. For years now, Sanders and his supporters have pointed to the state, and his success there, as evidence that he would have defeated Trump in 2016 \u2013 and would if given the chance now. The Vermont senator didn\u2019t run away from the stakes; instead, he ran toward them, canceling a trip to Mississippi in order spend more time in Michigan, which he repeatedly called \u201cthe most important state\u201d voting on Tuesday. But the added time did not add up to a better-than-expected result. Biden, like he did in Missouri and Mississippi, grew his support and delegate lead. And just like after the former vice president won in South Carolina, he also got a boost from some of the party\u2019s biggest names, who argued that the race is over and Sanders should acknowledge as much. The Sanders campaign has rejected any suggestion that he might consider dropping out any time soon \u2013 and certainly not before Sunday night\u2019s debate \u2013 but those hopes could soon be replaced by a colder calculus. \u201cHe\u2019ll debate,\u201d a Sanders aide said of his upcoming showdown with Biden in Arizona on Sunday night. The aide wouldn\u2019t go any further. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a prominent supporter of Biden\u2019s, minced no words as the results ticked in on Tuesday night. \u201cI think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination,\u201d Clyburn said on NPR. \u201cAnd quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down. It is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates.\u201d Clyburn put in the most direct terms a growing sentiment inside much of the Democratic Party: Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination was closed Tuesday night, and it\u2019s time for him to leave the race. \u201cI hereby am endorsing Joe Biden,\u201d former 2020 candidate Andrew Yang said on CNN Tuesday night. \u201cBernie was an inspiration for me, inspired my run. But the math says Joe is our prohibitive nominee. We need to bring the party together.\u201d And the broader Democratic apparatus began coalescing around Biden, too \u2013 led by Priorities USA, the party\u2019s largest super PAC. \u201cThe math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s head, tweet after Michigan was called. \u201cI hope others will join us in the fight.\u201d The last two weeks have showed that Biden is continuing to surge in the suburbs, where a major realignment that handed Democrats the House in 2018 is now benefitting the former vice president. The wins began on Super Tuesday in the suburbs around Dallas and Houston in Texas, as well as in northern Virginia outside Washington, DC. In Minnesota, Biden \u2013 buoyed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s endorsement \u2013 dominated around Minneapolis and St. Paul. That trend appears to have continued on Tuesday night. Biden, with 87% of the vote counted, had already garnered over 138,000 votes in Oakland County, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Four years ago, Clinton won Oakland County but with only 92,000 votes, a key reason that she lost the state to Sanders. The same is true in Macomb County, another Detroit suburb. With 71% of the votes counted, Biden is leading Sanders easily and has already won 58,000 votes. Clinton narrowly won the county in the primary with just under 48,000 votes in 2016. \u201cBiden\u2019s success in the suburbs \u2013 appealing to the base and crossover voters \u2013 closely follows what worked in 2018,\u201d said Meredith Kelly, a veteran Democratic operative who was a top staffer at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. \u201cIf Joe Biden wins the states where we won the House popular vote in the midterms, then it\u2019s game over for Trump.\u201d Since 2016, Sanders has made a concerted effort to broaden his base. In some ways, he has been successful. Latinos powered his signature win in Nevada and became perhaps most reliable constituency. But in South Carolina, on Super Tuesday and again in this week\u2019s primaries, he lost badly in African-American communities. In Mississippi, it\u2019s possible Sanders will not meet the 15% total required to collect a single at-large delegate. The numbers out of Mississippi will be jarring to the Sanders campaign, even if they were prepared to lose the state. In an electorate that was nearly two-thirds African American, according to exit polls, Biden outpaced Sanders by a 6-to-1 margin. Biden\u2019s strength with African American voters was evident in Missouri and Michigan, too, where the former vice president leads comfortably handily in Wayne and Genesee Counties, home to Detroit and Flint respectively. Sanders had four years to make inroads with African American voters, especially the older ones. He seemed to be on his way. Until the voting began.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden dashed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 hopes of igniting a comeback and moved into a dominant position in the Democratic nomination battle with a run of impressive victories on Tuesday night. Biden raised the first doubts about Sanders\u2019 future in the race when he pulled off a crushing victory in the key Midwest swing state of Michigan, to add to earlier victories in Missouri and Mississippi on a night of six contests. He added Idaho to his haul early on Wednesday morning, and Sanders won in North Dakota, CNN projects. His big night cranked up the pace of his hot streak that started when he rescued a misfiring campaign in South Carolina and swept to massive wins on Super Tuesday last week. The former vice president\u2019s formidable performance is likely to take his campaign, which is now consolidating almost all of the party\u2019s major power centers with the exception of the Sanders progressive wing, from strength to strength. Sanders\u2019 vow to pull off a democratic socialist revolution now looks in serious doubt amid fears that he is too radical to beat President Donald Trump in a general election. One reason for that is that the Biden victory appears to badly damage Sanders\u2019 narrative that his strengths among working class and younger voters could take him to the Democratic nomination and make him the best possible candidate to take on Trump. Four years ago, Sanders narrowly won the Great Lakes State over Hillary Clinton, but he was heading for a massive defeat this time around. With 85% of the vote counted in Michigan, Biden leads by more than 160,000 votes. Biden stretched his lead in the delegate count to more than 100, not yet halfway through a month that includes a string of contests that look favorable to his campaign. The proportional rules used in the Democratic primary make it very tough for a candidate to bounce back after falling behind in the delegate race. Biden reached out to Sanders\u2019 supporters as the Vermont senator reached a moment of decision about the future of his campaign. \u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,\u201d Biden said in a muted but forceful victory speech at Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitution Center after his planned Ohio rally was called off due to the coronavirus emergency. \u201cWe share a common goal and together we will defeat Donald Trump. We will defeat him together. We are going to bring this nation together,\u201d Biden said. Still, Sanders has a fundraising juggernaut and can stay in the race as long as he likes. He also has a track record from 2016 that suggests he may be determined to fight on for the policy platform he has been promoting for almost all of his life. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for 2020 news The story in Michigan was similar to the one the former vice president engineered on Super Tuesday. Biden\u2019s support among African American voters in urban areas and suburban white voters appears not just to be overwhelming Sanders but could be a good sign as Democrats try to take back Michigan and other Midwestern swing states on Election Day. Earlier Tuesday, the former vice president stacked up two more wins in Mississippi \u2013 where his strength among African American voters paved the way to victory \u2013 and the Midwestern battleground of Missouri, CNN projects. Biden\u2019s victory confirmed his strength among African American voters in Southern states and gives him bragging rights in a heartland tussle. Tuesday\u2019s races, which also include primaries in Washington state and caucuses in North Dakota, are taking place against the increasingly grim backdrop of the worsening coronavirus crisis. Both Biden and Sanders canceled planned election night rallies in another key state, Ohio, that goes to the polls next week. The former vice president plans instead to give an address without an audience at Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitution Center. The contest in Washington was too early to call Wednesday morning. Officials in Super Tuesday II states were disinfecting polling booths in an effort to prevent further infections from the novel coronavirus. Luckily, the primary in Washington state, one of the worst hit regions, mostly involves mail-in ballots. Officials still cautioned voters not to lick the envelopes containing their ballots. Biden\u2019s run of victories, and his dominant performance in Michigan especially, left Sanders facing existential questions about his campaign. Sanders flew back home to Burlington and there was silence from his camp, with the Vermont senator electing not to give a speech as results came in. His campaign has been losing steam ever since he won the New Hampshire primary and the Nevada caucuses in February, that at the time looked like they might set him on a glide path to the nomination. But Sanders\u2019 success in those contests may ultimately have sown the seeds of his eventual demise. Rising expectations that he could win the primary race appeared to be the trigger that convinced more moderate Democratic candidates like former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to quit the race and line up behind Biden. A top Sanders surrogate \u2013 progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2013 said there was no way to dress up Sanders\u2019 night. \u201cThere\u2019s no sugar-coating it \u2013 tonight\u2019s a tough night. Tonight\u2019s a tough night for the movement overall,\u201d she said during a livestream on Instagram. Still, Sanders has a fundraising juggernaut and can stay in the race as long as he likes. He also has a track record from 2016 that suggests he may be determined to fight on for the policy platform he has been promoting for almost all of his life. He is due to take on Biden in a CNN debate \u2013 that will now take place without an audience owing to the coronavirus crisis \u2013 on Sunday night in Arizona. Sanders knew that Tuesday could be a disappointing night, advisers said, but he did not expect such a crushing defeat in Michigan. He was counting on the state to revive his campaign and show that his coalition could grow. \u201cThis was his path. Tonight was his path,\u201d one top adviser said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Advisers are not certain what will come next, telling CNN that it\u2019s a decision that the senator and his wife, Jane Sanders, will make together. But the adviser said Sanders is still intent on debating Biden on Sunday. After that, it\u2019s an open question, with a tough road of primaries ahead in the coming weeks. After Biden\u2019s big wins over the last two weeks, Michigan became a pivotal race \u2013 for the front-runner to demonstrate his new strength is genuine and for Sanders to put a stake in the ground and regroup after a run of defeats. The first big Midwest swing state to vote in the Democratic race ought to have been home turf for Sanders given his strong connection to working class white voters and his populist message on trade. Such a recipe helped Trump become the first Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988 to capture the state as he headed to the White House in 2016. Yet Biden also has a long history and connections in the state, and has been lifted by the consolidation of the moderate Democratic field around him since his South Carolina triumph. Michigan will hand out 125 pledged delegates on Tuesday night, the most on offer on the second Super Tuesday. The former Delaware senator was part of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential ticket that won Michigan twice. He\u2019s touted his role in securing a bailout during the Great Recession that saved iconic auto giants that are major employers, and have tributary supply chains, throughout the state. Biden is banking on a coalition of African American voters in cities like Detroit and suburban college educated white voters. Joe Biden confronted on gun control by auto plant worker But recent results have also seen him increasing his share of other white voters, and he has a legacy of tight ties with labor unions \u2013 a traditionally strong Michigan constituency \u2013 that could help him move onto Sanders\u2019 turf. This story has been updated with developments throughout the night. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The one-on-one showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders begins Tuesday with a test of the candidates\u2019 ability to win in the crucial general election battleground state of Michigan. The state, along with Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington, all vote on the second Super Tuesday of the primary. Biden is expected to dominate in Mississippi, where African American voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate, and is looking to perform well in Missouri. Sanders is aiming to keep the delegate race close, though, with wins out West. But the biggest battleground is Michigan. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Four years ago, Sanders outperformed polls that showed him trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits there, delivering a stunning win that would prolong the Democratic presidential race. This time, it\u2019s Biden who is entering primary day with a double-digit edge in a spate of new polls. If Biden wins, the race is scheduled to shift to a set of states that look even more favorable for him next Tuesday \u2013 Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio \u2013 putting him in position to lock in a lead that would be all but impossible for Sanders to overcome. If Sanders wins, it would slow Biden\u2019s momentum and reset the race\u2019s narrative, suggesting Democrats are in for another drawn-out slugfest where every delegate matters. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s contests: If Biden can win Tuesday in Michigan, he\u2019ll undercut Sanders\u2019 central argument about his electability and leave his rival with very little time to correct course. Biden knows it. He showed Monday that he\u2019s looking to land a knockout punch \u2013 one that could be the beginning of the end of Sanders\u2019 campaign. Biden rushed two former rivals, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, to campaign with him in Michigan. He also campaigned with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who beat a Sanders-backed primary foe in 2018, and moderate female members of Congress who were part of the party\u2019s midterm wave. After Tuesday, nearly half the Democratic pledged delegates will have been awarded. A week later, after contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, that\u2019ll jump to 61%. They\u2019ll debate on CNN this Sunday night \u2013 but otherwise, it\u2019s not clear how Sanders would slow Biden down. Biden has the same advantages with African American voters that Clinton possessed four years ago. But exit polls from Super Tuesday show that he\u2019s built on Clinton\u2019s coalition by dominating with suburbanites who have flocked to the Democratic Party in the Trump era and by winning with non-college educated women. He\u2019s also closed the gap with Sanders among non-college educated men. That rapid consolidation behind Biden was part of a 72-hour burst of momentum between his blowout primary win in South Carolina and victories on Super Tuesday. This Tuesday\u2019s primaries will test whether it has held. Sanders isn\u2019t running away from the fact that his performance on Tuesday in Michigan could be his campaign\u2019s defining test. Over the last week, he has repeatedly described it as \u201cthe most important state,\u201d and his itinerary, which was changed to include more time there at Mississippi\u2019s expense, backed up his words. Sanders\u2019 biggest win this year came in Nevada, a state with a strong union presence and politically powerful Latino community. Sanders is hoping that Michigan, with its organized labor might and a politically powerful Muslim American community, will break the same way. But the dynamics of the race have changed since late February, when Sanders was cruising down the primary\u2019s progressive lane and the moderates were backed up to his right. Then came South Carolina and the Biden surge. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out last Thursday, but she has withheld her support and there is no indication \u2013 regardless of her decision \u2013 that her supporters should be counted on to rally behind Sanders. It is difficult to look past the increasingly daunting poll numbers, but Sanders is fighting on and getting some late boosts \u2013 first, from Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Civil Rights leader who endorsed him on Sunday morning. Jackson and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared with Sanders over the weekend. On Monday morning, Sanders got the backing of the progressive Working Families Party, which initially endorsed Warren. On Sunday night, Sanders gave a more expansive speech than is his normal fare. He talked about Jackson and Ocasio-Cortez, both progressive lightning bolts of their times, and said that in having them at his side, at different events but on the same day, \u201cWe see the arc of justice that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. talked about.\u201d Jackson won in Michigan during his historic 1988 presidential run. Afterward, the Democratic Party establishment rallied around then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Sanders, after his sweep of Nevada, could be staring down the same fate. Another reason Michigan is so crucial Tuesday is that it will test Democratic voters\u2019 views of free trade in a manufacturing state that\u2019s crucial in November\u2019s general election. Sanders was successful in hammering Clinton over the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted under former President Bill Clinton, in union-heavy, auto-industry-dependent Michigan in 2016. He\u2019s running the same playbook against Biden, blasting him for voting for NAFTA in TV ads and stump speeches. But things have changed: Trump renegotiated the deal and rebranded it as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The Sanders campaign\u2019s working theory is that blue-collar voters aren\u2019t following their leadership on this issue and remain opposed to the trade deal. That theory proved true in Nevada on a different issue, when Culinary Union members largely caucused for him despite the union leadership opposing his Medicare for All plan. If Sanders is right, and drastically outperforms the polls again in Michigan, it would quickly carve out his path forward: Through two more Midwestern manufacturing states, Illinois and Ohio, next week; then Wisconsin in early April; then Pennsylvania in late April. If he\u2019s wrong, it would be an indicator that the issue isn\u2019t swaying the Democratic electorate away from Biden. Even if he loses Michigan, Biden could end the day with more delegates than Sanders \u2013 due in part to Mississippi. The state possesses just 36 pledged delegates. That\u2019s far fewer than Michigan\u2019s 125, Washington\u2019s 89 and Missouri\u2019s 68. But the state\u2019s primary electorate is largely African American \u2013 and Biden has won overwhelmingly with black voters in the south. Sanders canceled plans to visit Jackson, Mississippi, over the weekend, instead focusing on Michigan \u2013 a tacit acknowledgment that a Biden blowout there is all but certain. Mississippi is an insurance policy for the former vice president, giving him a delegate cushion even if Sanders surprises Biden elsewhere. Sanders defeated Clinton in Washington state by more than 45 points in 2016. He won in Idaho by nearly 57. This time around, things will be different \u2013 by definition. Both states have ditched their caucuses in favor of a more straightforward primary voting process. The change is expected to hurt Sanders, even if he wins the states. Caucuses were especially kind to Sanders in 2016, allowing him to rack up significant delegate tallies that primaries don\u2019t often allow. They are also more appealing, traditionally, to the most ideological and motivated voters. Sanders\u2019 supporters are not as ideologically uniform as some believe, and caucuses can be a hassle for the working class voters he is after, but there is no questioning the dedication of much of Sanders\u2019 support. Fewer caucuses could, in the end, mean fewer delegates for the Vermont senator this time around. CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is again looking to Michigan to save his presidential bid. Just as suddenly as the Democratic race narrowed to a one-on-one showdown between the Vermont senator and former Vice President Joe Biden, it\u2019s brought a primary that Sanders needs to win \u2013 or his path to the Democratic nomination could quickly evaporate. \u201cEvery state is terribly important, and I think coming Tuesday, maybe Michigan is the most important state,\u201d Sanders told reporters Friday in Detroit. Four years ago, Sanders\u2019 stunning victory in Michigan slowed Hillary Clinton\u2019s march to the party\u2019s nomination and foreshadowed a struggle with working-class voters across the upper Midwest that would ultimately lead to President Donald Trump\u2019s election. Tuesday\u2019s primary in the state will now test the ability of Sanders and Biden to win in a crucial general election battleground. It comes as the primary calendar turns toward states that appear to be more favorable to Biden. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio \u2013 all large states where Clinton beat Sanders in 2016 \u2013 are voting next week, increasing the urgency for Sanders to deliver a trajectory-changing win in Michigan on Tuesday. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race For Sanders, though, Michigan is also about something more fundamental than delegate math: The state cuts to the core of his mythos \u2013 that he possesses a unique connection with the disaffected working-class voters who have abandoned Democrats in droves. Owing to its must-win status, Sanders canceled plans to visit Mississippi, which also holds a primary Tuesday \u2013 along with Idaho, Missouri, Washington and North Dakota\u2019s caucuses \u2013 and could hand Biden a delegate lead that day, no matter what happens elsewhere. Instead, Sanders traveled early to Michigan to make his stand, with plans to hold four rallies in three days in a bid to recapture the momentum he\u2019d built there four years ago. Much has changed since 2016, though. Michigan in 2018 elected one of the first two Muslim women to Congress with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a prominent Sanders ally. But it also rejected a Sanders-endorsed Democratic gubernatorial candidate in favor of a more moderate primary candidate, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is now a co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign. The Detroit suburbs have become part of a national realignment, with two moderate Democrats flipping GOP-held House seats there in the midterms. Garlin Gilchrist, Michigan\u2019s lieutenant governor and the first African American to hold the position, said he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary \u2013 but endorsed and is campaigning with Biden this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a different race. It\u2019s a different candidate. Joe Biden wasn\u2019t on the ballot. There wasn\u2019t an appearance of someone who had come through for the people of Michigan in such specific and direct ways,\u201d Gilchrist said. Kamala Harris endorses Joe Biden for president Lori Goldman, the founder of Michigan\u2019s Fems for Dems, a grassroots group with more than 7,000 members in the Detroit suburbs, said she\u2019d been \u201cidealistic\u201d and excited about the prospect of electing a woman president in 2016. But now, she\u2019s just worried about defeating Trump. \u201cI\u2019m no longer idealistic. I want Trump gone, and if George Bush were running again, I would vote for him if he was the only one I had available to vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a violence that we\u2019ve lived these last four years.\u201d Goldman said members of her group largely backed female candidates \u2013 but now that all but Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have dropped out of the Democratic race, most are supporting Biden. Her observation reflects the demographic advantages that catapulted Biden to 10 wins in the 15 states and territories that voted on Super Tuesday. He won among suburban voters and dominated among African Americans. He also won or fought Sanders to parity among white voters without college degrees, winning in most states among women while Sanders fared better with men. The group was key to Sanders\u2019 2016 Michigan primary win, when he defeated Clinton among white voters without a college degree by 15 percentage points, exit polls showed. But in the first Midwestern battleground to vote in the 2020 primary, Minnesota, Biden bested Sanders among that same group by 12 points on Tuesday. To win in Michigan, Sanders will have to undo some of Biden\u2019s advantages in short order. His aides and allies argue he\u2019ll appeal more strongly to African American voters in Michigan than he did in the South, where he has all but given up on Mississippi despite an endorsement from Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, an emerging figure in Democratic politics. Sanders and Biden on Sunday were both touting potentially influential endorsements from black Democrats. California Sen. Kamala Harris, a one-time 2020 presidential candidate, announced her support for the former vice president and plans to campaign with him Monday night in Detroit. Meanwhile, 1988 Democratic presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. endorsed Sanders and appeared with him in Grand Rapids on Sunday. Jackson said Sanders had reached out and asked for his backing but Biden had not. Sanders had endorsed Jackson in 1988, the year Jackson won Michigan \u2013 a victory that consolidated the Democratic field and led to a one-on-one battle between Jackson and Michael Dukakis. Sanders\u2019 campaign also got an endorsement late last week from Detroit Action, an organization that advocates for people of color and workers in Michigan\u2019s largest city. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more grassroots energy just around issues in Detroit,\u201d said Justin Onwenu, a community organizer in Detroit who supports Sanders. \u201cThere are a lot of systematic problems that have gone unchecked for such a long time. That\u2019s kind of the narrative around the Rust Belt.\u201d Sanders could also benefit from an organizational advantage. His staffers and volunteer army have been at work in Michigan much longer than Biden\u2019s campaign, which a little more than a week ago, amid a string of losses, looked like it might not last until the state\u2019s primary. Biden is touting a rapidly growing list of endorsements in Michigan, including Whitmer, Gilchrist, Reps. Elissa Slotkin, Haley Stevens and Brenda Lawrence and a slew of mayors. He\u2019s dispatched surrogates, including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, across the state to campaign for him. And Biden will hold rallies Monday in Grand Rapids and Detroit. But he doesn\u2019t have the grassroots firepower of Sanders. Goldman said she\u2019d gotten a phone call from an Oakland County commissioner on Friday looking for information on how to volunteer for Biden\u2019s campaign. The commissioner and others have told her, \u201cwe don\u2019t know where to go, we don\u2019t know who to call,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, she\u2019d received several text messages in recent days from Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cBiden\u2019s campaign is literally like a phantom campaign,\u201d Onwenu said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that to say that he\u2019s not going to be able to pull together a coalition, but I do think he\u2019s operating on goodwill.\u201d Jesse Jackson endorses Bernie Sanders for president That organizational disparity could turn into votes. So far, 925,140 absentee ballots had been requested and 597,667 were already returned, the Michigan secretary of state\u2019s office said Friday \u2013 though the office didn\u2019t say how many of those were Democratic or Republican ballots. There were 1.2 million votes cast in the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary. And 20,388 people, as of Friday morning, had asked their county clerks to \u201cspoil\u201d their already returned absentee ballots \u2013 effectively scrapping their initial votes and giving them a do-over. Some of those voters could have backed candidates who dropped out of the race. That Michigan allows such do-overs means it\u2019s likely there are people who voted for now-departed candidates and could be won over by Sanders or Biden \u2013 if they can convince them to vote a second time. Still, Biden\u2019s allies insist that even with a late start, his momentum is enough to carry him Tuesday. \u201cEarly on, a lot of minds were not made up. Now, their minds are made up,\u201d said Stevens, the freshman Democratic congresswoman. \u201cI can see it. I know it. He has got the momentum headed into Tuesday, and he is going to win the state of Michigan.\u201d Stevens \u2013 who was chief of staff of the Obama administration\u2019s auto bailout, and recently endorsed Biden after previously backing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 also argued Biden has a unique advantage in Michigan as the vice president in an administration that rescued the industry. She said that history will allow Biden to run on a message that mirrors how Democrats won House seats in Michigan in the midterm elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve got hundreds of thousands of people who are employed in this incredible industry, and Joe Biden is their advocate. That\u2019s what people in Michigan are energized by and that\u2019s what they\u2019re responding to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s frankly what I did when I was campaigning in 2018 in flipping a district that hadn\u2019t been won by a Democrat since before we landed on the moon.\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign has hammered Biden in recent days over his record on Social Security and his support for free trade bills, including the North American Free Trade Agreement and its new iteration, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, on Friday told reporters Biden is a \u201clongtime friend and ally\u201d but said the former vice president \u201chas some explaining to do with our members, especially around the issue of trade.\u201d Biden\u2019s allies point out that the new trade pact got support from some labor unions and Michigan Democrats. But Sanders\u2019 campaign argues that Michigan has felt the acute pain of free trade deals for decades \u2013 and that just like Culinary Union members did in the Nevada caucuses, union members and working-class voters will break from their leadership. \u201cThe thing that destroyed my entire town \u2013 oh, now, it\u2019ll only destroy a whole block? Good job,\u201d Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders aide in Michigan, said sarcastically of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that replaced NAFTA. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like New Coke. You\u2019re not building off an old brand that everyone loves,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re building off the single largest s*** sandwich that\u2019s ever been served to Michigan.\u201d Sanders\u2019 television ads in Michigan focus on trade and Social Security. One uses Biden\u2019s own words, featuring audio of the then-Delaware senator saying in 1995 that his calls to \u201cfreeze federal spending\u201d included Social Security. The Biden campaign\u2019s response has been to point to 2016. The former vice president\u2019s aides and allies in recent days have blamed Sanders for a divisive primary against Hillary Clinton, saying it cost the party the general election against Donald Trump \u2013 and that Sanders is doing it again. \u201cNegative ads will only help Donald Trump. It\u2019s time we bring our party together,\u201d a narrator says at the end of a new Biden ad that says Biden will protect Social Security and increase its benefits.

            "article_content": "Suddenly on a collision course, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are sharpening their attacks and looking to build out their bases of support as a new phase of what could be a lengthy and bitter battle for the Democratic presidential nomination commences. The former vice president followed his Super Tuesday triumph with a victory lap in Los Angeles on Wednesday, telling reporters his \u201cpositive, progressive\u201d vision was \u201cresonating all over the country,\u201d as his campaign reminded reporters of Sanders\u2019 role in a divisive 2016 primary. At home in Burlington, meanwhile, the Vermont senator said he likes Biden and considers him a \u201cvery decent human being,\u201d but that \u201cJoe and I have a very different voting record\u201d \u2013 on issues like Social Security and the Iraq war \u2013 that he planned to air out in the coming days and weeks. He also again described Biden\u2019s campaign as being \u201cheavily supported by the corporate establishment.\u201d \u201cSo what does it mean when you have a campaign which is funded very significantly by the wealthy and the powerful?\u201d Sanders asked. \u201cDoes anyone seriously believe that a president backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and lower income people desperately need?\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Super Tuesday took what had for more than a year been an unwieldy and crowded field of candidates and effectively stripped it down to its final contestants, beginning what could be a months-long duel between Biden and Sanders. Their feisty messaging on Wednesday gave voters a taste of the political combat to come. Democrats fear a 2016 repeat in 2020 But both Biden and Sanders enter their one-on-one battle with work to do in winning over the voters who have so far shunned them \u2013 either in favor of the other or\u00a0candidates no longer in the race. Biden\u2019s 10 wins out of 15 contests Tuesday came on a wave of momentum powered by his victory in South Carolina and a trio of endorsements from former primary rivals, but little else. He\u2019d spent just $2.2 million on ads, less than 1% of Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s outlay, had nowhere near Sanders\u2019 ground game, and had not even campaigned in six of the states he won. Exit polls showed that half the voters who made up their minds in the last few days backed Biden, an indicator that the post-South Carolina exits of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who announced their decisions to back Biden on Monday, along with former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, sent a wave of late support Biden\u2019s way. Nearly a week into March, Biden is still honing a message that at times drifts away from his core theme: restoring the \u201csoul of the nation.\u201d Meanwhile, his campaign is still scrambling to scale up to a national effort. Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield acknowledged on a call with reporters Wednesday that staff changes are coming, but downplayed the likelihood of major directional shifts. \u201cThere will certainly be additions to our campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we see it as addition, not subtraction.\u201d The questions and doubts now confronting Sanders are in many cases the inverse of those facing Biden. Sanders has a robust national operation and a clear, progressive populist message, but while there is diversity in his support, he has yet to expand the electorate to the extent he hoped \u2013 and promised. Young voters, exit polls show, have made up a much smaller portion of the electorate than Sanders had hoped, and in some key states new voters backed Biden over Sanders. Sanders on Wednesday acknowledged his struggles, saying, \u201cWe have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process. It is not easy.\u201d Young voters, Latinos and liberals make up the core of his dedicated base, but suburbanites, especially from more affluent enclaves, and older African Americans, among the most potent forces in Democratic politics, are breaking decisively for Biden. Sanders\u2019 team has been largely successful in coalescing the progressive, grassroots working class groups they view as the heartbeat of their campaign. But they have run into a roadblock in their efforts to win over uncommitted, persuadable party leaders. \u201cThe Sanders campaign needs to figure out how to build their coalition,\u201d progressive strategist Rebecca Katz said of the hunt for new endorsements. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that that Joe Biden has a lot of folks coming home to him. Now the Bernie campaign has to think, who are the unlikely suspects that they can get?\u201d The issue, one source close to the campaign told CNN, might be Sanders himself, and the Vermont senator\u2019s unwillingness to step out of his comfort zone and engage in the kind of personal politicking he is known to dislike. \u201cI think a big part of what it could be doing, that he\u2019s not doing, is leaning into a lot of the stuff that makes him uncomfortable, which is obviously media and politics,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rejection of doing, the typical political game. Calling people, doing the work that needs to be done to get endorsements to get momentum.\u201d California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Sanders campaign co-chair, said that means engaging more deeply with some establishment figures that might not gravitate toward Sanders on their own \u2013 a need, Khanna told CNN, that Sanders understands is necessary. \u201cTalk to Democratic leaders and talk to nonprofit leaders and civic leaders and Civil Rights leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just the grassroots but the leaders, and say, you\u2019re going to have a seat at the table. We want to learn from you, we want to hear your perspective. We have the flexibility to build a broad coalition.\u201d Sanders might appreciate the imperative, but whether he has begun to take those steps remains unclear. He was gracious in talking about Klobuchar and Buttigieg after they dropped out, and invited supporters to join his own during a Super Tuesday eve rally in Minnesota, but New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Marianne Williamson are the only former 2020 rivals to endorse him. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s exit from the race on Thursday means Sanders will be desperate to secure her endorsement, which would provide a much-needed boost of adrenaline to his campaign. There\u2019s no guarantee Warren\u2019s personal support would mean her voters would flock to Sanders, but it would galvanize progressive groups and potentially earn Sanders a second look from the suburbanites he\u2019s struggled to capture. It could also give him a pathway for winning over Democrats who find his promise of political revolution an uncomfortable \u2013 and unnecessary \u2013 prospect. Sanders\u2019 stated desire to tear down the current Democratic establishment created an awkward juxtaposition on Wednesday, when he began airing an ad that feature him and former President Barack Obama \u2013 a giant in Democratic politics, but one that Sanders has sharply criticized in the past. When a reporter asked Biden about Sanders\u2019 comments suggesting the establishment was aligning itself to defeat him, Biden shot back that Sanders was diminishing the coalition that had fueled the former vice president\u2019s success in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday. \u201cThe establishment are all those hardworking middle-class people, those African Americans,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey are the establishment!\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign is also aggressively accusing Sanders of undermining Democrats, pinning blame on him for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss four years ago. Aides and allies had pre-butted Sanders earlier in the day, with Bedingfield telling reporters that \u201cwe\u2019ve seen, unfortunately, what kind of campaigns Bernie Sanders runs. We saw the impact that it had in 2016. He\u2019s up this morning with three new attack ads.\u201d Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Biden campaign co-chair, criticized Sanders for characterizing Biden\u2019s support as coming from the Democratic establishment, pointing to the former vice president\u2019s big margins of victory among African American voters. \u201cI just did not know that African Americans in the South were considered part of the establishment,\u201d Richmond said. Richmond said black voters \u201chave made a conscious decision that we fought and we earned civil rights through blood, sweat and tears, but it\u2019s going to be common sense that keeps those civil rights.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t divide this party like we did last time,\u201d Richmond said of Sanders\u2019 ads. Now, as the race narrows, the competition for donor dollars will also be heating up, with Sanders relying on small-dollar donors and Biden also anticipating an infusion of online dollars to bolster major donors who are now coming off the sidelines. Biden has seen an upswing in his lackluster fundraising numbers since his South Carolina revival. The Sanders campaign, which routinely posts massive hauls, said on Wednesday that it had raised $5.5 million since Tuesday, through more than 220,000 donations. Biden\u2019s campaign said it had raised more than $7 million on Tuesday and Wednesday. This story has been updated to reflect Warren exited the presidential race on Thursday.",

            "article_content": "A reinvigorated Joe Biden has a nine state Super Tuesday victory haul, capped by topping Sen. Bernie Sanders for an upset victory in Texas after his comeback campaign transformed the Democratic presidential race. Just four days ago, the former vice president\u2019s White House hopes were fading fast. Now, he has hugely overperformed expectations on the most critical night of the 2020 race so far and the duel for the nomination is becoming a head-to-head with the democratic socialist from Vermont. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for 2020 news Biden grabbed highly significant victories in Virginia and North Carolina early in the night that suggested he is building a robust coalition, and added wins across the South \u2013 where his strength among African American voters is a big advantage \u2013 in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to CNN projections. But he also took chunks out of territory that had been expected to lean to Sanders. He won Minnesota, CNN projects, suggesting that home state Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who quit the race Monday and endorsed him, may have played a pivotal role. He also upset Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, a massive blow to Warren in her home state. And in a late developing story, Sanders and Biden are neck-and-neck in Texas with 60% of the vote counted. Even if Sanders hangs on to a state his campaign expected to win, owing to his strong ties to Hispanic voters, the tight nature of race means he will not get the wide advantage in the delegate count for which he had hoped. Sanders is leading in California \u2013 the state with the most delegates on offer \u2013 though both Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could reach the viability threshold to win delegates and cut the size of his advantage. It all represents a stunning turnaround for a candidate who launched the first of his presidential campaigns 33 years ago but had to wait until Saturday night for a first career-saving victory in South Carolina, which appears to have unleashed a torrent of momentum rarely seen in any presidential cycle. \u201cFolks, things are looking awful good. For those that have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. Just a few days ago the press and the pundits declared the campaign dead!\u201d a pumped-up Biden roared to a crowd in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s looking good, so I\u2019m here to report we are very much alive. And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.\u201d Sanders held serve in his home state of Vermont and later added Colorado and Utah, and his aides are predicting that the picture will become rosier for the progressive champion as votes are counted in Texas and California \u2013 the states with the biggest delegate hauls. CNN exit polls show Sanders is the early leader in the Golden State. Biden and Sanders are also locked in a tight race in Maine. Sanders told a raucous crowd in his home state that his campaign was still on a roll on a night when a third of all pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July are on the ballot in 14 states. \u201cTonight I tell you with absolute confidence we are going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of this country,\u201d he said. Early Super Tuesday projections and results suggested a disappointing night could be in store for Bloomberg and  Warren, who both need to make a statement to have a rationale for staying in the race. As votes are counted, both rivals were looking to vault the 15% threshold needed to win delegates in several states. RELATED: How to watch Super Tuesday primaries Bloomberg got one piece of cheerful news, winning the territory of American Samoa to open his delegate count. Biden\u2019s big early wins enshrine one of the most remarkable comebacks in modern political history. A week ago, his campaign was running on empty after poor showings in the first three nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But a massive win in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary now appears to have triggered a rebound that appears to be expanding in the 14 states that voted on Tuesday. Virginia was seen as a significant test of Biden\u2019s strength against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is facing voters for the first time in the 14 nationwide primaries after a half-billion-dollar advertising blitz. The results in Alabama and North Carolina will confirm the former vice president\u2019s strength among African American and affluent suburban voters on whom he is basing his campaign. Sanders and Biden are the early leaders in Maine, and the two are also in the early lead in Massachusetts along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is hoping for a win in her home state. Since his thumping victory in South Carolina on Saturday, Biden has enjoyed one of the most impressive streaks by a modern presidential candidate. He\u2019s consolidated the center of his party after his sudden revival caused top rivals \u2013 former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2013 to quit and endorse him. Establishment Democrats are rushing to endorse him and the once-dry fundraising spigot is suddenly gushing. Chalian: Biden winning Virginia with these 2 factors From the moment polls closed on Tuesday, Biden began racking up wins. A mix of affluent suburban voters in the Washington suburbs and African American voters downstate was a good fit for Biden in Virginia, a battleground won twice by former President Barack Obama. But it was a state where Bloomberg had high hopes of making an impact, and Biden\u2019s success may be a bad omen for the financial data billionaire, whose entire campaign is premised on the idea that the former vice president cannot win the nomination. Biden\u2019s projected victory in North Carolina came from voters who decided in the last few days, black voters, and those who prefer a candidate who can beat Trump in November. CNN projects Biden will win Virginia and Sanders will win Vermont According to early exit polls, around 3 in 10 Democratic voters in North Carolina decided who to vote for in the last few days. Almost 3 in 5 of those voters supported Biden \u2013 suggesting that the departures of Buttigieg and Klobuchar helped consolidate voters behind the former vice president. Black voters voted for Biden in strong numbers in North Carolina, around 6 in 10.  In Alabama, Biden carried black voters, moderates and voters whose priority is to beat Trump in 2020. Democratic black voters in Alabama, who made up almost half of the electorate, supported Biden in huge numbers, around 7 in 10, according to early exit polls. Sanders trailed behind with 1 in 7 black voters, and Mike Bloomberg won around 1 in 10. In Texas, the second biggest prize of the night,  a quarter of Democratic primary voters only made up their minds in the last few days \u2013 and Biden drew 2 in 5 of those voters. But three quarters of those Texas Democrats decided who to support much earlier, and a third of those supported Sanders, the most of any candidate. In Minnesota, half of late-deciding voters went for Biden. There are 1,300 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, a third of the total delegates. A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on a first convention ballot. There are no winner-take-all states and any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote in a state will win delegates to July\u2019s convention in Milwaukee. RELATED: The Democrats\u2019 delegate rules, explained Polls in the 14 states started closing at 7 p.m. ET. Voting in California continues until 11 p.m. ET. Given the vast geographic span of the Super Tuesday Election Day, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a total picture of the situation at the end of the night. The Golden State could, for instance, take days or even weeks to sort out its delegate allocation. Sanders reacted to Buttigieg and Klobuchar coalescing around Biden by suggesting that the \u201cpolitical establishment is getting nervous\u201d while at a rally on Monday night on Klobuchar\u2019s home turf in Minnesota. ANALYSIS: Bernie Sanders\u2019 hidden Super Tuesday edge While calling Biden a \u201cdecent guy\u201d and a \u201cfriend,\u201d the Vermont senator savaged his former colleague\u2019s record on issues like China trade, bankruptcy laws, NAFTA and the war in Iraq. But Biden drove home his message that after a turbulent three years of Trump\u2019s administration, Americans are not looking for more disruption that he says would result from a Sanders win. \u201cMy message is people are not looking for revolution. They\u2019re looking for results. I have the most extensive, successful record of getting big things done and big things passed,\u201d Biden said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d But Warren warned that Biden\u2019s pitch was simply about restoring a political order that had spurned working class Americans. \u201cNominating someone who wants to restore the world before Donald Trump, when the status quo has been leaving more and more people behind for decades, is a big risk for our party and our country,\u201d Warren said at a rally in Los Angeles on Monday. As he waits to see how voters will embrace his campaign after skipping the first four nominating contests, Bloomberg took a shot at Warren, who blasted him in their debate encounters. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she\u2019s still in. Is she?\u201d Bloomberg said to CNN\u2019s Cristina Alesci. Asked how he expected to perform on Tuesday night, he added, \u201cI think we are going to do very well \u2013 looking forward to it.\u201d Warren and Bloomberg knew they had to have big nights to regain some momentum, but early returns from key states failed to give the news their campaigns needed. Still, both appeared set to keep pushing forward. Warren and her team knew they weren\u2019t having a good night, but a top Democrat close to the campaign said they are keeping their eyes \u2013 and pinning their fading hopes \u2013 on California. Two things will determine her future: whether she can be viable in Texas and whether she can show more strength in Massachusetts. Advisers told CNN she wants to stay in the race to be an alternative to Sanders and Biden, if this becomes a three-way contest. \u201cShe wants to be on the debate stage in Arizona as an alternative choice,\u201d the top Democrat close to the Warren campaign said, but added that the \u201cdelegate math is looking increasingly tough.\u201d Warren has no bundlers and big donors, so her advisers believe she is less beholden to calls to drop out. But she does need money, which will be difficult to raise if Tuesday is a major disappointment. Bloomberg took the stage for his first election night party of the 2020 cycle and quickly lowered expectations. \u201cAs the results come in, here is what is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible.\u201d He added: \u201cIn just three months, we have gone from 1% in the polls to be a contender for the Democratic nomination for President.\u201d The line from the former New York mayor reflects a reality setting in for Bloomberg\u2019s team: Tuesday night did not go as planned.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders could receive a big boost today from a powerful demographic dynamic, even as more party leaders consolidate to resist his candidacy. The groups that have most favored the senator from Vermont in the Democratic presidential race are much more widely distributed than the groups that have resisted him across the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday, an exclusive congressional district by district analysis has found. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Latinos and non-college-educated whites, who have tilted solidly toward Sanders, constitute a critical mass of the eligible voting age population in a much wider range of districts than, college-educated whites and African Americans, who have been more skeptical of him, according to the analysis of census data by the University of Southern California Program for Environmental and Regional Equity provided to CNN. Sanders is facing new headwinds this week, as a procession of party leaders have endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden following his commanding victory Saturday in South Carolina; that list includes former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both of whom endorsed Biden on Monday after quitting the race in the last 48 hours. But this demographic pattern could help Sanders reach the threshold for acquiring delegates in a wider range of districts than any of his rivals on Tuesday and reinforce his status as the front-runner in the contest, even after Biden\u2019s recovery in South Carolina and the consolidation behind him by many party leaders. In almost all states, Democrats distribute delegates to the party convention in July based on the results in individual congressional districts as well as the statewide totals; candidates need to reach a threshold of 15% of the vote in either to obtain any pledged delegates. In all, the 14 states voting today \u2013 from North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama in the Southeast to Texas and California in the Southwest \u2013 house 169 congressional districts. Beyond the competition for the delegates and momentum that come from statewide victories, the candidates in effect are conducting 169 separate elections today as they compete for delegates on a district-by-district basis. (In Texas, the delegates are awarded by state Senate districts, but the distributions of the different demographic groups across them are similar.) Campaigns must target their efforts \u201cnot just state by state,\u201d Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders, told me recently. \u201cIt is congressional district by congressional district. Particularly on Super Tuesday, we are looking at it as CD by CD.\u201d To understand the demographic composition of this sprawling battlefield, Justin Scoggins, the data manager for the USC program, analyzed individual responses to the census\u2019 2018 American Community Survey and then applied a data tool from Missouri Census Data Center to assign those individuals to specific congressional districts. That allowed him to calculate the demographic characteristics of the eligible voting-age citizens in individual congressional districts with greater detail than is usually available. 4 Democratic candidates. 6 major issues. Hear their promises The results of the USC analysis underscore why Sanders could be positioned to deliver a very strong performance today, if Biden\u2019s resounding victory in South Carolina, and the cascade of endorsements that followed on Monday, does not dislodge the demographic patterns of support for the candidates from the first four contests. Sanders has won a plurality of white voters without college degrees in each of the first states that have voted, according to election day surveys conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Sanders\u2019 advantage over Biden among those blue-collar whites has reached as high as 21 percentage points in New Hampshire and Nevada, though the former vice president closed the gap to just 5 points in South Carolina on Saturday, according to the exit poll. The USC analysis shows how important it is for Biden to continue shaving Sanders\u2019 advantage with that group. Whites without college degrees represent one-third or more of the eligible voting-age population in 100 of the 169 House districts voting on Super Tuesday; they compose 25% to 33% in another 25 of the districts, the USC analysis found. In all, that means they constitute at least 25% of eligible voters in nearly three-fourths of all the districts voting today. Manuel Pastor, a USC professor of sociology who\u2019s the director of the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity, says Sanders\u2019 connection with young voters has somewhat obscured his success at targeting some of the same working-class whites who were drawn to Trump\u2019s promises of political disruption. \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get lifted up enough is Sanders\u2019 strength with the non-college-educated voters,\u201d said Pastor, author of the recent book \u201cState of Resistance,\u201d which covers the Democratic rise to dominance in California. \u201cWhat Bernie is trying to do is reach to that same disaffected group of workers but continually couch it in a rhetoric of not blaming the other, trying to resist scapegoating, and target the billionaires. Whether or not this is going to be enough to win across the nation in a general election, particularly when there is opposition research brought to bear later on, is still up to debate. But [in the primary] he is running very well among a traditional Democratic demographic.\u201d By contrast, whites holding at least four-year college degrees, who have displayed considerably more resistance to Sanders so far, are not distributed nearly as broadly across the Super Tuesday states. Those college-plus whites represent a third or more of the eligible voters in just 21 of the 169 districts voting today, and 25% to 33% in another 40 of them. That means they constitute at least 25% of eligible voters in only a little over a third of the districts. That helps Sanders, because those well-educated voters have been among the Democratic constituencies most dubious of him. The senator did win them in Nevada, according to the entrance poll, but with only about one-fourth of their votes; he hasn\u2019t exceeded 21% of the vote among them in any of the other three states. Just as the non-college whites more favorable to Sanders are distributed more broadly on Super Tuesday than the college whites dubious of him, the senator will benefit from a similar pattern among minorities. Latino voters, who have preferred him so far, constitute a critical mass of population across a broader number of districts in the Southwest battlegrounds of California and Texas than African Americans, the foundation of Biden\u2019s candidacy, do in the Southeast battlegrounds voting today. As I\u2019ve written, the period from late February through mid-March is the moment of maximum Latino influence on the Democratic nominating process. That influence peaks on Super Tuesday. The USC analysis found that Latinos constitute one-third or more of the eligible voting-age population in 34 districts voting today, all of them in California and Texas; they also represent one-fourth to one-third of eligible voters in another dozen districts, again all in those two mega-states. In sum, Latinos constitute at least one-fourth of the eligible voters in about one-fourth of all the districts voting on Super Tuesday and more than half of the districts in California and Texas combined. And although the concentration isn\u2019t as great, Latinos also represent one-sixth to about one-fifth of the eligible voters in four of the seven districts in Colorado, which also votes today. That\u2019s all good news for Sanders, because the evidence indicates he has substantially expanded his support among Latinos from 2016, when Hillary Clinton carried about three-fifths of them, according to a CNN analysis of all the exit polls conducted that year. This year, he posted a commanding lead among Latinos in the Nevada entrance poll and polls have shown him leading among them as well in California and Texas. By contrast, African Americans represent a critical mass of the population in a much smaller number of congressional seats. Blacks constitute one-third or more of eligible voters in just 10 districts across Super Tuesday, comprising three in Texas, two in Alabama, two in Virginia, two in North Carolina and one in Tennessee. They reach 25% in just two other districts. In California, black voters represent at least 25% of the eligible voting population in just the South Central Los Angeles district representated by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (though they also come in just below that cutoff in Democratic Rep. Karen Bass\u2019 nearby district). For a variety of reasons, the groups favorable to Sanders could constitute a somewhat smaller share of the actual, rather than eligible, voters in these districts. College-educated whites consistently turn out to vote at higher rates than whites without degrees, according to census data, and the same is true for African Americans compared with Hispanics. And because whites without degrees have migrated toward the GOP so steadily in recent years \u2013 especially during the Donald Trump era \u2013 fewer of them may be inclined to participate in a Democratic primary. The reverse is true for college-educated whites, whose long-term movement toward the Democrats has accelerated in the Trump years. (Compared with 2016, whites with college degrees have increased their share of the vote in each of the first four 2020 contests except New Hampshire.) Yet even with those caveats, the substantial contrast in the distribution of these groups underscores short-term and long-term challenges for the candidates hoping to dislodge Sanders from his leading position, a group now clearly led by Biden. The short-term challenge is to minimize the delegate advantage Sanders is likely to amass on Super Tuesday, in particular across California and Texas. Both states are configured in a manner that almost perfectly matches Sanders\u2019 coalition. In California, Latinos and non-college whites combined represent a majority of the eligible voters in two-thirds of the districts and at least one-third of the eligible voters in fully 94% of them, according to the USC calculations. In Texas, those two groups represent a majority of the eligible voters in nearly four-fifths of the districts and make up at least one-third in all of them. One asset for Biden and the others chasing Sanders may be a regional variation in the preferences of Latino voters. In California, Pastor notes, Latinos tilt to the left, in part because of the heavy influence of powerful labor unions across the state \u2013 a dynamic similar to Nevada. But in Texas, a state without a strong labor presence, more Latinos have gravitated toward the center or even the right, Pastor notes. And that should help Biden compete among them in Texas more effectively than polls signal he\u2019s likely to do in California. \u201cLatinos in Texas have been tied to a more traditional politics, connected to elected officials, whereas in California the Labor-Latino alliance has been the driving force,\u201d Pastor said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of geographic nuance.\u201d The same variation, he notes, in turn could help Sanders contain his losses among African American voters. Biden\u2019s strength could peak among black voters in the Southeast steeped in the cradle of the civil rights movement, but it may not be quite as imposing elsewhere, Pastor predicts. In fact, in 2016 exit polls found that Sanders ran somewhat more competitively among African American voters in several of the Midwestern battlegrounds \u2013 including Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 than he did in the South. If survival is the Super Tuesday goal for Sanders\u2019 rivals, their long-term challenge is to blunt his strengths and consolidate his vulnerabilities among white voters. For Democrats, no question about the race may be more uncertain than how college-educated white voters will break if the race functionally reduces to a two-person contest between Sanders and Biden after today. Neither one has been especially well positioned with those voters, though Biden ran much better among them in South Carolina than in the first three states. Through the first contests, a substantial portion of those voters have gravitated toward Buttigieg, who quit the race on Sunday; Klobuchar, who followed him off the field on Monday; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has not finished higher than third in the first four contests. Even so, in such a two-person race, the key question may be whether Biden, who styles himself as \u201cmiddle-class Joe,\u201d can blunt, or overcome entirely, Sanders\u2019 advantage among working-class whites. Biden\u2019s camp is optimistic he can, and some unaligned Democratic operatives agree. \u201cBiden\u2019s roots and history and commitment with those voters, with the blue-collar voters, will help him here. As long as he\u2019s not wounded coming out of Super Tuesday, then he could potentially get his bounce back and in some ways rehabilitate his campaign,\u201d says Jeff Rusnak, a Democratic consultant based in Ohio, a state with a large number of blue-collar white voters. \u201cThere is an opportunity for that here. Whether he has the money or not to do that, that\u2019s the challenge. Right now, there is no media, no ground game being waged by them. The Bernie folks are everywhere; they do have a ground game.\u201d Still, Sanders\u2019 position has been especially strong, and Biden\u2019s catastrophically weak, among younger blue-collar whites. In each of the first four states, Sanders carried 50% to 61% of non-college whites younger than 45, according to an analysis of the exit polls by the CNN polling unit. Among those younger blue-collar whites, Biden carried just 5% in Nevada and New Hampshire, 7% in South Carolina and, incredibly, only 1% in Iowa. The former vice president has run more competitively with older blue-collar whites, but he\u2019s carried them only in South Carolina. The next stages of the calendar will minimize Sanders\u2019 advantages among Latinos: There are fewer states where they are a major component of the electorate, and in Florida, the largest of them, he could face a backlash among Cuban Americans for his positive comments about the late dictator Fidel Castro. But if Biden can\u2019t improve his performance among working-class whites, even solid African American support might not be enough for him to overtake Sanders in the big Midwestern battlegrounds impending on the March calendar, including Missouri, Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. After today, states with 123 total congressional districts will vote through the remainder of March. Whites without college degrees compose half or more of eligible voters in 60 of them and at least one-third in 94, according to the USC calculations. In a one-on-one race with Sanders, Biden likely wouldn\u2019t need to win most of those voters, given his strength with African Americans and the potential resistance to the senator among well-educated whites. But Biden can\u2019t let Sanders sustain the lopsided advantages the senator has posted among those working-class whites in the first four states. Tonight may be the first indication of whether the former vice president can begin closing that gap.",

            "article_content": "A reinvigorated Joe Biden has a nine state Super Tuesday victory haul, capped by topping Sen. Bernie Sanders for an upset victory in Texas after his comeback campaign transformed the Democratic presidential race. Just four days ago, the former vice president\u2019s White House hopes were fading fast. Now, he has hugely overperformed expectations on the most critical night of the 2020 race so far and the duel for the nomination is becoming a head-to-head with the democratic socialist from Vermont. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for 2020 news Biden grabbed highly significant victories in Virginia and North Carolina early in the night that suggested he is building a robust coalition, and added wins across the South \u2013 where his strength among African American voters is a big advantage \u2013 in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to CNN projections. But he also took chunks out of territory that had been expected to lean to Sanders. He won Minnesota, CNN projects, suggesting that home state Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who quit the race Monday and endorsed him, may have played a pivotal role. He also upset Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, a massive blow to Warren in her home state. And in a late developing story, Sanders and Biden are neck-and-neck in Texas with 60% of the vote counted. Even if Sanders hangs on to a state his campaign expected to win, owing to his strong ties to Hispanic voters, the tight nature of race means he will not get the wide advantage in the delegate count for which he had hoped. Sanders is leading in California \u2013 the state with the most delegates on offer \u2013 though both Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg could reach the viability threshold to win delegates and cut the size of his advantage. It all represents a stunning turnaround for a candidate who launched the first of his presidential campaigns 33 years ago but had to wait until Saturday night for a first career-saving victory in South Carolina, which appears to have unleashed a torrent of momentum rarely seen in any presidential cycle. \u201cFolks, things are looking awful good. For those that have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. Just a few days ago the press and the pundits declared the campaign dead!\u201d a pumped-up Biden roared to a crowd in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s looking good, so I\u2019m here to report we are very much alive. And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.\u201d Sanders held serve in his home state of Vermont and later added Colorado and Utah, and his aides are predicting that the picture will become rosier for the progressive champion as votes are counted in Texas and California \u2013 the states with the biggest delegate hauls. CNN exit polls show Sanders is the early leader in the Golden State. Biden and Sanders are also locked in a tight race in Maine. Sanders told a raucous crowd in his home state that his campaign was still on a roll on a night when a third of all pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July are on the ballot in 14 states. \u201cTonight I tell you with absolute confidence we are going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of this country,\u201d he said. Early Super Tuesday projections and results suggested a disappointing night could be in store for Bloomberg and  Warren, who both need to make a statement to have a rationale for staying in the race. As votes are counted, both rivals were looking to vault the 15% threshold needed to win delegates in several states. RELATED: How to watch Super Tuesday primaries Bloomberg got one piece of cheerful news, winning the territory of American Samoa to open his delegate count. Biden\u2019s big early wins enshrine one of the most remarkable comebacks in modern political history. A week ago, his campaign was running on empty after poor showings in the first three nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But a massive win in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary now appears to have triggered a rebound that appears to be expanding in the 14 states that voted on Tuesday. Virginia was seen as a significant test of Biden\u2019s strength against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is facing voters for the first time in the 14 nationwide primaries after a half-billion-dollar advertising blitz. The results in Alabama and North Carolina will confirm the former vice president\u2019s strength among African American and affluent suburban voters on whom he is basing his campaign. Sanders and Biden are the early leaders in Maine, and the two are also in the early lead in Massachusetts along with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is hoping for a win in her home state. Since his thumping victory in South Carolina on Saturday, Biden has enjoyed one of the most impressive streaks by a modern presidential candidate. He\u2019s consolidated the center of his party after his sudden revival caused top rivals \u2013 former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2013 to quit and endorse him. Establishment Democrats are rushing to endorse him and the once-dry fundraising spigot is suddenly gushing. Chalian: Biden winning Virginia with these 2 factors From the moment polls closed on Tuesday, Biden began racking up wins. A mix of affluent suburban voters in the Washington suburbs and African American voters downstate was a good fit for Biden in Virginia, a battleground won twice by former President Barack Obama. But it was a state where Bloomberg had high hopes of making an impact, and Biden\u2019s success may be a bad omen for the financial data billionaire, whose entire campaign is premised on the idea that the former vice president cannot win the nomination. Biden\u2019s projected victory in North Carolina came from voters who decided in the last few days, black voters, and those who prefer a candidate who can beat Trump in November. CNN projects Biden will win Virginia and Sanders will win Vermont According to early exit polls, around 3 in 10 Democratic voters in North Carolina decided who to vote for in the last few days. Almost 3 in 5 of those voters supported Biden \u2013 suggesting that the departures of Buttigieg and Klobuchar helped consolidate voters behind the former vice president. Black voters voted for Biden in strong numbers in North Carolina, around 6 in 10.  In Alabama, Biden carried black voters, moderates and voters whose priority is to beat Trump in 2020. Democratic black voters in Alabama, who made up almost half of the electorate, supported Biden in huge numbers, around 7 in 10, according to early exit polls. Sanders trailed behind with 1 in 7 black voters, and Mike Bloomberg won around 1 in 10. In Texas, the second biggest prize of the night,  a quarter of Democratic primary voters only made up their minds in the last few days \u2013 and Biden drew 2 in 5 of those voters. But three quarters of those Texas Democrats decided who to support much earlier, and a third of those supported Sanders, the most of any candidate. In Minnesota, half of late-deciding voters went for Biden. There are 1,300 delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, a third of the total delegates. A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination on a first convention ballot. There are no winner-take-all states and any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote in a state will win delegates to July\u2019s convention in Milwaukee. RELATED: The Democrats\u2019 delegate rules, explained Polls in the 14 states started closing at 7 p.m. ET. Voting in California continues until 11 p.m. ET. Given the vast geographic span of the Super Tuesday Election Day, it\u2019s unlikely there will be a total picture of the situation at the end of the night. The Golden State could, for instance, take days or even weeks to sort out its delegate allocation. Sanders reacted to Buttigieg and Klobuchar coalescing around Biden by suggesting that the \u201cpolitical establishment is getting nervous\u201d while at a rally on Monday night on Klobuchar\u2019s home turf in Minnesota. ANALYSIS: Bernie Sanders\u2019 hidden Super Tuesday edge While calling Biden a \u201cdecent guy\u201d and a \u201cfriend,\u201d the Vermont senator savaged his former colleague\u2019s record on issues like China trade, bankruptcy laws, NAFTA and the war in Iraq. But Biden drove home his message that after a turbulent three years of Trump\u2019s administration, Americans are not looking for more disruption that he says would result from a Sanders win. \u201cMy message is people are not looking for revolution. They\u2019re looking for results. I have the most extensive, successful record of getting big things done and big things passed,\u201d Biden said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d But Warren warned that Biden\u2019s pitch was simply about restoring a political order that had spurned working class Americans. \u201cNominating someone who wants to restore the world before Donald Trump, when the status quo has been leaving more and more people behind for decades, is a big risk for our party and our country,\u201d Warren said at a rally in Los Angeles on Monday. As he waits to see how voters will embrace his campaign after skipping the first four nominating contests, Bloomberg took a shot at Warren, who blasted him in their debate encounters. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize she\u2019s still in. Is she?\u201d Bloomberg said to CNN\u2019s Cristina Alesci. Asked how he expected to perform on Tuesday night, he added, \u201cI think we are going to do very well \u2013 looking forward to it.\u201d Warren and Bloomberg knew they had to have big nights to regain some momentum, but early returns from key states failed to give the news their campaigns needed. Still, both appeared set to keep pushing forward. Warren and her team knew they weren\u2019t having a good night, but a top Democrat close to the campaign said they are keeping their eyes \u2013 and pinning their fading hopes \u2013 on California. Two things will determine her future: whether she can be viable in Texas and whether she can show more strength in Massachusetts. Advisers told CNN she wants to stay in the race to be an alternative to Sanders and Biden, if this becomes a three-way contest. \u201cShe wants to be on the debate stage in Arizona as an alternative choice,\u201d the top Democrat close to the Warren campaign said, but added that the \u201cdelegate math is looking increasingly tough.\u201d Warren has no bundlers and big donors, so her advisers believe she is less beholden to calls to drop out. But she does need money, which will be difficult to raise if Tuesday is a major disappointment. Bloomberg took the stage for his first election night party of the 2020 cycle and quickly lowered expectations. \u201cAs the results come in, here is what is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible.\u201d He added: \u201cIn just three months, we have gone from 1% in the polls to be a contender for the Democratic nomination for President.\u201d The line from the former New York mayor reflects a reality setting in for Bloomberg\u2019s team: Tuesday night did not go as planned.

            "article_content": "As customers drifted in and out of Harun Coffee in the historically black neighborhood of Leimert Park in Los Angeles last week, John Rader, a 47-year-old chef, considered his choices in California\u2019s primary this Super Tuesday, wondering aloud whether he should bother voting at all. Four years ago in this center of black art, culture and black-owned businesses in Los Angeles, Hillary Clinton turned out long lines of excited black voters for her rally. This year, however, a number of black voters who spoke to CNN expressed ambivalence and indecision about the Democratic contenders, even as former Vice President Joe Biden has tried to claim President Barack Obama\u2019s mantle. \u201cBiden will never win\u201d in November, Rader said Friday between orders for lattes and chicken sandwiches, citing Biden\u2019s losses in the first three contests as an indication of likely failure in the general election. \u201cHe\u2019s too passive.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Just days later, Biden got the victory he needed in South Carolina on Saturday night, winning roughly three out of five black voters in the state that he has long called his firewall. The question now becomes whether he can carry that momentum into Super Tuesday, and garner similar support in other states. Several new polls in California, North Carolina and Texas underscore the often overlooked fact that the black vote is not a monolith. For decades, no bloc of voters has been more pivotal in determining the Democratic nominee than African Americans, particularly women. Though Saturday night\u2019s exit polls showed Biden winning them convincingly, in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary, interviews with more than two dozen African American voters in California, Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama \u2013 all of which vote on Tuesday \u2013 indicate that many black voters are uncertain about whether Biden has the staying power to beat President Donald Trump. The former vice president\u2019s convincing win on Saturday could change that, but he faces logistical challenges that could make it hard to capitalize on his momentum. Most notably, he has not put anywhere close to the same level of attention, investment or time into Super Tuesday states as he did in South Carolina, where his standing was bolstered by the last-minute endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn. The fight over black voters will be front and center as the contest now moves into bigger and more diverse states with sizable black populations. More than a quarter of the electorate in Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia was black in 2016, according to CNN exit polls. Interviews in Super Tuesday states suggest that Biden is also facing a sense of apathy among some black voters that did not exist in 2008 and 2012, when African Americans overwhelmingly backed Obama, or even in 2016 when they supported Clinton. That ambivalence toward Biden stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm of 2016, when African Americans formed the core of Clinton\u2019s winning coalition. (Seventy-seven percent of black primary voters overall supported her, according to exit polls.) The field is far more split this time, with former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders all vying for the support of black voters. Meanwhile, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who found himself addressing largely white audiences in South Carolina and came away with just 8% of the vote, dropped out of the race Sunday evening. Buttigieg struggled to make progress with black voters after his record on improving relations between South Bend residents and the police came under scrutiny. Joe Biden's South Carolina rout sends a warning to Bernie Sanders Two new CBS News/YouGov polls released Sunday show Sanders and Bloomberg edging into Biden\u2019s lead among black voters. In California, Sanders won the backing of 24% of black Democratic voters to Biden\u2019s 39%; another 11% favored Bloomberg. Eight percent supported Buttigieg and 7% backed Warren. In the Texas CBS/YouGov poll, Biden maintained the support of 47% of black Democratic voters, while Bloomberg garnered the support of 24% and Sanders 19%. \u201cI suspect Biden is still the favorite among black voters but I also think many black voters believe he is too weak to go after Trump,\u201d said Richard Fording, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama. Despite Biden\u2019s slow start in the primaries, he was for many months the top choice for black voters, according to public polls. But the size of the field has fractured his early domination of the voting bloc. In Texas, for example, another key state that will vote Tuesday, Biden led among likely black Democratic voters, with 42%, to Sanders\u2019 23% as Bloomberg trailed with 16%, according to a mid-February University of Massachusetts-Lowell poll there. By contrast, Clinton won 83% of black voters in Texas in 2016, while Sanders won 15%, according to CNN exit polls. Biden\u2019s campaign can boast an impressive number of endorsements from prominent black elected officials, including 20 Congressional Black Caucus members \u2013 by far the most of any Democratic candidate. But that hasn\u2019t assuaged questions about whether he can beat Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in the African American community. \u201cWhat Trump has done to this country in four years is ridiculous. He has wiped out 100 years of progress as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Carol Black, a 74-year-old former health insurance worker who lives in Los Angeles and was deciding among Sanders, Biden and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, before Steyer dropped out of the race Saturday night. Black says she likes Biden\u2019s experience, but she\u2019s drawn to Sanders\u2019 message as a straight-talker who is advocating for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Black told CNN last week that she won\u2019t make up her mind until Tuesday. Biden races to lock down moderates as Buttigieg exit rocks rapidly shifting Democratic race Other black voters expressed concerns that the 77-year-old Biden may be too old for the challenge. \u201cI think had he ran in 2016 he might have won, I really do believe that, but I think he might be past his prime right now,\u201d said Larry Harold, a 46-year-old undecided voter from Springfield, Tennessee. Many black Biden supporters who spoke to CNN spent less time praising the former vice president\u2019s qualifications than explaining why they could not vote for the alternatives: Bloomberg\u2019s past support for stop-and-frisk, which disproportionately targeted black and Latino young men; Sanders\u2019 progressivism and their fears about the impact of his costly proposals on the economy. Aaron Thompson, a 46-year-old from Richmond who said he will probably vote for Biden on Tuesday, said his choice was a question of practicality, the cost of Sanders\u2019 plans and which candidate would be acceptable to most Americans. \u201cTell me how you\u2019re going to pay for that,\u201d Thompson said. There is evidence that Sanders is slowly making gains among black voters. His share of the black vote in South Carolina, according to exit polls, was 17%, up slightly from his 14% showing with South Carolina blacks in 2016. Sanders led Biden among likely Democratic black voters in North Carolina with 30% to Biden\u2019s 19% (another 19% favored Bloomberg) in the February 20 University of Massachusetts-Lowell poll. Sanders\u2019 senior adviser Chuck Rocha told CNN that the campaign tried to address the lessons it learned in 2016, when Clinton trounced Sanders with huge majorities of African American voters in state after state across the South. In South Carolina, for example, 83% of Sanders\u2019 staff this time was comprised of people of color, the vast majority of whom were from South Carolina, rather than having aides swoop in from other states. \u201cIt takes time to go in and build trust in a community when you\u2019re a white senator from Vermont who is new to running campaigns in the South,\u201d Rocha said. Rocha argued that Sanders\u2019 message about lifting up working class Americans is particularly resonant in Latino and African Americans communities, where many workers are under-insured, struggling with student debt and frustrated by the refusal of Congress to raise the minimum wage. That\u2019s what has attracted Dakota Evans, a 24-year-old from Los Angeles, to Sanders, he told CNN. \u201cI have a sort of a checklist, especially being a young black man, things that are important to me: free college tuition, free health care,\u201d said Evans, who works at Jimmy John\u2019s sandwich shop and was wearing a shirt that read \u201cI\u2019m black. I read books and I know a lot of sh*t.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a shift coming,\u201d Evans said when asked about Sanders\u2019 challenge among older black voters. \u201cAs more and more people get back into learning about the candidates, they\u2019ll start to see there\u2019s really no comparison. I don\u2019t want to say he\u2019s perfect, but he\u2019s the closest we can get.\u201d But Sanders\u2019 rally last Thursday in Richmond, Virginia \u2013 another state that will vote on Tuesday \u2013 demonstrated the challenges: his crowd in a largely black city was mostly white. \u201cOver 50% of the city is African American,\u201d said Richmond city council member Michael Jones, who has not endorsed a Democratic candidate. \u201cIf that\u2019s not represented, that may tell you something.\u201d Among Sanders\u2019 biggest challenges is overcoming the concern among more conservative black voters who told CNN they remain deeply skeptical about how he would pay for his proposals, particularly Medicare for all. Ajay Brewer, a 35-year-old businessman in Richmond, said he was emphatically opposed to Sanders\u2019 support for a federal minimum wage of $15-an-hour. Brewer, who owns two coffee shops and a waffle shop in the Manchester neighborhood in Richmond\u2019s south side, said he worried about the Democratic Party moving too far left on economic issues that hurt black entrepreneurs like himself. After considering Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, who have both dropped out, as well as Warren, Brewer says he\u2019s settled on Biden. \u201cI just can\u2019t pull myself to vote for Bernie because he will destroy me,\u201d said Brewer. The Bloomberg campaign is courting exactly those kinds of voters who view Sanders as too liberal but have doubts about whether Biden can beat Trump. As his campaign has positioned itself for Super Tuesday, many of Bloomberg\u2019s ads have focused on his seemingly unlimited resources to take on Trump. In California alone, Bloomberg has already spent a stunning $55 million on ads. Stockton, California Mayor Michael Tubbs, Bloomberg\u2019s national co-chair and an African American, noted that the Bloomberg campaign has gone to great lengths in its Super Tuesday advertising to tout the candidate\u2019s \u201cGreenwood Initiative\u201d \u2013 his plan to address \u201csystematic bias\u201d that has kept black Americans from building wealth \u2013 as well as his agenda for climate change, his version of the wealth tax and his plans to support black businesses in America. Tubbs joins several more black current or former mayors supporting Bloomberg, including Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. \u201cHe is speaking in a way that a lot of people in the black community are taking notice of,\u201d said Tubbs. He acknowledged, however, that Bloomberg\u2019s record on the stop-and-frisk policing policy has been a hurdle with some black voters. \u201cStop and frisk was a terrible policy,\u201d Tubbs said, noting that Bloomberg has apologized. At the same time, he believes there should be more attention focused on the 1994 crime bill championed by Biden and supported by Sanders, a bill, Tubbs argued, \u201cthat really accelerated mass incarceration\u201d in America. But Bloomberg\u2019s appearance at Brown Chapel AME Church Sunday in Selma, Alabama to commemorate the 55th anniversary of Bloody Sunday was a striking reminder of the challenges that lie ahead for the former New York City mayor in explaining his own record even after his apologies. As he spoke about his agenda to help one million more black families own a home and to double the number of black-owned businesses through his Greenwood Initiative, several congregants sitting in the church pews stood up and turned their backs to Bloomberg as he spoke.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump formally announced Friday that he will nominate Kenneth Braithwaite, the current US ambassador to Norway, to be his next Navy Secretary. The formal notice from the White House comes months after Trump first announced his decision to tap Braithwaite, a retired rear admiral, to replace former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, who was forced to resign in November by Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Spencer was ousted for circumventing the chain of command by working on a \u201csecret agreement with the White House\u201d to reinstate Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher despite resistance from the Pentagon, a senior defense official told CNN at the time. Gallagher had been convicted of bringing discredit to the armed services after posing next to a dead ISIS fighter\u2019s body, which is against regulations. He was demoted for that offense and acquitted of a separate murder charge. Trump reversed Gallagher\u2019s demotion and ordered Esper to allow the Navy SEAL to keep his status in the elite service \u2013 a move critics say completely undermined the military\u2019s chain of command structure. Ousted Navy secretary calls Trump's war crimes intervention 'shocking and unprecedented' Spencer appeared to be seeking a way to resolve a standoff between the Pentagon and White House. He has since accepted responsibility for the actions that led to his \u201cfiring\u201d but insisted Esper \u201cwas completely informed as to this because his chief of staff was briefed on it.\u201d Braithwaite, 59, is a Michigan native who graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1984 and was the first of his class to earn a flag rank, after 21 years of military service. A trained Naval aviator, Braithwaite flew missions tracking Soviet submarines throughout the Northern and Western Pacific Ocean regions, according to his online biography. Braithwaite later became a public affairs officer, serving in a variety of strategic communications and legislative affairs roles before leaving active service and entering the reserves in 1993. Braithwaite deployed on several occasions while in the Navy reserves. He served in a support role for the fleet involved in the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was deployed again in 2005 to assist with relief efforts following a major earthquake in Pakistan. His final post before retiring from the reserves as a decorated rear admiral in 2011 was Vice Chief of Information for the Navy. Trump taps US Ambassador to Norway to be his new Navy Secretary In addition to his military experience, Braithwaite previously worked as a senior adviser to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter from 1997 to 2000, while Specter was in the Republican Party. He has also spent time in the private sector as an executive for American oil and health care companies. In March 2007, Braithwaite was named Vice President of Government Affairs for Ascension Health, the largest health care system in the US, and executive director of its Delaware Valley Healthcare Council lobbying group. Following the 2016 election, Braithwaite became a member of Trump\u2019s transition team and was nominated by the President as ambassador to Norway, a NATO ally, in February 2018, filling a post that had been vacant for nearly two years. During his confirmation hearing, Braithwaite emphasized the importance of reaffirming the US commitment to NATO and pledged to strengthen trade ties with Norway. But during Braithwaite\u2019s tenure as ambassador, that effort has been at times complicated by Trump\u2019s repeated demands that Norway, and other NATO partners, ramp up defense spending under threat of the US shifting its military presence in Europe if they do not. NATO members committed to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense at a 2014 summit in Wales, and Trump has repeatedly bemoaned that NATO allies have not fulfilled this commitment. While some defense officials, including former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, have tried to reassure NATO allies, both publicly and privately, amid Trump\u2019s attacks over burden sharing, Braithwaite seemed to side with the President in September when Trump criticized Norway failing to fulfill this pledge. \u201cNorway is both a founding member of NATO and a key member of the alliance, and is financially capable of meeting these commitments,\u201d Braithwaite said at the time. \u201cI have emphasized that it is important for Norway to show leadership and reach the 2% goal well before 2024.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders issued a warning on Thursday night in South Carolina: Don\u2019t believe everything you see on television. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot of disinformation on TV about \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d As he answered his question, talking through the perks of the program, there was a decent chance that somewhere across the Palmetto State\u2019s largest media markets, an ad was running making an argument against it. The fight over health care is escalating ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary as an industry group opposed to Medicare for All, along with other efforts to expand public health insurance options, steps up its spending amid recent polls that suggest those policies are growing in popularity with Democratic voters. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future (PAHCF), a coalition of pharmaceutical, hospital and private insurance organizations, is running nearly $300,000 worth of ads across the state during the run-up to the vote. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been on the air all week with a spot that begins, \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All would completely eliminate private insurance, forcing 150 million Americans off their current plans \u2013 including 20 million seniors on Medicare Advantage.\u201d Medicare for All has been a flashpoint throughout the Democratic primary. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren are touting plans to implement a universal, government-administered insurance program. Their moderate rivals, like Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have questioned its cost and financing, while arguing that Medicare for All would be a poison-pill with voters in a general election. The math behind Bernie Sanders' $50 trillion vision Despite the onslaught, Medicare for All has fared well with Democrats in entrance and exit polls in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. In each state, surveys conducted by Edison Media Research have found that about six in 10 voters supported \u201creplacing all private health insurance with a single government plan for everyone.\u201d Sanders has led with those voters, but Warren and Buttigieg, though his plan is centered on a public option, have also seen notable support from the same cohort. In Nevada, members of the state\u2019s powerful Culinary Union helped power Sanders\u2019 overwhelming victory in apparent defiance of their leadership, which did not endorse in the race but was harshly critical of Medicare for All. The PAHCF\u2019s efforts in South Carolina have met resistance on the ground and online from another group, Medicare for All NOW!, which has spent into the six figures on door-to-door canvassing, digital media and, over the past two weeks, a number of town hall meetings. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Sanders backer, took part in one event and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Warren campaign co-chair, knocked doors with the group\u2019s organizers. In its ads, the industry group derides both Medicare for All and public option or buy-in plans as too costly and warns that their passage would lead to a decrease in the quality of care for patients currently on private plans. \u201cAmerican families deserve access to high-quality, affordable health coverage,\u201d PAHCF executive director Lauren Crawford Shaver said in a statement Tuesday introducing a new ad that aired around the South Carolina debate. \u201cUnfortunately, many presidential candidates\u2019 calls for one-size-fits-all new government health insurance systems, such as Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in and the public option, would threaten the health care of millions of Americans.\u201d Sanders has not addressed the ad campaign by name, but regularly rails against the private insurance and pharmaceutical industries in his stump speech, delighting in what he describes as their increasing anxiety over his rise. Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders\u2019 deputy campaign manager, described the PAHCF ads as a cynical attempt to shape voters\u2019 perceptions about Medicare for All. \u201cOur campaign actually believes people are smart, and what those ads show is that the drug companies, the insurance companies and all the people funding those anti-Medicare for All ads don\u2019t have faith in the intelligence of the American people,\u201d Rabin-Havt said. Wendell Potter, the former head of corporate communications at Cigna, is now on the other side of the debate as the president of Medicare for All NOW! and Business for Medicare for All. He spent parts of the past two weeks in South Carolina as part of his group\u2019s work to push back against the PAHCF campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not a bit surprised about (their) spending. They seemingly have an endless pot of money to spend on propaganda campaigns and they spend it in many different ways,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it show up through these advertisements from this so-called coalition, the Partnership for America\u2019s Healthcare Future \u2013 their group to do this that has a name that really doesn\u2019t explain who is behind it.\u201d The \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d framing, Potter added, is a staple of the private industry\u2019s messaging against any expansion of public health care or insurance programs. He said the tactic was meant to stoke fear among more affluent voters. \u201cThat (message) is geared to make people think that if there is a system in which everyone in this country has access to good care, that somehow people of privilege and people who have health plans right now might be at some disadvantage,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThey want people to fear that if we had a system like every other developed country in the world has, in which every citizen, every person in the country has access to good care, that somehow this is a zero-sum game.\u201d The PAHCF ads airing in South Carolina, as they have around the country, point to price estimates in the tens of trillions over a decade and claim that the bulk of the cost will be shouldered by middle-class families. \u201cLike every mom, my family\u2019s health care is a top priority. That\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned that new government-controlled health insurance systems politicians are pushing are a real threat to our health coverage and yours,\u201d a woman says in one of the ads, ticking off the costs of both Medicare for All and public option plans. \u201cIt\u2019s time to build on what\u2019s working and fix what\u2019s broken, not start over.\u201d At Sanders\u2019 rally in Spartanburg on Thursday night, a handful of supporters said they had seen the ads on television or online. Timothy McPherson, a physician from the area, said he was undecided on the candidates, but \u201c100%\u201d in support of Medicare for All. \u201cMy impression are that those are moneyed ads. People are making money,\u201d he told CNN. Asked if he thought they were giving voters a clear picture of the health care system, McPherson said, \u201cI know that they don\u2019t.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report",

When Clinton defeated Sanders in the Democratic primary four years ago, Uriel Guzman of Santa Ana voted for Green Party Nominee Jill Stein \u2013 and he has no regrets about that vote, because he believes Trump\u2019s victory was a much needed wakeup call for Democrats. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s the only one who is actually speaking to us,\u201d said Guzman, a 23-year-old Latino who has struggled with rising college tuition and housing costs. \u201cHe understands our issues. He is speaking to our community \u2013 I mean he\u2019s here in Santa Ana. That never happens. We\u2019re always overlooked.\u201d Sanders understands, Guzman said, that if someone like him got really sick, his family wouldn\u2019t be able to help him: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the money to really survive,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN in Santa Ana. It\u2019s a point that was echoed by Garcia, of Anaheim, who said he trusts Sanders to push through Medicare for All without compromise. \u201cEvery other country that\u2019s first world provides health care to its citizens and I think it\u2019s barbaric that the United States does not give health care to its people,\u201d Garcia said. The certitude of Sanders voters, both in the candidate\u2019s convictions and in their support for him, is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of his candidacy. And it is not just his most youthful supporters, who often get the most attention. Over the past six months, his events have become increasingly multi-generational, with older voters often telling CNN they embraced his candidacy after hearing about it incessantly from their children. In Iowa early this year, one voter told the Vermont senator during a town hall in West Des Moines that she began paying more attention to him after her children came to her each week asking her to donate part of their allowance to his campaign. Sanders\u2019 authenticity, compared with other candidates who have hedged and wavered on their positions while appearing to follow the trajectory of the polls, ultimately pushed Teresa Miller, a 43-year-old from Corona, into the Sanders camp last fall. It wasn\u2019t just Sanders himself; it was the strong feeling of connection she felt among his backers, the sense of a shared struggle. Miller, who is Latina, said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was her top choice until she went to one of Warren\u2019s rallies. \u201cIt was completely old white women. I felt completely out of place there and it made me wonder what she was doing to connect with Latinos and minorities,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI tried to not let that bother me, but then she kind of walked back her Medicare for All plan.\u201d Sanders\u2019 unyielding advocacy for universal health care ultimately won her over. \u201cThere\u2019s no means testing with him,\u201d she said. In photos: Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders When Warren said in January that Sanders had told her in a private conversation that he didn\u2019t believe a woman could win the presidency, Miller was offended by what she saw as an attempt by Warren to paint Sanders as sexist. \u201cThat\u2019s not Bernie. That\u2019s not his crowd,\u201d said Miller, an office supervisor for an architecture firm. Other supporters note that many of Sanders\u2019 ideas \u2013 once viewed as the product of the progressive fringe \u2013 are now essentially part of the Democratic platform in 2020. They point out that his policy positions have often been the same since the 1970s. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing and saying the same thing (since) when it wasn\u2019t popular and he had to come up against a lot of friction,\u201d said Karon Finn, 77 of Grimes, Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s got such a long record of being very steadfast (about) the things I care most about, which are education, health care and the middle and lower class in this country,\u201d said 57-year-old Elizabeth Duffy of Acworth, New Hampshire, who watched Sanders speak during an early February rally at Keene State. \u201cHe\u2019s always been clear and steadfast about what he talks about.\u201d Allison Schwiegeraht, a 21-year-old student from UNC Greensboro who is studying environmental and sustainability studies, attributed Sanders\u2019 appeal to his passion on the climate crisis and environmental issues. \u201cHe always really knows the right thing to say,\u201d Schwiegeraht said. \u201cHe\u2019s dedicated his whole life to this. Since he was also in his teenage (years) and in his early twenties, he just has a real passion for this \u2013 and it\u2019s really hard to find that in a candidate, or really in any public figure.\u201d The connection Sanders has, even with voters who have a very different life experiences than his own, is one that his campaign tried to build through all of 2019, and even before that when his team began encouraging their supporters to share stories of their economic struggles on social media. The effort to build a stronger connection with voters than he did in 2016 came from Sanders himself and his wife Jane. It was a recognition from the candidate that in 2016, he often talked at voters rather than listening to them in speeches that could span as long as an hour and 45 minutes. Sanders wanted to foster a sense of community, the foundation of a campaign slogan that became, \u201cNot me. Us.\u201d \u201cThey knew 2016 had been more academic, not as personal,\u201d Sanders senior campaign adviser Jeff Weaver said of the campaign shift. \u201cThey wanted to make what he was talking about connect \u2013 to make it relevant to real people\u2019s lives.\u201d Bernie Sanders' rise has moderate Democrats wondering if it's too late to stop him Sanders became a better candidate, his advisers say, through those smaller, more intimate events \u2013 where he asked voters for their stories about their economic troubles in the Trump economy. \u201cHe understands what we go through and he doesn\u2019t fake it,\u201d said Destinee Campbell, a 19-year-old sophomore studying social work at Bennett College, a historically black college in North Carolina. She said she was confident Sanders would dedicate his presidency to improving the lives of minorities and women, even though that has been far afield from his own life experience. \u201cHe actually seems like, if he hasn\u2019t been through it, he knows people who\u2019ve been through it and understands what we need,\u201d said Campbell in an interview with CNN during Sanders\u2019 visit to the college last September. \u201cHe understands middle-class, real life situations. He understands us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is looking for a breakaway win in Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses. Everybody else in the Democratic presidential race is trying to keep it close. Just a week from the South Carolina primary and 10 days from Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote, candidates are running out of time and opportunities to break out of the pack and amass the fundraising and operations they\u2019ll need to compete in a drawn-out delegate battle. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Here are six things to watch in the Nevada caucuses: Sanders is increasingly regarded as the primary\u2019s clear front-runner. But in wearing that title, he also faces greater expectations. Anything less than victory in Nevada will send shockwaves through the field and give a massive charge to not only the victor, but everyone else looking to knock Sanders off his perch. It would also raise questions about Sanders\u2019 prospects on Super Tuesday, when he is banking on Latino support in California and Texas \u2013 much like here in Nevada \u2013 to boost him to the top of the field. If Nevada breaks like he expects, there is a solid case that Sanders is on his way to the nomination. If it doesn\u2019t, Democrats might be in for a months-long fight that could very well be decided \u2013 on a second ballot \u2013 at the party\u2019s summer convention. If Sanders is the favorite, the rest of the field is in a sprint to see who can emerge as his most serious challenger \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear who has the advantage. Like Iowa, Nevada\u2019s caucus rules require candidates to hit a 15% viability threshold in each precinct in order to receive any delegates there \u2013 which means in places former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, businessman Tom Steyer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren fall short, their supporters would be scattered elsewhere on a second alignment. That reality could make it even harder for any one candidate to keep pace with Sanders. The stakes are high for every candidate. Biden hung his campaign on the argument that he\u2019d perform well in states with more diverse electorates \u2013 and told CNN on Friday that second place would be \u201ca win.\u201d Buttigieg and Klobuchar hear the clock ticking on their 2020 campaigns: Both are battling the former vice president for the moderate lane, and both need a major jolt to climb the national polls before Super Tuesday on March 3. Steyer spent nearly $15 million on television ads in Nevada \u2013 more than seven times his nearest rival\u2019s spending \u2013 and needs something to show for it. And Warren, most of all, needs to parlay her strong debate performance this week, where she led the charge against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, into results. The complicating factor for the Massachusetts senator: About 75,000 early votes were already cast before Wednesday night\u2019s debate. That\u2019s almost as many people as voted in the state\u2019s 2016 caucuses. As Sanders has emerged as the party\u2019s front-runner, moderate Democratic candidates and operatives have howled that he\u2019ll alienate the suburban women who propelled the party to 2018 midterm success and hurt the party\u2019s chances against President Donald Trump. Nevada is Sanders\u2019 first opportunity to demonstrate an ability to generate a winning coalition of his own. It starts with Latinos \u2013 particularly those who are younger \u2013 who Sanders\u2019 campaign has targeted more aggressively than any of his rivals for months. He dominated among Iowa\u2019s small share of Latinos, and now will seek to replicate that success with a much larger and more diverse population. If he can add them in considerable numbers to the electorate and sustain that success elsewhere, it could propel him to wins in California and Texas on Super Tuesday. Perhaps more importantly for the party: It would strengthen Democrats\u2019 general election chances in Arizona and help the party make inroads in Texas, where the state House and several congressional seats are expected to be competitive. Biden has led with African-American voters, but if Sanders is winning among non-white voters overall, increasing turnout among young people and beating expectations with working-class voters \u2013 even if he has received a mixed reception from labor leaders in Nevada, where the Culinary Union has criticized him \u2013 his roadmap to November could begin to come into focus. Time for round two. More than two weeks after the Iowa caucuses crumbled into chaos, Nevada Democrats will try their hand at the complex process. And, in a successful effort to boost turnout and open up the process, the party added another layer of difficulty this year by allowing four days of early voting that saw roughly 75,000 Nevada Democrats cast ballots already. Countless questions remain, though, and while campaigns have grown more upbeat in recent days about the prospect of the caucus going off without error, many still worry about how the party will integrate the early vote into the caucus process, whether the so-called \u201ccaucus calculator\u201d will effectively streamline the counting process and how the party will handle issues in rural caucus sites. More than just the success of the caucuses is riding on Saturday\u2019s success. Former aides and advisers to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, including longtime adviser Rebecca Lambe, have been intimately involved in strengthening the process after Iowa. That involvement reflects the feeling that the Nevada caucuses, and the prospect the contest could move up in four years after Iowa\u2019s failure, is central to Reid\u2019s legacy. One word of warning from a source familiar with the process: Counting votes on Saturday could take longer than expected, drawing out the results process later into the night. Klobuchar showed with her performance in the New Hampshire debate what one big night can do for a campaign. And Warren had a very big one in Las Vegas on Wednesday, when she spent the better part of two hours ripping into Bloomberg. The revitalized progressive earned a big \u2013 and needed \u2013 fundraising bounce for her efforts. The question now is whether Warren\u2019s debate stage momentum carries over into the caucuses. One reason why it might not have the desired effect: early voting here meant that, by the time Warren took the stage, about 75,000 people had already made their picks. Steyer closed out his Nevada campaign by treating supporters to a TLC concert, paying the iconic R&B group known for \u201cWaterfalls\u201d to perform the night before the Nevada caucuses. The question for Steyer is whether that will be the high point of his Nevada campaign, which featured nearly $15 million in TV ads. Conversations with voters across the state show some Nevadans are eager to back the man, they believe, began the impeachment inquiry \u2013 even after it failed in the Senate. \u201cHe started the impeachment,\u201d Luis Romero, a 38-year-old cook at the New York, New York Hotel and Casino, told CNN after voting for Steyer. Romero and others pointed to Steyer\u2019s countless television ad about his effort with the anti-Trump group he founded, Need to Impeach. Steyer is coming into the caucuses under the radar. He didn\u2019t make the debate stage this week, and he has largely faded from the day-to-day Democratic primary conversation. But he has polled in the double digits in South Carolina, where he has heavily courted black voters, and a stronger-than-expected showing in Nevada could make him a serious player in a jumbled field. His campaign believes voters like Romero will lead to a surprise on Saturday afternoon.",

            "article_content": "This is the moment for the ultimate question of the Bernie Sanders movement: is the United States ready for a socialist President? At Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Sanders defended himself as a socialist (he calls himself a democratic socialist) and then dismissed a recent poll that suggested Americans do not have a favorable view of socialism. Who was leading in that poll, he asked the debate moderator? He was, although the moderator didn\u2019t know it. The moment allowed Sanders to skate with the impression that it doesn\u2019t matter that Americans oppose socialism because clearly they like him. It is true the Sanders was leading in the poll, conducted by the Wall Street Journal and NBC \u2013 but only among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents when asked who they supported for the Democratic nomination. He had 27% support compared to Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, each with 14% support. And in a hypothetical matchup, he was narrowly ahead of President Donald Trump. SIGN UP HERE TO RECEIVE CNN\u2019S WHAT MATTERS NEWSLETTER IN YOUR INBOX But two-thirds of all voters \u2013 Democrats plus everyone else \u2013 said they would be uncomfortable with a socialist President. Come November, it will be all Americans over the age of 18 who elect the Electoral College that picks the President. Those results and the questions they raise about whether the country would accept a socialist are repeated in an NPR / PBS News Hour Marist poll. In that poll, Sanders had even more support \u2013 31% in the Democratic primary compared to Michael Bloomberg, in second place with 19%. Take a look at the party breakdown regarding socialism. Fifty percent of Democrats have a favorable view of socialism compared to 46% who have a favorable view of capitalism. But again, socialism is far less favorable than capitalism in the country as a whole. In the NPR poll, among Americans overall, just 28% had a favorable view of socialism compared to 57% who had a favorable view of capitalism. Among Republicans, 76% held a favorable view of capitalism compared to 7% who felt favorably about socialism. And, among independents \u2013 who may or may not decide the next presidential election \u2013 it was 23% who had a favorable view of socialism compared to 59% who had a favorable view of capitalism. And while views of socialism are slightly favorable among Democrats, they\u2019re below 35% for whites (25%), minorities (33%), Gen Xers (28%), Baby Boomers (20%), and the Silent Generation (20%). Favorable views of socialism are greatest among younger adults (38% favorable), who just happen to also be Sanders\u2019 base of support. Sanders isn\u2019t afraid to gloss over a point he doesn\u2019t like, as when former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg asked him where he\u2019s going to find \u201c$25 trillion\u201d to pay for his health care plan. \u201cMaybe we can talk \u2013 maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that\u2019s a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,\u201d said Sanders, who wants to erase the private US health care system for something completely government-run and without premiums. He also hit Bloomberg, who is worth tens of billions of dollars and is pouring hundreds of millions into his campaign, about inequality, an issue that has animated the Democratic race. \u201cWhat we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of wealth and income inequality is make sure that those people who are working \u2013 you know what, Mr. Bloomberg, it wasn\u2019t you who made all that money, maybe your workers played some role in that as well,\u201d he said. Bloomberg said Sanders\u2019 points \u2013 he wants to do away with billionaires \u2013 were \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation. It\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019re not going throw out capitalism. We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism. It just didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. That communism barb drew cries of outrage from Sanders and Warren, although she identifies as capitalist. Communism today is associated with repressive regimes in the Soviet Union and China, although it is was, in the vision of Karl Marx, the next step after socialism. Sanders said at a CNN town hall last April that he opposes \u201cauthoritarian communism\u201d in the mold of the Soviet Union. Rather, when he talks about democratic socialism, he means, \u201cI believe in a democratic civilized society health care is a human right. Government should make that happen. I believe that every young person in this country regardless of his or her income has the right to get all the education they need.\u201d He usually points to Denmark, which has a regressive and high VAT tax (imagine a 25% federal sales tax on everything, split in stages between manufacturers, retailers and consumers). But it also has generous benefits that raise quality of life for every Dane. Denmark\u2019s government, for the record, respects a market economy. So does Bloomberg. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for all billionaires,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cAll I know is I\u2019ve been very lucky, made a lot of money and I\u2019m giving it all away to make this country better. And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic party as well.\u201d He also pointed out that Sanders, after starting his movement in 2016, became a millionaire and has multiple homes. \u201cWhat a wonderful country we have. The most well-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with 3 houses,\u201d he said. Sanders argued that the US tax system helps the rich more than the poor and the middle class. He said more of the country\u2019s wealth should be spread around. Bloomberg pointed out it\u2019s Congress and the Senate that write the tax code. And Sanders is currently a senator. As with so much, Sanders\u2019 seems more focused on changing the way Americans think about things than actually enacting policy, although he and Warren both have plans to ramp up taxes on the wealthy. Warren wants to tax wealth rather than income. \u201cWhen Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that\u2019s socialism for the rich,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have to subsidize Walmart\u2019s workers on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages. That\u2019s socialism for the rich. I believe in democratic socialism for working people. Not billionaires. Health care for all. Educational opportunity for all.\u201d Bloomberg pointed out that even though he\u2019s a billionaire, he wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, and he pointed out that as mayor in New York, he did raise taxes. President Donald Trump has already tried to paint all Democrats as socialists. There is, however, another important element to all of this. If anyone who isn\u2019t Sanders, let alone a billionaire like Bloomberg, were the Democratic nominee, would Sanders\u2019 socialist supporters show up to vote in November? And, conversely, if Sanders wins the nomination, will Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and other liberal billionaires stick to their promises to underwrite Democrats\u2019 efforts to unseat Trump as well as other Republicans? It\u2019s an identity crisis the party is just coming to grips with as it considers who it should select to take on Trump.",

Explore the behind-the-scenes drama that gave rise to some of the most influential American leaders on CNN Original Series \u201cRace for the White House,\u201d Sundays at 10p ET. The 2020 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden is perhaps the craziest, most controversial election in US history. We say perhaps because we don\u2019t want to bog you down with superlatives when there have been so many truly zany moments in American elections. Who could forget Howard Dean screaming like he\u2019d lost a limb, or Rick Perry forgetting one of the three federal agencies he\u2019d cut if elected? Then there\u2019s the bevy of oh-so-colorful characters, from Jello Biafra, Joan Jett Blakk and Wavy Gravy to Lee Mercer, Jack Shepard and Lyndon LaRouche. Did we mention Deez Nuts? To say an election was the craziest or most controversial simply isn\u2019t objective. Sure, Trump has claimed victory despite Biden\u2019s projected win, questioned the voting system\u2019s integrity and suggested he might not step down, but is that more controversial than Congress picking a president? That\u2019s happened a few times. We\u2019ll let you decide. So, without any superlatives, here are 11 fascinating elections in American history: The outcome of the 1800 contest between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams was so bizarre, the United States had to amend the Constitution. Pre-12th Amendment, Electoral College members each had two votes for president, and there were no official tickets. Whoever garnered the most votes was president, and second place took the vice presidency. Though problems with the system were apparent in 1796, the election of 1800 saw Jefferson tie with his Democratic-Republican \u201crunning mate\u201d Aaron Burr. Both had 73 votes to Adams\u2019 65. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Hamilton Congress would be called upon to break the tie. Enter Alexander Hamilton, the nation\u2019s first treasury secretary, founder of the Federalist Party and a man who did not care for Adams, Jefferson or Burr. Nonetheless, Hamilton engaged in a campaign to convince the Federalists to vote for Jefferson, his lesser of three evils, writing in a letter that \u201cMr. Burr loves nothing but himself \u2013 thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement.\u201d The House of Representatives didn\u2019t easily arrive at its decision, casting 35 ballots in a week before finally voting to name Jefferson the victor and Burr the veep on February 7, 1801. Making the election all the zanier, the rivalry between Burr and Hamilton would continue for more than three years before Burr, still the sitting vice president, killed Hamilton in a duel. This one was odd from the get-go, if only for the fact that the Federalist Party was on the cusp of extinction and all four candidates were Democratic-Republicans. Andrew Jackson, a war hero and statesman, won the popular vote by fewer than 39,000 ballots and took 99 Electoral College votes. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams secured 84, Treasury Secretary William Crawford won 41 and House Speaker Henry Clay had 37. With no candidate earning a majority of the votes, the House again had to settle the deadlock, and Jackson was confident he would win the presidency given that he had won the popular vote and Electoral College. Because the House could choose among only three candidates, Clay got the boot. Presidential Places: Andrew Jackson's Hermitage We mentioned Clay was speaker, yes? Well, after a month of horse trading, many of Clay\u2019s supporters shifted their support to Adams, who would go on to win the majority of the House vote. Maryland, Illinois and Louisiana, which had cast most of their Electoral College votes for Jackson, as well as Kentucky, where Adams did not receive a single ballot in the popular vote, decided to back Adams. After his inauguration, Adams selected Clay as his secretary of state. Jackson was furious and accused Adams and Clay of a \u201ccorrupt bargain.\u201d He vacated his Senate seat and vowed to win the 1828 election as a Washington outsider. Backed by his new party, the Democrats, Jackson made good on the promise, besting Adams, who by then was a leader in the National Republican Party. This election wasn\u2019t particularly close. Abraham Lincoln trounced John Breckinridge in an election that had one of the highest voter turnouts of all time. No, the 1860 election was notable because it ripped the long-dominant Democratic Party \u2013 and thereby, the nation \u2013 in half. The Supreme Court\u2019s Dred Scott decision of 1857, essentially legalizing slavery in all U.S. territories, had laid the battleground: The Republican Party largely opposed slavery but was reluctant to push for its prohibition in states that already had it, and the Democrats were unable at their 1860 convention to establish an official party line on slavery. An actor, a president and the crime of the 19th century At a second convention that year, the Democrats nominated Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, but many Southerners in the party defected and selected Breckinridge, who was vice president, as their man. Both would claim to be the official Democratic candidate. The Constitutional Union Party, which had formed the year before and staged a campaign that basically ignored the issue of slavery, selected Sen. John Bell of Tennessee. The Electoral College vote told the story. Lincoln snared only 40% of the popular vote, but in the Electoral College took most of the North, along with California and Oregon. Douglas came in second in the popular vote but took only Missouri (and three votes in New Jersey). Breckinridge took most of the South, along with Maryland and Delaware, and Bell\u2019s middle-of-the-road policies earned him the middle of the road: Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Weeks after the election, South Carolina voted to secede, followed by six more Southern states. In February 1861, delegates from those states formed the Confederate States of America and selected Jefferson Davis as their president. In April, a South Carolina militia would take Fort Sumter, and four more states would join the Confederacy. Set aside that 1872 was the year suffragette Victoria Woodhull of the People\u2019s Party became the first woman to run for president. Also, forget that writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, her running mate, was the first African-American to be considered for the vice presidency. And never mind this was the year Susan B. Anthony would be arrested for illegal voting. No, 1872 was strange because one of the primary candidates never saw the final Electoral College vote. Horace Greeley wasn\u2019t supposed to put up much of a fight in his bid to unseat President Ulysses S. Grant, but a schism in Grant\u2019s Republican Party made things a little more interesting. Grant, who led the Union armies that defeated the Confederacy, had not been so convincing in the Oval Office. The White House website describes him as out of his element and quotes one visitor who spoke of his \u201cpuzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms.\u201d Some Republicans defected, becoming Liberal Republicans, and cast their lot with Greeley, a Democrat who would go on to snare 44% of the popular vote, almost 3 million ballots, despite ending his campaigning to tend to his sick wife, who died a week before the election. Before the Electoral College could cast its votes, the newspaper founder died November 29, 1872, and 63 of his 66 votes were dispersed among Thomas Hendricks, who would later become vice president, and other Democrats. Grant attended his rival\u2019s funeral. Democrat Samuel Tilden had beaten Republican Rutherford Hayes. He snared a quarter-million more ballots in the popular vote, and he had 19 more votes in the Electoral College. Problem was, Tilden was one Electoral College vote away from a majority of 185 votes, and four states composing a total of 20 votes \u2013 Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon \u2013 were disputing the results. In the Southern states, each party was accusing the other of fraud. With no precedent to lean on, the two parties agreed to establish a 15-member commission made up of seven Republicans, seven Democrats and an independent. The independent, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, however, was unexpectedly selected by the Illinois Legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was replaced by Justice Joseph Bradley, a diehard Republican who would cast every vote for Hayes, providing him the 20 votes he needed for a majority. Democrats initially threatened to block the decision, but in a backroom deal they agreed to drop their opposition if Hayes, among other provisions, removed federal troops that had been in the South under Reconstruction. Hayes was sworn in March 5, 1877, and within weeks, he removed the troops. Reconstruction formally came to an end, halting the progress African Americans had made. It would be decades before civil rights would see serious discussion again in Congress. It was a battle between two newspaper publishers, but the election wasn\u2019t terribly exciting. Republican Warren G. Harding handed Democrat James Cox a historic beatdown, taking more than 60% of the popular vote along with 37 of the 48 states. Third place is where it got interesting. Long before Bernie Sanders faced jabs for his liberal politics, the Socialist Party of America enjoyed a modicum of support at the outset of the 20th century. That union leader Eugene Debs ran for president in 1900, 1904, 1908 and 1912 is somewhat unremarkable, as is the fact he secured roughly 6% of the popular vote in 1912, more than 900,000 ballots. In 1920, though, Debs had to run his fifth campaign from the most unlikely of headquarters: prison. No stranger to incarceration \u2013 he\u2019d served time in connection with an 1894 railroad strike \u2013 Debs again drew the government\u2019s ire in 1918 when he gave an anti-war speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he pilloried \u201cthe ruling class\u201d who made all the decisions to send the working class to war. \u201cYours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die,\u201d he said. He was convicted under an espionage law and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Demonstrations protesting his imprisonment evolved into the May Day riots of 1919, and Debs was later moved to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, from where he conducted his presidential campaign. He would again secure more than 900,000 votes \u2013 an impressive tally, but not nearly enough to compete with Harding, who snared more than 16 million. The following year, on Christmas, Harding commuted Debs\u2019 sentence to time served. President Harry S. Truman was done before the election began. You could stick a fork in him, to hear the pundits tell it. The election was New York Gov. Thomas Dewey\u2019s. Period. The 1946 midterms had handed both houses to Republicans for the first time in almost 20 years, and opinion polls showed that just one in three Americans approved of Truman\u2019s handling of the presidency. Making matters worse, Truman\u2019s commerce secretary, Henry Wallace, had revolted over the administration\u2019s foreign policy toward the Soviet Union and declared his intention to run as a third-party candidate. Southern Democrats also jumped ship over his stance on civil rights, forming the States\u2019 Rights Party \u2013 aka the Dixiecrats \u2013 and electing segregationist South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond as their candidate. The final pre-election Gallup poll \u2013 interestingly, taken in mid-October and not released until the day before Election Day \u2013 showed Dewey beating Truman by 5 percentage points. Even on Election Day, Truman recalled an NBC report predicting he would lose. It wasn\u2019t until 4 a.m. that his Secret Service agents woke him to say he had won. The Chicago Daily Tribune had referred to Truman as a \u201cnincompoop\u201d on its editorial page in the run-up to the election. Poetically, a printers\u2019 strike forced the newspaper to publish its morning edition hours earlier than usual, and Publisher J. Loy Maloney took the pollsters\u2019 word and signed off on one of the most famous headlines in history. \u201cDewey defeats Truman.\u201d John F. Kennedy set a lot of precedents when he was elected in 1960. He was the youngest president elected to office, the first at the time to be born in the 20th century. He was also the first Catholic president. The contest between Kennedy and Richard Nixon, pitting a relatively unknown senator against a two-term sitting vice president, marked another precedent: the first time that presidential debates would be pumped into American living rooms. This was important to the vote\u2019s outcome because televisions were increasingly part of the American household. Eighty-eight percent of homes had them, compared with 11% in 1950. Nixon had recently been hospitalized. He refused to wear makeup, which served to highlight his thin, sickly appearance. He had a 5 o\u2019clock shadow. He wore a gray suit that blended into the background. His appearance left much to be desired, historians would note. Kennedy, on the other hand, was tanned and wore a blue suit and shirt, so he stood out against the studio backdrop. Unlike Nixon, he spoke to the cameras rather than to his opponent. Debates enter the TV age The estimated 70 million people who watched the first of four televised debates, on September 26, 1960, felt Kennedy won, whereas the much smaller audience listening on the radio felt Nixon was the victor. On November 8, Kennedy edged out Nixon by 119,000 votes (out of a total of almost 69 million). Though it\u2019s arguable that the debate alone won Kennedy the election (he also secured the African-American vote by offering his assistance in getting the Rev. Martin Luther Jr. out of prison just weeks before the election), politicians and historians concur this changed the face of campaigns. Televised debates made image and appearance primary considerations, and it raised such an unsettling specter for some candidates that it would be 16 years before another presidential hopeful agreed to a televised debate. This is the election that brought us the \u201cDaisy\u201d ad \u2013 an attempt to paint Republican Barry Goldwater as too reckless to be put in charge of the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The ad remains haunting even amid today\u2019s supercharged mudslinging. The summer of 1964 brought the Civil Rights Act. Angry Whites protested the legislation across the South, while Blacks enraged by police treatment erupted into demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and other cities. The stage was set for extremes, but the election would not hinge on whether Goldwater or President Lyndon Johnson was a more capable commander in chief. Race would not only shape 1964\u2019s ballot, but it would affect elections for decades to come. The civil rights movement in photos Alabama\u2019s fiery segregationist Gov. George Wallace took on Johnson for the Democratic nomination, and despite the sentiment that \u201cwhite backlash\u201d against the Civil Rights Act was a Southern thing, Wallace received more than 30% of the vote in Wisconsin and Indiana and more than 40% in Maryland in the primaries. Wallace would eventually drop out of the race, but not before causing both Goldwater and Johnson substantial concerns. Goldwater feared Wallace would run on a third-party ticket, sinking his campaign, and Johnson worried about Wallace\u2019s strong showing in non-Southern states. While Goldwater, who had cast his vote against the Civil Rights Act, was painted as a racist, something he had always denied, Johnson tried to please everyone. That was most evident when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Black activists organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, showed up at the national convention demanding to be seated because Mississippi had run a segregated primary. Johnson would have to broker a deal in which the segregationists were seated at the convention, along with two members of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. He would later anger many in the South by selecting Hubert Humphrey, a staunch civil rights advocate, as his running mate. Johnson would go on to win one of the most lopsided elections ever. Goldwater won only his home state of Arizona and Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. Republicans still enjoy a great deal of political dominance in the South to this day. It happened in a hasty two-minute phone call. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota had just won the Democratic nomination for president and phoned Sen. Thomas Eagleton to ask him to be his running mate. Several high-profile Democrats had declined to join McGovern on the ticket, so he picked Eagleton, in part, because he hoped he would help him shore up the Catholic vote. To say Eagleton didn\u2019t undergo the intense vetting of, say, Sarah Palin or Paul Ryan would be an understatement. Had McGovern grilled Eagleton according to today\u2019s standards, he might\u2019ve learned Eagleton\u2019s secret: that the senator from Missouri had been hospitalized three times for depression and had undergone electroshock therapy on two of those occasions. When rumors first began to surface, McGovern stood by his running mate but eventually decided that Eagleton posed a liability. 2012: A look at the life of George McGovern During a news conference at a South Dakota state park, where McGovern was supposed to be relaxing, not campaigning, Eagleton revealed his medical history to reporters and explained that he had only recently divulged the matter to McGovern. On August 1 \u2013 18 days after he was selected \u2013 Eagleton officially dropped out of the campaign. Richard Nixon would go on to obliterate McGovern, carrying 49 states and outpacing the Democrat by about 18 million votes \u2013 thereby striking fear into would-be presidents for decades about who they choose to join them on the ticket.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders clinched a hard-fought victory in the first-in-the-nation primary in New Hampshire, as he battles with Pete Buttigieg to claim the mantle as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. After winning New Hampshire in 2016 with a margin of more than 20 points over Hillary Clinton, Sanders was expected to do well as the senator from a neighboring state. But the race tightened as results came in Tuesday night, once again producing a surprisingly close race between Sanders and Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. All of the candidates quickly turned their attention to upcoming states like Nevada, South Carolina and more diverse states that will vote on Super Tuesday like California and Texas. But Sanders took a moment to savor his win, which marked an extraordinary comeback for a candidate who was all but written off by many pundits after he suffered a heart attack in early October. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race New Hampshire, which is famous for breathing new life into struggling candidacies, also delivered a rush of momentum to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who placed third after a strong debate performance Friday night that fueled a late surge in her support. Both Klobuchar and Buttigieg appear to have been buoyed by the large number of independent voters in the state \u2013 who are permitted to vote in either party\u2019s primary. The Granite State became another stumbling block for both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, who made the telling decision to abruptly abandon his election night party in favor of heading to South Carolina. But it was Sanders who won the night. After his upstart bid against Clinton in 2016, he has built a far more formidable operation this cycle while focusing on broadening his appeal to build a coalition of young voters, working class voters and voters of color. No other candidate has matched his grassroots fundraising advantage, which has allowed the campaign to build robust turnout operations in the early stated, helping him in a deeply unsettled Democratic field. On Tuesday night, the Vermont senator proclaimed his victory as \u201cthe beginning of the end for Donald Trump.\u201d Though he congratulated his Democratic rivals, he implicitly took a swipe at Buttigieg and other candidates who are raising money for their campaigns through big-dollar donations. He argued that his campaign was centered on taking on billionaires and \u201ccandidates funded by billionaires.\u201d 5 takeaways from the New Hampshire Democratic primary \u201cThe reason I believe we are going to win, is that we have an unprecedented grassroots movement, from coast to coast, of millions of people,\u201d Sanders told a raucous crowd at his election night party. \u201cThe reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented, multi-generational, multiracial political movement. This is a movement from coast to coast, which is demanding that we finally have an economy, and a government that works for all of us \u2013 not wealthy campaign contributors.\u201d Buttigieg, who was came out ahead in the still-contested Iowa caucuses last week, once again outpaced expectations and tied with Sanders in the delegate count, according to CNN estimates. In his own election night speech, Buttigieg pointed to his strength across disparate parts of New Hampshire, and to his appeal among independents and more conservative voters. \u201cThanks to you, a campaign that some said shouldn\u2019t be here at all, has shown that we are here to stay,\u201d Buttigieg told supporters in New Hampshire Tuesday night. \u201cSo many of you turned out \u2013 diehard Democrats, independents unwilling to stay on the sidelines, and even some newly former Republicans ready to vote for a politics defined by how many we call in, instead of by who we push out.\u201d He expressed his respect for Sanders, noting that he admired the Vermont senator even as a high school student, but he continued to describe Sanders\u2019 approach to politics as divisive. \u201cIn this election season we have been told by some that you must either be for revolution, or you are for the status quo. But where does that leave the rest of us? Most Americans don\u2019t see where they fit in that polarized vision, and we can\u2019t defeat the most divisive President in modern American history by tearing down anybody who doesn\u2019t agree with us 100% of the time,\u201d Buttigieg said. Sanders led in New Hampshire on Tuesday night among liberals, voters under 45 years old and whites without a college degree, three of his core constituencies, according to exit polls. Voters who wanted a candidate who can bring change to the country, as well as those looking for someone who cares about \u201cpeople like them,\u201d also favored him. Four in 10 voters under 45 cast their ballots for Sanders, more than double his nearest opponent; and he drew the support of nearly half of voters under 30 years old. With 95% of precincts reporting, Sanders led with 26%. Buttigieg was in second with 24.4% and Klobuchar in third with 19.7%. It was a steep drop-off to fourth place for Warren, who had 9.3%, and Biden in fifth, with 8.4%. Warren and Biden will not win any delegates in Tuesday\u2019s race, according to a CNN Decision Desk analysis. CNN is projecting President Donald Trump will easily win the state\u2019s Republican primary, as expected. In the all-important delegate count, CNN is estimating Sanders and Buttigieg both earned nine delegates on Tuesday, while Klobuchar won six. There are 24 delegates at stake. As results came in, Klobuchar touted her \u201chappy, scrappy campaign\u201d and told her supporters in New Hampshire that their effort had \u201cbeaten the odds every step of the way.\u201d She said that the election would prove that \u201cthe heart of America is bigger than the heart of this guy in the White House.\u201d \u201cTonight is about grit, and my story, like so many of yours, is one of resilience,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI announced my candidacy in the middle of a Minnesota blizzard. And there were a lot of people that predicted I wouldn\u2019t even get through that speech, but not the people of my state, and not the people of New Hampshire. Except, then they predicted that we wouldn\u2019t make it through the summer. We did. Then they predicted we wouldn\u2019t make it to the debates and Man, were we at the debate in New Hampshire.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been strong and we\u2019ve never quit,\u201d the Minnesota senator continued. \u201cI think that sounds pretty good for a president. Across the months, and months, and miles of this race, we redefined the word grit.\u201d She alluded to unique hurdles that the female candidates have faced \u2013 the fact that a large portion of voters still worry that a female nominee would face a more difficult climb against Trump than a male candidate. The exit polls in New Hampshire Tuesday night bore out that concern among voters. Thirty percent of voters polled said they believe it would be harder for a woman to beat Trump, while 11% said it would be easier. Fifty-eight percent said there would be no difference. Klobuchar said people have told her, just as they have told Warren, that \u201cthey didn\u2019t think a woman could be elected.\u201d \u201cIn my case, it was elected to the US Senate; no woman had ever done it before,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cBut I came back. I defied expectations and I won. \u2026 And tonight in New Hampshire, as everyone had counted us out, even a week ago \u2013 thank you, pundits \u2013 I came back, and we delivered.\u201d Before the votes were even tallied, Warren\u2019s campaign manager pointed in a memo to her ability \u201cto organize in all 57 states and territories\u201d and argued that no one candidate \u201chas yet shown the ability to consolidate support.\u201d When the Massachusetts senator took the stage early in Manchester, New Hampshire, she congratulated Sanders and cast herself as the unity candidate, noting that Biden, Buttigieg and Sanders have all targeted one another over the past week. \u201cThese harsh tactics might work if you\u2019re willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing,\u201d Warren said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re going to beat Donald Trump in November, we are going to need huge turnout within our party, and to get that turnout, we will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels they can get behind. We can\u2019t afford to fall into factions. We can\u2019t afford to squander our collective power. We will win when we come together.\u201d As Biden and Warren sought to recalibrate their campaigns, businessman Andrew Yang and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet both dropped out of the race after results began coming in. Biden, who finished fourth in Iowa, dismissed predictions of his demise during a visit to a polling location in New Hampshire on Tuesday morning. But he was already in South Carolina by the time the New Hampshire results rolled in. He hopes to draw attention to his lead in the Palmetto State, casting it as a chance to prove that his strong support among African American voters could carry him to the Democratic nomination. \u201cWe just heard from the first two of 50 states,\u201d Biden told supporters in South Carolina. \u201cWhere I come from that\u2019s the opening bell, not the closing bell. The fight to end Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is just beginning.\u201d In a nod to the lack of minority support for two of his key rivals, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, Biden emphasized that African American voters have historically played an outsized role in selecting the nominee of the Democratic Party. \u201cWe need to hear from Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states and beyond. Look we\u2019re moving into an especially important phase (of the race), because up until now, we haven\u2019t heard from the most committed constituency in the Democratic Party \u2013 the African American community \u2013 and the fastest growing segment of society \u2013 the Latino community,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cNinety-nine point nine percent \u2013 that\u2019s the percentage of African American voters who have not yet had a chance to vote in America.\u201d But Biden\u2019s biggest problem now is that he has built his entire campaign on the premise that he is the most electable candidate against Trump. His fourth place finish in Iowa and fifth place finish in New Hampshire eviscerated that argument. Six in 10 Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire said they were more focused on finding a candidate who could beat Trump, than finding one who agreed with them on the issues. This story has been updated with additional developments throughout the New Hampshire primary. CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip, Eric Bradner and Sarah Mucha contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is hoping to declare the sort of decisive victory that could turn the entire Democratic presidential primary in his favor Tuesday in New Hampshire. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg aims to stop him and force another close tally after their near-tie in the Iowa caucuses eight days ago. Former Vice President Joe Biden is just looking to avoid disaster, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar looks to leapfrog him and emerge as a surprise contender as the campaign moves to Nevada. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, needs a strong showing in her neighboring state to generate the sense of momentum her campaign has lacked in recent weeks. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Here are seven things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary: Sanders didn\u2019t get the result he wanted in Iowa, but New Hampshire \u2013 a rural state with an independent streak that handed him a 22-point victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2013 is his wheelhouse. With so many candidates on the ballot, the margins will be much smaller this time around, but Sanders and his campaign do not want to leave here without having delivered a victory speech. In primetime. With supporters sending donations to match every applause line. Every recent poll of the state shows the senator from neighboring Vermont with a significant, if not runaway, lead over his nearest rival, Buttigieg. The pair have jousted over the last week following their narrow 1-2 finish in Iowa, where their respective campaigns claimed the top slot in an as-yet unresolved contest. But for Sanders, New Hampshire has to be different. There can\u2019t be any doubt. A loss to Buttigieg, who is trying to establish himself as the moderate standard-bearer, would hang a dark cloud over Sanders\u2019 campaign as the contest heads west for Nevada\u2019s caucuses. Sanders figures to do well there, owing to his significant advantage with Latino voters, but anything less than a clear win in New Hampshire would upend the Democratic primary and potentially plant damaging doubts with some of his softer support: specifically, the voters who believe he is the best candidate to reclaim the white working class from President Donald Trump in November. Biden\u2019s campaign has long depended on turning a base of black voters into a win in South Carolina and a huge delegate haul on Super Tuesday. But after a fourth-place finish in Iowa, it\u2019s not clear whether he can survive another weak showing and keep that base intact. To fix his problems, Biden tried several messages in the closing days in New Hampshire. On Saturday, he lambasted Buttigieg\u2019s limited experience as a small-city mayor in the most negative ad of the Democratic race to date. On Sunday, he scrapped those attacks in favor of a message focused on morality. And on Monday, he opened the day telling voters how he\u2019d try to reclaim a strong economy from Trump.  It felt as if his campaign might have been trying every option it had to see if any worked. Biden has already set expectations for a loss here. On Friday, he predicted \u2013 to a national audience, in his first answer of a debate \u2013 he\u2019d \u201cprobably take a hit\u201d in New Hampshire, too. But a strong second-place finish is much different than a distant fourth or fifth. Biden already lags behind several of his rivals in fundraising, and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s presence in the race looms over Super Tuesday. Money drying up after another weak finish might be the most immediate threat to his campaign. Buttigieg, fresh off the news that the Iowa Democratic Party has awarded him the most delegates from last week\u2019s caucuses, has seen a substantial boost in New Hampshire. Polls in late 2019 found him barely in the double digits there \u2013 a CNN/University of New Hampshire survey in October put the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor at 10%. But after the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg saw a surge; the last CNN tracking poll now has the mayor at 22%. By comparison, Sanders has enjoyed a consistent lead in New Hampshire. So, the question for Buttigieg on Tuesday is simple: Can he turn in a second-place performance and how close can he keep things with Sanders? The two have turned up the attacks ahead of the primary \u2013 with Sanders knocking Buttigieg for taking money from wealthy donors and the former mayor responding by casting the Vermont senator as too extreme and unbending for most voters. Buttigieg has touted his Iowa results in New Hampshire, but he has also looked to flatter the New Hampshire voters by describing them as people who \u201cfamously think for\u201d themselves. \u201cI\u2019m also mindful and humbled by the fact that New Hampshire is New Hampshire,\u201d Buttigieg said in Merrimack. \u201cAnd New Hampshire is not the kind of place to let Iowa or anybody else tell you what to do.\u201d But he is hoping the state listens \u2013 even a little \u2013 to Iowa. She\u2019s been relentlessly on message, preaching electability and personal durability while spelling out her signature root-and-branch plans for reforming a corrupt federal government. But Warren underperformed in Iowa, a state where many believed she had the savviest field operation, and only just reached double digits in CNN\u2019s final pre-primary poll of New Hampshire. The Massachusetts senator doesn\u2019t need a miracle here; just a \u201cstrong enough\u201d showing, as her one of most devoted backers, Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green told CNN this weekend, to give her a lift as the contest moves west. On the trail, Warren has told crowds to keep the faith \u2013 that she\u2019s been in \u201cunwinnable fights\u201d before and overcome the odds. \u201cI started out down 19 points, and I had never run for anything before. But every time I got knocked down, I got back up,\u201d Warren said of her 2012 campaign to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown. \u201cAnd I got knocked down again and I got back up. Even on Election Day, people were saying, too close to call, not sure if we\u2019re going to do this. I beat him by seven and a half points, there\u2019s another unwinnable fight.\u201d Her chances of pulling off that kind of comeback in the Granite State appear slim. But what she can\u2019t afford \u2013 perhaps literally, given the fundraising implications \u2013 is to fall out of the top tier, which would mean being overtaken by both Biden and Klobuchar. Buttigieg and Biden will be closely watched \u2013 but both have paths forward in the Democratic race. The moderate candidate with the most riding on Tuesday\u2019s primary is Klobuchar. She finished fifth, on Biden\u2019s heels, in Iowa. If her strong debate performance Friday night, when she pointedly questioned Buttigieg\u2019s experience, catapults her as high as third place in New Hampshire \u2013 possibly ahead of the former vice president and Warren \u2013 it would scramble the Democratic race. Klobuchar won the most votes when a little more than two dozen New Hampshire residents in three tiny townships \u2013 Dixville Notch in the state\u2019s northern tip, nearby Millsfield, and Hart\u2019s Location, further south and tucked in the White Mountains \u2013 cast their ballots shortly after midnight on Tuesday. Klobuchar\u2019s path forward without a surprisingly strong finish in New Hampshire is murky: She has virtually no support among non-white voters who are set to play a much larger role in the Democratic race starting in Nevada, and her late rise hasn\u2019t allowed her to build the kind of campaign organization in Super Tuesday states that other contenders have. At least two other candidates in the moderate category appear to be approaching the ends of their roads. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who focused on New Hampshire with little to show for it in the polls, hasn\u2019t qualified for a debate since last summer. And former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, a late entrant to the primary, hoped his neighboring state would give him a boost and carry him to South Carolina \u2013 where his bet was that Biden would collapse and leave him an opening to win over black voters. But New Hampshire may underscore the difficult of getting into a race months after others began campaigning. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, along with Buttigieg, was arguably the biggest surprise of the 2020 primary. He rose from true obscurity \u2013 when he told his family he was planning to run for president, some replied with, \u201cPresident of what?\u201d \u2013 to garnering a devout and unique following online. His focus on a universal basic income has given his campaign the sort of animating cause that eluded some of his rivals. But that is largely where the success ended. Yang finished with 1% in Iowa and did not receive a national delegate. And his campaign had to lay off staff in the days following the caucuses there, signaling that, despite Yang\u2019s online fundraising prowess, money could be tightening. Yang\u2019s top operatives believe New Hampshire, with more independent voters participating in the Democratic primary, could be better suited to backing the businessman-turned-politician. But recent polling shows Yang in the low single digits here. \u201cIf we don\u2019t show as well in New Hampshire, there will be some reassessment,\u201d said a Yang aide, \u201cespecially if it ends up being the worst-case scenario.\u201d Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard all but moved to New Hampshire in late 2019 \u2013 renting a house to make it easier for her to hold events nearly every day in the Granite State. The strategy has made her one of the most omnipresent candidates in New Hampshire, with the congresswoman even inviting supporters to go snowboarding with her this winter. But that ubiquity has not shown up in polls. Gabbard had 5% in the latest CNN tracking poll of New Hampshire, far behind the top tier of candidates. She barely registered in Iowa, meaning any long-shot bid by the lawmaker is fully dependent on her finish in New Hampshire. \u201cBeing able to spend time here in New Hampshire, we\u2019re able to campaign through old school, grassroots campaigning and be competitive,\u201d Gabbard said, knocking the complex nature of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made this decision.\u201d On Tuesday, Gabbard will find out if that bet was worth it.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said Monday that Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 democratic socialist label would hurt Democrats\u2019 chances of winning control of the Senate in the general election if the Vermont independent is the party\u2019s presidential nominee. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d in New Hampshire on Monday, Biden bragged that Democratic candidates in red states had asked him to campaign with them in the 2018 midterm elections. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cAre they inviting him to speak?\u201d Biden said of Sanders in the interview. \u201cBernie\u2019s a great guy, but it\u2019s his self-definition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the question is who can help us win back the Senate most?\u201d Biden\u2019s comments come as the Democratic field battles over which candidate is the most electable in a general-election matchup with President Donald Trump. Sanders and his campaign have said Biden\u2019s history of backing free-trade agreements and adjustments to entitlement programs would make him vulnerable to attacks from Trump; Biden has responded that Sanders\u2019 progressive platform of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d is politically unrealistic and would alienate voters in swing states. \u201cAre you going to walk into any of those states we have to win, like Florida, and other places that we\u2019re going to win, in Georgia and North Carolina,\u201d and embrace a Democratic nominee who describes himself as a democratic socialist, Biden asked. \u201cWhat do you think Trump is going to do with that?\u201d In the interview, Biden \u2013 who has polled well behind Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in New Hampshire \u2013 admitted he faced an \u201cuphill race here.\u201d He attributed the challenge to running against two candidates, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren,from neighboring states. \u201cI don\u2019t get a sense that there\u2019s any of that kind of panic. I was on the phone today with the South Carolina team; they feel good, I feel good,\u201d Biden said, nodding to the fourth state to vote, after Nevada. And he said no Democratic contender can win the nomination without black voters backing them. \u201cThe only people that have ever won are people who have overwhelming support in the African American community,\u201d he said. Biden argued that he\u2019ll be best positioned to win in swing states against Trump. \u201cThe next nominee is going to have to be able to win in Pennsylvania and Michigan and Arizona and places that \u2026 we didn\u2019t win last time,\u201d he said. Biden also told Lemon he agrees with James Carville, the Democratic operative and former top Bill Clinton aide who in recent days has lambasted Democrats for embracing policies he\u2019s called out of touch with the voters the party will need in a general election. \u201cI think he\u2019s absolutely right about African Americans. I also think he\u2019s right about white middle class folks and working class folks. They want to know what you\u2019re doing. They want authenticity. Tell me what you\u2019re going to do, how it\u2019s going to work, how are we going to pay for it, who\u2019s going to pay for it. And tell me whether it\u2019s real. Can you get it done?\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the place where I think I\u2019m in the strongest position. I\u2019ve been able to bring people together, I\u2019ve been able to get things done \u2013 big things done.\u201d This story has been updated with additional quotes from the interview.",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign settled on a message \u2013 and she isn\u2019t changing it now, even as her path to the nomination begins to look narrower. In the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, the Massachusetts senator began to frame herself as the one candidate in a fractious field with the credentials to unite the Democratic Party ahead of a general election showdown with President Donald Trump. But Warren finished a disappointing third, despite having what many regarded as the best ground game in the state, and is now staring down another potential finish outside the top two in New Hampshire. But as she bolts around the state, Warren has continued to tie her \u201cunity\u201d pitch, along with a consistent assertion that the women in the race are the party\u2019s best bets, into the anti-corruption message that has defined her now more than 13-month-old campaign. Unlike her rivals, Warren has not thrown more than a glancing blow at the other candidates, as she and her team insist their organization is in it for the long haul \u2013 and confident of their prospects as the campaign moves into more diverse states. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cWe have one job in November: beat Donald Trump,\u201d she said at her event in Lebanon on Sunday night. \u201cI was thinking about this and I was thinking about unwinnable fights, because I think they tell us a lot about ourselves, who we are, and the kind of country that we want to have \u2026  Well they\u2019re only unwinnable if you don\u2019t get in the fight and fight it.\u201d She went on to tell the story about how she wanted to be a teacher and how her mother, echoing the conventional wisdom of a bygone generation, tried to manage her expectations. \u201cYou have to remember, I grew up in an America that wasn\u2019t telling little girls they could run for president, it was telling little girls, \u2018get married and find a nice man to take care of you,\u2019\u201d Warren said. \u201cSo the whole time I was growing up, I would talk about how I was going to be a teacher and my mother would talk about, she\u2019ll outgrow it.\u201d She also recalled her triumph in another \u201cunwinnable fight\u201d \u2013 her 2012 campaign against incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts. \u201cI started out down 19 points, and I had never run for anything before. But every time I got knocked down, I got back up,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I got knocked down again and I got back up. Even on Election Day, people were saying, too close to call, not sure if we\u2019re going to do this. I beat him by seven and a half points, there\u2019s another unwinnable fight.\u201d But if Warren is going to get back up in the 2020 Democratic primary, New Hampshire seems unlikely to give her a hand. In CNN\u2019s latest poll of the state, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, Warren stands at 10% \u2013 19 percentage points off the leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders (29%), and about even with former Vice President Joe Biden (11%), whose own campaign is facing an existential crisis ahead of Nevada and South Carolina. Warren\u2019s fundraising, too, has also shown recent signs of flagging. In the final quarter of 2019, Warren announced raising $21.2 million in the final quarter of 2019, falling about $3 million short of what she had raised in the prior quarter, when she was in the middle of a summer surge. And last week, it took five days for her campaign to raise $2 million, per an email to supporters. Comparably, Sen. Amy Klobuchar took in $3 million over a two-day period, following a lauded debate performance. Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have been reporting massive hauls that could allow them to comfortably compete deep into the primary calendar. As she attempts to revive the momentum she enjoyed during a buoyant summer, that put her in the top tier of hopefuls last fall, Warren has kept a packed schedule in New Hampshire, with more events than she did in the days before the Iowa caucus, when she was locked down in Washington for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, with a late flurry of unscheduled stops and town halls. She also received a late joint endorsement from the grassroots veterans organization Common Defense on Monday, which is also backing Sanders. \u201cElizabeth Warren grew up in the same type of working class family that many veterans did,\u201d US Air Force veteran Kathryn Smith, a Common Defense organizer, told CNN. \u201cWe also trust Elizabeth, as commander-in-chief, will end the forever wars in a responsible and expedient manner \u2026 As veterans, our children shouldn\u2019t have to fight the wars we fought.\u201d Despite the headwinds facing her campaign, Warren has retained the support of many progressive groups. Others, like Justice Democrats, have so far declined to issue an endorsement, a quiet affirmation that her strong standing within progressive circles remains intact. Asked recently if she was changing her strategy, post-Iowa, following reports she had canceled ad buys in Nevada and South Carolina, Warren said the reasoning was more mundane. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that we completely finance our campaign through grassroots, and I just always want to be careful about how we spend our money,\u201d she told reporters last week. The campaign might be sagging, but it hasn\u2019t been caught by surprise. In a memo released to the press shortly before the caucuses, Warren\u2019s campaign manager, Roger Lau, touted her nationwide organization and promised to leave troops behind in states, like Iowa, they believe could come into play this fall. He also warned supporters, 10 days out from the first round of voting, that those investments might not pay off in the early state contests. \u201cWe expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday (in March) and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,\u201d Lau wrote. But the narrative around Warren, on the eve of New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary, has been less \u201cbreathless\u201d than muted. The moderate candidates have sucked up most of the oxygen, with Biden attacking Buttigieg, who has shifted his focus to the former vice president, while Klobuchar has taken aim at both. Warren made wave with her criticism of Buttigieg\u2019s handling of race relations in South Bend during Friday night\u2019s debate, but her strong showing didn\u2019t set off a shift in the polls. Instead, the progressive most likely to profit off the moderate infighting appears to be Sanders. Warren\u2019s most vocal organized backers, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, are also being careful to manage expectations \u2013 and pointing to the contests that follow New Hampshire. \u201cI\u2019m actually looking more at South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d PCCC co-founder Adam Green said on Sunday night. \u201cAs other candidates beat each other up and Biden collapses before South Carolina, Warren will be in a prime position to pick up support going into the next couple of states.\u201d Warren has woven distinct and robust policies targeted at the African-American community and women of color into her tapestry of \u201cplans.\u201d As the contests shift away from mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire her supporters are hoping those efforts will sway an electorate that has not yet coalesced around any one candidate. While it\u2019s unclear right now where Warren stands in South Carolina and Nevada \u2013 most of the polling has focused in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 her campaign has invested in the final two early contests. It has 10 offices in South Carolina and eight in Nevada, as well as a significant ground game in both states. Warren has already begun shifting to do local press in Nevada, with a radio interview with KCEP Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting more moments like last year\u2019s She The People forum (last April in Houston), when Warren was the only candidate to earn a standing ovation from women of color in the crowd,\u201d Green said. \u201cAs long as we are strong enough coming out of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina present good opportunities for Warren.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders on Friday launched a series of attacks against Pete Buttigieg, suggesting that the former South Bend mayor could not, if elected, be trusted to pushback against the rich individuals and powerful interests that have donated to his campaign. Four days out from the New Hampshire primary, and just hours away from a debate Friday night, the two appear to be on a collision course, with Sanders leading the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive line and Buttigieg, following his strong showing in Iowa, emerging as the primary\u2019s moderate champion. \u201cButtigieg has received campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires, from the CEOs of the largest drug companies in this country, from fossil fuel (financiers), from Wall Street,\u201d Sanders said in an interview with CNN. \u201cDo you think that when people receive money from powerful special interests that they\u2019re really going to stand up to those special interests and do what has to be done for the working class in this country? I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Sanders\u2019 sharper tone comes as Buttigieg, following a strong performance in Iowa, hopes to ride his Hawkeye State momentum to victory in New Hampshire, a state the Vermont senator won by more than 20 points in 2016 and has led in recent polls. Earlier in the day, at a Politics and Eggs breakfast here, Sanders read out a variety of headlines that depicted Buttigieg as overly cozy with moneyed interests. Buttigieg has also ramped up his previous round of attacks on Sanders. In a fundraising email Thursday, his campaign touted its post-Iowa haul before taking aim at progressive outside groups supporting Sanders. \u201cBernie is still first in the polls in New Hampshire, and we\u2019re being massively outraised by his campaign,\u201d the appeal read, before turning to Sanders\u2019 outside support. \u201cIn January alone, his campaign raised more than $25 million, and they\u2019re being supported by NINE outside dark money groups, too.\u201d When asked to respond to Sanders\u2019 initial criticism, the Buttigieg campaign pointed to the former mayor\u2019s comments about campaign finance reform Thursday night on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \u201cI understand the frustration and I\u2019m not a fan of the campaign finance system we have today. I\u2019m also a fan of beating Donald Trump,\u201d Buttigieg told Colbert. \u201cI will make exactly one promise to anybody, whether they\u2019re giving three bucks online or the maximum allowable by law, and the promise is I\u2019m going to take that contribution and I\u2019m going to use it to build the campaign that\u2019s going to defeat Donald Trump so that we can actually get the reforms that this country needs.\u201d Looking beyond New Hampshire, which like Iowa is overwhelmingly white, Sanders told CNN that he believed he was better positioned than Buttigieg to win in Nevada and South Carolina, the more diverse states that follow New Hampshire on the primary calendar. \u201cI think we have a real advantage. We have been running a campaign, which addresses many of the major crises facing the African American community, facing the Latino community,\u201d Sanders said, pointing this performance in last week\u2019s caucuses as evidence of his growing appeal to minority voters. \u201cWe did extraordinarily well (In Iowa with) Latino voters who understand that we are standing up and fighting for their rights.\u201d Sanders first took clear aim at Buttigieg earlier in the day, when he sought to frame the coming vote as an existential decision between his progressive vision and a faction in the party that welcomes and courts big dollar donors. \u201cThis campaign is about which side are you on,\u201d Sanders told the crowd, referencing the Woody Guthrie song. \u201cAre you on the side of the working class of this country, which has been battered for the last 45 years, are you willing to take on the greed and corruption of the billionaire class and the 1%, or will you continue to stand with the big money?\u201d The headlines Sanders read aloud included a Forbes article detailing how Buttigieg has the most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat, an article from the Washington Post about how after a strong performance in Iowa that states Buttigieg is \u201cgetting an even closer look\u201d from Wall Street donors, and a Forbes article revealing the list of billionaires that support Buttigieg\u2019s campaign. \u201cI like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,\u201d Sanders said after ticking through the list of headlines. \u201cBut we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.\u201d After the event, Sanders debuted a new hashtag on Twitter, #PetesBillionaires, which included screenshots of the headlines Sanders had read during his speech. Sanders has accused Buttigieg of being bought and paid-for by big money before, notably during the controversy over the former mayor\u2019s decision to hold a fundraiser in a wine cave. Sanders addressed the issue directly with supporters and Sanders aides wore T-shirts reading \u201cPetesWineCave.com\u201d to December\u2019s primary debate, but his comments on Friday signaled a belief that the two campaigns could be competing in a tier of their own in New Hampshire This story has been updated with an interview with Bernie Sanders.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised $25 million in January, his campaign said Thursday, a staggering sum that marks his highest monthly total since entering the race a year ago. The haul surpassed his totals from the first and second quarters of 2019 combined, and nearly matched his third quarter total of $25.3 million. He led the Democratic primary field with $34.5 million in contributions over the final three months of the year. Sanders\u2019 campaign spent $50 million during the final quarter of 2019, exceeding its intake, but still began January with $18.2 million in cash-on-hand. His January fundraising figures underscore the enduring power of his grassroots donor base, which will allow him to compete \u2013 and spend big \u2013 deep into what could be a long and expensive primary contest. RELATED: CNN\u2019S Election Center With big states like California, which votes on Super Tuesday in March, on the horizon, the new money will be crucial in paying for pricey television ad time and a large field operation at a time when billionaire Michael Bloomberg is already spending at an unprecedented clip. January\u2019s total brings the amount Sanders has raised since entering the race in February 2019 to $121 million. The campaign also reported that January\u2019s fundraising came from more than 1.3 million donations from more than 648,000 people, of which over 219,000 gave for the first time. \u201cBernie\u2019s multiracial, multigenerational, people-driven movement for change is fueling 2020\u2019s most aggressive campaign for president,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. \u201cWorking class Americans giving $18 at a time are putting our campaign in a strong position to compete in states all over the map.\u201d The Sanders campaign said virtually all of its donors, more than 99.9%, have not yet given the legal maximum, meaning he is well-positioned to continue posting eye-popping numbers as the campaign moves forward. Among Sanders\u2019 January donors, \u201cteacher\u201d was the most common occupation and the five most common employers were Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, the United States Postal Service and Target. The average donation was $18.72. Since he got in the race, Sanders has continued to break fundraising barriers. The campaign crossed the 5 million individual contribution mark in January, a milestone his aides said no other presidential contender had achieved at a similar point in a presidential campaign. Including January, the campaign has now received 6.4 million individual donations. Sanders was also the first Democratic candidate to have 1 million people donate to his campaign, a benchmark the campaign hit in September. That number has now grown to over 1.5 million people, according to the campaign. In addition to the news of their massive January fundraising total, the Sanders campaign announced Thursday that it will invest $5.5 million in television and digital ads and hire a significant number of new staff in 10 Super Tuesday states. The most states targeted in the buy \u2013 Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah \u2013 are new investments for the campaign, while the buys made in California and Texas expand on previous investments.

            "article_content": "The State of the Union address Tuesday night gives President Donald Trump the chance to shift from weakness to strength by spotlighting the resilient American economy. The President\u2019s weakness \u2013 his insistence on crossing behavioral and ethical, if not legal, lines \u2013 landed him in the Senate impeachment trial scheduled to conclude Wednesday. It has made Trump the only modern President never to reach 50% job approval among the American public. But economic performance on his watch justifies boasting on the biggest stage American presidents command. No wonder Trump ahead of the Super Bowl previewed Tuesday night\u2019s remarks as \u201cvery, very positive.\u201d Growth has slowed lately after the short-term acceleration in 2018, stimulated by tax cuts and spending increases. It remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as the coronavirus crisis that\u2019s frightening investors, and the self-inflicted wound of trade conflict, which dampened business confidence before Trump called a truce with China last month. Yet nine months before Election Day, history places the Trump economy squarely in territory consistent with winning another term. Of his six most recent predecessors, each one who avoided an economic downturn in the last half of his first term won reelection. Only Bill Clinton and Trump, so far, avoided any brush with recession at all. Unpresidential behavior notwithstanding, Trump has overseen a three-year extension of the expansion he inherited from Barack Obama. The expansion has broken previous records to become the longest in US history. It has driven unemployment to its lowest rate in a half-century and boosted wages for average workers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 43% since his inauguration. All Presidents have limited ability to shift the trajectory of America\u2019s $20 trillion economy. That hasn\u2019t stopped Trump from characteristically wild exaggerations, which television viewers can expect to hear again Tuesday night as he touts \u201cThe Great American Comeback.\u201d He has not created \u201cthe greatest economy in the history of our country.\u201d The late-1990s boom under Clinton produced far more robust growth. He has not ended an economic \u201cnightmare\u201d by replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US-Mexico-Canada deal he signed last week. It actually represents a modest revision of NAFTA, much of it negotiated by the Obama administration for the larger Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump junked. He has not delivered job gains \u201cnobody would\u2019ve believed\u201d before his presidency. The 8 million jobs created during Obama\u2019s last three years in office outnumbers those created in Trump\u2019s first three. In fact, Trump has largely surfed growth and employment trends that began in the Obama-era recovery from the Great Recession. The 2% annual growth economists now forecast over the next decade matches forecasts from before he took office. \u201cThe potential of the US economy to produce goods and services has not fundamentally changed,\u201d observes Michael Strain, who directs economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Yet Strain sees an opening for Trump to brighten a national economic debate that has emphasized shrinking opportunities for middle- and working-class Americans. His forthcoming book, \u201cThe American Dream Is Not Dead,\u201d argues that both parties have overlooked improving conditions while playing to voter anxieties. Trump\u2019s eventual Democratic opponent \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden or anyone else \u2013 will make those anxieties a central theme this fall. Organizational bungling in the Iowa caucuses temporarily delayed the first round of competition. But presidential incumbents, as Ronald Reagan showed with his 1984 \u201cMorning in America\u201d campaign, usually strike upbeat themes as they argue for another term. Holes in Trump\u2019s record complicate his case. He has not delivered better health care coverage to vulnerable Americans, instead threatening benefits they gained under Obamacare. He has not upgraded American infrastructure or revived a coal industry still beset by economic and environmental pressures that drive down demand. Manufacturing \u2013 the object of his pledge to end the \u201ccarnage\u201d afflicting blue-collar workers \u2013 has fallen into recession. Despite his promises to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut has ballooned the federal budget deficit, delivered its greatest rewards to wealthy Americans and failed to sustain growth of 3% or more. Business investment lags even after the top corporate tax rate dropped from 35% to 21%. Spending by consumers has sustained Trump-era growth. And economists see their confidence as fragile. \u201cConsumers say they feel good, but have proven they\u2019ve grown more susceptible to a negative news shock,\u201d notes Diane Swonk, chief economist for the business consulting firm Grant Thornton. That raises the stakes for Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, which threatens to damage global economic activity. His administration has not earned a reputation for competent governance. The coronavirus wild card could yet trigger a 2020 recession, which Mark Zandi of Moody\u2019s Analytics calls a 35% possibility. So could setbacks on trade policy. Fear of economic fallout led White House advisers to dissuade Trump from new tariffs on imports from China late last year. But an unpredictable president governed by impulse often bucks attempts to control him \u2013 on the economy, national security and everything else. The nature of 21st century polarization makes culture at least as important as the economy in driving election outcomes. No one doubts Trump could return to truculent populism if he deems it necessary to motivate core supporters, whatever economic advisers say. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen to them,\u201d says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, once a top economic aide to President George W. Bush. \u201cWho knows what he\u2019ll do?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voters here are set to settle what for months has been a tight four-person contest as Iowa becomes the first state to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have all been closely bunched in the polls. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has attempted a late climb as well. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang outpaced every other Democrat, holding 78 events in Iowa in the last month before the caucuses. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race In seven of the last nine competitive Democratic primaries, the candidate who placed first in the Iowa caucuses went on to become the party\u2019s presidential nominee. Here are six things to watch in the Iowa caucuses: One question that could determine Monday night\u2019s outcome is how many Iowa Democrats turn out to vote: Will it top 2008\u2019s record of nearly 240,000 caucusgoers, as Iowa Democrats for months had expected? Or will it be somewhere between that record and 2016\u2019s more muted turnout of about 171,000? Sanders\u2019 campaign \u2013 which has emphasized finding new voters, particularly Latinos \u2013 believes the higher turnout climbs, the better it is for them. Biden, meanwhile, could benefit from lower turnout, with his support coming from older, traditional Democrats who never miss caucuses. It's a clich\u00e9 because it's true: It all comes down to turnout in Iowa But it\u2019s not all about the total turnout. Campaigns will closely watch entrance polls to see the age of the electorate. In 2016, for example, 28% of voters were 65 or older. It\u2019s a group Biden performs best with, he\u2019d benefit if it increases. Region matters, too. Warren has concentrated her campaign on the suburbs \u2013 the sorts of areas where voters, especially women, propelled Democrats to victory in the 2018 midterms. If that surge carries over in 2020, it\u2019d be a boon for her hopes. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has been focused on turning out disaffected Republicans in rural areas. If those Republicans and independents make up a larger-than-usual share of the electorate, it\u2019d be good news for Buttigieg, Biden and Klobuchar. Iowa Democrats are releasing more information about caucus results than usual this year \u2013 and it could cause some confusion, and give more than one campaign reason to declare victory. The most important number \u2013 the one news organizations like CNN will focus on to determine the winner \u2013 is state delegates won. Each precinct sends delegates to county conventions, who then send delegates to the state convention. The \u201cstate delegate equivalents\u201d \u2013 the number that\u2019ll be the focus Monday night \u2013 are the estimated number of delegates candidates have won to the state convention based on their results in each precinct. The Iowa caucuses, explained But another number that some campaigns are likely to emphasize is the raw vote total. The state Democratic Party will release the total number of people at each precinct that lined up with each candidate at the start of the caucuses. Then, after realignment \u2013 the process where those who fall short of 15% are eliminated, with their supporters either choosing a different candidate to back or going home \u2013 the state party will release those raw vote totals as well. It\u2019s possible the same person won\u2019t win all those categories. Some candidates could turn in strong performances in urban areas but fall short of 15% in rural areas and fail to pick up any delegates \u2013 or vice versa. Campaigns are likely to pick and choose the data that\u2019s best for them to emphasize. The three top moderate candidates in the race \u2013 Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2013 are all running to win on Monday night. But they are also running to finish ahead of each other. The thinking goes like this: With most operatives anticipating a Sanders win on Monday night, the three candidates want to be able to leave the state claiming the title of top challenger to the Vermont senator. This is because the race after Iowa will likely be viewed after as a contest between one or two progressives and another group of moderates, so finishing atop an ideological cohort could give the top candidates needed momentum in New Hampshire. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. I need to have a good finish here in Iowa,\u201d Buttigieg said on Sunday. Biden, too, has been playing pundit and publicly downplaying the need to be first in Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between second and fourth,\u201d Biden told CNN in Mount Pleasant. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really tight no matter how it works out. It\u2019s been bunched up. It\u2019s going to remain bunched up I think.\u201d He added: \u201cI just think it\u2019s a different year in that I think the measure, you all won\u2019t do it now and I don\u2019t mean it in a bad way, but I think what you\u2019re going to have to measure is who can represent every aspect of the Democratic Party.\u201d Iowa has more counties that voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Donald Trump in 2016 \u2013 and almost every campaign in Iowa has looked to court voters in these states as a sign of their ability to take on the President in 2020. What happens in these counties \u2013 including who wins and what turnout is \u2013 will speak volumes about each candidate\u2019s ability to win in contested counties and whether Democrats\u2019 theory that some disaffected Republicans are ready to break with Trump is true. No candidate has made this pitch more forcefully than Buttigieg, who spent the final weeks in Iowa rallying supporters in many of these areas \u201cRegardless of how you voted before \u2013 what party, if any \u2013 you belong to you belong here,\u201d Buttigieg said this week in Cerro Gordo County, a place that went to Obama in 2008 and 2012 but went for Trump in 2016. Klobuchar is the only candidate that has visited every so-called pivot county, and her campaign has made her ability to win over rural, conservative voters central to her pitch. \u201cI see a coalition that is much bigger than what some people see,\u201d Klobuchar said on Saturday. \u201cI see fired up Democrats and I see people in rural and suburban, and I want to bring them with us and we really need to bring with us in this general election.\u201d What happens in these pivot counties \u2013 especially Cerro Gordo, Dubuque and Clinton counties \u2013 will be telling, not only for who wins the Iowa caucuses, but how they are positioned going into November. Sanders waged his campaign in Iowa with a clear proposition: that higher turnout among working class, young and Latino voters would all but guarantee victory. If his bet comes in on Monday night, the campaign is confident that it will head to New Hampshire, where Sanders won handily in 2016, with both history and momentum on his side. Sanders\u2019 Iowa team has been organizing in Latino communities and in other parts of the state with populations that don\u2019t traditionally tend to make big showings on caucus night for nearly a year. They have organized soccer games and advertised aggressively on Spanish-language radio. They have camped out organizers and volunteers in Casey\u2019s stores around the state, in order to meet working class voters where they shop and kibbitz. Latinos only make up about 7% of the state\u2019s population, but the community skews younger \u2013 so, as seen in the polls, likely toward Sanders \u2013 and could potentially provide the boost he needs in what is expected to be an extraordinarily tight final count. As many Sanders aides are quick to note or ready to concede, there are more than a few delegates on the line here. A strong showing in Iowa will serve as validation for their theory of how to run a successful campaign at a time when Democrats, and the left more broadly, is searching for ways to forge a new progressive coalition. Other camps, typically the moderates, argue that more affluent suburban voters hold the keys to Democrats\u2019 reclaiming the presidency, much in the same way they helped deliver a House majority last year. Sanders isn\u2019t writing off those groups or those parts of the state, but if he is going to win on Monday, it will be on the strength of a big, broad and diverse electorate turning up, and turning out for him. Progressive leaders with an affinity for both Sanders and Warren would like nothing more than to see them run 1-2 on Monday night, a result that would by definition mean Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar underperformed, and signal the strength of the left going forward. Though they tend to pull support from different pools of voters, Sanders and Warren remain the progressive movement\u2019s most recognizable \u2013 and, at least among those most inclined to their politics \u2013 beloved figures. To see them dominate the caucuses would be a shot of adrenaline that could carry into New Hampshire, a state that borders both of their own. But in the end, of course, there can only be one. And if Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 campaigns leave Iowa with impression that their next step on the road to a potential nomination is to consolidate progressives, the movement might have some cause for concern. Warren and Sanders are friends, as they both have been increasingly quick to remind reporters in the wake of the scuffle over the contents of their now famous 2018 meeting, but they are also both running massive campaign operations with differing messages. Warren has in recent weeks played up her ability to unite Democratic factions. Sanders, though repeatedly promising to back the eventual nominee, does not make that distinct argument. His goal, in stark terms, is to defeat the establishment and then count on its support when he faces off with Trump. So the progressive nightmare scenario is closely attached to the dream one. It looks like a divisive campaign pitting the left\u2019s standard-bearers against one another and, in the process, clearing a path for a moderate resurgence.",

            "article_content": "After months of identifying their likeliest supporters, the Democratic 2020 contenders are entering a final weekend of door-knocking and phone-banking in Iowa hoping to tip caucus-night turnout in their favor. The key questions are how many voters will show up Monday night, and how different \u2013 younger or older; more liberal or more moderate; more heavily Latino than usual for Iowa \u2013 that turnout will look from Democratic caucus-going crowds in 2008 and 2016. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is betting on turnout that would break 2008\u2019s record of nearly 240,000, growing his progressive base by adding first-time caucus-goers who are younger and heavily Latino. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is an older crowd of reliable Democratic voters, with a heavier-than-usual sprinkling of independents and disaffected Republicans. Biden is hoping to turn in strong performances in rural and union-heavy areas. Lower turnout \u2013 between 2008 and 2016\u2019s 172,000 \u2013 could benefit his campaign. Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib boos Hillary Clinton at Sanders campaign event in Iowa Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are both hoping for boosts from their best-in-class organizations \u2013 with Warren\u2019s travel schedule suggesting she is focused on turning out progressive voters in cities and suburbs, while Buttigieg targets rural areas with disaffected Republicans much like Biden. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The key drivers of turnout, top Iowa Democrats said, are suburban and college towns: the areas around Des Moines, particularly its fast-growing western portions; and places like Iowa City, the home of the University of Iowa, and Ames, where Iowa State University is located. Just as important as turnout is who the new voters are. Monmouth University released a poll Thursday showing Biden narrowly ahead of Sanders, 23% to 21%, using a model based on 2008\u2019s turnout. But pollster Patrick Murphy said if caucus-night turnout consists of traditional Democratic voters, Biden\u2019s edge could jump to six points; while Sanders has a four-point lead if the caucus electorate consists more heavily of voters who do not ordinarily participate in primary elections. \u201cA turnout swing of as few of 10,000 voters could determine who \u2018wins\u2019 the caucus if it is driven by a specific demographic group,\u201d Murray said in a statement accompanying the poll\u2019s release. Five takeaways from Democrats' 2020 fundraising Iowa Democratic officials have long said they are prepared for turnout to exceed 2008\u2019s record of nearly 240,000. \u201cIt is always hard to predict caucus turnout but we as a party have been prepared for record turnout all along,\u201d said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price. \u201cThat is why we have big rooms; that is why we have a lot of materials.\u201d But several leading Democratic campaigns in recent months have revised their turnout expectations downward, saying this year doesn\u2019t match 2008 \u2013 a year in which then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as John Edwards, were all running among the best campaigns the state has ever seen. Tom Miller, the long-time Iowa attorney general who campaigned with Biden this week, said the record-breaking 2008 caucuses were \u201cunique\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that this year won\u2019t replicate its explosion in new voters. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good idea of the people that will come\u201d on caucus night this year, Miller said. After the Flood: Iowans will help decide the country's future, but this town is unsure of its own Biden\u2019s campaign has focused the former vice president\u2019s travel schedule in the final sprint on rural areas where he hopes independents and disaffected Republicans looking for a moderate Democratic alternative to Trump make up a larger-than-usual share of the electorate. His campaign is targeting Catholics, military veterans and union members, a Biden aide said, with his travel schedule also focusing on union-heavy eastern Iowa. Biden\u2019s closing argument has emphasized his electability, highlighting how he has withstood attacks from Republicans defending President Donald Trump amid impeachment proceedings on Capitol Hill. He has campaigned with Iowa Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, two first-term Democrats who won previously Republican-held seats \u2013 an effort to demonstrate that Biden could help down-ballot Democrats. Other candidates are also targeting suburban and rural voters, expecting those portions of the electorate to be more moderate. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s campaign is expecting turnout around 2008 levels \u2013 down from the record-breaking numbers it had previously expected, according to a source familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking. The source said Klobuchar\u2019s campaign believes the record could be broken, but not by much. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign believes turnout will be in the 2008 range, between 210,000 and 240,000, according to a source familiar with the campaign\u2019s strategy. \u201cIn the more suburban and rural area, if there are significant chunks of new caucus-goers showing up, that is very positive for us,\u201d the source said. One measure campaigns will be watching closely is the age of the caucus-going electorate. In 2016, 28% of Iowa caucus-goers were 65 or older, entrance polls showed. If that number climbs, it would likely benefit Biden, who has consistently drawn older audiences at his campaign events and polls better with older voters. If the 18% of voters between 17 and 29 jumps, it would likely benefit Sanders. Biden burns through cash ahead of early 2020 contests More progressive candidates, like Sanders and Warren, are banking on higher turnout. \u201cIf there\u2019s a huge voter turnout, you can turn off your TV \u2013 Bernie won,\u201d Sanders spokesman Mike Casca said. Sanders and his estimable volunteer army have been working since early on in the primary to expand the electorate in Iowa, with a particular focus on Latino communities around the state, which tend to skew younger \u2013 and, the campaign believes, toward Sanders if they come out in higher proportions on Monday. The caucuses will also provide the first live-fire verdict on the effectiveness of the campaign\u2019s \u201cBERN app,\u201d a digital organizing tool used by organizers and volunteers to help them identify and target potential supporters. Early indications suggest it has helped facilitate the kind of peer-to-peer engagement the campaign encourages. Top staff recently decided to ask some supporters who had been making dialing from out of state to redirect their energies to other primary hotspots around the country, or their own neighborhoods, because of an oversaturation of calls into Iowa. On the stump, Sanders has been banging the turnout drum in speeches and talks around the state. Last weekend, during a brief break from Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, he warned supporters against becoming complacent in the final stretch. \u201cThere was a poll that came out today that had us all of one point in the lead. That tells me this is going to be a very, very tight election,\u201d Sanders said in Ames. \u201cAnd it tells me that the candidate will win, which campaign has the best get out the vote effort. Polls are one thing, getting out the vote is something else.\u201d Bernie Sanders burns through $50 million in last three months of the year Sanders added: \u201cIf there is a large voter turnout \u2013 if working people and young people come out in large numbers \u2013 we will win and win big.\u201d Warren is banking on what a number of Iowa-wise operatives and elected officials have long viewed as her best-in-class ground game to deliver what would, in light of recent polling, be an upset victory Monday. In an interview with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe on his \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast last year, Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s former campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, also an Obama campaign veteran, singled out Warren\u2019s Iowa operation. \u201cI have been really impressed by the organization that Elizabeth Warren has built on the ground,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said. \u201cHer team (in Iowa) is very strong. They\u2019re just doing the work every day, and I think that that\u2019s just been apparent from the start.\u201d In a call with this week hosted by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Iowa State Sen. Zach Wahls, who endorsed Warren in October, described what her winning coalition might look like. \u201cI think that the fact that she is able to energize some of those outsider or progressive folks who may not be traditional caucus goers, plus have that strong crossover appeal with folks who are kind of the more standard Iowa caucus goer, I think is what gives her that ability to unite the party to both win the caucuses and to unite the party in November,\u201d Wahls said.",

            "article_content": "Michael Bloomberg is skipping Monday\u2019s Democratic caucuses in Iowa. But that doesn\u2019t mean his presence isn\u2019t worrying Democrats hellbent on winning here. Bloomberg, by ignoring the first nominating contests, is attempting something that no nominee in nearly a half century has ever done successfully. But the former New York mayor is leveraging his massive personal wealth and ability to air endless positive ads about himself to operate in an entirely different universe from his Democratic opponents, one where he is almost exclusively running against President Donald Trump and is divorced from the day-to-day machinations of the Democratic primary. While former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg court voters at town halls in Iowa and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont jockey for progressive support in neighboring New Hampshire, Bloomberg\u2019s team is building a campaign staff of more than 1,000 as the mayor visits 24 states. Bloomberg also has spent more than $286 million on television, digital and radio ads \u2013 including a $10 million spot focused on his work to combat gun violence that is slated to run Sunday during the Super Bowl. He\u2019s already picked up the endorsements of more than 30 of the nation\u2019s mayors, including on Thursday by Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, a high-profile black Democrat. So far, the strategy has shown signs of working \u2013 the endless positive ads have vaulted Bloomberg nationally to 10% in a recent Fox News poll and to 8% in a Quinnipiac survey, allowing him to pull even or slightly ahead of Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And his Democratic opponents are starting to take notice of him and his money and to demand that Bloomberg \u2013 once viewed as a long shot for the nomination \u2013 take part in a debate. DC mayor endorses Michael Bloomberg for president Klobuchar said this week that it was time for the former mayor, instead of just spending money, to \u201cbe on the stage and be able to go back and forth so that voters can evaluate him.\u201d Progressive groups have made the same argument and are now publicly pushing the Democratic National Committee \u2013 as Bloomberg rises in national polls \u2013 to get him on the stage so his opponents can take him on. All of this is welcome news in Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt is very intentional,\u201d Dan Kanninen, Bloomberg\u2019s states director, said of the former mayor\u2019s strategy to largely ignore the Democratic primary for now. \u201cIt\u2019s being like on a different plane, where we can simply have our opponent be the president in the battlegrounds that matter for the fall, which also happen to be battlegrounds on Super Tuesday and beyond.\u201d Kanninen referred to the nominating process and the first four states as a \u201cquirk of the system\u201d that forces \u201cmore traditional candidates into that narrow box.\u201d \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he added, \u201cis an advantage that we have.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s ad spending has been central to his strategy, and the attention those ads have created has afforded him the momentum that most candidates need to survive after the first nominating contests. The nearly $300 million he has spent on ads dwarfs what candidates like Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren have spent by a factor of 10, and Bloomberg is already on track to spend more than $100 million in the Super Tuesday states, which vote March 3, including a whopping $59 million in California and Texas. Bloomberg\u2019s ads \u2013 and that he has been unchallenged, for now, by other Democrats \u2013 have also allowed him to both introduce himself to the country in a positive light, with most of his spots focused on key issues for Democratic voters and on his upbringing, and to take on Trump. \u201cHe could\u2019ve just been the middle-class kid who made good, but Mike Bloomberg became the guy who did good,\u201d a narrator says in one of his spots. \u201cAnd now, he\u2019s taking on him,\u201d the ad continues, as images of Trump are displayed. Bloomberg\u2019s strategy has its potential hazards. Money can create momentum, but Bloomberg still faces the same dynamics that all other candidates do in the Democratic primary, especially regarding the need to win over a diverse mix of voters that represent the Democratic electorate. Bloomberg to air gun control ad during the Super Bowl Bloomberg disavowed his previous deep support for stringent policing laws such as stop and frisk, seen as a liability for him among African Americans, who make up a key Democratic constituency. But Democratic operatives eyeing a serious Bloomberg run see that past support as a clear area for opponents to attack the former mayor. Bloomberg is looking to combat those questions with high-profile black validators like Bowser, former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Columbia, South Carolina, Mayor Steve Benjamin, and ads that feature black supporters, like his upcoming Super Bowl spot, which features a black woman whose son was shot and killed in 2013. His entire plan could also be dashed if a consensus winner emerges from the first four contests, leading people close to the mayor to privately hope that multiple candidates win the primaries and caucuses in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, thereby limiting the amount of momentum each candidate has heading into March. \u201cWhat\u2019s undeniable is that Bloomberg is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to go from zero to a higher number in the polls, but how durable that is should be measured after Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d said a top Democratic donor who is supporting another candidate. The most concerning scenario for Democrats is the possibility that a bruising January and February could hurt candidates competing in the first four contests and allow a largely unscathed Bloomberg to step in once voting begins in March. \u201cI think that instead of just putting your money out there, he\u2019s actually got to be on the stage and be able to go back and forth so that voters can evaluate him,\u201d Klobuchar said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren in the Democratic primary, has asked the Democratic National Committee to change its debate criteria to ensure Bloomberg\u2019s inclusion if he climbs substantially in the polls. Politico first reported the group\u2019s lobbying efforts at the DNC. Bernie Sanders is the Iowa favorite, but he is far from a sure thing Currently, candidates have two paths to qualify for the next debate February 7 in New Hampshire: Hit either fundraising and polling thresholds or win at least one pledged delegate out of the Iowa caucuses. Since Bloomberg isn\u2019t taking money from donors and is not competing in the Hawkeye State, he\u2019s unlikely to meet any of those criteria. \u201cIt makes no logical sense for someone who is spending a quarter-billion dollars and buying himself numbers in the polls to avoid the scrutiny of being in the debate mix, especially someone who is as corporate as Michael Bloomberg is in an economic populist era,\u201d Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told CNN this week. Green said there\u2019s a \u201creal possibility\u201d the DNC will agree to alter the debate rules before Super Tuesday. \u201cI wasn\u2019t laughed out of the room,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they are committed to the principle that candidates who voters need to hear from should be on the debate stage.\u201d DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the national party has not set any debate criteria beyond the New Hampshire event and declined further comment. Kanninen said Bloomberg is not shying away from the debates. \u201cMike Bloomberg is a pretty tough guy himself,\u201d Kanninen said, \u201cand someone who has been mayor of New York \u2026 for three terms and knows how to handle himself in the debate.\u201d For now, though, the former mayor and his large team of operatives are happy to focus more on the President than people like Klobuchar, hoping that it forces voters to think about a general election matchup between Bloomberg and Trump. This was clear earlier this month, when Trump, reportedly after seeing a Bloomberg ad on television, laid into his former mayor on Twitter, labeling him \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg.\u201d Bloomberg responded \u2013 \u201cObsessed Much,\u201d he asked \u2013 a sign that he is enjoying getting into the President\u2019s head. \u201cIt does validate the fact that what we\u2019re doing is working when the President is that nervous about us,\u201d said Kanninen. \u201cHe does this kind of stuff when he wants to put his thumb on the scale and pick his opponent. And clearly he does not want to get run against Michael Bloomberg.\u201d This wouldn\u2019t be the first time Bloomberg has used his immense wealth to get into the heads of his opponents. During his mayoral run in 2009, the mayor\u2019s team bought up all the available digital ad inventory in the neighborhood of his opponent, Anthony Weiner, according to former Bloomberg adviser Brad Tusk. \u201cEvery time Anthony opened his computer, we wanted him to see us,\u201d Tusk wrote in his book. \u201cEvery time, he logged off, we wanted to be the last thing he saw.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is finally getting the fight he wanted. After spending a week mired in a back-and-forth with fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, Sanders on Saturday came under some welcome fire from Joe Biden over the tactics used by his camp to criticize the former vice president\u2019s record on Social Security. The clash comes less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, with the latest polls showing Sanders, Biden, Warren, and Pete Buttigieg all within striking distance of victory \u2013 and one another. The Sanders campaign sought out direct conflict with Biden throughout the campaign, but the candidate and his supporters sharpened their attacks over the last 24 hours as they worked to highlight the contrasts between Sanders\u2019 expansive, progressive vision and Biden\u2019s pledge to restore normalcy in Washington by seeking a measure of reconciliation with Republicans. Biden\u2019s instinct for deal-making, often to the frustration of liberals, is now under renewed scrutiny as part of that debate. At an event in Iowa, he accused \u201cBernie\u2019s people\u201d of promoting a \u201cdoctored video \u2026 saying that I agreed with Paul Ryan, the former vice presidential candidate, about wanting to privatize Social Security.\u201d The claim set off its own debate over the veracity of the clip, which was taken from Biden\u2019s 2018 speech at the Brookings Institution. Though the video takes Biden\u2019s remarks that day out of context, it has not been altered. But questions over the video, which has been shared by senior Sanders aides, have now given way to a broader clash \u2013 which the Sanders campaign has been pushing for weeks but Sanders himself did not bring up during last week\u2019s debate \u2013 over Biden\u2019s past willingness to entertain negotiations with Republicans over deals that would either slow the program\u2019s growth or reduce its scope. Speaking to reporters on Sunday in New Hampshire, Sanders dug in on the charges. \u201cI think anyone who looks at the vice president\u2019s record understands that time after time after time, Joe has talked about the need to cut Social Security,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s in the congressional record. He has said that many, many times. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s disputable.\u201d Sanders specifically cited Biden\u2019s role in \u201cthe so-called \u2018Balanced Budget\u2019 effort,\u201d a mid-1990s push to require by law that government spending does not exceed revenue in a given fiscal year, before highlighting his opposition: \u201cI put together a \u2013 we called it a \u2018defending Social Security caucus,\u2019 (and) played a very active role in saying, \u2018No, you can\u2019t cut Social Security when for millions of elderly people, this is what they live on.\u2019 You can\u2019t cut it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s said it many, many times,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cthat he believes it appropriate to cut social security or freeze (cost-of-living adjustments) or to raise the retirement age. That\u2019s just the record. I don\u2019t think anyone can debate that.\u201d The questions over Biden\u2019s speech, though, muddled the campaign\u2019s attempt to bring the fundamental issue to the foreground. Sanders campaign speechwriter David Sirota previously cited Biden\u2019s Brookings speech in a newsletter to supporters, writing that Biden \u201clauded Paul Ryan for proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\u201d PolitiFact rated that description as \u201cfalse,\u201d writing that Sirota had misrepresented Biden\u2019s \u201csarcastic\u201d comment about Ryan. Social Security is one of the most popular government programs across party lines, along with Medicare, and many high-ranking Democrats in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 like Biden \u2013 sought to signal their seriousness about the deficit by expressing a willingness to negotiate with the GOP over plans to slow its growth or raise the retirement age. Despite having gone on the record in the past decades saying he would be willing to buck his party to strike a bipartisan deal on Social Security, Biden drew a clear line on one of the most aggressive GOP proposals: The George W. Bush administration quickly abandoned a 2005 move to privatize it. Biden spokesman Andrew Bates on Sunday pushed back against the full force of the Sanders campaign and its supporters, who have flooded social media with an assortment of old news clips showing Biden talking about potential changes to the program, citing Sanders\u2019 own words. \u201cAs Bernie Sanders himself said in 2015: \u2018Joe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the wellbeing of working families and the middle class,\u2019\u201d Bates said in a statement. As Biden\u2019s claim about the video began to circulate on Saturday evening, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir fired back, saying in a statement that Biden \u201cshould be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.\u201d \u201cThe facts are very clear: Biden not only pushed to cut Social Security \u2013 he is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions,\u201d Shakir said. Biden during his time in the Senate publicly expressed an openness to either freezing year-over-year cost-of-living increases, as part of a bipartisan plan to slow federal spending, or raising the retirement age in order to preserve the program while managing the federal budget. Sanders has been a consistent and fierce supporter of growing the New Deal-era program and, during the Obama years, emerged as a leading opposition voice when it was reported that cuts were being considered by a bipartisan presidential deficit commission. Last year, the Vermont senator reintroduced legislation that would add more than 50 years of sustainability to the program, which on its current track would no longer be able to pay out full benefits by 2034, by subjecting all income above $250,000 to the existing 12.4% Social Security payroll tax, which is split between workers and employers. Sanders would also levy a new 6.2% tax on investment income above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. The revenue boosts proposed by Sanders, in the legislation and by his campaign, would increase benefits for all Social Security recipients and make the annual cost of living adjustment more generous. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper earlier this month, Sanders skewered Biden on everything from his support for NAFTA, the unpopular and soon-to-be-replaced trade deal, to his vote to authorize the Iraq War. \u201cJoe Biden has been on the floor of the Senate talking about the need to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Sanders added, as part of a riff suggesting that his Democratic primary rival would make for a poor candidate in November\u2019s general election. A Biden campaign aide pointed to the former Delaware senator\u2019s \u201c100% lifetime record on Social Security votes\u201d from the Alliance for Retired Americans as evidence of his fidelity to the program and accused the Sanders campaign of pushing a \u201cvideo and transcript that were intentionally, deceptively edited to make it seem like Vice President Biden was praising and agreeing with Paul Ryan, when it is clear he was doing the exact opposite.\u201d The aide argued that the clip met the threshold for being labeled as \u201cdoctored.\u201d Despite the questions over how they had initially presented their case against Biden, the Sanders campaign seemed to delight in Biden stirring the pot on an issue they believe Biden\u2019s record \u2013 when cast against Sanders\u2019 \u2013 could damage him with Democratic primary voters with the first round of voting, in Iowa, a little more than two weeks away. \u201cBiden is desperately trying to muddy the waters by dishonestly manufacturing a fake nonsensical controversy over one single video \u2013 because he knows there are multiple videos out there of public speeches he made proudly congratulating himself for working to cut Social Security,\u201d Sirota told CNN. \u201cIn trying to cut Social Security, Joe Biden is telling us exactly who he is \u2013 and we should believe him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Annie Grayer and Sarah Mucha contributed to this report",

Every Sunday, I deliver to your inbox the 5 BIG storylines you need to know to understand the upcoming week on the campaign trail. And they\u2019re ranked \u2013 so the No. 1 story is the most important of the coming week. Tell your friends to subscribe to The Point newsletter! 5. Nevada, Nevada, Nevada: Quick, name the first four states in the Democratic nomination fight. Well, there\u2019s Iowa (February 3) and New Hampshire (February 11), obviously. And then South Carolina (February 29), of course. That\u2019s three. The fourth state will vote in the Nevada caucuses, set for February 22. Nevada often gets forgotten amid the focus on the other three, but in 2020 at least, it seems poised to play an influential role in the process. Why? Because there\u2019s a very big gap of 18 days between the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries. For that 11 days after New Hampshire, Nevada will be the big focus \u2013 as candidates seek to use it to either keep up momentum built in the first two states, or to find some before it\u2019s too late. Thanks to a new Fox News poll released late last week, we have a pretty good sense of the state of play at the moment in Nevada. Former Vice President Joe Biden takes first with 23%, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 17%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer take 12%. (Steyer!) Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets 6% and businessman Andrew Yang 4%. Those numbers \u2013 especially at the top \u2013 are largely unchanged since a November Fox poll in the state (with the exception of Steyer\u2019s rise), suggesting that the race isn\u2019t totally engaged just yet. And we know that what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire can (and likely will) have some effect on where Nevada stands when the nation\u2019s attention turns there. But make no mistake: No matter what happens in those first two states, Nevada matters this time around. 4. Do endorsements matter at all?: I\u2019ve long been a skeptic that endorsements from politicians have any major effect on voters. But the rapidly approaching Iowa caucuses will give a real-time chance to test how much endorsements matter. On Sunday, Iowa Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack endorsed Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, calling the former South Bend mayor \u201cthe candidate that can heal our divides, restore decency to the presidency and bring this country together.\u201d Earlier this year, Iowa Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer, who was elected to the House in 2018, endorsed Biden\u2019s campaign. (Biden has also been endorsed by former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack and his wife, Christie.) Only Rep. Cindy Axne has stayed on the sidelines among congressional Democrats in the state. The question is this: Do Loebsack or Finkenauer have turnout operations in their congressional districts that help ensure Buttigieg or Biden supporters get to the polls? Do the Vilsacks? If not, then all these endorsements mean is a positive news story on the local news. Which isn\u2019t nothing but isn\u2019t all that much. 3. Liberal-on-liberal fights: Since the start of this campaign, Sanders and Warren have played nice with one another. Political reality always dictated that kumbaya view wouldn\u2019t last \u2013 since both candidates are trying to consolidate liberals behind their candidacy. Sanders appears to have broken that pact, with Politico reporting that the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign is circulating talking points to supporters and surrogates that claim that Warren is the candidate of \u201chighly-educated, more affluent people\u201d \u2013 aka the elites. The Sanders camp is also making the case that Warren voters will be with the party no matter who the nominee is while his voters \u2013 younger, more working class \u2013 might not show up if the Vermont senator isn\u2019t the nominee. Now, putting an attack in talking points isn\u2019t the same as putting in on TV. (Or attacking in a debate \u2013 more on that below!) But it suggests Sanders recognizes that his path to the nomination requires drawing contrasts with Warren.

Here\u2019s your debate primer: The last debate before the Iowa caucuses is set for Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Eastern on your favorite network. (That\u2019s CNN, if you were wondering!) With just six candidates, this will be the smallest debate stage since the race began. And if not for rich guy/businessman Steyer\u2019s last-minute qualification \u2013 literally on the day before the deadline \u2013 we would have only had Biden, Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on stage. What to watch for? Do Sanders and Warren clash? Does Buttigieg stay as aggressive against, well, everyone as he\u2019s been? Is Biden just trying not to make a big mistake or does he try to play offense? Can Klobuchar find the moment (again) that she will need to close the gap with the frontrunners? Will Steyer wear that same flannel tie? Will anyone on stage complain about party rules that have resulted in no non-white candidates making the stage? 1. Race for second choice in Iowa: By now, you\u2019ve likely seen the new CNN-Des Moines Register poll out of Iowa; it\u2019s a statistical four-way tie between Sanders (20%), Warren (17%), Buttigieg (16%) and Biden (15%). What you might have missed \u2013 but shouldn\u2019t \u2013 is what the numbers look like when you combine voters\u2019 first and second choices. When you do that, here\u2019s what the numbers look like: Warren 33%, Sanders 32%, Buttigieg 31% and Biden 27%. Why does second choice matter? Because this is a caucus, not a primary. If your preferred candidate \u2013 and there are still more than a dozen Democrats running \u2013 doesn\u2019t get 15% support in any individual caucus in the state, then he or she isn\u2019t considered viable and you will be asked to choose another candidate. And, according to CNN\u2019s Harry Enten, of the 1 in 5 people in the CNN poll who currently support a candidate below that viability threshold, Biden takes 19%, Buttigieg 18%, Warren 13% and Sanders 11%. Of the 1 in 3 voters who either a) don\u2019t support a candidate about the viability line or b) haven\u2019t picked a candidate, here\u2019s how favorably they view the top-tier candidates: Buttigieg 55%, Biden 53%, Warren 43% and Sanders 41%. So, the second choice matters. A lot. In fact, who people make their preferred second choice could make the difference between winning and losing in the caucuses on February 3.",

            "article_content": "He has been dismissed, shrugged off, and, most gratingly to his campaign and supporters, ignored for long stretches by other leading primary rivals and national political pundits. But with less than a month before the Iowa caucuses, this volatile 2020 presidential primary has taken yet another eye-popping turn: Bernie Sanders is being recognized by the Democratic establishment, sometimes in puzzlement and others in fear, as the real deal \u2013 a legitimate contender, even a front-runner, to become the party\u2019s next presidential nominee. It happened slowly, then, as the year turned, seemingly all at once. Maybe it was his fourth quarter fundraising total \u2013 $34.5 million, more than anyone else and a personal best \u2013 or the recent early-state polls, which suggest a Sanders sweep of Iowa and New Hampshire is very much in play. The 78-year-old democratic socialist always had the firmest voter base. He has not made any meaningful adjustments to his campaign strategy. What\u2019s changed is that he is beginning to show concrete signs of expanding his support in a way that few outside his loyal circles predicted. Now, with the potential for victory in sight, Sanders has begun to sharpen his case against Joe Biden, who has mostly sought to sidestep the substance of that criticism. How much longer the former vice president can afford to avoid the kind of confrontation Sanders is seeking is an open question. Tuesday night\u2019s debate in Des Moines will mark the field\u2019s final joint exercise before the caucuses. In recent interviews, Sanders has taken aim at Biden\u2019s core strength \u2013 perceived electability \u2013 by highlighting his past votes to authorize the Iraq War and, with a special nod to how it would \u201cplay\u201d in the industrial Midwest, the North American Free Trade Agreement. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat Trump, we need turnout,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday night. \u201cAnd to get turnout, you need energy and excitement. And I don\u2019t think that that kind of record is going to bring forth the energy we need to defeat Trump.\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir expressed some exasperation at the tone of Biden\u2019s responses so far, which have, as Shakir described them, been limited to \u201ca brush-off smile or coy comment.\u201d Biden in a recent interview on NBC News, pushed back \u2013 in vague terms \u2013 on the suggestion he didn\u2019t have the juice to fire up Democratic voters . \u201cBernie, I\u2019ll see you at the caucus,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New Hampshire, I\u2019ll see you in the primaries, I mean, let the voters decide that, whether there\u2019s enough energy and I \u2013 all I know is out on the stump, things are feeling really good, there\u2019s a whole lot of energy.\u201d In past gatherings, Biden and other moderates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have mostly passed up potential flashpoints with Sanders, preferring to zero in on his progressive ally Elizabeth Warren, whose headline-grabbing surge in the polls over the summer made her a more appealing target. Both Biden and Klobuchar may have unwittingly boosted Sanders in their zeal to undermine Kamala Harris and Warren, respectively. In separate venues, both described Sanders as \u201chonest\u201d in order to knock down other rivals during exchanges over the nuts and bolts of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Elizabeth Warren has her night in the barrel Harris has since dropped out of the race and Warren is slumping after a sustained hammering over the details of her plans. Sanders, meanwhile, has largely been spared that level of scrutiny \u2013 at least from the other campaigns \u2013 and forged ahead with his efforts to build the diverse, working class coalition of support, bolstered by a massive, volunteer-driven organizing apparatus, his team believes will ultimately carry him to the nomination. If Sanders succeeds, a Democratic establishment that either opposes his policies on a substantive level or views his leftist politics as a general election loser \u2013 or some combination of the two \u2013 will be left asking itself why it spent long stretches of the campaign treating the Vermont senator as an afterthought. Progressive strategist Rebecca Katz, a former aide to Harry Reid in the Senate who has not endorsed a primary candidate, puts it down to the cloistered nature of high-level politics. \u201cThe issue here is that because you have so many folks in the establishment who don\u2019t know anyone voting for Bernie, they assume that there is no one voting for Bernie,\u201d Katz said. \u201cBernie always had the highest floor, he always had the most amount of people who believed in him. Those people now are starting to convince their friends and family that they should be for Bernie, too.\u201d Sanders\u2019 uptick has not gone unnoticed by Republicans. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign, which has for the most part stuck to either criticizing Biden or the Democratic field more generally, launched a rare direct attack on Sanders. In an email to reporters, the Trump team singled out his response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani as insufficiently bellicose, calling it evidence Sanders \u201ccannot be trusted to protect American lives.\u201d If that statement is the beginning of a trend, then Democrats already skeptical of Sanders will see their prevailing hypothesis \u2013 that he cannot withstand the opposition ringer \u2013 tested as the primary season finally kicks off. \u201cI think there are a number of people who are concerned that Bernie Sanders has not been fully vetted in this current field the way that other candidates have,\u201d Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist and former rapid response director for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cAnd there are a lot of unknown about him. He may have a glass jaw and will crumble the moment that the right wing attack machine turns his focus on him.\u201d The Republican \u201cattack machine\u201d might be late coming to Sanders, but it has relentlessly sought during her first year in office to make Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the b\u00eate noire of the Trumpist movement. But those efforts have done little to dim her star with progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Sanders, which was announced shortly after he returned to the trail following a heart attack on the first day in October, provided his campaign with a jolt \u2013 and helped set it off on an upswing that has carried into the new year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to place too much on this, but a lot of people thought that when he had his heart attack, that was the end of his campaign,\u201d said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which has not yet decided whether it will endorse in the primary. \u201cAnd what it did was it rejuvenated it. I mean, it made him a \u2018real person.\u2019 People can\u2019t just talk about him as a grumpy old man. Then (the campaign) started actually showing him doing physical activity because that\u2019s what people were interested in.\u201d Bernie Sanders is breaking barriers with young Latinos. Now he just needs them to vote The Ocasio-Cortez endorsement, which Shakir called \u201ca moment of great courage on her part,\u201d offered Sanders a level of public validation, especially with Latinos and voters of color, he never quite achieved in 2016. It also underscored the stakes of the coming primary, which will stretch beyond this year and the next. If Sanders succeeds, an entire generation of Democrats, dating back at least to the early 1990s, will be forced to reconsider their place in the party \u2013 a prospect in which most of his supporters would surely delight. Still, most voters don\u2019t think in those sweeping, historical terms. Polls have routinely suggested that, as much as Medicare for All or free public college play on their minds, it is the more elemental question of trustworthiness that has consistently undergirded Sanders\u2019 support. In the final accounting, Sanders, by changing very little of himself, might very well change everything in Democratic politics. Nabilah Islam, who is running on a platform including Medicare for All in Georgia\u2019s 7th House district primary, will be watching the first round of presidential voting with interest. \u201cIf (Sanders) starts winning these early primaries, I think people will start realizing that his policies are resonating,\u201d Islam, who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how the media tried to cast him as just too, too progressive. But the policies that he\u2019s advocating for are the ones that we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d The contrast between Sanders and the top tier of the Democratic field, even as it has moved left over the past few years, played out in miniature in the aftermath of the recent US strike in Iraq. When most candidates initially responded by couching their condemnations of the attack with reminders of Soleimani\u2019s own bloody rap sheet, Sanders skipped straight to warning against a military escalation and calling for congressional action to arrest any push for war. It was, simply, exactly what you\u2019d expect from Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s been consistent on every single issue, not just for this last campaign, not just for this last year, but for his entire career,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThere\u2019s no caveats. He\u2019s in the position he is because everybody knows what he says is what he believes, because he\u2019s been saying it for decades.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "With the Iowa caucuses now less than a month away, a realization is setting in among the political class: Bernie Sanders has a very credible chance at winning the 2020 Democratic nomination. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Consider: * A series of polls \u2013 both nationally and in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 released over the past month make clear that Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden are running neck-and-neck. * Sanders, again, outraised the rest of the Democratic field in the final three months of 2019. He brought in $34.5 million between October 1 and December 21 \u2013 almost $10 million more than former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came in second in the cash dash. (Biden raised $22.7 million in the quarter.) * Conservative outlets are beginning to opine about the danger Sanders would represent if elected. \u201cSanders is not merely an amusing old crank but rather an advocate for truly dangerous ideas that have caused great violence, suffering, and deprivation of freedom throughout the world,\u201d the Washington Times wrote in an editorial Tuesday. \u201cAmericans may not be clamoring for socialism, but right now, Sanders has a chance of winning a major party\u2019s nomination, and in a two-party system, each major party candidate starts off with a decent chance of winning. His emergence should not be dismissed as an idle threat.\u201d * In an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday night, Sanders was more pointed in his critique of Biden than he has been in the race to date. Here\u2019s exactly what Sanders said: \u201cI mean, look, Joe and I are friends and I truly like Joe. But what is imperative is that we defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in modern history. And that means you\u2019re going to have to have a huge voter turnout. You\u2019re going to have to get working people excited. You\u2019re going to have to get young people excited. \u201cJoe Biden voted and helped lead the effort for the war in Iraq, the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. Joe Biden voted for the disastrous trade agreements, like NAFTA, and permanent normal trade relations with China, which cost us millions of jobs. You think that\u2019s going to play well in Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania? \u201cYou know, Joe Biden has been on the floor of the Senate, talking about the need to cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. Joe Biden pushed a bankruptcy bill, which has caused enormous financial problems for working families. So, if we\u2019re going to beat Trump, we need turnout. And to get turnout, you need energy and excitement. And I just don\u2019t think that that kind of record is going to bring forth the energy we need to defeat Trump.\u201d Ranking the 5 Democrats with the best chance of winning in 2020 Taken together, the picture is clear: Not only has Sanders lasted longer as a viable candidate than many people thought, but he also will have the resources to fight it out for the nomination for months to come. And then there\u2019s perhaps the most important element of all of this: Sanders appears ready \u2013 in ways he never seemed comfortable with in his 2016 primary challenge to Hillary Clinton \u2013 to draw real contrasts with his fellow Democratic candidates in order to peel votes away from them. Think back to that 2016 primary. Its defining moment (or one of its defining moments) was when Sanders told Clinton \u201cno one cares about your damn emails\u201d in reference to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as Secretary of State. That effectively took the issue, which some Democrats even at the time expressed concern about in terms of Clinton\u2019s vulnerability in a general election, off the table. And Sanders barely laid a glove on Clinton otherwise \u2013 only offering glancing criticism of her decision to give a series of speeches to corporate America for significant sums. (The Clinton campaign complained that Sanders had been too negative, but there is just very little evidence to back that claim up.) Sanders in that race seemed generally content to be a cause rather than a campaign. He built a movement for sure. But with the exception of the immediate aftermath of his crushing victory in New Hampshire over Clinton, it never really looked like winning was the main objective. Interviews like the one Sanders gave to Cooper on Monday night suggest that he won\u2019t make that mistake again. (Sidebar: Campaigns \u2013 all campaigns \u2013 are about choices between candidates. Highlighting your strengths is of value, yes. But so too is noting your opponents\u2019 weaknesses \u2013 and why they should matter to voters.) Sanders has clearly read up on Biden\u2019s looooong voting record \u2013 supported the invasion of Iraq, backed NAFTA, advocated for a bankruptcy bill \u2013 and is beginning to roll out the clear contrast between the former vice president\u2019s record on those issues and his own. (Sanders is helped in all of this because he was in the Senate contemporaneously with Biden and can point to moments where the two differed.) The next question for Sanders will be whether he puts these critiques in television ads in places like Iowa and New Hampshire as the votes in both of those states near. Whether Sanders continues to take the case to Biden remains to be seen. Ditto whether he will wind up as the Democratic nominee. But what is less ambiguous is that Sanders is in far better position to become the Democratic standard-bearer than most people \u2013 including most Democrats \u2013 expected him to be even as recently as last fall. And the Iowa caucuses are only 27(!!) days away.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised more than $34.5 million for his White House bid during the final three months of 2019 \u2013 a sign of his considerable financial strength a little more than a month before Democrats begin selecting their 2020 presidential nominee. Sanders was the second candidate vying for the Democratic nomination to announce his fundraising numbers in the fourth quarter, a day after former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg announced raising $24.7 million. The other Democrats who have emerged in the top tier, former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have not yet announced their totals for the last months of 2019. President Donald Trump also announced on Thursday that he raised $46 million in the fourth quarter, outpacing the Democratic candidates\u2019 individual totals so far. Sanders\u2019 massive haul \u2013 one of the largest quarterly totals of any Democratic candidate this election cycle \u2013 brings the total he has collected to date in his second bid for the presidency to $96 million, and underscores the might of his small-dollar donor base. On Wednesday, Sanders\u2019 campaign announced that it had received more than 5 million individual contributions \u2013 a milestone his aides said no other presidential contender had achieved at this point in a White House campaign. The Vermont independent \u201cis proving each and every day that working class Americans are ready and willing to fund a campaign that stands up for them and takes on the biggest corporations and the wealthy,\u201d his campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. \u201cYou build a grassroots movement to beat Donald Trump and create a political revolution one $18 donation at a time, and that\u2019s exactly why Bernie is going to win.\u201d Sanders\u2019 fourth-quarter fundraising significantly outpaces his own previous totals. Sanders raised roughly $18 million in each of the first two quarters of the year and $25.3 million in the third quarter. Other Democratic presidential contenders have not reported their totals for the final three months of the year but seem unlikely to topple Sanders as the Democrats\u2019 fundraising leader. Warren told supporters in late December that she had raised $17 million and encouraged her backers to help her hit a goal of $20 million by year\u2019s end. The goal represented about 20% less than she had collected in the third quarter \u2013 pointing to a significant dip in fundraising. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign has claimed a financial rebound. In a memo to journalists last month, his campaign manager said that as of December 1, Biden had raised more in October and November than the $15.7 million he had collected in the previous three months. But he had not released his fourth-quarter totals as of Wednesday evening. The fourth-quarter fundraising performance is closely watched as a sign of candidates\u2019 ability to fund their campaigns through the early voting contests and whether they have built strong financial bases for a general election face-off with President Donald Trump, who has been raising record sums. Trump and the joint fundraising committees he established with the Republican National Committee started October with $158 million in campaign cash available in their bank accounts. The battle to become the Democratic Party nominee kicks off February 3 with the Iowa caucuses. Sanders\u2019 team emphasized his small-dollar base. His $34.5 million haul came from more than 1.8 million donations, with 40,000 new donors contributing on the final day of the quarter, according to his campaign. More than $18 million of the quarter\u2019s total raised December alone. The average donation was $18.53, up slightly from the third quarter\u2019s average of $18.07, aides said. Sanders\u2019 campaign said that virtually all of its donors have not hit the $2,800 maximum an individual can donate to the primary, allowing the campaign to tap them again for contributions. Sanders has long touted his grassroots fundraising but increasingly has sought to draw contrasts with opponents, such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Buttigieg, who faced intense criticism during last month\u2019s Democratic presidential debate over attending a high-dollar fundraiser in a Napa Valley wine cave. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a super PAC. We don\u2019t want a super PAC. We don\u2019t go to rich people\u2019s wine caves. This is a campaign of the working class of this country, by the working class and for the working class,\u201d Sanders said in Venice, California, on December 21. Even as he leads early fundraising, the billionaires now in the Democratic race are tapping their fortunes to outspend their rivals by wide margins. Bloomberg, who entered the contest in late November, and California environmentalist Tom Steyer have spent a combined $255 million on television advertising so far, according to a tally by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group.",

He is a partner in the Dentons US LLP law firm and the head of its Georgia public policy team. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. With record-setting fundraising of over $200 million by Georgia Democratic US Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, can Democrats expect to win next week\u2019s runoffs? Probably not. Just ask former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former South Carolina Democratic candidate Jaime Harrison how their record-setting fundraising turned out for them in their respective US Senate races. However, this does not mean that a Republican Party, still deeply divided and embittered after a presidential loss, cannot manage to lose what should be two winnable races. While President-elect Joe Biden eked out the first Democratic presidential victory in Georgia since 1992, Democrats in the Senate and other down-ballot races lagged behind. Ossoff trailed incumbent Sen. David Perdue by over 80,000 votes, and in the scrambled 20-person special election to succeed Sen. Johnny Isakson, in which Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Warnock emerged as the top two candidates, the total Democratic votes trailed Republican votes by almost 48,000. This pattern continued down to statehouse races. Of the contested ones, Republican candidates outperformed President Donald Trump in all but nine. However, Republicans aren\u2019t without their own challenges. While they appeal to conservative voters to vote in the runoff, many continue to support Trump\u2019s claim that Georgia\u2019s political system is rigged. Trump, who will return to Georgia to campaign on the eve of the runoff, highlighted this contradiction in the past week. While urging Georgia Republicans to vote in the runoff, he also attacked Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state, who have defended the validity of the state\u2019s November election results. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at where things stand one week out and what to focus on in the final days of the race: For better or worse, Georgia Republicans\u2019 embrace of Trump is a continuation of a long tradition of welcoming their national party leaders \u2013 but for Georgia Democrats it is a relatively new trend.  When former President Barack Obama came to Georgia in 2010, the Democratic nominee for governor, Roy Barnes, had a \u201cscheduling conflict\u201d that kept him away from greeting the President. What Chuck Schumer doesn't understand about Georgia The scene repeated in 2014, when Democratic gubernatorial and senate nominees Jason Carter and Michelle Nunn avoided greeting the President during a visit. Those days are now over \u2013 with both Ossoff and Warnock joining Biden on stage at a rally earlier this month and Biden appearing prominently in a campaign ad touting the two candidates. Ossoff and Warnock\u2019s embrace of Biden and the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda is a two-edged sword. While it whips up the Democratic base, it also assists Republicans in sending the message to their base that the stakes of this special election are bigger than just the Senate \u2013 they could decide the fate of the first two years of Biden\u2019s presidency. Much has been written about demographic shifts in Georgia changing its political landscape. While Georgia is an evolving and growing state, Biden did not win in Georgia solely due to changing demographics. In 2016, Trump carried Georgia by a five-point margin and by over 200,000 votes. While the percentage share of White voters did drop from 2016 to 2020 from 61% to 57%, the percentage share of African American voters, the Democratic Party\u2019s most reliable demographic group, remained virtually unchanged at 28%. The demographics that increased their share of the electorate included Hispanics and Asians. Of growing interest to demographers, however, is the increasing gap between college-educated and non-college educated White voters. This shift has played out throughout upper middle-class White neighborhoods in the metro Atlanta suburbs, where support for Trump dropped by over 20 percentage points compared to the GOP ticket eight years ago \u2013 in part because of support for Biden among college-educated voters. Whether these voters return to the Republican camp in the runoff or vote for the Democrats remains an open question. However, judging by the added support down ballot Republicans received in races around the state, this is a likely demographic where Republicans could pick up votes previously lost to Biden. If you are a Georgia voter watching the evening news, a football game or a Christmas movie, you have been bombarded with nonstop election ads. Each ad makes serious accusations \u2013 from one falsely claiming Loeffler profited off the pandemic (when both the Justice Department and Senate Ethics Committee closed their investigations without bringing any charges) to another falsely claiming that Warnock is a socialist and anti-American. What Ronald Reagan could teach Georgia Republicans about winning But given the sheer volume of ads purchased at over $500 million, most voters are likely to tune them out, and recent studies show that such ads have little effect on voters\u2019 opinions about candidates. The more effective, and less costly, outreach in this campaign will likely be in the direct microtargeting being conducted by both political parties, the campaigns and third party advocates on both sides. This includes mining voter registration and voter history data to target likely voters for their candidates through text messages, live phone calls, robocalls and old-fashioned door knocking. The key in this runoff will not be to broadcast to the world the candidates\u2019 message, but to push likely supporters to the polls. Georgia voters enjoy three methods of voting \u2013 early in-person voting, no excuse needed absentee and Election Day in-person voting. Some controversies have erupted over allegations of a reduced number of early voting locations opened for the runoffs. County election officials have blamed the reductions on a combination of \u201cCOVID, the workload, and the holidays\u201d leading to a reduced number of available people, but voting rights groups fear it will lead to fewer working-class and low-income voters being able to vote. That said, until the beginning of the Christmas weekend, early in-person voting was generally tracking with turnout in the general election. This has now dropped off significantly in the last few days \u2013 and there is a 24% drop in turnout to date, according to Georgia Votes, a privately run website tracking voting data. As we approach a second holiday weekend with New Year\u2019s celebrations, it is questionable if this gap can be significantly narrowed. There is also a significantly lower number of absentee applications \u2013 12% percent fewer  \u2013 at this point in the campaign, compared to the recent general election. If this trend continues, it could bode poorly for Democrats, whose voters were more likely to vote early and by absentee in the most recent election.  At the present time, however, the early turnout may favor Democrats since among African Americans, historically strong Democratic voters, turnout is a higher percentage of the electorate in early voting than it was in the general election \u2013 31% compared to 28%, while White voters are a slightly smaller percentage of the electorate than they were in November \u2013 55% compared to 57%. The question going forward is whether Republican turnout efforts, including traditionally stronger Republican voting on Election Day, can reverse this present trend, or whether Democrats can continue their present level of supporter turnout. The bottom line in Georgia is that both sides continue to face challenges in the final week of these runoff campaigns. If the Democrats merely reproduce their efforts in the November election, they may lose, since Georgia voters, red-leaning, will likely prefer their incumbent Republican senators to Trump himself. The continuing divisions on the Republican side, however, pose an equal challenge for the GOP. In order for them to win, they must finally put aside their disappointment over the presidential race and focus on the two races at hand.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN. Election week in America has come to an end. The votes have been counted. And Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States. While Democrats did not get the landslide victory they were hoping for, make no mistake: Biden\u2019s win is huge and historic. Why Donald Trump lost So far, Biden has won over 74 million votes \u2013 more than any other president in American history \u2013 exceeding the previous record President Barack Obama set in 2008. Biden won with at least 50.5% of the popular vote, crossing the majority threshold that President Donald Trump failed to clear in 2016, when he received just 46.4% of the popular vote. On the road to 270 electoral votes, Biden flipped at least three states Democrats lost in 2016. He became only the 11th challenger to dislodge an incumbent president. He reclaimed the upper Midwest and is also leading in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. According to exit polls, he won independent voters, union households and moderates by double-digit margins over Trump. It is an impressive mandate for the former Vice President, who became the oldest person to win the presidency, 32 years after his first run for the White House and 48 years after he was first elected to the US Senate as the face of generational change. This time, the mantle of generational change was embodied by his charismatic VP nominee, Sen. Kamala Harris, who will become the first woman \u2013 and the first woman of color \u2013 to serve as Vice President of the United States. Running against a conspiracy-theory-peddling President who failed to contain a raging pandemic that has already killed more than 235,000 Americans, Biden was able to appeal to a country hungry for unity, empathy and competence. His closing argument offered a clear contrast to Trump, who has stoked partisan fires for the last four years: \u201cI\u2019m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I\u2019ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I\u2019ll work as hard for those who don\u2019t support me as for those who do. That\u2019s the job of a president, a duty of care for everyone.\u201d Donald Trump is a one-term president who can't admit he's a loser But there has been grousing among Democrats, despite the big win at the top of the ticket. Many voters quickly fell into despair after Biden failed to win Florida on election night, and PoliticalWire\u2019s Taegan Goddard later pointed out, \u201cDemocrats let their expectations get way ahead of reality.\u201d While the results show Biden won with a broad coalition, the days-long count frustrated voters looking for a quick and clear repudiation of Trump. The divisive and broadly unpopular incumbent managed to rally his passionate base and gain more than 7 million more votes than he did in 2016. In Florida, Trump surged in Miami Dade County and won the support of many Cuban-Americans who may have been turned off by aggressive disinformation campaigns spreading conspiracy theories and tarring all Democrats as socialists. This led centrist House Democrats to rail against the political costs of their more progressive colleagues immediately after the election. And despite the President\u2019s race-baiting and culture war politics, exit polls show he won 18% of Black men and 36% of Latino men nationally. Overall, he won the highest percentage of non-White voters among Republican presidential candidates since 1960, according to political strategist Adrian Gray. While a conservative, populist demagogue lost the election, he also demonstrated that Trumpism still has a constituency \u2013 particularly among white men without college degrees. And conspiracy theories may be here to stay. As Mitt Romney\u2019s former chief strategist and Lincoln Project advisor Stuart Stevens put it, \u201cThe Republican party will now have more QAnon believers than African-Americans in the House of Representatives.\u201d 'The club' of former presidents will never be the same Black voters and suburban voters turned out big time for Biden. Democrats still have an uphill battle to face in the Senate, having only gained one seat so far (they picked up seats in Colorado and Arizona but lost one in Alabama), with two more seats up for grabs in Georgia\u2019s run-off elections in January. While Democrats will likely retain their hold on the House, their majority will be slimmer, having lost several seats to Republicans. For months, Donald Trump has been trying to undermine faith in the election and spreading baseless claims of voter fraud. Now that the President has lost, he is taking the desperate and predictable route of launching flimsy legal challenges, while his allies have spread unsubstantiated claims on social media. On Thursday night, Trump spewed lies about winning the election, falsely claiming that it was being \u201cstolen\u201d from him during a press conference at the White House before reiterating the sentiment in a rage-tweet at 3 am on Friday night. This is toxic nonsense and more evidence of Trump\u2019s impulse to put his self-interest over national interest. Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Elections Commission, put it bluntly when she tweeted: \u201cEnough, Mr. President. Enough. Spewing conspiracy theories regarding this election will not change the results\u2026Your lies undermine our democracy and harm our country. Just stop.\u201d Trump won\u2019t stop. But he is powerless to unilaterally change the democratic outcome. The rage and fear we hear from Trump stems from his own confrontation with reality, and the fact that he is a loser who has been fired by the majority of the American people. Professor FLOTUS: How Jill Biden would redefine what it means to be first lady Due to the slow drip of results over the last five days, Republicans and some Democrats may be tempted to make the case that Joe Biden will enter the Oval Office without an overwhelming mandate. But let\u2019s not forget: Biden won the White House with a bigger margin in the popular vote than John F. Kennedy in 1960 or Richard Nixon in 1968. And his victory is far more sweeping than Donald Trump\u2019s in 2016, when he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes before proceeding to govern with a complete disregard for uniting the nation. President Biden promises a very different approach than Trump. His experience primes him to make government work again, although it remains to be seen whether Senate Republicans will work with him in good faith. Either way, the divisions in this country run deep and will not be magically erased by the results of this election. A raging, recalcitrant incumbent who refuses to accept the reality of the democratic vote, will only make the task of bringing the country together even more difficult. But leadership matters. And unifying leadership is what we\u2019ve been missing. Now Biden\u2019s time has come, with a political approach that is a cross section of former Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Barack Obama. Like LBJ, he knows how to move legislation through Congress. He has campaigned as a champion of the working class and middle class for decades. And he believes in the power of personal diplomacy, often repeating his belief that while you can question someone\u2019s judgement, you shouldn\u2019t question their motives. He is in some ways a man who transcends the bitter politics of our era. During his campaign, Biden did not get distracted by Twitter mobs that so often distort our civic debates. He promises to be a steady leader in an unsteady time and harkens back to an era when bipartisan coalitions could be cobbled together to solve common problems with a combination of decency and raw political skill. He was a giant of the Senate who was seen by many as past his presidential prime when freshman senator Barack Obama asked him to join the ticket as an experienced hand with foreign policy expertise. A potential bid for the presidency in 2016 was derailed by the tragic death of his beloved son Beau, who died at the age of 46 from brain cancer. It devastated Biden, who has endured a life of loss, consoled and buoyed by faith. But he found renewed purpose in his oversight during the Obama administration of a national \u201ccancer moonshot\u201d  initiative to find a cure.  Biden had stepped away from politics until white nationalist violence broke out in Charlottesville in 2017, and Trump responded with his \u201cboth sides\u201d equivocation. Biden decided to enter the 2020 race. It was poetic justice that his path to the presidency was cleared by flips in the home states of two of his friends\u2014both Trump foes\u2013who died of cancer in the past four years: Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. John Lewis of Georgia. It was almost as if their spirits helped him over the finish line. Biden has been preparing for this challenge his entire adult life. As the author Richard Ben Cramer wrote of Biden in his epic history of the 1988 election, What It Takes: \u201cIf there came a time when he should run for the White House, he\u2019d know \u2026 There would be time, in his life, to establish in everyone\u2019s mind, that he was of good character.\u201d That time is now. For Biden, character proved to be the clearest contrast with the incumbent president he dislodged with a decisive defeat. Now his success will be our country\u2019s success, and by leading with character he might help our nation rediscover the central importance of character, not only within the presidency, but within ourselves.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Laura Beers is a professor of history at American University. She writes on British politics and gender and is the author of \u201cThatcher and the Women\u2019s Vote\u201d and \u201cFeminist Responses to Thatcher and Thatcherism.\u201d The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s appointment to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court goes to the heart of the question of what feminism actually is. Is supporting the promotion of women inherently feminist? One of Ginsburg\u2019s best-known quotes came from an interview in 2015 when she asserted, \u201cPeople ask me sometimes, when\u2014when do you think it will it be enough? When will there be enough women on the (Supreme) Court? And my answer is when there are nine.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s immediate public commitment to appoint a woman to replace Ginsburg on the Supreme Court, and his subsequent nomination of Barrett were intended, one presumes, to demonstrate that he too supports increasing female representation and that, therefore, women who consider themselves feminists can support Donald Trump. Trump himself directed a spotlight on how open his play for the support of White women is during a Pennsylvania rally on Tuesday, when he said: \u201cSuburban women, will you please like me?\u201d In her remarks in the Rose Garden following Trump\u2019s announcement of her nomination, Barrett noted with terse applause that \u201cJustice Ginsburg began her career at a time when women were not welcome in the legal profession. But she not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them. For that, she has won the admiration of women across the country, and indeed, all over the world.\u201d Feminism \u2013 in marked contrast with the legal vision mapped out by many of Barrett\u2019s writings and public statements on issues like health care and sexual assault \u2013 is about promoting women\u2019s equality across the social and political spectrum. As Ginsburg\u2019s veritable judicial opposite, Barrett\u2019s praise suggests that people should admire Ginsburg for her success in becoming the second female supreme court justice, not for her record. But, for those who admired the \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d as a feminist icon, the two are inextricably intertwined, and many women\u2019s rights activists have refused to look with favor on the woman likely to be confirmed as the Supreme Court\u2019s fifth female justice. These women want to see more women fill the highest posts in law and politics, but they want women in those posts who will use their positions, not to set an example of what is achievable by the ambitious minority, but to further the interests of the majority of women who will never attain a seat at the highest tables. Why history shows 'court packing' isn't extreme Barrett is putting herself forward for confirmation as a jurist, not political office, but, with the Republicans in firm control (for the moment) of the Senate and the White House, her confirmation hearings are largely acknowledged as political theatre. In playing out their disagreements over Barrett\u2019s nomination on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats are making a particular appeal to those White women who were seen as a key component of Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral coalition and who appear to be turning away from the president in 2020. During the first two days of hearings, Republicans such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Joni Ernst applauded Barrett and held her up as a role model for her success in juggling a legal career and a large family, with Indiana Sen. Mike Braun referring to her as \u201ca legal titan who drives a minivan.\u201d Barrett, for her part, repeatedly made reference to her children and her maternal empathy in discussing her approach to writing judicial opinions. Really, Sen. Cruz? This is what you asked Judge Barrett Democrats, meanwhile, focused on the threat her confirmation could pose to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), underscoring the risks particular to women if the Supreme Court were to invalidate the ACA. Its provisions include making it illegal to charge women more for coverage than men or discriminate against pregnant women, and mandate that health insurance policies must include contraceptive coverage, excepting in cases where the employer has a conscientious objection to providing such a benefit. Democratic legislators, beginning with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also highlighted concerns about Barrett\u2019s stance on Roe v. Wade, which Trump has contradictorily suggested is likely to come up for revision by the new court, and insisted is \u201cnot on the ballot\u201d in the coming election. Senator Mizuno Hirono pointedly raised the case of Lilly Ledbetter, who unsuccessfully sought remedy at the Supreme Court for years of gender-based pay discrimination while working at Goodyear Tire. Barrett\u2019s mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia, sided with the majority in deeming her case beyond their jurisdiction. Ginsburg wrote the court\u2019s dissent. Kamala Harris grills Amy Coney Barrett on Obamacare Sen. Amy Klobuchar summed up the feminist position: \u201cTo the women of America, we have come so far, and in the name of RBG, we should not go backward\u201d by confirming Barrett. Vice-presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris strongly contrasted Barrett\u2019s refusal to weigh in on Roe with Ginsburg\u2019s confirmation hearings in 1993, during which Ginsburg declined to commit to a stance on the case while leaving absolutely no doubt about her commitment to women\u2019s right to choose and its direct connection to social and economic equality for women. In listening to the past two days\u2019 hearings and reading the statements opposing Barrett\u2019s nomination issued by feminist groups, I was reminded of the controversy over Margaret Thatcher\u2019s election as Britain\u2019s first female prime minister.  The Iron Lady was a trailblazer and a role model for many women. Yet, as I have written elsewhere, she was roundly rejected by feminists and her premiership arguably pushed many women out of the Conservative Party. When Thatcher became prime minister in May 1979, following her party\u2019s landmark election victory, exit polling showed that nearly half of women had voted for the Iron Lady. Eight years later, when Thatcher won her third general election, she could still claim the allegiance of a plurality of female voters. But what was notable about the 1987 election was less Thatcher\u2019s continued electoral dominance than the collapse of the UK\u2019s historic \u201cgender gap\u201d in male and female voting. In the United States, women have historically held a stronger preference for the Democratic party than their male counterparts. (Even in 2016, when Trump won amongst White women, he still polled substantially better with White men than White women.) In contrast, British women, prior to 1987, were reliably more pro-Conservative than British men. Yet, while Thatcher\u2019s support among male voters held steady across her premiership, the gender gap disappeared because her support amongst women fell. Notably, the fall off was most dramatic amongst younger women. The reason perhaps lies in Thatcher\u2019s famous assertion in 1978 that, \u201cI am not a feminist.\u201d  She rose to political prominence at the same time as the second-wave feminist movement, and her career owned much to the social changes of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet, her policies as prime minister did not advance women\u2019s social or political security \u2013working-class women, in particular, were negatively affected by her welfare reforms. Faced with the alternatives of a woman hostile to women\u2019s interests and a male-led opposition Labour Party which at least sought to work with women\u2019s groups to advance a reformist agenda, many women\u2019s rights activists opted for a different type of gender solidarity. Academic research suggests that female swing voters, if they identity as feminists, are likely to respond positively to a female candidate. While Trump cannot change his own gender, he can hope to win favor with female voters by nominating a woman to the court, just as Joe Biden arguably publicly declared his commitment to choose a female running mate in part to shore up support from women voters.  Yet, history shows that women do not judge female politicians \u2013 nor, presumably, female justices \u2013 by their gender alone, and there is little reason to believe that Barrett\u2019s nomination will be received differently by women voters simply because she is a woman. If they like her politics and judicial philosophy, they will like her, and appreciate Trump\u2019s decision to nominate her to the bench. If they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. A little more than an hour after President Trump, infected with the coronavirus, made a rash and reckless return to the White House, Democratic challenger Joe Biden made clear at a televised NBC town hall why he is leading Trump in every national poll and in most top battleground states as well. The leading issue in the November 3 election is the federal response to Covid-19. Biden has checkmated Trump on the issue. Even as the President\u2019s close allies and advisers turn up sick after ignoring social distancing and mask-wearing best practices \u2013 including his campaign manager, press secretary and three Republican senators \u2013 Trump has chosen to double down on a failed strategy of downplaying the importance of the pandemic, tweeting, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life.\u201d Americans have seen the effects of the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 people, shut down entire school systems, triggered a global food crisis and resulted in the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression. And they have the good sense to be afraid. Trump's grotesque coronavirus theater Trump\u2019s wildly irresponsible advice \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t let it dominate your life\u201d \u2013 plays right into Biden\u2019s strategy of offering the nation a calm, sensible and presidential alternative by simply acknowledging reality.  At a time when the nation\u2019s leader seems lost in a fog of claims that he might be immune to the virus and unfounded predictions that the pandemic would simply disappear, Biden gets a big head start by following basic public health precautions and urging voters to do the same. Thus, shortly after Trump ginned up a media spectacle of checking himself out of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and posing, maskless, on a balcony overlooking the South Lawn of the White House, Biden was imploring voters to take the deadly pandemic seriously.  \u201cI hope nobody walks away thinking it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem.\u201d And when asked about Trump contracting Covid-19 after months of sowing confusion about the virus, Biden surely must have got heads nodding all over America by simply acknowledging the truth. \u201c210,000 have died already. And the expectation is, if nothing changes, another 200,000 dead by the end of the year,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat\u2019s 400,000 \u2013 God forbid it that happens \u2013 more than were killed in one year in America than four years in World War II.\u201d Biden\u2019s coronavirus plan \u2013 which includes requiring social distancing and mask-wearing on all federal property, making testing universally available and following the advice of scientists \u2013 is simple common sense. But compared to Trump\u2019s wild carelessness, common sense sounds like deep wisdom. Former Secret Service agent: I'm stunned by what I saw NBC anchor Lester Holt, who hosted the event, said that Trump, like Biden, has been invited to talk with voters in a town hall, but the Trump campaign has not agreed to participate. That speaks volumes about what\u2019s likely to happen if Trump is well enough for the candidates meet for their next official debate, which will be a town hall. Biden excels at the format, using jokes and personal anecdotes to connect with everyday voters. It\u2019s a world away from Trump\u2019s preferred campaign style of flying into a city and holding forth to hollering crowds at an arena or airport hangar. Trump uses his speeches to lavish praise on himself, while Biden talks about his working-class upbringing and his wife\u2019s career as a public school teacher. Trump never misses an opportunity to slash at enemies \u2013 Democrats, looters, immigrants, radicals \u2013 while Biden talks hopefully about unifying the nation. \u201cThe country is ready to be united, I believe,\u201d he told a voter at the town hall. \u201cWe have to just change the way we talk to each other. Politics has become so mean and so ugly. We\u2019ve gotta get rid of that. We gotta just start talking to each other like we respect each other.\u201d  At a town hall, it won\u2019t be easy for Trump to interrupt and talk over voters, the way he did with Biden and the moderator in their first debate.  Confronted with the real needs of ordinary Americans, Trump will be forced into the uncomfortable position of explaining why he has denied and denigrated scientific knowledge at every stage of the pandemic. He\u2019ll also have to answer the question on everybody\u2019s mind: with hundreds of people dying every day, how can we trust you to keep the country safe from Covid when you couldn\u2019t even protect yourself from it?",

John Lewis. The trilogy is illustrated by award-winning graphic novelist Nate Powell, whose forthcoming book, \u201cSave It For Later: Promises, Parenthood, and the Urgency of Protest,\u201d will be published in 2021. The views expressed here are their own. View more opinion at CNN. How does an icon reinvent himself? And how does he do it at 70? Creating a graphic-novel memoir with the explicit goal of making nonviolent revolution attainable and urgent was audacious, but the late Rep. John Lewis took that risk with us, alongside us and precisely because he knew the stakes. We\u2019re still in awe of his trust in us to tell his life story, including his willingness to risk being brushed off and laughed at for this choice of medium and format.  Interviewers often asked us, \u201cWhy a graphic novel?\u201d The truth is that \u201cMarch\u201d was always a comic, starting with Andrew\u2019s initial vision after Congressman Lewis described 1957\u2019s buried but influential \u201cMartin Luther King and the Montgomery Story.\u201d Across 14 pages, the comic book explains the philosophy and discipline of nonviolent social resistance through an illustrated recounting of Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery bus boycott. Comic books at the time were widely demonized, considered by some to be a corrupting influence \u2013 but having witnessed the inspiration \u201cMontgomery Story\u201d gave young activists, including himself, Lewis knew comics\u2019 potential. He saw the format as the most democratic and accessible mass medium, one that enabled anyone to express an idea with basic, inexpensive tools and reach a broad readership across educational, class and language barriers. He was also conscious of the role the Internet played in creating a new literacy among young people. Words and pictures worked together in tweeted memes in much the same way as a comic panel. Sequential narrative was becoming the language of young adults. At the same time as we made our comics, Andrew and the Congressman worked together in the Congressional office (their day jobs, as Lewis would describe it) to dramatize the stories of the movement through social media, creating the now ubiquitous \u201c#goodtrouble.\u201d These efforts worked hand in hand to sensitize, educate and inspire young people, bringing them a history and view of the world around them that was at once both iconic and immediate. The idea for \u201cMarch\u201d first took root in 2008 on the Congressman\u2019s re-election campaign, as longtime staffers struggled to find new ways to tell his story against the growing question of \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d, and the sharp backlash to Lewis\u2019 initial endorsement of then-Sen. Hillary Clinton for president.  Andrew, who had been on the Congressman\u2019s personal staff and was serving as the campaign\u2019s press secretary, suggested a simple idea: Congressman Lewis should write a comic book. Though it took some convincing, the Congressman agreed on one condition: He would do it, but only if Andrew wrote it with him. It took five years for that idea to reach the world, as mainstream publishers rejected the concept as outlandish. Andrew eventually found a sympathetic ear at a 2010 comic convention, and by 2011 artist Nate Powell had joined the team. Then, along with Lewis, we began our improbable work. No historical figure of such magnitude had ever tried to tell their story directly through comics, and in order to produce work that felt truly alive we had to invent our own form of scholarship. We weighed multiple narratives and memories of the principal participants of the movement against the long history of scholarship and retellings, while staying true to the fact that we were first and foremost telling John Lewis\u2019 story. Sometimes people disagreed. Sometimes books disagreed. And we had to sort all of that out with Congressman Lewis often serving as a sympathetic referee, since we were evaluating the work and history of his friends, colleagues and admirers. Our collaboration required a delicate balance between an accurate, responsible historical account and the intimate, subjective experience of that history. Growing to truly know and love John Lewis throughout the creative process also required growing in trust \u2013 the trust necessary to place ourselves in his shoes at the drawing table and keyboard. We worked each day to prove ourselves worthy of it, breathing life into frame after frame. A lifelong lover of visual art, Lewis\u2019 openness guided him to embrace comics with the same adoration he brought to his favorites like Romare Bearden, Aaron Douglas and Jacob Lawrence. He plainly saw the potential of the comic book to nurture a social conscience within every young person in America, and had faith in our medium to equip people with the tools to organize and protect themselves. When John Lewis spoke about forces \u201ctrying to take us back,\u201d he was trying to get us to see that the forces he faced never went away. They were always there, hiding in plain sight, waiting for us to let our guard down, waiting for us to forget how to fight back. As a cloud descended over our society throughout the 2010s, he pushed us both to continue to believe in the human capacity for change; to remain open even as possibilities threatened to disappear. As we turned in the first 10 completed pages of \u201cMarch: Book One\u201d back in summer 2012, we only hoped our collaborative vision could stand up to his subjective experiences. Reading those pages brought tears to his eyes, distilling something true on the page from within his own private memories. The Congressman would often say that reading \u201cMarch\u201d was \u201clike being there,\u201d and that the illustrations had the ability to make the words \u201csing.\u201d There was no model for what we were trying to do. We had to build the language and the standards as we went. His commitment to the project was powerful. As he did so many times before, he gave his whole self. A typical book tour might be a few weeks\u2019 worth of signings, a speech here and there, and perhaps a triumphant cocktail reception before receiving a piece of dishware repurposed with your name and book title etched onto it. But the history of \u201cMartin Luther King and the Montgomery Story\u201d taught us that the 1957 comic worked in conjunction with a \u201creconciliation tour.\u201d Leaders like John Lewis\u2019 mentor, the Rev. James Lawson, and others led workshops explaining the philosophy and discipline of nonviolent resistance as they distributed the comic so that participants had something tangible to study and apply. For John Lewis, that process was as important as the comic itself. As he would say, \u201cWe have to get out there and spread the gospel.\u201d So we did. If these books were a roadmap first drawn by Dr. King, then we needed to be Paul and the Apostles preaching to our flock (of chickens, of course). As biblical as it may sound, this work also enlivened the political part of the Congressman\u2019s soul, the part that truly loved getting out to meet \u201cWe The People.\u201d It was a whole new campaign. From Comic Con International, to the American Library Association, to universities like Michigan State and Georgia State, to whole-community reading programs in San Diego and Vermont (yes, the whole state) \u2013 we went everywhere. We gave hundreds of talks. One day we\u2019d speak at a tiny elementary school in Brooklyn, and the next we\u2019d speak our minds to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Congressman kept it up until the end; last December, just before his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer became public, he spoke with teachers and students in New York City, where the Department of Education has included all three volumes of \u201cMarch\u201d in its system-wide curriculum. It took a special kind of person to invite us along with him into this national spotlight. On TV, on stage at events, in interviews and classroom visits, the Congressman always made sure we were included, and regularly fought for it. When an interviewer would only want to speak to him, he would insist they speak to all of us, refusing to do the interview unless we were all a part of it. He would often say, \u201cWe\u2019re a band of brothers,\u201d and that it reminded him of his days traveling with Julian Bond working for the Voter Education Project. In some ways, it was in keeping with the philosophy of SNCC, the student organization he once led, that though there may be a leader, every voice deserves to be heard. We often joked, after years of touring together, that if we were a band we\u2019d be called \u201cGood Trouble.\u201d That sense that we were in this together, with no person more or less important than the other, was at the core of the Congressman\u2019s philosophy. To him, not telling the whole story\u2014whether of the civil rights movement or of how we made our comics\u2014was a sin. He was actually gracious, actually kind, actually patient. There\u2019s so much bandwidth wrapped up in \u201cJohn Lewis The Icon\u201d that it\u2019s easy to discount the years we spent eating meals together; shopping for socks; discussing the O\u2019Jays \u201cBackstabbers\u201d LP; waiting in line together as Nate bought a Batgirl action figure for his daughter after a signing. The nights spent indulging in candy and ice cream after an important evening event, or the relief of anonymity in faraway towns. The sheer adventure of criss-crossing America together for five years straight is something we\u2019ll miss most. Congressman Lewis always made a point to identify \u201cMarch\u201d as \u201ca roadmap to change,\u201d one that allowed future generations to recognize both the successes and obstacles within the movement as it grew and evolved. And by \u201cchange,\u201d we always meant \u201crevolution.\u201d This goal was sometimes chuckled at early on \u2014 really, a new wave of nonviolent revolution from a comic?! \u2014 but Lewis was always guided by a clear moral framework in every action, every organization and every page of every book. He was inspired by the notion that the graphic novel format could represent civil rights history in a more immediate, impactful way \u2014 and his enthusiasm reflected a lifelong willingness to let younger people take the lead with new approaches to progress. Lewis\u2019 example has helped Nate, at 42, recognize that he\u2019s already approaching dinosaur-status in the eyes of his 8-year-old, and that when she inevitably calls him out of touch with a changing world, it\u2019ll be time to listen and grow with the next generation. This is the broadest sense of continual revolution, embodied by our openness, our vulnerability and our capacity for reflection and change.  It is no vindication that today his mandate is increasingly seen as a necessity for the very survival of our democracy. We\u2019ve all lived the consequences of nationalist myth clouding our shared history, as well as the struggles endured to maintain a precarious democracy. But we\u2019re only at the beginning of those potentially catastrophic consequences. Truth matters. History \u2014 told by the people who lived it \u2014 can and will determine our ability to sustain and fight for a society holding actual equality, actual justice, actual freedom, and actual peace as ideals. John Lewis spent his massive lifetime marching toward that promise, and we must fulfill it. We can. But we must do it together, now, even with the possibility that nothing already lost will return.",

A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School, where he founded the Center for Public Leadership.

Ted Kennedy announced his campaign for President, Roger Mudd famously asked him, \u201cSenator, why do you want to be President?\u201d Kennedy hesitated, fumbled and lost his campaign before it even started. Some 40 years later, in his quest to unseat Sen. Ed Markey, Congressman Joe Kennedy III stepped into the footsteps of his late great uncle. He failed to answer the question at the crux of every campaign: Why me? Voters these days are looking for more than a storied name; they want candidates who have a strong message and can deliver real change. Markey made the sale very effectively. Sen. Ed Markey defeats a Kennedy in Massachusetts Early in the race, it appeared that the biggest difference between them was age: Markey went to Congress before Kennedy was born. The progressive wing of the party would have been pleased to have both of them in the Senate. Youthful and charismatic, Kennedy jumped out front and appeared headed toward victory. But his team either forgot or never appreciated how good Markey can be as a political leader. In the months that followed, Markey took over the progressive lane, pushing Kennedy to the side and painting him as the candidate of the establishment. Somehow, he maintained his stature as a senior, respected leader of Democrats while also creating strong ties with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her ideological allies.  A wide array of Democratic figures flocked to his banner. Meanwhile, Markey\u2019s television ads were far superior, showing the senator as a strong, effective and relatable leader. With Covid-19 ruling out much face-to-face campaigning, Markey also mobilized an army of digital supporters. And he did the unimaginable in Massachusetts: He attacked the Kennedy family legacy, criticizing the creation of a super-PAC supported by family members, and deftly contrasted it with his own working-class roots as the son of a Malden milk truck driver. While this was a sui generis election of sorts, the race serves as a lesson in the importance of political fundamentals. Markey\u2019s campaign was anything but conventional, yet he delivered on fundraising, communications and organization. What was there to dislike in his campaign? Not much. In truth, Kennedy has been a solid member of the House and was growing into one of its bright stars. While he is out of elective politics for a while, he can still have a meaningful impact in changing the country\u2019s direction. The Kennedys will still shine bright in history, but Tuesday night they did lose some of their luster.  Clearly, the moment belongs to Markey. Without abandoning his principles or priorities, after running a clean race and delivering the first ever defeat of a Kennedy in a Massachusetts election, Markey returns to the Senate with more influence than ever. There are a good number of folks in Massachusetts (where I am living these days) who have been despondent about our politics. Markey\u2019s victory will give them fresh hope.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. It may be unfashionable to say, but national party conventions are important \u2013 even when the parties can\u2019t convene. They are among the few nights on the election calendar when a candidate and campaign have the chance to deliver an unfiltered message directly to an audience of tens of millions of Americans. Joe Biden enters his convention with an average polling lead of 9 points, the strongest position of any challenger to an incumbent president in recent history. Yet in a deeply divided country, the race is bound to tighten. A CNN poll released Sunday puts Biden\u2019s lead at a narrower four points. The convention gives him a chance to fortify his position for the fall campaign before Trump gets his turn at the Republican Convention next week. First, while he has held a steady lead, only about a third of voters backing the former Vice President say they are doing so primarily to support him. Most say they will vote for Biden out of a desire to defeat President Trump. This reflects the fact that, despite his 50 years in politics, Biden\u2019s background isn\u2019t all that well known. People remember him as Barack Obama\u2019s Vice President. Many Americans recall the tragic death of Biden\u2019s son, Beau, which the country watched him live through. But the convention is a chance to flesh out Biden\u2019s biography and accomplishments. Biden\u2019s strengths \u2013 namely, character decency, empathy, and experience \u2013 should all be comparative advantages in a race against a president whose personal qualities and management style have become major liabilities, especially in the crucible of the Covid-19 crisis. Look for the Democrats to draw those contrasts. The President\u2019s chaotic stewardship during the virus itself and Trump\u2019s relentlessly divisive leadership will be a persistent theme. Biden began his race as a \u201cBattle for the soul of America,\u201d and it is a meme you can expect to hear throughout the week. Yet while Biden leads Trump on many polling measures, there is one on which the President continues to have an advantage and that should be a concern to Biden and the Democrats. Despite the precipitous drop caused by the virus and measures to cope with it, Trump still leads on the important question of who will better handle the economy. So, you can be sure that Democrats also will use the next four nights to attack Trump as a plutocrat in populist clothing, pushing policies that have benefited the wealthy like himself, while hurting working families. Trump puts voters on high alert In service of this argument, it\u2019s a good bet Democrats will strike a contrast between Trump\u2019s privileged life and Biden\u2019s hardscrabble, working class roots and understanding of the struggles working families face. Biden, at 77, also enters the race as the oldest candidate ever to run for President. (Trump is second at 74). As such, it is imperative for the convention and his speech on Thursday to not only draw a contrast with Trump but to paint a picture of the future that Biden envisions and his prescriptions for getting there. He will have to do that and convey a sense of energy without the advantage of the roaring crowd that would normally greet the nominee at a traditional party convention. Biden\u2019s speech instead may feel more like a fireside chat \u2013 a challenging assignment, but also more appropriate and reassuring for a country riven by crisis. While the convention will lack the vitality of crowd interaction, the virtual format the virus requires will allow the organizers to produce two made-for-TV hours of programming each night, without the awkward intervals that the traditional, anachronistic convention provides. You can expect faster-paced programming: Shorter and fewer speeches, more video and testimonials from everyday people and musical interludes. And while there will be more moving parts, as they pull in speakers from around the country, many of the presentations will have been pre-recorded, allowing the organizers greater quality control. Democrats also have the advantage of having decided earlier to adopt a virtual format, while Republicans wasted many weeks searching for venues that would accommodate Trump\u2019s vain insistence on speaking to a large crowd of supporters. The biggest lesson Scranton taught Joe Biden We will see next week if and how well the Republicans have caught up. One other advantage of a virtual convention is that riffs between the far left and more moderate factions with the party will be on display little this week. Bound by their shared desperation to defeat Trump, and carefully negotiated platform language, they seem committed to presenting a united front behind Biden and his newly named running-mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris. We will hear from the expected \u201cclosers,\u201d Michelle and Barack Obama, Dr. Jill Biden and, of course, Harris and Biden themselves. We will hear from some of Biden\u2019s vanquished opponents, led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, from an apostate Republican, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and the young progressive icon, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. There will be celebrity hosts and everyday Americans, together painting a portrait of a diverse America. Format notwithstanding, the strategic goal of these conventions will be the same as ever. Each side will tell their version of where we are, where we ought to go, and why their standard-bearer is the best positioned to take us to a better place that the other side will not. And they both may be talking a lot about the same man.  For Biden, the task is to fully introduce himself to the nation and offer reassurance that he is the calm, steadying, decent leader many Americans seek. For an embattled Trump, about whom many Americans already have made up their minds, next week\u2019s convention will be a lot about tearing Biden down. The race will not be won or lost in the next two weeks. But virtual or not, they will be important signposts along the way to the election this November.",

Is Donald Trump trying to lose this election? Seriously, is he self-destructing because somewhere, deep inside his tortured soul he knows he is an unworthy, incompetent, poseur? Naaah. But his executive action suspending collection of payroll taxes hands the Democrats the kind of issue that can sink a candidacy. It is nothing less than a declaration of war on Social Security and Medicare. The payroll tax funds those two vital and beloved programs. When you suspend collection of the revenue that funds those two programs, you endanger their viability. Say it with me, Democrats:  Donald Trump wants to gut Medicare and Social Security. The Center for American Progress jumped on this like a duck on a June bug. Even before Trump announced his executive order and three memorandums on Saturday, CAP was out with a memo slamming the President. CAP says that if his scheme works it \u201cwould divert hundreds of billions from Social Security and Medicare.\u201d  Every Democrat should repeat that. Trump is an impulsive, impetuous man; that we know. But on the issue of cutting Social Security and Medicare, this is not his first attempt. His 2021 and 2020 budgets each proposed deep and painful cuts in Social Security and Medicare. How deep? How painful? $2 trillion over ten years, according to the Wall Street Journal. What a coincidence: that\u2019s about how much Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut for corporate America cost. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Trump\u2019s corporate tax cut has a price tag of $1.9 trillion. Donald Trump's five revealing words While hanging out with the forgotten upper class in the globalist hangout of Davos, Switzerland in January, Trump said he was open to cutting entitlements\u2013 in other words, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He even said, \u201cthat\u2019s actually the easiest of all things.\u201d In March, he returned to his desire to cut entitlements, telling a Fox News town hall meeting, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll be cutting.\u201d  Trump did not specify which programs he was referring to, but the big ticket items are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans\u2019 benefits. He later tweeted that he would not cut Medicare or Social Security, but as we have learned, Trump\u2019s tweets are often not worth the pixels they\u2019re printed on. Democrats can run on this and win. I was so confident of this \u2013 even before Trump\u2019s latest attempt to gut Social Security and Medicare, that I devote an entire chapter of my new book (YOU\u2019RE FIRED: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump) to begging Democrats to run on Trump\u2019s attempts to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The title of the chapter is: \u201cThis Chapter Will Beat Trump: I Guarantee It.\u201d Even the conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation is dubious of Trump\u2019s payroll tax suspension \u2013 but for different reasons. Joe Bishop-Henchman, vice president of tax policy and litigation, wrote, \u201cthere are many potential legal challenges associated with a unilateral Presidential payroll tax suspension\u2026 Without detailed answers to some of these questions, employers might just steer clear of all of it by continuing to do what they\u2019ve always done, blunting the desired economic impact of reducing taxes.\u201d Be careful what you wish for, Mr. President Other dubious Trump executive memorandums seek to suspend collection of student loan debt, postpone evictions and extend unemployment benefits. The unemployment benefits order is especially galling, as it requires states to foot one-fourth of the bill; the same states he is refusing to aid as they stare at a revenue collapse that could compel them to cut schools, hospitals and other vital services. Beyond that, Trump is offering out of work Americans just $400 extra per week, a significant cut from the $600 they\u2019ve been getting. Why the cut? \u201cThere was a difficulty with the 600 number because it really was a disincentive,\u201d Trump said. He means that people who get an extra six hundred bucks to keep body and soul together during this Covid crash will suddenly become lazy and refuse to go back to work. That is an insult to every working woman and man, and Democrats should call Trump out on it.  The President seems to believe $600 a week is too generous. Meanwhile, he gets free housing, free health care, a free helicopter and a jumbo jet. Oh, and his family charged the taxpayers nearly $1 million to house Secret Service and other federal employees at Trump-owned properties. So, Democrats can point out, $600 is too much for you, but a million bucks is just fine for the Trump family. Fittingly, Trump issued his order and memorandums at his Bedminster, New Jersey country club, where the initiation fee is reportedly $350,000 \u2013 yet another proof-point that Trump\u2019s heart is really with the Forgotten Upper Class.",

Splitting the atom changed everything, Einstein reputedly said, except the way we think. Covid-19 has changed nearly everything about America: how we live, work, learn, eat, vacation, entertain, interact. More than 4.6 million Americans infected, nearly 160,000 killed, millions of jobs lost. It\u2019s changed everything \u2013 except the way President Donald Trump thinks. His lack of adaptability, and his presumptive rival Joe Biden\u2019s openness to change, are fundamentally altering the contours of campaign 2020. The novel coronavirus has robbed Trump of two of his greatest assets. First, he can no longer convince people that politics is merely spectacle. Before the pandemic, his entertainment skills helped lead many Americans to conclude that politics was theater: an overhyped, cartoonish play in which a brutish lout gets to say rude things about people you dislike. The fascinating mystery of Trump's approach to Putin \u201cOwning the libs\u201d was enough of a goal for many Trump supporters. Trump\u2019s theatrical talent, honed by years on television, lulled some folks into seeing politics as merely show business for ugly people. (I should know: I\u2019m the guy who coined that phrase.) No more. Trump picking a Twitter war with, say, Chrissy Teigen now comes with a cost: the sense that the President isn\u2019t responding to the crisis. People are dying. Morgues are overflowing. Small businesses are collapsing. There is less appetite for low burlesque at a time of high mortality. Second, Trump has lost his ability to divert. It had been his superpower. He was the master of using division for diversion. When GDP numbers in July showed a catastrophic collapse, Trump mused on Twitter about postponing the election. The tweet was shocking. But it didn\u2019t work. The collapsing economy still led the news. In fact, Trump\u2019s move backfired on him. The co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi, who had supported Trump, called it \u201cfascistic\u201d and grounds for Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. When you\u2019ve failed to move the spotlight off the collapsing economy but succeeded in alienating the co-founder of the Federalist Society, you\u2019ve got a problem. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has shown impressive adaptability. He is a natural candidate, a glad-handing, back-slapping, high-fiving retail politician. But Covid-19 took him off the trail, robbed him of that asset and left him talking to the camera from his basement in Delaware. He retooled his campaign. This is the real issue with Biden's VP choice Having faced more personal loss than any person should ever have to endure \u2013 he lost his first wife and daughter in a car crash, and one of his surviving sons later died from brain cancer \u2013 Biden tapped his vast reservoir of empathy, telling the families of those who\u2019ve lost loved ones, \u201cTo all of you hurting so badly, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. This nation grieves with you.\u201d In a video, he said, \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re feeling. You feel like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest. It\u2019s suffocating.\u201d His message was heartfelt and heartbreaking. He knows to the depth of his marrow how painful this is. Biden also released details last month about how he will, in his words, \u201cBuild back better.\u201d His plan is a progressive version of Buy American \u2013 leveraging federal power to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, and investing heavily in research and development. Standing in Dunmore, Pennsylvania \u2013 not far from his hometown of Scranton \u2013 Biden made a direct economic populist pitch: \u201cIf I\u2019m fortunate enough to be elected president, I\u2019ll be laser-focused on working families, the middle-class families that I came from.\u201d He also pledged to raise corporate taxes, which were slashed radically under Trump. \u201cThe days of Amazon paying nothing in federal income tax will be over,\u201d he said. Trump, on the other hand, could not offer a single policy goal for his second term when asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity in late June. Instead of talking about, ohhh, I dunno, fixing our damaged public health infrastructure, or putting people back to work, Trump produced a veritable cornucopia of blather. Here is part of it, each word chasing the previous one to a destination visible only to the addle-brained:  \u201cWell, one of the things that will be really great, you know the word experience is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I\u2019ve always said that. But the word experience is a very important word. It\u2019s an \u2013 a very important meaning.\u201d  Perhaps pleased with this palaver, he went on:  \u201cI never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times. All of a sudden, I\u2019m president of the United States. You know the story. I\u2019m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our First Lady and I say, \u2018This is great.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t know very many people in Washington. It wasn\u2019t my thing. I was from Manhattan, from New York. Now I know everybody, and I have great people in the administration.\u201d Again, the question that produced this stream of idiocy was: \u201cWhat are your top priority items for a second term?\u201d.   Nothing here about how he\u2019ll help Americans. Nothing about health care. Nothing about jobs or the environment or education, or fighting racism. It was all about him. At a time when we\u2019re seeking empathy, he gives us narcissism. We have a long way to go in this election, but if Mr. Trump is to prevail, he will have to do something he has thus far been unable to do: stop being a reality TV host, and start adapting to the new reality. If he doesn\u2019t, tens of millions of Americans will be only too glad to turn the channel and bid him goodbye with a famous TV catch phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Last Thursday, security officials from three countries told us that Russian hackers were targeting organizations involved in Covid-19 vaccine research in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. At first glance, this seems like an old school Cold War story with everyone other than James Bond involved. All of the familiar elements are present: a shady group of Russians called APT29, which also goes by the name \u201cCozy Bear\u201d \u2013  the same group accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election \u2013  and a stout denial of wrongdoing from Kirill Dmitriev, who leads the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which has invested in at least one company developing a vaccine. \u201cAccusations \u2026 regarding hacking attacks against western pharmaceutical companies are an attempt to tarnish the Russian coronavirus vaccine,\u201d he said. Dmitriev, who was educated at Stanford and Harvard Business School, further pressed Russia\u2019s innocence by announcing Friday that AstraZeneca, the UK-based pharmaceutical company that is working on \u201cthe Oxford vaccine,\u201d has agreed to allow production in Russia by a company supported by the RDIF. Despite the deal, Dmitriev said he believed the Russian vaccine was superior, so much so that he and his septuagenarian parents  have already received a dose. Still, Dmitriev insists this is a story of countries needing to \u201cpick sides\u201d regarding which vaccine to buy and distribute to its citizens. In his view, this is a super power race to the top that features the US, China, the UK, and, of course, Russia, as the contestants. Bernie Sanders and Andy Slavitt: America's cost effective Covid-19 solution? Masks for All This approach to market dominance echoes President Donald Trump\u2019s reported March offer of \u201clarge sums of money\u201d to a German company to get first and only dibs on their candidate vaccine. Or his more recent swoop and run of almost all available remdesivir - keeping the only drug that has an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to treat Covid-19 largely in America\u2019s hands. But Dmitriev\u2019s bullying \u201cpick sides\u201d directive and Trump\u2019s \u201cbuy it up\u201d approach arise from the wrong set of assumptions. As strangely comforting, or at least familiar, as the superpowers-seeking-world-dominance story might be, it does not fit with the reality about medical discovery. Medical advances have saved countless lives, earned billions of dollars of profit and made dozens of scientists world famous. But unlike the arms race or the race to space, where there were just two belligerents with deep pockets and an urge for world control, in the medical domain countless other companies, countries and international consortia are in every race. And they all can and will beg, borrow, and steal from each other. There were no competing commercial companies looking for a piece of the action when the atomic bomb was built or when Mercury One was launched into space. But in the medical world there are. Lots of them. Consider a drug like the antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine), introduced in the 1980s and one of the first billion-dollar medications.It was the only available drug in its class for a few years but then the market caught up to it and spawned similar compounds. Then the generics started grabbing a piece of the pie. Same story for the statins. And antibiotics.  And sleeping pills. And heartburn medicine. Yes, the first one to the approval gets the first billion but soon after that everyone else gets into the action. Of course, the extreme urgency to get a vaccine up and into millions of people as soon as possible changes the story somewhat. But as of July 15, we have 23 vaccine products that are being tested in humans and another 140 in various stages of pre-clinical development, according to the World Health Organization. We're wasting time talking about herd immunity Given the public health crisis at hand, the need to make political hay, and our chronically imbalanced perception of risk and benefit, many of these products are likely to be approved or at least given FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Plus Russia and some other countries have a less strict system for regulatory approval. According to Dmitriev, the Russian vaccine will move from a Phase 1-like study (small and focused on safety) to delivery to the general population in just a few months \u2013 an unheard of pace in the West. This beat \u2018em to the punch approach overlooks the long history with other medications used in desperate situations, especially cancer, when borders become quite porous and what is approved in one country quickly finds its way to the next. These unique conditions likely will lead to multiple vaccine products becoming available one way or another. Determining efficacy will be difficult and subject to squabbles among experts but \u2013 if we are lucky \u2013 the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines will be 50% to 60% effective, similar to the influenza shots on a good-match year. And the side effect profile hopefully will be favorable, though in the recent Moderna product, which is entering a large definitive Phase 3 shortly, 21% of patients at the most potent dose had one or more \u201csevere adverse events,\u201d  including severe fatigue, headache and chills. That does not even consider the questions about second vaccination and sorting out whether it is safe or advisable to vaccinate with one product now (maybe the Oxford?) then another later (hmm, I would like to try the Moderna, thank you) in hopes of bigger and better immunity. I suspect we are about to enter a vaccine free-for-all with preferences based on extremely sparse information. Indeed, the recent \u201cdebate\u201d over the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 will pale in comparison to the data-lite, opinion-heavy give-me-that-one-now \u201cnational discussion\u201d we are about to enter into.  It\u2019s unclear what, if any, information was collected from the putative Russian hack. Given the inevitable confusion ahead, getting to the head of the line just does not make sense as an explanation, at least from a financial windfall perspective or a saving lives perspective. But the need to dominate voiced both by Trump and the leader of Russian vaccine efforts, Dmitriev, makes the likely reason for any sneak attack all too clear. It\u2019s less about saving the world with a vaccine than about beating the other guy and taking home the first place medal.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. Much has been made of the spectacular flop that was President Trump\u2019s planned campaign re-launch in Tulsa over the weekend.  But one of the most revealing moments got too little attention. It was almost an afterthought in the middle of a nearly two-hour speech and improv when Trump rolled out his principal attack on Joe Biden. And in doing so, Trump also tipped his hand as to why he feared Biden so much that he bought himself an impeachment trying to dirty up the former Vice President. \u201cIf the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control,\u201d proclaimed the self-styled \u201claw-and-order president\u201d in the midst of his long, disorderly presentation. \u201cJoe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left.\u201d The lines he appeared to ad-lib about Biden next were unintentionally revealing. \u201cHe\u2019s not radical left. I don\u2019t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left.  But he\u2019s controlled by the radical left, and now he\u2019s really controlled.\u201d Donald Trump is a cultural warrior. His politics depends on mining the fear and resentment of white, working class voters who feel they are on the losing end of economic and demographic change. The old-school campaign tactic that's boosting Biden Joe Biden is culturally inconvenient for Trump\u2019s re-election project.  An older, white, Irish Catholic from a working class Pennsylvania family, Biden is just not frightening enough to the voters Trump needs to scare. Trump has recognized this from the start. It\u2019s why he leaned so hard on the President of Ukraine last summer to open a baseless investigation into Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s board membership of a Ukrainian energy company. Now Trump has the match up he hoped to avoid. And his comments on Saturday underscored both why he fears Biden and what line of attack he will attempt to use to shove the race back into the cultural framework Trump believes will motivate his base. (Whether his base is large enough to win is another story.) Trump\u2019s acknowledgment that Biden is not \u201cradical left,\u201d was an admission that to try to paint the former VP as extreme was a losing proposition. So instead, Trump will try to portray Biden as the addled, doddering tool, too weak to resist the gravitational pull of the Left. Trump is relying on Biden\u2019s occasionally uneven performances to support his argument.  But Biden has been relatively disciplined in his comments since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and his team has been strategic about how and where he has appeared, mainly via Zoom, while it is Trump who has suffered from overexposure.  The President who suggested to the nation that consuming disinfectant might be a ready cure for Covid-19 opens himself up to a vicious counterpunch if he stakes his candidacy on attacking another man\u2019s mental acuity.  Yet that is where he is going. That is the best shot he has. Biden\u2019s most salient qualities \u2013 empathy, decency, experience \u2013 have always offered a valuable contrast to Trump\u2019s most glaring deficiencies as a leader. They have become even more pronounced in this period of trial and unrest, during which the cost of Trump\u2019s narcissism, divisiveness and inability to manage crises has come into sharper focus. In February, the odds favored the re-election of the president. Today, they have shifted in favor of the challenger.  This was symbolized by the startling sea of empty blue seats Trump confronted in Tulsa, as he offered up a melange of 1970 culture war hits: flag-burning, leftist mob rule, socialism, the confiscation of guns and toppling of Confederate icons. Still, as Trump madly pushes these tried and true buttons, he\u2019s not getting the desired reaction. He is underperforming among the non-college white and evangelical voters whose overwhelming support facilitated his narrow electoral victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago. Add this to a seismic move among suburban voters against Trump, who carried the suburbs in 2016, and a lesser but significant shift from voters over 65 who also favored Trump in \u201916 but now give Biden the edge, and you can see the president\u2019s challenge. Biden\u2019s age, background and demographic profile may have been an obstacle in nailing down the nomination of an increasingly diverse Democratic Party, but it is working for him now. For a white culture warrior like Trump, old Joe Biden is proving to be a vexing target.",

His most recent book is \u201cSan Francisco Year Zero: Political Upheaval Punk Rock and a Third Place Baseball Team.\u201d (Rutgers University Press, 2019) Follow him on Twitter @LincolnMitchell. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. While Democrats struggle with the logistics of planning a political convention during a pandemic, pundits are stepping up their suggestions about who presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph Biden should choose as his running mate. This quadrennial ritual is a fun part of American politics \u2013 and its importance shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Certainly there are those who argue that vice-presidential choices don\u2019t matter all that much because voters make their decision based on the top of the ticket. This is true to an extent, but there is more to it than that. Whoever Biden chooses will be elevated to a prominent role in the Democratic party and in the political life of the country. Biden himself must be aware that, had Barack Obama not picked him for his 2008 ticket, his chances of being his party\u2019s likely 2020 nominee would have been slim. Perhaps more importantly, vice presidential choices matter because they help frame perceptions of the presidential candidate. When Donald Trump chose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate in 2016, it signaled both that Trump was willing to work with conventional career politicians and that he cared about the conservative base of the Republican Party. Biden has one VP pick that stands above the rest In 2008 John McCain\u2019s choice of then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate probably did not cost him the election, but his choice of someone so clearly unqualified \u2013and unvetted by his campaign \u2013 revealed an impetuous side of McCain\u2019s political temperament that likely turned off some voters. One of the most intriguing examples of a nominee contributing to the narrative around a presidential campaign occurred in 1992 when Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor who represented the southern moderate-to-conservative wing of the Democratic Party, did not balance his ticket with a northern liberal, a woman or person of color, but reinforced his image by choosing Tennessee Sen. Al Gore who, at the time, was also part of the party\u2019s southern moderates. This helped Clinton portray himself as a centrist breaking from a party that many swing voters saw as becoming too liberal. Biden\u2019s vice-presidential choice will similarly help formulate an image about him in the minds of many voters. He has already begun to do this by pledging to put a woman on the ticket, thus showing that he recognizes the importance of diversity. Many candidates choose their running mates based on who they think will help them get elected. Biden himself was chosen at least in part because his foreign policy experience and appeal to white working-class voters helped Obama in areas where he was weak or inexperienced. Similarly,  Pence, an Evangelical Christian, was instrumental in helping Trump raise his stock with evangelical voters. The creative thinker who should be Biden's vice president However, this year will be different for Biden. Given his age \u2013 he will be 78 on Inauguration Day of 2021 (Trump will be 74) \u2013 and the reality of a terrible pandemic that preys on older people, Biden must emphasize governance when choosing a running mate. Whoever Biden chooses, should he be nominated, must be seen by voters as able to be president immediately if something were to happen to him. Accordingly, choosing a younger, less experienced, but perhaps more exciting candidate might not be the best choice. This is one reason why if Biden were to select former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a smart, progressive, dynamic politician who has never been elected to anything higher than the Georgia state legislature and has no Washington experience, it might send the wrong message about governance. This may be bad news for Abrams, but it should be encouraging for several other women, including California\u2019s Kamala Harris, Massachusetts\u2019 Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar. These three senators competed with Biden for the Democratic nomination but fell behind him, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, early in the campaign season. However, they are all clearly qualified to be president right now. Harris was California\u2019s attorney general for six years and has served three and a half years in the US Senate. Warren was elected to the Senate in 2012 and was in national government for years before that. Klobuchar won her Senate seat in 2006. Biden must choose 'the woman in Michigan' Broadly speaking, Biden\u2019s potential choices among his three former rivals tap into the key demographic or political factions of the Democratic Party. Choosing one of them probably will not guarantee Biden any more support from those groups, but it will influence how voters see him, both positively and negatively. Choosing Warren would assuage progressive concerns that Biden is too centrist, but would make him more vulnerable to being called a socialist by the Trump campaign. Putting Harris, or another African American woman like Abrams or Florida Rep. Val Demings, on the ticket will send a message to African American voters, to whom Biden would owe his nomination, should he be tapped, that they are a central part of his coalition. However, it would send a very different message to white working-class voters. Putting a white Midwestern woman like Klobuchar on the ticket would send a message from Biden that white working-class voters are the key to his coalition while downplaying the importance of African American voters. Klobuchar represents a swing state, so her ability to deliver that state in the general election may figure into Biden\u2019s deliberation as well. (Warren and Harris both represent solidly Democratic states that will vote for Biden no matter who his running mate is.) Other swing-state politicians who would also be ready to take on presidential responsibilities immediately if necessary include Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, currently serving her second term in the Senate, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.  For Biden, the questions are: what story does he want to tell about himself and his candidacy through his selection of a running mate, and where does he think he is strong (or weak) already. Biden\u2019s success so far has been based on his unusual ability to appeal to working-class white voters as well as African Americans. However, with seemingly no potential running mate who also appeals to both constituencies, Biden will have to make a choice and decide where he is strong enough on his own that he does not need additional help. It remains true that for the huge majority of Americans, Biden\u2019s choice will have little impact on their vote. Most decided long ago whether or not they want to give Trump another term. However, close presidential elections are won on the margins as undecided voters in a handful of states make up their minds. For those voters, the image and story that the candidates craft are very important \u2013 and for Biden part of that story will be told through his choice of running mate.",

Her work focuses on recentering people on the margins of society, culture from the African Diaspora and structural inequality. She received a photography commission from the Obama Foundation in 2018 and is currently working on her master\u2019s degree at Columbia Journalism School. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles at CNN. On Saturday, audiences across the world logged onto Twitter and Netflix to take part in the official global (and quarantine-friendly) watch party for Michelle Obama\u2019s new documentary film, \u201cBecoming.\u201d Tens of thousands of tweets, with the hashtag #WatchBecoming, exchanged emotional testimonies, quotes, expressions of gratitude and even GIFs. The outpouring pushed the hashtag to be a top trending topic in the US. The Netflix documentary follows the former first lady on a book tour promoting her 2018 autobiography by the same title. The book is a personal narrative that delves deep into moments that shaped Obama as an individual and life lessons she processes as she begins the next phase of her life outside of politics. In the film, we get to see Obama reflecting on growing up in a working-class family from the South Side of Chicago. She talks candidly about her late father, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. We get to hear about the very first time she spoke to Barack Obama on the phone and how his voice gave her a bit of butterflies, her struggles with trying to find herself after motherhood, enduring negative comments on the campaign trail, 2008\u2019s election night and juggling simultaneous defining moments \u2013 like the memorial for the Charleston church shooting victims happening the same day as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states on June 26, 2015 \u2013 during the Obama administration. Viewers heard about how the Obama girls spent their last night in the place where they called home for eight years: a sleepover. A testament to the pockets of normalcy that the former first lady tried to give her children during that time. And in the morning, Obama said she woke them up by saying, \u201cWake up, the Trumps are coming!\u201d During the watch party, viewers were inspired to share their favorite moments. People reacted to Craig Robinson, Obama\u2019s brother, always cracking a joke on his baby sister; and they shared stories about their own sibling rivalries. Many on Twitter identified with the stress of having to maintain perfection, which the former first lady expressed openly. They laughed when she talked about calling Barack Obama \u201ca trifling black man\u201d when he was late for their first meeting, and later Twitter users swooned over the rest of the Obama\u2019s love story. Reviews for the documentary span the spectrum of opinion, much like the Obamas themselves. IndieWire called it \u201cbland,\u201d while Forbes saw in it \u201clessons in leadership,\u201d and  The New York Times called it a \u201croutine\u201d  documentary that we would see with any megastar, showing the public \u201cselective biographical moments and star-studded guest appearances.\u201d This is all a matter of perspective, a truth that keeps the film\u2019s director and cinematographer Nadia Hallgren from ruminating on these voices for too long. Former first lady's book is becoming a Netflix documentary As a kid, Hallgren could be found watching documentaries and foreign films when she wasn\u2019t people-watching on her stoop in the South Bronx. She landed her first big break in 2004, working as a production assistant and camera operator with Michael Moore on his documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, and launched a career out of that opportunity. With dozens of credits and awards under her belt,  \u201cBecoming\u201d is Hallgren\u2019s first feature-length project. Hallgren and I first met years ago at the Bronx Documentary Center when she came to mentor a cohort of newbies \u2013 myself included. There she taught me that each shot and editing choice is a wink or a nod that all points to the underlying intention of a film. On Friday, before the global watch party, I joined Hallgren for a virtual  discussion on the filmmaking process. We not only discussed the meditative practice behind her elegant cinematography, the importance of ordinary things and waiting for magic, but also filmmaking in this era of disinformation and documenting the vulnerabilities of everyday folks and the powerful alike. Answers have been edited for length and clarity. Melissa Bunni Elian: What was the working relationship like with Michelle Obama? From her writing, we know she understands story, how single moments come together. This film is about the power of coming to terms with one\u2019s past and the formation of a personal narrative. How did this influence, if at all, how you worked together? Nadia Hallgren: I think that she appreciated and understood the process. To the extent that we, as filmmakers, ask for a lot from strangers, she was okay with it. She would even suggest things or let me know events that were happening in her life so that I could be there. As I assembled the film that I wanted to make \u2013and eventually show to her \u2013 she was supportive of what we made with her own personal story, even giving me advice on how to deepen certain threads. Elian: There\u2019s a critique that this film wasn\u2019t private enough. But the Obamas are private citizens. What boundaries did you juggle? What do you consider public in terms of what you are documenting and how do you balance that with what new information can be revealed? Hallgren: We really did get unprecedented access to Obama and I think a lot of that is perspective. I think you can see it when we are filming in her hotel room as she\u2019s getting ready backstage. There are these really intimate moments between her and her staff. Even with her and former President Barack Obama. We also see an intimate moment with her and her daughter Malia. Considering someone can say something like \u201cI\u2019ve never heard Malia speak and I see her speaking in the film and she\u2019s saying something profound,\u201d I think it\u2019s a testament to the level of intimacy and access that we actually did get from this film. We are used to seeing Michelle Obama from far away, like we\u2019ve never seen her that close up. She was just awesome with me. She\u2019s a very warm person and she\u2019s a hugger and likes to engage with people. It was really great! It never bothered her that I was that close to her. Elian: In terms of the book and the documentary, how did you approach weaving them together? What did you want to preserve from the book in the film? Was there anything new you wanted to explore? Hallgren: As I read the book, I did highlight stories that I thought were incredibly moving to me and thought about how those could be incorporated in the film. A lot of those played out on stage at her readings as well, so viewers learn her backstory. But we also wanted to make a film that was very different from the book. For example, when she\u2019s hanging out with her brother and he is teasing her about her outfit, I think scenes like that one are so telling because she\u2019s still someone\u2019s little sister getting teased. There was a tremendous opportunity to be with Obama in the moment that to me, as a verit\u00e9 filmmaker, is a real gift. Elian: Something else that really stood out to me was the voices that we hear beyond Obama\u2019s. We have the superstar moderators, but then it seems to me that the most powerful questions actually came from the young adults who she spends time with. In terms of the films you usually make and the characters and their struggles, I felt like that the whole reason for the film was to get those voices out. Was that your intention? How did you think of weaving the big society voices with these future adults? Hallgren: I like that you got that from knowing my past work. Just like you said, young people often ask the questions that the adults don\u2019t dare ask. That\u2019s the reason why Obama loves spending time with young people. They\u2019re so unguarded and unselfconscious and she enjoys that. That also provided for really great storytelling to get to some deeper places in what\u2019s happening in Obama\u2019s life right now. We go into those smaller settings and some of the questions get a little bit more intimate. Elian: In one of several scenes where you focus on students, Elizabeth, a young Latina woman, describes her hardships when called upon to speak during a small meet-and-greet hosted for students throughout the tour. Obama then talked about turning those hardships into small triumphs. It seems like the films and the subject matter you usually take on have that same quality. Why are these stories important and did you know that you were going to tell that kind of story within the larger narrative? Hallgren: There\u2019s something about the ordinariness of life that I find very special. I think that there\u2019s a real beauty in that and I like to focus on that a lot, especially as a cinematographer. I think there is so much humanity in those details that says a lot about people. Obama was traveling to tell her story, and hundreds of thousands of people wanted to hear it. And so with Elizabeth, when she shared her own story with Obama and they had this incredible connection, I wanted to go a little bit deeper. That was how that came about in terms of diving into those particular young women\u2019s backstories. Elian: You\u2019re looking for the ordinary, but you\u2019re also seeing extraordinary things happen all around you. How are you piecing that all together, knowing what to capture? Hallgren: My process of cinematography is very meditative. When we filmed at her childhood home, I filmed there with her and then I went back the next day \u2013 just completely alone so that I could be there by myself with no pressure and take in the space in a really thoughtful way. And I filmed quietly. That\u2019s when that beautiful shadow came over her father\u2019s chair and it really felt like he was in the room and that\u2019s the magic of photography and cinematography, especially when things aren\u2019t planned and they\u2019re not set up, stuff happens and then it\u2019s like this feeling of: I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING!! I try to just be in the moment and be present and eventually things will emerge that kind of speak to me. I was so close to Obama all the time. You know, I was thinking that  at some point someone\u2019s going to be like \u201cYou can\u2019t be up on her like that.\u201d But no one said anything. You know, sometimes nothing happens for hours, but I think it\u2019s just the practice of being prepared for it. Elian: This film addresses the issue of public scrutiny. Knowing the ways in which the Obamas face scrutiny, did you feel any difference in your sense of anticipation towards reactions to the film. Were you afraid some things might be misinterpreted from what you were capturing? Hallgren: I honestly didn\u2019t know what to expect in terms of the level of scrutiny or anything like that. I stand by the film that I made. We worked hard to make sure that the film was cohesive and clear. We\u2019re telling a big story so there is a lot that goes into that process. Part of putting your work out in the world is for people to sort of take it and for people to bring their own life experience to it. I think that for all artists and filmmakers, it\u2019s something you have to be willing to do. Elian: How do you view your role as a documentary filmmaker and the documentary format as a tool for learning, and the power of the camera, specifically in this era of disinformation?  Hallgren: As a kid, my world was so small. I loved seeing people in magazines, foreign movies and documentaries \u2013 any way that I could consume this idea of this bigger world and how people live differently. So I think that for me that was a way that I got information and I actually got more curious and interested in people. So I hope that the work that I do helps people\u2019s curiosity about each other and brings a level of understanding of complexity to the world. One of the biggest things I learned  as someone involved in the lives of people is that we all go in with ideas and when those ideas get turned on their heads, that\u2019s probably the most exciting part of it. There is so much more behind things that I didn\u2019t know. Elian: One line that stood out to me was when Obama said \u201cWhat I experience in these arenas is the power of gathering,\u201d as we see her signing books and interacting with readers early on in the film. Everyone in attendance exuded energy. What was the feeling in that room and can you imagine that ever happening again post-coronavirus? Hallgren: I hope so! It was so special! The energy in the crowd at Obama\u2019s events was tremendous, it was moving and overwhelming and it\u2019s what inspired me to want to capture the faces of people in the audience in the way that I did. I was so moved by all the different types of people, the ages of people. It was a tremendous energy that just felt monumentally special and it felt historic. I felt very lucky to be there. You can tell when people value something. People dressed in their nicest clothes and there was just this pact that came with just being in the room.",

Bernie Sanders\u2019 millions of volunteers, supporters, donors and voters demonstrated the breadth of our movement that is widening the boundaries of acceptable political debate in this country. As Bernie himself has pointed out, ideas like Medicare for All and jobs for all, that only a few years ago would have been radical, are now supported by the American people.  Our work has been so successful that policies such as a $15 minimum hourly wage and free public college tuition have been adopted by the Democratic Party and even by Bernie\u2019s primary opponents. We made that happen. We made policies that benefit everyday people important again. We effectively delivered, and will continue to deliver, a new hopeful vision for our country.  My good friend Senator Nina Turner uses a quote from the late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan that sums up the vision that we offer \u2013 \u201can America as good as its promise.\u201d The Sanders\u2019 candidacy was always about accelerating our path toward that \u201cAmerica as good as its promise\u201d by institutionalizing as much progressive change into law as could be accomplished had he become president. Just as Republicans have spent decades unsuccessfully trying to gut Social Security and Medicare, so they would spend decades trying to undo a President Sanders\u2019 plans for college for all, Medicare for All, and the rest. Mitch McConnell's phony gesture to 'future generations' Now we have come to the place where Bernie is not going to be the president.  I wish I could convey how deeply that hurts me to write it.  But that\u2019s where we are.  We can spend a lot of time fixated on the unfairness of the process over the last two primary cycles, the role of big money, the advantages of the establishment and the fecklessness of much of the media.  All that is true.  But, so what?  Who in our movement ever thought that the ruling class was just going to roll over?  Progressive politics is not for the faint of heart. Nor is it a debating society.  It\u2019s not the \u201cholier than thou\u201d Olympics.  It is organizing to achieve real and positive change in the lives of the people we represent.  It\u2019s not about being right.  It\u2019s about achieving what\u2019s right for the right people.  The people who are, in Sanders\u2019 words, too often \u201cput down and pushed around.\u201d  That is why so many people worked for, donated to and voted for Bernie\u2019s campaign \u2013 to make life better for ordinary people. As our movement moves the Democratic Party and much of the nation in our direction through our blood, our sweat, and, too often in recent days, our tears, we must be good stewards of the hard-won political influence we earned to benefit the people we care about. Why Stacey Abrams is making her case for VP -- everywhere I don\u2019t know anyone who thinks Joe Biden will be as far to the left as president as Sanders would have been. But after all the work we progressives have done together, having knocked on all those doors, made all those calls, made all the small donations, the rank and file supporters of our movement deserve to enjoy the success of their efforts so far. Will the changes we see in the short run be incremental? Of course, they will (although it is our mutual responsibility to make them as expansive as possible). But that increment will be an improvement in the lives of real people that springs directly from the organizing we have done. Does this mean we should support an incremental approach to change?  Absolutely not. We will all continue to push forward an agenda of transformative change and we will fight for candidates who will deliver it. I know this position will be controversial to some, as will the decision to use a SuperPAC as the vehicle for this effort. Senator Sanders himself doesn\u2019t approve of this vehicle. But a real improvement in people\u2019s lives at this moment is possible.  So we must all deliver it in the most effective way we are comfortable with. Otherwise, how can we look in the face the single mother that Bernie and I met in Iowa, who was making $8.00 an hour, if we sit home because we don\u2019t want to pull the lever for Joe Biden \u2013 who supports a $15 minimum wage?  Why should our ideological sensitivities mean anything to her and her kids if they can\u2019t afford housing, or medicine, or food?  Where is our moral standing to ask her or anyone like her to stand with us in the next campaign?  How do we explain to the 60-year-old service worker who has no health insurance that we could have gotten her access to Medicare (not a buy-in, but access like 65-year-olds get now)?  Should she care that we were so committed to Medicare for All that we wouldn\u2019t support a candidate who would make Medicare available only to some 40 million additional people over the course of a single term in office? Why should people trust progressives to protect their interests in the future if we fail to deliver when we have the opportunity now? In this moment, we must work as hard as we can to secure as much as we can for the people whose interests our movement champions: the poor and marginalized, working families and the middle class. That\u2019s not to say any of these changes go far enough or that our work is finished.  Far from it. We will keep pushing.  We will keep organizing. We will keep building. This isn\u2019t about Joe, or Bernie, or any one of us. It\u2019s about all of us. It\u2019s about meeting the needs of people so that together we can create that America as good as its promise. That won\u2019t happen by sitting on the sidelines with our arms folded.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Joe Biden has moved into the vice-presidential sweepstakes phase of his candidacy. Although the choice for vice president rarely matters as much as the media buildup suggests it will (long gone are the days when regional balance on the ticket was vital to the outcome), Biden\u2019s pick this time around will be significant. Besides the concerns some have raised about Biden\u2019s age and stamina, the fact that this campaign will take place in the middle of a full-scale pandemic means Democrats will need all hands on deck to pull out a victory in November. While there are many good possibilities from which Biden can choose, one stands out more than any other: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She fulfills several key criteria that Biden will need from a running mate to help him win. Keeping big promises: This is a basic part of the decision, but one that he can\u2019t get wrong. During his debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders in March, Biden vowed on national television that he would select a woman for the role. He can\u2019t back down from this promise even if governors like New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo and California\u2019s Gavin Newsom \u2014 who have raised their profile during the pandemic \u2014 seem appealing. The last thing that Biden wants to do is follow in the footsteps of former President George H.W. Bush, who famously said, \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes\u201d on the campaign trail in 1988, before doing exactly what he promised he wouldn\u2019t in 1990. The party of governance and serious ideas: The pandemic has laid bare the danger of an administration that does not value expertise or take the task of governing seriously. President Donald Trump\u2019s haphazard respond to Covid-19 at every step of this crisis will intensify the desire for an administration that can handle the demands of the office. National polls have shown that trust in the President\u2019s ability to handle the pandemic has fallen. Michigan's protests are a bellwether of an increasingly dangerous partisan divide Americans may be looking for someone they can trust, and Warren brings all the qualities to the table, with her devotion to ideas and public policy, extensive experience in public service, and the ability to deliberate substantively over the most complex matters. Adding her to the ticket would help Democrats draw a distinction with Trump and define the campaign as a race between the party of experience and ideas versus the party of chaos. Mobilizing the base: This remains as central as ever. Given the President\u2019s ability to retain much of his base support in the major Electoral College states, Democrats will need to make sure every voter undertakes his or her civic responsibility by sending in a ballot through the mail or showing up on Election Day. The challenge will be doubly difficult since the effects of the pandemic could easily lead to lower turnout. Of all the contenders for vice president, Warren has one of the best chances of mobilizing progressives within the party. Without having to compete against Sanders, Warren can represent the left wing and serve as a unifying force on the ticket. She is an unabashed supporter of using government to solve problems and she has consistently put forth policies that progressives agree with. Because the world has changed so much since January, some of the ideas that may have made her seem too radical during the campaign \u2014 like an expansive vision of health care, an aggressive approach to climate change, and bold economic policies for working Americans \u2014 will sit easier with the center of the electorate. Warren can also help Biden  draw female voters, who in the 2018 midterm election made all the difference to the balance of power in Congress. Media sophistication: During the primaries, Warren was remarkably adept at generating media attention and using social media to communicate her message in a crowded field. In 2020, breaking through the noise and communicating effectively across different platforms will be essential, especially since traditional campaign events will be limited due to the coronavirus and a substantial amount of media attention will be devoted to public health. During her campaign, Warren was known for taking selfies with her supporters, which helped generate excitement for her candidacy and create a substantial online presence. Her Twitter feed was an effective way for her to share her policy messages and offer personal glimpses into her life. When it comes to political communication, Warren brings the receipts. She could easily help Biden boost his public standing and communicate in ways that he is not comfortable with. Warren performed extremely well in the televised primary debates and showed an ability both to hold her own in contentious moments and explain complex ideas in a simple way. Time to fire Jared and Ivanka Middle class insecurity: Due to the pandemic, voters are particularly concerned about economic security. Many working Americans, who were already struggling to provide for their families, have now lost their jobs, while a major recession looms on the horizon. There are few politicians in the national arena who have tackled the economic challenges of the middle class as intensely as Warren. She spent much of her time as an academic studying the threats that the middle class faces from high credit burdens, education and health care costs, consumer fraud and nonunionized work. She headed the congressional panel that oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was created in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis. It was Warren who helped establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As senator, Warren made the economic health of the middle class her top priority. Placing Warren on the ticket would send a strong signal to voters that Biden will deal with these struggles from his first day in office. Warren has something else to offer. She became known for having a plan, or what seemed like an answer for every problem. She thought systematically about the nation\u2019s challenges and laid out detailed responses. At this moment, Americans are desperate for a plan. Somewhere in between the choice of permanent self-distancing and reckless liberation must come a well-thought-out plan that is comprehensive and clear.  Americans want to know how this will end and how we will restore our lives, with a healthy economy and our social institutions intact. More than ever, we need a planner to help us out of this mess. Among Biden\u2019s many options, Warren would be the most powerful choice. She would instantly energize Biden\u2019s campaign and expand its capacity to reach a broad electoral base. While Biden may be considering others, like former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, it is Warren, one of the stars of the Democratic primary, who offers him the best chance for taking the Oval Office.",

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. The daily White House briefings certainly bring some relevant information each time about the federal government\u2019s response to the deadly coronavirus pandemic. But the briefings have also become a political tool for President Donald Trump. He uses them both to take credit and to shift blame away from himself for his response to the crisis. Amidst the recent flurry of news made at recent briefings -- about how or whether to \u201creopen\u201d the country, the different phases that might involve and who \u201ccalls the shots\u201d \u2013 was a revealing exchange that is emblematic of the President\u2019s political strategy ahead of the November election. This was most clearly and cleverly demonstrated in response to a question from Jonathan Karl, of ABC News, who asked Trump for a reaction to protesters in Michigan rallying against stay-at-home restrictions. The President, who earlier in the briefing had lauded Americans\u2019 stay-at home-discipline, took a different approach with the Michigan protesters. The President said, \u201cWell, they\u2019ve been going through this a long time, Jon, and it\u2019s been a tough process for people \u2026 there\u2019s death and there\u2019s problems staying at home, too.\u201d When Karl pressed further on the protesters\u2019 violation of social-distancing guidelines, Trump added, \u201cI think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion.\u201d As Amber Phillips of the Washington Post observed: \u201cInstead of taking the opportunity to tell the protesters to stay home, he empathized with their desire to go back to work.\u201d The President then doubled down on the strategy this morning with less subtle tweets saying \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA,\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN,\u201d and \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA.\u201d It was all a dog whistle of sorts to his supporters that accomplished a couple of things at once: It suggested to them that it was OK to move away from social-distancing practices, designed to stem the tide of Covid-19, and get back to a more normal life. And it also told them that if they stuck with social distancing, any suffering and inconvenience they experience is not Trump\u2019s fault because he gets them, they speak the same language, he feels their pain. And that messaging is illustrative of the President\u2019s overall strategy to get reelected. He\u2019s given himself maximum flexibility to take credit for whatever goes right and maximum ability to deflect or shift any blame for whatever goes wrong. The strategy is part of the dizzying turnaround from the President\u2019s position earlier in the week, when he told reporters he had absolute authority, adding \u201cthe President of the United States calls the shots.\u201d Thursday\u2019s briefing brought a significant change in tune, with the President bestowing upon the governors wide authority, reporting that he had told them in a conference call they now call the shots. That was less a constitutional climbdown and more a reflection of the President managing his political situation and strategy. Cuomo to Trump: How many times do you want me to say 'thank you'? The strategy is brilliant in its simplicity. The governors now take the responsibility of all public health decisions in their states as well as when and how to reopen the economy\u2013 including schools, large gatherings, even professional sports.  If they open too soon and the virus spikes in a significant way, they alone are responsible. If they open too slowly, and the economy contracts even further and unemployment continues to rise, they will also have to answer for that. After blaming almost everyone under the sun for the position we are in, and taking no responsibility himself, the President now has engineered a safer political environment where he cedes his leadership in return for being critic-in-chief. The only unknown is what he\u2019ll be campaigning against and when he\u2019ll get going on it. But it\u2019s very easy to see him entering the fall saying \u201cwe moved too quickly/we moved too slowly against my own better judgment.\u201d This approach offers a potentially potent weapon against his presumptive opponent, Joe Biden. The former vice president has been clear that reopening the country too soon is a recipe for disaster  But if, by chance, an earlier reopening in some states does not cause a reemergence of the spread of Covid-19, while at the same time other large state economies are slow to reopen, the President will hammer his opponent for causing economic hardship across the country. All of this strategy is based on the public\u2019s buying into the idea that we\u2019ve done enough testing already \u2013the truth is the country is woefully lagging \u2013 or that the additional testing needs to be done by the states, which they currently are ill-equipped to do. Michigan's protests are a bellwether of an increasingly dangerous partisan divide I have little doubt that on both of those scores \u2013 and with the help of conservative media partners like Fox News \u2013 the President will be well-positioned with his base. I believe they will embrace the simple strategy of what goes right is credit to the President and what goes wrong is not his fault. The real question is: What will the swing voters decide? These are the working-class Democrats who crossed over in 2016 and the moderate Republicans who\u2019ve never been comfortable with the President\u2019s character or style of governing. They are the real battleground for the 2020 election. And the victor will be decided in no small part on who wins the blame game for the catastrophic disruption to American life in 2020. While it\u2019s impossible to predict who wins at this point, the President\u2019s answer about the Michigan protesters Thursday made clear what case he plans to make to the American people. Whether it\u2019s a true reflection of what really happened is almost beside the point because, well, this is politics and the politicians set the ground rules.",

Five years ago, the shambling, stoop-shouldered septuagenarian launched a quixotic campaign for the presidency and pushed Hillary Clinton \u2013 a brand name in Democratic politics \u2013 to the limit. This year, he did it again, defying those who said the Vermont senator\u2019s day had passed \u2013even overcoming a mid-campaign heart attack \u2013 to forge another potent challenge to the Democratic establishment. Along the way, he shined a bright light on the weaknesses in the country\u2019s social safety net (which have been further bared by the current Covid-19 crisis); the yawning and growing inequality in our economy; the mounting burden of student debt; the corrupting power of special interests; and the mortal threat of climate change. It is a message that galvanized millions, particularly the young. They are demanding wholesale changes to address what they see as shameful systemic failures that conspire against working class Americans and the poor. Sanders, a self-styled Democratic Socialist who has never actually claimed membership in the Democratic Party, outlasted all but former Vice President Joe Biden out of a field of more than two dozen. How to protect the 2020 elections from the coronavirus crisis But at the almost certain risk of bringing down the wrath of the acid-tweeting Bernie Bros: It\u2019s over, Senator. It\u2019s time to go. Yes, the campaign is in a weird state of suspended animation as America grapples with a horrific global pandemic. Yes, 23 states have yet to vote. But the math is immutable. Barring an act of God \u2013 which admittedly may not be the best turn of phrase at the moment \u2013 Biden will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. Biden holds a 317-delegate lead over Sanders. That means Sanders, who trails Biden by 20 points in national polling, would have to win 60% of the remaining delegates to overtake Biden. Even if Sanders got on an unforeseen roll, such a rally would be a near impossibility. Unlike the winner-take-all Social Darwinists over in the Republican Party, Democrats award delegates proportionately, according to the popular vote. As long as you clear 15% in a state, you get delegates \u2013 which makes a lead the size of Biden\u2019s insurmountable. Way back in\u2026well, a month ago, Sanders said he would not continue if the nomination were out of reach. \u201cI\u2019m not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can\u2019t be won,\u201d Sanders told George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d Now he must know that he is in a race that can\u2019t be won. Sanders rips GOP senators over objections to stimulus package His most ardent supporters argue that Sanders should remain to continue to give voice to his progressive agenda and leverage his support to influence the party platform. But he already has done that to the extent he can, compelling Biden and other Democrats to move, even if not all the way, in Bernie\u2019s direction on a variety of issues, such as free tuition for many young Americans at public colleges and universities. There will be no more debates. And, given the gravity of the pandemic and resulting economic coma, there will be virtually no opportunity to break through the news in any meaningful way. To linger in the race, moreover, only delays and complicates a coming together around the mission of defeating President Donald Trump, whose reelection Sanders has described as \u201can existential threat.\u201d In a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll, an astonishing 15% of Sanders\u2019 voters said they would support Trump in November. To Sanders, who bristles at the suggestion that his prolonged and bitter challenge to Clinton in 2016 helped facilitate Trump\u2019s election, this should be a concerning number. With Sanders idling his engine in Burlington, Vermont, his most zealous supporters \u2013 and Trump-inspired bots posing as Bernie supporters \u2013 continue to trash Biden online in terms remarkably similar to the president\u2019s own \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d memes. Chalian: Biden has a 'near insurmountable' delegate lead Trump, himself, has become Sanders\u2019 greatest champion, accusing Democrats of \u201ccheating\u201d Sanders out of the nomination (this is when he is not calling Sanders \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d). Team Trump is eager to stir this pot and drive alienated young Berniacs away from the polls in November, as they did in 2016. Unlike his bitter breach with Clinton, for whom he campaigned but with little enthusiasm, Sanders clearly has affection for Biden. Whatever their differences, they pale in comparison to the gulf between them and Trump. Politics seems well beside the point at a time when the country is focused on just one thing, and that is the brutal effects of a raging pandemic and the draconian measures necessary to blunt it. Yet there will be an election this fall and the crisis we face has only underscored the consequences of that choice. Given the magnitude of the moment, that is a message Sanders can deliver with characteristic passion to his faithful supporters. A strong, early statement of support by Sanders for Biden, and an unambiguous call to unity and action in this moment, would be valuable and important. It also would unleash the Democratic National Committee to put its resources fully behind Biden as the nominee. You have a lot to be proud of, Senator. Now it\u2019s time to go.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Last night, Joe Biden solidified his control of the Democratic nomination. With resounding victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, he has proven to be the most formidable candidate in the competition. Amid a major pandemic and economic crisis, Democratic voters are turning to the former senator and vice president to defeat President Trump in November. Bernie Sanders needs to accept that reality. After his campaign meets to assess the situation, the best thing that the senator can do is to step down. Doing so will allow the Democrats to unite as a party and concentrate their political energy on winning the election in 2020. There is even a very real possibility of them shifting partisan control of the Senate. More consequential, Sanders bowing out would allow Democratic voters to sit out the remaining primaries so that everyone can keep their social distance. With the nomination locked up for Biden, there is no need to risk doing anything that could potentially help spread this devastating virus. Stepping down would be a heroic act by a politician who had an immense impact on American politics. When the history books are written, Sen. Sanders will end up being remembered as a hugely consequential figure despite having lost the nomination two times and having a meager legislative record. Sen. Sanders was instrumental to transforming the policy agenda within the Democratic Party. In presidential politics, Democrats had spent several decades since Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory in 1980 shifting to the center in an attempt to avoid being branded as too far left. Even President Obama, who pushed one of the boldest domestic agendas since the 1960s, was extraordinarily cautious in the way that he framed his government plans and avoided ideas that could be labeled as too radical. Rather than single payer national health insurance, for instance, the Affordable Care Act relied on regulatory mechanisms, online markets and expansion of existing programs \u2013 such as Medicaid \u2013 to provide better coverage. Bernie Sanders' devastating losses put him on the spot Sanders rejected all that. Together with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he offered a robust and vigorous defense of government as a solution to our problems. He pushed for Medicare for All, free college and a Green New Deal, as well as other forms of aggressive government intervention, without apology. He also called on Democrats to remember their historic commitment to working class Americans, demanding a higher minimum wage and more stringent workplace safety rules. In other words, Sanders forced the party to debate these proposals rather than having debates on the terms that Republican defined. As a result, the party\u2019s conversation shifted dramatically to the left. Even the presumed nominee has embraced a platform that is relatively liberal compared to what we have seen in recent elections. Sanders also mobilized a new generation of Democrats into party politics. He built a movement behind his campaign, though that movement fizzled during the past few months. Although much of the attention is often on the \u201cBernie Bros\u201d who engage in scurrilous attacks, a majority of his followers are younger Americans who have been turned off and distrustful of politics but now see the possibilities of what our democracy can still offer. He has excited them with his moral clarity and passion for fighting against corrupt political structures. He has persuaded them to vote, to organize, to donate and to think that politics is worthwhile. The huge divide between Biden and Sanders In 2020, the campaign has also done a remarkable job of turning out the Latino vote, a crucial constituency in the next few decades. Through all of these efforts, Sanders has spawned an exciting generation of younger politicians, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be important voices of the future. What Democrats do with this movement remains to be seen. He has brought them to the party and given Democrats an opportunity to stay engaged. At the same time that he rails against the role of private money in politics, Sanders has also helped revolutionize campaign finance. He has demonstrated through example that it is possible to raise massive amounts of money through small donations rather than big donors. Using the most sophisticated media outreach and building a campaign that took the grassroots seriously, he has established a permanent model for raising small amounts of dollars in huge numbers. In January alone he raised $25 million and in February $46 million. Using livestreaming on social media and online solicitations, as well as the information collected at mass rallies, Sanders has shown that the future doesn\u2019t have to be about big donors even without a system of public finance being put into place. But now the competition is over. Biden is the candidate and in a moment of genuine, catastrophic crisis, the nation turns its lonely eyes to him. Sanders needs to do the right thing. He has to make a big decision, to step out of the race and offer a bold speech calling on all of his supporters to enthusiastically and aggressively line up behind the Democratic ticket, without any reservation or hesitation. The stakes are too high.  If he does this now, and closes this chapter of his political book, he will go down as the politician who did more than anyone else to revive progressive politics in America\u2014both inside and outside of the Democratic Party. He will be the outsider and the renegade who mobilized a movement behind ideas that had been left behind and new proposals that never even had a chance to be heard. Ironically, given the severity of the health crisis we are facing, Sanders might even live to see Medicare for All become the law of the land.",

You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that there are no rules in politics and there\u2019s nothing more to learn from history. After all, a guy who got caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women got elected president by winning a majority of white women over the first female presidential nominee. Donald Trump was a populist outsider who violated all the rules of politics. He did not care about the Republican Party and he didn\u2019t try to build a broad coalition. But he was beloved by his base, even as the GOP establishment warned he would be a disastrous nominee. Now, many people are seeing a replay of that same script with the rise of Bernie Sanders. There\u2019s no question that this outsider has built a populist movement and moved the debate inside the Democratic Party decidedly to the left. His supporters are passionate and quick to condemn the Democratic establishment. And after two caucuses and one primary, Bernie Sanders is the Democratic front-runner after trailing Joe Biden in the polls for most of the campaign. Now, he has momentum. But can Bernie win? That\u2019s the 270-electoral vote question. Because the No. 1 issue for Democrats this election is simple: Beating Trump. And interestingly, according to a January CNN poll, 45% of Democrats thought Biden had a better chance of beating Trump in November, while Sanders trailed in second at 24%. Typically, the most ideologically extreme candidate is the one worst positioned to win over swing voters in swing states. Barry Goldwater and George McGovern are iconic \u2013 if dated \u2013 examples. Both lost in landslides. But what if this time it\u2019s different? Reagan vs. Carter holds a crucial lesson for 2020 Dems As Pete Hamby wrote in Vanity Fair, \u201cInstead of asking if Sanders is unelectable, ask another question: What if Sanders is actually the MOST electable Democrat?\u201d Now this might sound like magical thinking, but Hamby explains: \u201cIn the age of Trump, hyper-partisanship, institutional distrust, and social media, Sanders could be examined as a candidate almost custom-built to go head-to-head with Trump this year.\u201d Bernie is a political celebrity: People know what he stands for, for better or worse. He is authentic and admirably consistent about his self-described democratic socialist views. But there\u2019s plenty to suggest that those views play better in a polarized Democratic primary than in a general election. Let\u2019s take a look at the ideological divisions inside the Democratic Party. On the surface, the party is basically split evenly between liberals and moderates. But dig a little deeper and you\u2019ll see, according to Pew, only 15% of Democrats identify as very liberal, where a democratic socialist agenda would logically fall. Beyond that, 32% describe themselves as liberal, 38% as moderate and 14% as some flavor of conservative. It is not a far-left party, despite the youthful energy inspired by Sanders\u2019 promises of free health care and free college. A fractured center lane makes it tough to match Sanders so far in first-past-the-post totals. Panning out to the overall American electorate, just 27% of Americans identify as Democrats, according to the most recent Gallup tracking poll, with 30% describing themselves as Republicans and 42% declaring as independents. Likewise, Gallup makes it clear that America remains a center-right nation, with 37% of Americans calling themselves conservative, 35% moderate and just 24% liberal. Bernie Sanders absolutely could win it all this November The takeaway: Any nominee is going to need to win votes beyond their base to win the presidency \u2013 and a far left candidate will presumably have more work to do. Now, Bernie\u2019s electoral argument is the same as Trump\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019ll drive turnout by connecting with working-class voters who\u2019ve been alienated by the establishment. That may be the case. But it\u2019s notable that the new voters who Sanders\u2019 claims will turn out for him have not done so in the three caucuses and primaries to date. Then there\u2019s the label \u201csocialism\u201d \u2013 the umbrella under which democratic socialism lives. It\u2019s really not popular: Gallup shows that more Americans say they would vote for a gay, Muslim or atheist president than a socialist. There\u2019s a reason why Team Trump rails against socialism and wants to run against Sanders. You can argue that Americans vote on authenticity, not ideology. And that\u2019s a fair point in the Trump era. But the center-right center of gravity is tougher to argue. Democrats need to understand why Reagan and Nixon won 49 states in landslide reelections, while Clinton and Obama had to fight for their second terms, despite strong records amid economic recoveries. The electoral college also seems to favor the GOP, with Trump and George W. Bush winning the White House despite losing the popular vote. That means running up margins in New York and California isn\u2019t enough. Democrats can\u2019t afford to write off Florida or ignore the warnings of swing-district congressmen about the down-ticket impact of Sanders.  Bottom line: Could Bernie win? Sure \u2013 anything is possible. But possible is not the same thing as probable. Donald Trump is a historically unpopular President despite a strong economy to date. But, a lot can and will happen before November. According to a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, the top-tier Democrats beat Trump by different margins in head-to-head matchups. The same thing is largely true for swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, which is a far better gauge of who might win the presidency. Bernie Sanders has built a movement and he has momentum. But there are plenty of rational reasons to think that nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk \u2013 and could deliver Donald Trump a second term.",

View more opinion articles at CNN. In back-to-back appearances at CNN town halls Thursday night in Nevada, former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren rooted themselves in bread-and-butter Democratic issues. They spoke to the economic challenges of the middle class and working families, who in Biden\u2019s words \u201care getting battered across the board,\u201d and need relief from high health care costs and the rising cost of living. And while normally this approach would be smart political strategy, it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s going to draw Nevada\u2019s Democratic voters to either of them in the caucuses Saturday. Biden and Warren have both lost the strong polling leads they had last fall, and are confronted by the ascendance of two more extreme economic views \u2013 those of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sander\u2019s, in which capitalism has failed and must be curbed, and former Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s, in which capitalism is critical to success. Biden and Warren did not just linger on the economic fight Thursday night \u2013 they took the fight to Trump, speaking to the corruption of the current administration and reports of continued Russian election interference, which in Warren\u2019s words demonstrate \u201clawlessness that we have never seen in this country before.\u201d However, these candidates\u2019 world views are decidedly not the same: Biden spoke to a world people wished they lived in, a bygone era where camaraderie and bonhomie were all that was needed to make political progress. Warren spoke to the world we live in now, a more complex society where race, gender and economics too often intersect to create barriers to equal opportunity. Biden bemoaned the state of politics today for being \u201cso mean and ugly and dirty.\u201d While he blamed President Donald Trump for the decay of political discourse, Biden suggested that Trump is an aberration, that the system can be reset: \u201cI honest to God believe, with Trump out of the way, you\u2019re going to find people screwing up a lot more courage than they had before to say, \u2018OK, OK, I can move now, I have more leeway.\u2019\u201d Warren challenges Bloomberg to sign contract she wrote This worldview can be soothing and compelling because it doesn\u2019t involve change; it simply means turning back the clock. It\u2019s also involves magical thinking mixed with revisionist history. For example, Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is no more likely to work with Biden as a President than he was Biden as Vice President, when McConnell denied a hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court, vowed to make Obama a one-term President and worked to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Biden himself mentioned this challenge in the course of the town hall \u2013 but failed to explain why things would be different in a Biden administration. By contrast, Warren spoke bluntly of race, gender, and income inequality embedded in institutional structures. She labeled white supremacy as a form of domestic terrorism, calling on the Attorney General to enforce \u201cefforts to shut down white supremacy\u201d and enforce civil rights without interference from the White House. She spoke to the complexity of gendered expectations around women in leadership positions, something, she said, \u201cwe all struggle with every day,\u201d and offered a path forward: \u201cWe have to recognize that the world has changed since 2016. And how do I know that? I\u2019m here in Nevada with a woman majority state legislature, hello!\u201d She also addressed the issue of women in the workplace, taking direct aim at the former New York City mayor. Ironically drawing upon her own experience as a contract law professor, Warren offered Bloomberg a release form, so that all the people with whom he has non-disclosure agreements \u2013 many of whom Warren believes to be women \u2013 could share their stories about workplace discrimination or sexual harassment. (Bloomberg maintains he made nothing more than a few off-colored jokes, a response many women hear when pointing out sexism.)  And she spoke of her early warnings about the 2008 mortgage crisis and how \u201cmortgage companies figured out that they could target communities of color \u2026 and sell them the worst of the worst mortgages.\u201d Like Biden, Warren remains hopeful: \u201cThere is so much we need to do.\u201d Biden and Warren, two Democratic stalwarts, must now overcome two outsiders \u2013 Sanders, who has spent most of his political career as an Independent, and Bloomberg, who has funded, among other candidates, Republican Senate candidates that have helped McConnell maintain the Senate majority. Sanders offers revolution, while Bloomberg offers a cynical realism \u2013 both appealing to voters who think the system we\u2019ve been raised to believe in is fundamentally broken. This is the reality facing not just Biden and Warren, but the Democratic Party writ large \u2013 how to build unity within a structure that many voters are signaling they don\u2019t believe in anymore.",

This week lawmakers in Iowa are debating whether a teacher can say \u201cPete Buttigieg is gay\u201d in the classroom without first notifying parents. I wish I were kidding but I am not. The bill, which was introduced by 13 Republicans and advanced to the full House Education Committee on Monday, would require that lessons touching on the topic of sexual orientation or gender identity first be approved by parents, who would then have the option of sending a note to the principal excusing their children from class. Rep. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, reportedly was not clear whether mentioning in, say, a government class that Buttigieg has a husband would require permission (it \u201cmight,\u201d she said). It\u2019s the kind of story that supports the uncomfortable truth Rush Limbaugh spoke of during a homophobic rant he delivered on his radio show Wednesday, a week after Melania Trump hung a Presidential Medal of Freedom around his neck. Limbaugh mused about the discomfort some voters would experience watching Buttigieg kiss his husband on the debate stage, especially if he\u2019s standing next to, as he put it, \u201cMr. Man, Donald Trump.\u201d As offensive as Limbaugh\u2019s remarks about Buttigieg were (and as ironic as his holding up Trump as the epitome of manliness were, considering it was the gay dude who volunteered to fight for this country and the straight one who pleaded \u201cbone spurs\u201d), the reality is homophobia is not theoretical. As the lawmakers in Iowa are showing, it is actively practiced. There will be people who will see Trump\u2019s many alleged infidelities (which he denies) as well as his well-documented bullying as quintessential masculine behavior and will dismiss Buttigieg\u2019s levelheadedness and affection toward his husband as effeminate. Pete Buttigieg on faith, his marriage and Mike Pence And because homophobia is ultimately an extension of misogyny \u2014 that is, to be female is to be less than a man \u2014 some of the same prejudices that women seeking the highest office face also plague Buttigieg. That doesn\u2019t mean fair-minded people should placate homophobes, misogynists and or racists to win an election \u2014 although that does happen. It only means that when a loudmouth like Limbaugh spews his vitriol, people should not be surprised. Remember, he would not be a millionaire if a significant number of people didn\u2019t agree with him. So, the question isn\u2019t whether or not we should chastise the blowhard messenger, it\u2019s what are we doing to challenge the hateful message? Buttigieg is not the first openly gay person elected as mayor in this country. No, that would be my friend Neil Giuliano, who was elected mayor of Tempe, Arizona, in 1994 and came out in 1996. A recall effort to remove him was immediately activated but didn\u2019t reach the ballot. However, the second attempt did, and you know who stood up to the homophobes in his ultra-conservative state? The late Sen. John McCain, who later said \u201che was a hard-working public servant and someone I have great respect for.\u201d Giuliano won reelection easily \u2026 but the homophobes did not go away. Prejudice did not go away. The people who listen to Limbaugh did not and will not go away. This is not meant to conflate supporting Buttigieg with fair mindedness. Only to remove who he loves off the list of reasons to not vote for him.  Limbaugh recently revealed he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. He may survive it. He may not. But one thing for sure is the attitudes of those who delight in his hateful speech will remain. So be mad at Limbaugh all you want. Just know there is a difference between how things are and how things should be. The bridge between the two is not constructed from denial and despair but rather acknowledgement of the enemy \u2014 in this case, it\u2019s prejudice \u2014 and a determination not to allow it to prevail.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. As promised, Senator Bernie Sanders is shocking the political establishment. The candidate who many thought had no chance of winning is polling extremely well in Iowa and New Hampshire and several other states. According to a new CNN/UNH poll, he has a nine-point lead in New Hampshire. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumed frontrunner, is waking up to the reality that he is running neck-and-neck with the senator from Vermont. The other top candidates, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, are struggling to keep up with him. They are likely experiencing the same sinking feeling many Republicans felt in 2016, when they awoke to the reality that Donald Trump was stronger than the party establishment seeking to contain him. The Sanders juggernaut does not appear to be a flash-in-the-pan candidacy. It is true that Sanders has had trouble expanding his base of support, but for several months now he has remained in the top tier in the polls, along with Biden, Warren and Buttigieg. It has become increasingly possible to imagine his winning the nomination. How did a candidate who is so risky\u2013as his supporter Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez admitted during a rally\u2013work his way to the very top? The most important element of Sanders\u2019 surge is that his candidacy is built on top of a movement.  Sanders subscribes to a vision of electoral politics which stipulates that campaigns need to be built from the bottom up. Hillary Clinton's Sanders comments are reckless, but telling In an age of candidate-centered elections, what was apparent in 2016 remains clear today: The senator has amassed a loyal and devoted cadre of followers who imagine that they are trying to transform the fundamentals of politics, not just win an election. Some of his main surrogates, such as AOC, are products of the movement he built in 2016. The passion that Sanders commands from his supporters is intense and it has created a solid foundation for his candidacy that prevents the dramatic swings others have experienced. The movement serves as a political weapon in the caucuses and primaries. Sanders\u2019 supporters and surrogates are known for their quick and fierce response to his critics.  Whereas this kind of support has elicited considerable frustration among his opponents, it is has been an asset in the heat of the campaign that supplements his own work at rallies and in the media. When candidates take on Sanders they have to take on everyone around him. Sanders offers the kind of moral clarity, even if simplistic, which can be extremely appealing in an era where nothing seems trustworthy. At a moment when the President of the United States spews out disinformation on a daily basis and many Democrats seem to go back and forth on key questions\u2013depending on which way the wind blows\u2013there is something powerful about a candidate who has been saying the same thing, fighting the same fight, since early in his career. Though he clearly stands to the left of his party\u2019s mainstream, many of his core ideas are connected to core liberal traditions, including national health care and progressive taxation. Trump has also upended American politics in a way that gives someone like Sanders a fighting chance. The triumph of this kind of Republican leader and his ability to get away with what he does in the White House has poured cold water on the \u201creasonable\u201d campaign experts who praise the promise of compromise and centrism. As the status quo seems so totally broken with President Trump running around in the Oval Office, there are more Democrats who are willing to \u201cnot play it safe,\u201d as AOC urged her Iowa audience. Why Bernie Sanders is wrong about women Sanders also benefits from the thinness of Biden\u2019s support which has largely hinged on the elusive trait of \u201celectability.\u201d From the start, most experts have agreed that Biden\u2019s strongest attribute has been the perception among voters that he is best positioned to defeat Trump. Even with his gaffes and missteps, this view from the electorate has undergirded his strong numbers in most of the states. It has led many Democrats to rally around him even if they are not particularly excited about his vision. But that source of strength also makes Biden vulnerable and has created a dynamic field. When serious concerns emerge about his electability, it has created opportunities for the surges that we have seen. With all of his liabilities, Sanders brings to the table his own arguments of electability. The passionate movement that he can count on offers a weapon to be used against Trump\u2019s fierce campaign tactics. The senator\u2019s  ability to appeal to working class white Americans, as well as younger Latinos and African Americans, suggests that he could potentially build the kind of coalition that Democrats will need for victory. The attributes \u2013 such as his aggressive support base and resistance to compromise \u2013 that turn off so many Democrats, like Hillary Clinton who has remarked that \u201cNobody likes him,\u201d could be seen as important in a campaign against President Trump. Of course, early success will produce an even fiercer counter-mobilization that Sanders will have to survive. The vetting about his record will come fast and furious if he starts to tally up wins in key primary states. Candidates such as Mike Bloomberg or Amy Klobuchar could easily experience a surge of support if centrists in the party start to fear that Sanders, and his policies, are unviable. Senator Elizabeth Warren could emerge as the only candidate capable of uniting left and center. All of these developments could start to undercut his gains. Is Sanders an enormous risk who might end up costing Democrats the White House? He might be.  But the fact that Sanders is doing well right now shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise. There are solid reasons behind his growing success and they go far beyond the dynamic that we have seen in the past of candidates becoming \u201chot\u201d at a given moment. The Sanders surge is rooted in core elements of the way that the senator practices his bottom-up politics and realistic fears of what it will take to defeat this president in 2020. It grows out of a genuine discontent in the electorate about the broken state of our politics.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In 2020 America, members of the two political tribes can largely go their own ways without having to pay attention to the other side. Except for last week: The Republican controlled Senate had to sit silently and listen to the Democrats as they methodically made their case that President Donald Trump should be removed from office. Fidget spinners spun. Milk was served. A crossword puzzles and doodle were spotted. But for the most part, senators followed the rules. One tough one: no phones or other digital devices. It was a \u201cdigital detox,\u201d Peggy Drexler observed, something \u201cmost of us could use.\u201d The most surprising moment came when President Trump\u2019s staunch defender Sen. Lindsey Graham paused at the elevator to congratulate Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the House impeachment managers presenting the case against Trump. The South Carolina senator told reporters Schiff was \u201cwell spoken\u201d and \u201cdid a good job.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Schiff won over Graham or anyone else on the GOP side. On Saturday, the tables were turned as Democrats had to listen to the President\u2019s lawyers begin their defense. Their arguments, Elie Honig wrote, ran \u201cthe gamut from marginally convincing (at best) to transparently flimsy, outright misleading and disingenuous.\u201d Where\u2019s the trial heading? \u201cIt is crucial for the Democrats\u2019 case for Trump\u2019s removal to establish the danger of inviting foreign interference in American elections,\u201d wrote Errol Louis. \u201cBut partisan politics stands in the way. Republican senators appear to have decided to protect Trump at all costs.\u201d Graham was far from the only one praising Schiff\u2019s presentation. Raul Reyes called it \u201cmasterful: it was eloquent, thoughtful and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 restrained. While he invoked everyone from Alexander Hamilton to John F. Kennedy, he never slipped into histrionics or hyperbole, which any trial lawyer knows can backfire. Instead, he methodically went through a timeline of the President\u2019s alleged improper conduct.\u201d At the same time, Republican commentators like Scott Jennings didn\u2019t buy the Democrats\u2019 argument: \u201cSchiff\u2019s reckless statements in the runup to the Mueller report and now this week\u2019s impeachment arguments were a continuation of the Democratic emotion to never concede the 2016 election \u2013 and to never acknowledge the legitimacy of a man they detest,\u201d Jennings wrote. \u201cSchiff is, in effect, arguing that America\u2019s political institutions have already failed and will fail again unless a singular individual is no longer allowed to exist in the system.\u201d Jennings argued that Schiff was playing into the hands of Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin in destabilizing American democracy, while Louis and others made the case that it was Trump\u2019s conduct in the Ukraine affair that helped accomplish Putin\u2019s goals.  New evidence emerged last week in documents released by the Office of Management and Budget suggesting that the administration was already preparing to withhold aid from Ukraine before Trump\u2019s fateful July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. They show, Anne Milgram wrote, \u201cthat the President\u2019s effort to bully Zelensky to \u2018do us a favor\u2019 was premeditated, planned and timed to give the President a hammer to compel a foreign leader to do Trump\u2019s personal bidding for his personal gain.\u201d Even so, \u201cSenate Republicans continue to maintain a united front against impeachment and removal from office,\u201d wrote Alice Stewart. \u201cUnless there is a new blanket of information, the Senate scales of justice will side on acquittal.\u201d In 2003, journalist Laurie Garrett covered the spread of the SARS virus as it reached \u201c37 countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them.\u201d The news of this year\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus outbreak gave her \u201ca chilling sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d In the wake of the new virus\u2019 outbreak, China is restricting travel, closing off Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City and parts of the Great Wall and shutting movie theaters. And other nations, including the US, are seeing the first cases of the virus. \u201cWhile 17 years has brought significant improvements in virology, diagnostics development, international health regulations and the WHO, and we know more today about the nCoV2019 virus (as the Wuhan coronavirus is awkwardly dubbed) than we did one month into the SARS epidemic, there is no magic wand that can wave this highly dispersed, airborne-spread, human-to-human transmitting microbe away,\u201d Garrett wrote. \u201cBeijing is now executing the playbook that ultimately stopped SARS. The city of Wuhan is now on lockdown and fever checkpoints are operating in most major transit hubs across the country while Lunar New Year celebrations have been canceled. Instant contagious quarantine, 1,000-bed facilities are under construction, with one due to open next week outside Wuhan.\u201d In a new documentary, Hillary Clinton blasted her former primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders: \u201cNobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.\u201d In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Clinton wouldn\u2019t even promise to back Sanders if he wins the Democratic nomination this year, although she later said she would back whoever wins the primary. Sanders noted \u201con a good day, my wife likes me, so let\u2019s clear the air on that one.\u201d (It\u2019s not hard to imagine Larry David saying that on one of his SNL impersonations of Sanders.) Jill Filipovic took Clinton\u2019s part, mostly: \u201cClinton is finally being her authentic self,\u201d she wrote \u201cand it turns out that she\u2019s a human being with normal human emotions. She is angry at someone she perhaps rightly sees as contributing to her stunning loss in 2016, and the ushering-in of one of the most dangerous presidents in American history. We say we want female politicians, and prominent women generally, to be authentic and honest.\u201d Filipovic said that at a time when Donald Trump is president, waffling on supporting Sanders if he wins the primary is \u201cwildly reckless,\u201d but Clinton is not wrong \u201cabout the online culture that has coalesced around Sanders \u2014 it indeed can be toxic, and often misogynist, and just plain uglier, more aggressive, and more venomous than anything else you see on the left side of the political aisle.\u201d Joseph Ellis has devoted his career as a historian to studying the USA\u2019s founding generation. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his book on the founders and the National Book Award for his biography of Thomas Jefferson. This week he brought it all to the question of impeachment. When the framers of the Constitution met in Philadelphia in 1787, Ellis wrote, they were \u201chaunted by conversations that had occurred in that very same room 11 years earlier, in July 1776\u201d when representatives of the American colonies gathered to declare their independence from the tyranny they argued resulted from British rule. \u201cThe ghost at the banquet was George III.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s chief offense is his own defense,\u201d wrote Ellis. \u201cNamely, that as president he cannot be indicted, convicted or investigated, and has no legal obligation to provide documents or witnesses when requested by the House or Senate. That means President Trump is claiming he is an elected monarch who is above the law.\u201d Nullifying the checks and balances spelled out in the Constitution and failing to grant that Congress is a coequal branch of government would be fatal to American democracy, Ellis observed.  \u201cFor in doing so we are siding with George III rather than Thomas Jefferson. We are saying that the American Revolution was a mistake. We are announcing that we are no longer a republic. And that, so it seems to me, is self-evidently a price not worth paying.\u201d Other takes on impeachment: William Cohen: Rule of law must be more than a mantra we repeat Shan Wu: Trump\u2019s flawed \u2018Jekyll and Hyde\u2019 impeachment defense Julian Zelizer: What\u2019s behind Dershowitz\u2019s brazen claims Dean Obeidallah: Trump knows his presidency is forever tainted even if the Senate doesn\u2019t convict Retired pilot Les Abend noted that there are still questions about the January 14 dumping of \u201cthousands of pounds of jet fuel at a too-low altitude over a populated area that included six Los Angeles schools at recess, dousing children and others.\u201d Teachers at one of the schools sued Delta and the FAA is investigating. \u201cAviation officials were surprised at the pilots\u2019 decision\u2014particularly because in their transmission to air traffic control when they requested return, the pilots asserted that they would not need to dump fuel.\u201d  Abend said we should wait for the results of the investigation to know for certain. But one of his remarks stands out: \u201cAssuming that an immediate return wasn\u2019t necessary, if the pilots had told controllers that dumping was required, the flight likely would have been vectored out over the ocean to an area where the fuel particles would, for example, not land on people.\u201d Mark Hertling: A \u2018headache\u2019 could mean brain trauma, President Trump Navaz Ebrahim: My sister died in the Iran plane shootdown Abigail Pesta: What Nassar judge did isn\u2019t bias.

But it sure annoyed some of his fellow Canadians who, when it comes to donuts, worship at the shrine of Tim Hortons. Michael Bociurkiw noted that the donuts at the Winnipeg store \u201cOh Doughnuts\u201d cost as much as $4.25 Canadian each (for the \u201cgluten friendly\u201d kind). \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that he committed this sin at a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, a predominantly working-class, central Canadian prairie city,\u201d wrote Bociurkiw, a Canadian who worked there as a reporter for a year. \u201cWinnipeggers pride themselves on being thrifty and resilient \u2013 especially during long, bone-chilling cold winters. And it also didn\u2019t help that his NATO \u2018hot mic\u2019 scandal (in which Trudeau appeared to mock US President Donald Trump at a Buckingham Palace reception) \u2013 was still ringing in the ears of Canadians as they watched him carting out his fancy doughnuts with his fancy new beard.\u201d",

Follow him on Twitter @WorldAffairsPro. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN. Oh, Justin Trudeau, what crisis have you baked up for yourself now? Fresh from a string of mini scandals and a humiliating election win, the photogenic Canadian Prime Minister has inadvertently handed his citizens another reason to ridicule him. In what was probably an earnest attempt to satisfy the sweet tooth of his Liberal cabinet colleagues, Trudeau posted a photo of himself on Twitter Monday carrying several boxes of pastries from the Winnipeg gourmet doughnut shop, Oh Doughnuts. To make matters worse for loyalists of Canada\u2019s popular, iconic, and non-gourmet doughnut chain, Tim Hortons, Trudeau referred to his doughnut haul as \u201csome of Winnipeg\u2019s best.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that he committed this sin at a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, a predominantly working-class, central Canadian prairie city.  Winnipeggers pride themselves on being thrifty and resilient \u2013 especially during long, bone-chilling cold winters. And it also didn\u2019t help that his NATO \u201chot mic\u201d scandal (in which Trudeau appeared to mock US President Donald Trump at a Buckingham Palace reception) \u2013 was still ringing in the ears of Canadians as they watched him carting out his fancy doughnuts with his fancy new beard. But, honestly speaking, people are getting too wound up about it. Compared with, say, the rebuke he drew last year after photos of the younger Trudeau in blackface turned up (he apologized), and his disastrous India trip, this doughnut dustup is a minor, forgivable gaffe. I would suggest everyone go have a Timbit with a double double (I\u2019ll explain). Canadian victims' families will receive $25,000 after plane crash If you are not a Canadian (I am one), and this is all puzzling \u2013 well, you don\u2019t know doughnuts (which is to say: Tim Hortons). Even after being sold to overseas owners, Tim Hortons \u2013 named after co-founder and Canadian hockey legend Miles Gilbert \u201cTim\u201d Horton \u2013 remains a Canadian icon on par with the Hudson\u2019s Bay department store chain and the Canadian Tire hardware store chain. While the latter dishes out \u201cCanadian Tire money\u201d to loyal customers, Tim Hortons generates long line-ups at about 4,300 Canadian retail and airport locations, and customers are in on a special lingo when they order at the counter (\u201cdouble double\u201d? That\u2019s two creams and two sugars in the coffee). Oh Doughnuts, on the other hand, boasts just two locations, both in Winnipeg. Its menu ranges from (at the lower end) \u201cGluten friendly\u201d doughnuts, at C$4.25 each to a half dozen regular and specialty doughnuts that can cost between $19 to $25 Canadian (that\u2019s close to $15 US). The company says it offers its employees decent wages and good benefits, as well as utilizing local and organic ingredients. Tim Hortons\u2019 cheapest doughnuts, by contrast, cost under a dollar each. If you want 10 assorted \u201cTimbits\u201d (made from the leftover dough from the doughnut hole) it will set you back the proletarian price of $C2.39. Hot mic moment went unnoticed until producer did this While Tim Hortons is a massive corporation owned by a Canadian holding company that is majority-owned by a Brazilian investment firm, Oh Doughnuts proudly announces that it is queer (and woman)-owned and operated and bakes its product \u201cfresh from scratch daily. \u201d Certainly for Trudeau, the values of this establishment couldn\u2019t align better with his public persona as a self-avowed feminist and champion of minority and gender rights. Still, that he is being dragged for his Tweet indicates how this master of political correctness may have traded his Midas touch for a series of missteps. He got strafed in the press for coming home with that new salt and pepper beard after an extended Costa Rica family vacation over Christmas (critics said it was meant to project an air of maturity), and harangued last year for fumbling an answer on how his prime ministerial household consumes water. In this latest dustup, one Twitter user even took aim at the Prime Minister\u2019s choice of treats as inconsistent with Canada\u2019s Food Guide, a government guideline for healthy eating, which many Canadians unashamedly post on their refrigerator doors. Trudeau, currently in a vulnerable minority-government position, probably regrets posting the doughnut take-out on social media and setting off this  \u201cOnly in Canada\u201d incident. But who knows?  If Trudeau keeps his head down (and his beard trimmed) it may turn out to have been just a tempest in a teapot \u2013 or much a-dough about nothing.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. He is supporting Bernie Sanders for president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. To judge how an economy is doing for its richest people, look at the stock market. To judge how it\u2019s doing for everyone else, look at life expectancy. These two measures show that America is coming apart at the seams: the stock market is booming while life expectancy has declined for three years running. Those in the top 1%, with incomes above $500,000 a year, are delighted; those in the working class are dying of what researchers have come to call \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d I am for one America, not two. Abraham Lincoln called for a \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people,\u201d \u2013 not a government of the rich, by the lobbyists, for the few. We need policies that produce prosperity for all Americans, including guaranteed health care, decent wages and job benefits, a green new deal and 21st century infrastructure. The 2020 presidential election offers the most important choice our country has faced in generations. American democracy is at stake. Donald Trump didn\u2019t create the divisions, but he is dramatically and willfully amplifying them. Our widening inequalities of wealth and resources can be traced to an infamous 1971 memo from lawyer Lewis Powell, Jr. to the US Chamber of Commerce. Powell wanted to put corporations into the political driver\u2019s seat. That same year Richard Nixon appointed Powell to the Supreme Court, and Powell soon put his plan into operation. In 1978, Powell wrote a disastrous decision (First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti) giving companies free reign to spend corporate money in politics, under the preposterous doctrine that corporate spending on politics is merely free speech under the First Amendment. Since then, the lobbies have eaten our democracy alive. The 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which held that corporations and other groups can spend an unrestricted amount of money to promote candidates has massively exacerbated the problem. Since then, campaign funding through Super PACs and dark money groups has soared. This contradicts what Americans want for our political system. By a huge margin, 77% to 20%, according to Pew Research Center data from 2018, Americans want limits on money in politics. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court opened the way for the corporate takeover of politics through massive campaign spending. In the future, the Supreme Court\u2019s campaign contribution decisions will be as infamous as the Court\u2019s reactionary decisions on slavery, separate but equal, and rejection of fair labor standards in the 19th and early 20th centuries. To defeat Trump, Sanders and Warren supporters must stay united Since the early 1980s, inequality in the US has soared. Starting with Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cuts, the rates paid by the richest Americans have been slashed. Since then, repeated rounds of tax cuts have further benefited the rich. By 2018, the richest 400 Americans paid lower taxes as a share of income than any other income group including the poorest Americans, according to Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The environmental movement, bipartisan at its start in 1969, was similarly derailed by big money in politics. Corporate lobbies have successfully pressured government officials to gut environmental regulations. America has gone from being the world\u2019s environmental leader to being the environmental rogue as Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the only country of the 193 UN member states to leave the accord. Six major lobbies have taken the helm of political power. Wall Street has financialized the economy so that corporate CEOs could be paid in stock options, compensating themselves excessively more than their workers, while unions were busted and workers\u2019 pay stagnated. Big health care has monopolized local healthcare delivery and drug prices, leading to a healthcare system that costs more per person than any other country in the world. The fossil-fuel industry (coal, oil, and gas) has fought all attempts to limit global warming, up to and including America\u2019s withdrawal from the climate agreement. The military-industrial complex has continued to push a worldwide network of hundreds of overseas military bases and perpetual wars backed by hundreds of billions of dollars of military spending per year, much of it for private contractors. Corporate-owned prisons took the prison system private, and then lobbied for policies that result in poor African-Americans being locked up to keep the prisons full. And now big tech uses our personal data without proper protections of privacy and monetizes the data through online advertising and manipulations of e-commerce \u2013 all the while getting the President and Congress to protect the sector from fair taxation and regulation. The method of the corporate lobby takeover was anything but subtle. Their power is money. Over the years, these industries have contributed billions in campaign funds. Bernie Sanders isn't facing enough scrutiny They have spent billions more on lobbying outlays, some of which have employed former Congressmen and their families, in return for previous loyal support. America\u2019s political system has been sold to the highest bidder. Consider some of the numbers from the 2018 election cycle. Oil and Gas spent $85 million on Congressional campaigns in 2018, of which 87% went to Republicans, and $126 million on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Health spent $265 million on campaigns, of which 56% went to Democrats and $568 million on lobbying. Trump is cruder than his predecessors in support of the corporate lobbies. He is forcing out or pressuring many government scientists and replacing them with corporate shills in order to gut environmental regulations. In 2017, Trump slashed corporate taxes and \u201cpaid\u201d for the tax cuts by running up the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the budget deficit will reach $1 trillion in 2020. Yes, the stock market is soaring as taxes are cut, but the richest 10% of Americans account for 84% of the American stock ownership, according to a 2017 study, while 57% of the low income Americans report hardships paying their medical bills. According to recent survey data from NPR, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, a majority of people in  the top 1% report themselves to be \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with life. No big surprise. Meanwhile, less than half of poorest Americans reported this same satisfaction.  The same survey also shows that less than half of the top 1% believe that the federal government should prioritize narrowing the gap between rich and poor in the future, compared with a majority of low-income Americans. Another recent poll by Reuters and Ipsos shows a strong majority for taxing the wealth of the richest Americans. No other high-income democracy has faced the corporate onslaught on national politics as has America. The result: America is falling behind our counterpart nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on almost all major social indicators. America\u2019s life expectancy now ranks 28th among the OECD countries.  America is the only one of the top 25 highest income OECD countries without the guaranteed right to healthcare. It is the only industrialized nation without guaranteed paid leave for new mothers and out of the 21 richest countries in the world, the US is the only one that does not guarantee paid vacation days. It costs more to be a college student in America than any other country worldwide, leaving many with crippling student debts, now totaling around $1.5 trillion for 44.5 million Americans. As the other high-income countries amply prove, America\u2019s problems can be solved if our democracy can be retaken from the corporate lobbies and the big money in politics. Bernie Sanders is running a true grassroots campaign, relying on more than 5 million individual donations so far to beat the big money.  His movement harks back to the progressive era a century ago, when a similar grassroots movement successfully took on the power of the industrial robber barons of the late 19th century.  Sanders\u2019 movement aims to wrest power from the corporate lobbies to reinvigorate our democracy \u2013 and that is exactly what the country needs. Politics this election year is therefore about the two Americas, the small group at the very top versus the common good. Trump brazenly stands on the side of the richest Americans. A true grassroots movement can restore fairness and prosperity for working Americans. The 2020 election is our urgent opportunity to retake power from the corporate lobbies and breathe new life into American democracy.",

Follow him on Twitter @crgibs. David Weissman is an army veteran, Times of Israel columnist, and former Republican. Follow him on Twitter @davidmweissman. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. As the first primaries and caucuses of 2020 approach, the race for the Democratic nomination is shaping up to be a three-way primary between Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. This means the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is going toe-to-toe with the centrist wing of the party, whose policies are less intrusive to entrenched corporate power. The most certain way to ensure the corporate wing wins is for the progressive wing to fracture. Following Tuesday night\u2019s debate, tensions between supporters of Sanders and Warren are boiling over. On Monday, reports surfaced of Sanders allegedly telling Warren a woman could not win the presidency, which he denies, and new audio of the terse exchange between Warren and Sanders emerged \u2013 in which Warren accused Sanders of accusing her of lying \u2013 all of which makes such a fracture all the more likely. Unity among progressives now is more important than ever. As we saw in 2016, nominating a candidate aligned with corporate special interests with little enthusiasm from the Democratic base is the surest way to hand President Donald Trump a victory. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s most recent assessment of which candidate is most likely to win the nomination, Biden comes out in front, with the data model giving him a 40%chance of winning outright and predicting he\u2019ll receive, on average, over 1,500 pledged delegates. Sen. Sanders has a 23% chance of winning outright, with the model. F forecasting an average of over 1,000 pledged delegates, and Sen. Warren has a 13% chance, with around 700. Should the delegate allocation predictions come true, none of the three would win the 1,990 pledged delegates needed to clinch the nomination, which FiveThirtyEight gives a 15% chance of happening. This means superdelegates \u2013 party leaders free to vote for whomever they please, who will no longer be allowed to vote unless there\u2019s a deadlocked convention \u2013 would likely push Biden over the finish line on the second ballot. Neither Sanders nor Warren alone will likely have more delegates than Biden when the convention comes around, if current polling is to be believed. However, if one of the two were to pool their delegates and form a unity ticket in July, they may very well have enough to clinch the nomination. Whoever has the most pledged delegates at the time of the convention should be at the top of the ticket, and select the other as their running mate. Should progressives fracture and the Sanders and Warren camps train their sights on each other rather than Biden, it would be the largest gift yet to the Biden campaign, particularly as early state contests and Super Tuesday approach. By early March, more than one third of the US population will have voted. Should Biden still be in front after Super Tuesday, he\u2019ll likely have enough momentum to surge through the rest of the primary and win the nomination in Milwaukee. Nominating Biden could very well lead to four more years of President Trump, given his lack of a robust volunteer base. As the Philadelphia Inquirer noted in October, debate watch parties organized by Biden\u2019s campaign were sparsely attended. The Biden campaign\u2019s impotent efforts in Iowa were well-documented by The New York Times in November, with one county Democratic Party chair calling the unscripted portions of his speeches \u201cunfocused and less energetic.\u201d Elizabeth Warren is becoming Trump's greatest threat The Daily Beast has reported that Trump\u2019s team has been becoming more and more concerned with Sanders\u2019 polling, not Biden\u2019s. The former vice president\u2019s past support for deeply unpopular policy is also sure to hurt him in the general election. Biden supported George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq. While the Iraq War cost America the lives of nearly 4,500 troops, and led to the deaths of  an estimated hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, Biden\u2019s explanation for his pro-war vote Tuesday night was deeply inadequate. Biden suggested he was hoodwinked by the Bush administration, and didn\u2019t know there was actually going to be a war \u2013 which suggests his foreign policy judgment is highly questionable. Domestically, Biden has embraced a conservative position on Social Security \u2013 a vital social safety net beloved by the vast majority of Americans. Biden has in the past championed  cuts to Social Security through means testing and freezing cost-of-living increases, though he\u2019s now distancing himself from these past positions, saying he\u2019ll call on wealthier Americans to pay into Social Security at rates similar to working-class Americans Both Sanders and Warren have consistently proposed expanding Social Security. A civil war among progressives could endanger Social Security\u2019s future. What Iowa can \u2014 and can't \u2014 tell us While Biden may characterize his warmth toward conservative policy as proof he could win enough Republican support to defeat Trump, that strategy may prove ineffective. A December Gallup poll found an 89% approval rating among Republicans for Trump. Hillary Clinton also attempted to court Republicans in her bid for the White House, but, according to a CNN exit poll, only 8% of Republicans voted for her, and she also lost among independents. Aside from his lackluster volunteer base and poor policy positions, Biden\u2019s fundraising operation leaves much to be desired. As of the third quarter fundraising period, Biden had less than $9 million remaining in his war chest. That\u2019s $25 million less than Sanders\u2019 third-quarter war chest and $18 million less than what Warren\u2019s campaign had on hand. If Democrats want a candidate who is able to beat Trump, they\u2019ll need to have a dedicated base of supporters to combat the incumbent president\u2019s money machine, as he had roughly $83 million on hand in late 2019. There\u2019s far too much at stake for progressives who support Sanders and Warren to allow their own personal preferences for any one candidate to jeopardize progressives\u2019 chances to win the White House. Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal and Medicare for All proposals, along with Warren\u2019s wealth tax and universal child care proposals, would make either candidate the most progressive president in history.  One of this op-ed\u2019s co-authors once campaigned for Trump and knows how the President and his supporters operate. They are ruthless, determined and intelligent and will use anything to divide us. Trump has already tweeted  about the Sanders/Warren feud, and has tried before to divide Democrats by encouraging Bernie Sanders to run as an independent. Though one of us is a Warren supporter and the other a Sanders supporter, we both respect the other and will vote for the eventual Democratic nominee. We understand these are tense times, but we must stay focused. The only way to win is to be united.",

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. On Tuesday, six Democratic candidates will gather in Iowa for another major televised debate. The stakes are high now that the field has narrowed, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game with three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are currently leading the pack in Iowa at 20% and 17% respectively, with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (16%) and former Vice President Joe Biden (15%) trailing close behind in a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. After more than a year of candidate announcements, polling, televised debates and campaign coverage, voters will finally have a chance to weigh in on February 3. The nation will have its first glimpse at which candidates have the capacity to win the hearts and minds of the electorate. Iowa became the first state to hold its caucus in 1972, and Jimmy Carter turned the sleepy state into a kingmaker four years later by riding his early victory all the way to the White House. While commentators have criticized the election calendar for elevating the importance of a demographically unrepresentative state (Iowa is 90% white) and placing such weight on a lengthy process that is often difficult for working-class Iowans to participate in, the caucus continues to play a big role in American politics. In 1976, Democratic candidates with far more experience and name recognition barely paid attention to what was happening in the Hawkeye State. Meanwhile, Carter established a formidable team of volunteers on the ground and spent a huge amount of time campaigning door-to-door. When Carter came out on top and used the victory in Iowa to gain momentum in the New Hampshire primary, the former governor of Georgia showed how success in this small state could catapult a lesser-known candidate and devastate more established opponents. Iowa poll shows a tight four-way race in final weeks before the Democratic caucuses Since then, there have been a few instances when a candidate nabbed an early victory in Iowa and went on to win the election. In 2008, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama scored a stunning victory over Hillary Clinton and shook the conventional wisdom that the nomination would inevitably go to the more experienced opponent. By investing resources in the state, the Obama campaign defied the odds and ensured record turnout by mobilizing young people \u2014 many of whom had never participated in politics before \u2014 and independents in a way that Clinton was unable to. Though he lost in New Hampshire, the Iowa victory gave Obama\u2019s campaign a sense of legitimacy and demonstrated to both voters and party officials that he was indeed \u201celectable.\u201d This time around, a surprise victory or a second-place finish from anyone other than Joe Biden \u2014 who still leads the national polls among Democrats \u2014 will be seen as a game-changing moment that will generate extensive media coverage and attract a significant fundraising boost. How Amy Klobuchar can seize her moment But the impact of Iowa can be overblown, and the New Hampshire primary on February 11 could produce a very different outcome, given the unusually large number of second-tier candidates, like Amy Klobuchar, and billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are armed with hefty war chests. A crowded field could lead to a scenario that harkens back to 1992, when Bill Clinton came from behind to win the nomination despite losing in both Iowa and New Hampshire. The clustered big state votes on Super Tuesday in March are much more likely to solidify the frontrunners and dictate the outcome of this contest. Much of Iowa\u2019s potential impact has been softened as a result of the 24-hour news cycle. There has already been so much coverage of the candidates that viewers may be inured to the results, having already followed multiple, high-profile shifts in the race  Democrats would do well to remember that this is a long game. Whatever happens in Iowa will only be part of the story, even if many of us in the media want to make the outcome the story. Barack Obama\u2019s great contribution to campaign politics was to show how focusing on the big picture \u2014 and attracting the support of a big tent \u2014 could be a recipe for success. That lesson will be an important one amidst all the fervor on February 3 when the first results of the Iowa caucus are finally in.",

            "article_content": "A New Jersey school district wants to keep at least one winter tradition from the pre-Covid days intact: the snow day. Mahwah Township Public Schools, a school district with approximately 3,000 students in Bergen County, bucked the pandemic trend this week when it said that its schools wouldn\u2019t be doing away with snow days. \u201cWe have decided that few childhood acts remain unchanged due to COVID-19 and we will maintain the hope of children by calling actual snow days due to inclement weather,\u201d the district announced in a statement. \u201cSnow days are chances for on-site learners and virtual learners to just be kids by playing in the snow, baking cookies, reading books and watching a good movie,\u201d it said. The assurance came as several school districts across the country \u2013 districts that are back to some form of in-person learning \u2013 said there would be no snow days this year, as online learning had shown students could remain home but still attend class over Zoom. A number of school districts in Kansas said they would plan to have remote learning days instead of traditional snow days this year. A Colorado Springs school district is having its middle and high schoolers \u201ce-learn\u201d on snow days. And New York City\u2019s Department of Education, which manages the country\u2019s largest public school system, told parents not to expect snow days this year due to the delayed start. \u201cAs we reopen schools for this critical school year, we are utilizing all of the lessons learned from remote schooling this spring to maximize our students\u2019 instructional time,\u201d New York City\u2019s Department of Education said in a statement reported by CNN affiliate WABC. \u201cThis includes providing remote instruction during both Election Day and snow days.\u201d Students, say goodbye to snow days -- and say hello to school at home The War on Snow Days didn\u2019t begin during the pandemic, but it\u2019s definitely exacerbated the conflict. Typically, snow days are \u201cbuilt in\u201d to school\u2019s schedule each year, as most schools have a mandated amount of days that they need to be open each year. Even with federal holidays and breaks, most schools are able to satisfy that quota \u2013 meaning that when the weather gets rough, particularly in the Northeast, schools have the legroom to shut down for a few days. But that doesn\u2019t mean the school year always goes perfectly. It\u2019s not uncommon for periods with severe weather to force districts to ration out the \u201cfree days\u201d it can give out, or face budget cuts if the year is shorter than mandated. In Ohio, students will go home with \u201cblizzard bags\u201d of schools assignments they\u2019re expected to finish. And last year, Pennsylvania passed a bill turning snow days into work-from-home days. School snow days could become a thing of the past in Pennsylvania. Lawmakers want kids to telecommute to school if it's closed for weather While snow days haven\u2019t completely gone away, some school districts said they would be committed to using them as a short-term solution to the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for education,\u201d a Valley Center Public Schools Superintendent in Kansas told KWCH-12. \u201cAs we know, we all lost quite a bit last spring, when we all went remote and did that home learning, and it looks different than it does this year. We refined, we made it better and so we need every moment we can with students to make sure that can achieve as much as we hope this school year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The home of Martin Luther King Jr., capital of the New South and \u201cthe city too busy to hate\u201d is again in the spotlight of protest and change related to the country\u2019s race relations, from Black Lives Matter to the presidential election. Recent violence will lead to grieving in a historic location Tuesday in Atlanta. Rayshard Brooks, an African American killed by Atlanta police in a Wendy\u2019s parking lot, will be remembered at a funeral service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was co-pastor until his 1968 assassination. King\u2019s daughter, the Rev. Bernice A. King, will speak at Brooks\u2019 funeral, which starts at 1 p.m. The Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, Ebenezer\u2019s senior pastor and a Democratic candidate for US Senate, will provide the eulogy. A public viewing took place there Monday afternoon. The memorial costs will be covered by hometown mogul Tyler Perry, one of the most famous and powerful Black men in entertainment, family attorney Chris Stewart said. Rayshard Brooks remembered as a caring father kept down by a racist legal system It is a familiar but still unwelcome spotlight for this city, where Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and rappers tried to calm demonstrations that turned violent after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. \u201cWe have to be better than this moment,\u201d Killer Mike exhorted. \u201cWe have to be better than burning down our own homes, because if we lose Atlanta, what else we got?\u201d An impassioned Bottoms implored, \u201cWhat I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. This is chaos.\u201d For them and many others, recent events are revealing that Atlanta\u2019s vaunted self-perception as a racially progressive city might not be so simple, says Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Georgia State University instructor Douglas Blackmon. Brooks\u2019 killing \u201chas forced Atlanta to see the conflict between the reality and how it likes to see itself,\u201d Blackmon says. \u201cAtlanta likes the spotlight when it\u2019s a warm and fuzzy spotlight. It doesn\u2019t like suddenly having the kind of events that have occurred over the past weeks.\u201d Like other Southern cities, Atlanta has a history of systemic racism predating the King era. \u201cThere are still a lot of skeletons in the closet that have not been dealt with yet,\u201d he said, citing incidents going back to the 1920s and current poverty. Bottoms is reportedly being considered as a possible running mate for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. Bottoms was gaining attention even before national and global protests over systemic racism and police brutality against blacks. She pushed back forcefully when Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, began reopening the state\u2019s economy April 24, making Georgia the first state to do so after widespread coronavirus restrictions. Another Black woman from Georgia frequently mentioned as a VP pick is Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic state House minority leader who narrowly lost a controversial race against Kemp in 2018. Atlanta is never shy about its aspirations to be seen as a first-class city. It was host to the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games and boasts that its Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is often cited as the world\u2019s busiest. It is home to corporate giants such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, plus the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University and Georgia Tech. The metro area \u2013 encompassing cities and unincorporated areas beyond the City of Atlanta \u2013 is know for its sprawl and traffic, often cited as among the worst in the nation. Long hailed as a mecca for the Black middle class, it also rose to the top of the hip-hop landscape, with countless top-selling acts living and recording here. US Rep. John Lewis, the long-serving Democrat whose district includes Atlanta, was a civil rights hero during King\u2019s era. Both US senators are white Republicans \u2013 and, unusually enough, both are on the ballot in November. The National Center for Civil and Human Rights is a top tourist draw. So is nearby Stone Mountain, which features a memorial carving of Confederate leaders Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson that\u2019s larger than Mount Rushmore. The legacy of \u201cGone with the Wind,\u201d written and set here, is entrenched and controversial in ever-new ways. HBO Max said it was pulling the 1939 Civil War epic from its rotation, but then added it back with a disclaimer about its racial stereotypes in the Old South. Its movie and TV production boom, boosted by state tax incentives, has earned it the nickname \u201cY\u2019allywood.\u201d Perry\u2019s productions, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d Marvel movies and countless more have been filmed here. Blackmon says the current tribulations again could make it an example for other cities. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll see the emergence of a special kind of leadership in Atlanta,\u201d he said. \u201cAtlanta is probably more open to that conversation right now that at any time in the last 30 or 40 years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In an exclusive interview, Rep. Paul Mitchell, Republican of Michigan, told CNN that his disgust and disappointment with President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the election have led him to request that the Clerk of the House change his party affiliation to \u201cindependent,\u201d and to notify GOP leaders in a letter that he is withdrawing his \u201cengagement and association with the Republican Party at both the national and state level.\u201d \u201cThis party has to stand up for democracy first, for our Constitution first, and not political considerations,\u201d Mitchell said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cNot to protect a candidate. Not simply for raw political power, and that\u2019s what I feel is going on and I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d Mitchell, who is retiring at the end of this session of Congress, says he fears that the House GOP leadership\u2019s participation in the outgoing President\u2019s conspiracy theories and attempts to disenfranchise millions of American voters to overturn President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory could cause \u201clong-term harm to our democracy.\u201d It is \u201cunacceptable for political candidates to treat our election system as though we are a third-world nation and incite distrust of something so basic as the sanctity of our vote,\u201d Mitchell wrote in his letter, which was sent Monday. Mitchell noted that Republican leaders had been \u201ccollectively sit(ting) back and tolerat(ing) unfounded conspiracy theories and \u2018stop the steal\u2019 rallies without speaking out for our electoral process,\u201d and the last straw for him seemed to be \u201cthe leadership of the Republican Party and our Republican Conference in the House actively participating in at least some of those efforts.\u201d He echoed that message later Monday, saying on CNN that, \u201cAnybody that gets in politics has to be willing to accept winning and losing with some level of grace or maturity. I\u2019ve done both. Losing is brutal, it\u2019s personal, it hurts, but if you\u2019re not willing to accept that, you should not be in political leadership.\u201d \u201cThis country needs it desperately and, unfortunately, we haven\u2019t seen it demonstrated as much as we should.\u201d Last week, 126 House Republicans, including top leadership, signed onto a lawsuit the Texas attorney general tried to bring to the US Supreme Court to block all votes in four states Biden won \u2013 Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and award the electors to Trump, who also joined the suit. The complaint, which was full of lies and was called \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201cinsanity\u201d by conservative legal experts, was summarily rejected by the Supreme Court. Despite so many of his colleagues throwing in with those undemocratic efforts, Mitchell has been outspoken in criticizing the various evidence-free GOP attacks on the election and standing up for voters and facts. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Mitchell tweeted last month, \u201c@realDonaldTrump Please for the sake of our Nation please drop these arguments without evidence or factual basis. #stopthestupid.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s vow to \u201ckeep going\u201d in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday morning, Mitchell tweeted: \u201cCourts have heard the \u2018evidence\u2019 provided of \u2018fraud\u2019 and found it unsubstantiated numerous times.\u201d \u201cContinuing this circus is just \u2026 so damaging \u2026 so unproductive \u2026 so narcissistic\u2026what about our country?\u201d Electors are meeting Monday to formally cast their ballots for president and vice president, but the outcome of the election has been known for weeks: Biden won 306 electoral votes to Trump\u2019s 232. Biden became the first presidential candidate to win more than 80 million votes, and his popular vote margin exceeds 7 million votes. Mitchell\u2019s exit from the GOP underscores the tension within the party over how to respond if Trump won\u2019t concede after the Electoral College vote. While a growing number of Senate Republicans are ready to publicly acknowledge Biden\u2019s win, a wide swath of Republicans on Capitol Hill are still siding with Trump or ignoring his daily conspiracy theories altogether. And the President\u2019s staunchest defenders are urging him to fight his loss all the way to the House floor in January. It is not unusual for a losing candidate\u2019s most fervent supporters to take their case to the House floor \u2013 something that occurred after the 2016, 2004 and 2000 presidential races. But it is unusual for the losing candidate to mount a weeks-long public campaign aimed at sowing discord and distrust over a pillar of democracy, something that Trump has done relentlessly since losing the race. Mitchell, one of the wealthiest members of Congress and a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, was elected to the House in 2016. He voted for Trump that year and again earlier this year. He\u2019s publicly called out the President before, but on policy at least, has been a strong supporter of Trump, voting with him 95% of the time, as he pointed out in his letter to Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, a fellow Michigander, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The congressman from Michigan\u2019s 10th District included in his letter an aside to McDaniel, suggesting that he\u2019s confident that she knows better, particularly when it comes to unhinged allegations about the Wolverine State. Biden carried Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, helping him rebuild the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Great Lakes states that had helped Trump win four years ago. GOP efforts have focused on disenfranchising voters in Wayne County \u2013 the state\u2019s largest \u2013 which is disproportionately Black and contains Detroit. But Mitchell writes to McDaniel, \u201cPresident Trump did not lose Michigan because of Wayne County, but rather he lost because of dwindling support in areas including Kent and Oakland County, both previous Republican strongholds. In the 2020 election, President Trump lost Michigan by 154,000 votes, compared to 2016 when his margin of victory was slightly more than 10,700 votes.\u201d Mitchell, who had been elected the sophomore class representative to House GOP leadership, announced in July 2019 that he would not seek a third term. Earlier that month, he tweeted a pointed rebuke of the President\u2019s racist attacks on progressive Democratic congresswomen that had falsely implied they were not natural-born American citizens. \u201c@realDonaldTrump we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders,\u201d he said. Turning to how his decision Monday will play out, Mitchell acknowledged he will likely \u201ctake abuse from both the far left and the far right.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, the extremes of both parties are dragging their parties and this country off a cliff. The majority of Americans are in the middle. The majority of Americans want solutions to problems \u2013 want us to address them and not see who can have a political win. Not see who can grab political power for all it\u2019s worth and actually do something to solve a problem for the American people,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd frankly we haven\u2019t done enough of that \u2013 haven\u2019t done enough the last two terms. And this election simply confirms for me that it\u2019s all about power first and that, frankly, is disgusting and demoralizing.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden named key members of his economic team on Monday, with the long-expected announcement of Janet Yellen as treasury secretary along with three other women in top roles on a diverse team that will help him navigate the nation\u2019s punishing fiscal headwinds in hopes of building an economic recovery. Biden named Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget, elevating Tanden, the CEO and president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, into the top ranks of his administration. Tanden would be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to become director of the Office of Management and Budget if confirmed by the Senate. The announcement of Tanden sparked more outrage than any nominee has so far, with progressive Democrats and Republicans expressing opposition. A spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Tanden \u201chas an endless stream of disparaging comments about the Republican Senators, whose votes she\u2019ll need, stands zero chance of being confirmed.\u201d He named Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, which puts another Black woman in a high-profile role of Biden\u2019s top advisers. Rouse would be the first woman of color to chair the Council of Economic Advisers if confirmed by the Senate. She served on the council during the Obama administration. Among the barrier-breaking nominees Biden announced is Adewale \u201cWally\u201d Adeyemo, president of the Obama Foundation in Chicago, for deputy Treasury Secretary, serving under Yellen. If confirmed, he would be the first Black deputy Treasury Secretary. Adeyemo served on the National Economic Council of the Obama administration and last fall was named as the first president of the Obama Foundation. \u201cAs we get to work to control the virus, this is the team that will deliver immediate economic relief for the American people during this economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than ever,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cThis team is comprised of respected and tested groundbreaking public servants who will help the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 and address the structural inequities in our economy.\u201d Biden also named Jared Bernstein, a longtime economic adviser to Biden, as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Bernstein previously served as the executive director of the White House task force on the middle class and as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama. He was also the deputy chief economist at the Department of Labor under President Bill Clinton. The President-elect announced Heather Boushey, who has been one of Biden\u2019s chief economic policy advisers during the campaign, would serve as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Boushey is a longtime economic counselor to Biden and currently serves as president and CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonprofit she cofounded in 2013. The new team is set to be formally introduced by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris during an event Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, according to the transition team. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Biden\u2019s expected top economic picks. RELATED: Here\u2019s who could serve in top roles in the Biden administration The economic team is among the most critical pieces of the new administration, whose successes or failures will play a large role in determining the course of the Biden presidency. Biden is also still set to name the leader of the National Economic Council, officials said, as well as United States Trade Representative, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other posts.   It is unclear whether Biden will name his Commerce Secretary nominee this week, officials said, and the timing of other key economic positions also could be shifted based on final decisions and last-minute adjustments. Several people close to the transition tell CNN this is a glimpse of leading contenders for other key roles on the economic team: Brian Deese, a former top economic adviser in the Obama-Biden administration, is among the leading contenders to head the National Economic Council, officials said. He served as deputy director of the OMB and the NEC and is now a top official at BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. Roger Ferguson Jr., who served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is also seen as a leading contender for the National Economic Council, officials said, but could also be named to another top economic post. Katherine Tai is among the leading contenders to serve as US Trade Representative, officials said, a critical position as the Biden administration moves beyond the trade policies of the Trump era. Tai is the top Democratic trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee and oversaw trade enforcement for China during the Obama administration. She also played a key role in negotiating trade policy for Democrats in the US-Mexico Canada Agreement. MAP: See 2020 election results The roster of contenders for the various economic posts inside the West Wing also includes Gene Sperling, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations, and Ben Harris, who also worked in the Obama administration. Several other candidates have also risen to the top for high-profile economic jobs, officials said, including Lisa Cook, an economist at Michigan State who also worked in the Obama administration. Austan Goolsbee, who served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the second term of the Obama administration, has also been mentioned for top posts in the Biden White House. But Goolsbee dismissed that possibility on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: \u201cI don\u2019t plan to be going into the administration.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting and announcements on Monday.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden intends to make a push on health care in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death as a political fight over the Supreme Court vacancy is already underway. In the immediate days after Ginsburg\u2019s passing, the Biden campaign has not signaled a fundamental shift in its campaign strategy, which has hinged on the coronavirus pandemic and the economy, as President Donald Trump quickly moved to make the Supreme Court vacancy a central issue in his campaign. Instead, Biden campaign officials say the former vice president plans to make defending the Affordable Care Act and its sweeping protections for pre-existing conditions a key focus, with an aide saying they view the President\u2019s efforts to dismantle Obamacare as a motivating issue for voters. \u201cMake no mistake: the fight to preserve protections for pre-existing conditions is on the ballot,\u201d a Biden campaign aide said. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden started that push with a speech in Philadelphia Sunday as he assailed Trump\u2019s support of a Republican-led challenge to the Affordable Care Act as the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on the case one week after the election. \u201cIn the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court trying to strip health care coverage away from tens of millions of families, to strip away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Biden said in a speech at the National Constitution Center. Biden also repeated his call for the Senate not to consider a nominee until after voters have selected the president in this year\u2019s election. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly,\u201d Biden added. \u201cBut if I win this election, President Trump\u2019s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president, I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg\u2019s successor.\u201d Hours after learning of Ginsburg\u2019s death Friday, Biden insisted a replacement should not be named until after voters have chosen who will be president \u2013 a position embraced by Senate Democrats. \u201cLet me be clear that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,\u201d Biden said in New Castle, Delaware, Friday night. \u201cThis was the position of the Republican Senate took in 2016 when there were almost 10 months to go before the election,\u201d Biden said, a reference to the GOP-controlled Senate in 2016 blocking a hearing on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in an election year. \u201cThat\u2019s the position the United States Senate must take today.\u201d Biden\u2019s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would hold any Supreme Court nomination hearing. She echoed Biden\u2019s sentiment in a fundraising e-mail on Saturday, saying, \u201cThe work of holding Senate Republicans accountable to the standard they set in 2016 starts now.\u201d A Biden campaign aide told CNN that Biden, Harris and their staff have been in contact with Democratic leadership in the Senate and the House about the Supreme Court vacancy, adding that congressional Democrats and the campaign will be \u201cregularly coordinating.\u201d The aide also said they are aligned on the message on the need to protect the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThey are strongly unified in the belief that this fight underscores the stakes of the election more than ever \u2013 especially when it comes to Americans\u2019 health care during the pandemic,\u201d said the aide. At a campaign rally in North Carolina Saturday evening, Trump indicated he will choose a Supreme Court nominee \u201cnext week\u201d and \u201cit will be a woman.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to hold a Senate vote on the President\u2019s nominee but has not laid out a specific timetable. \u201cTo jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power and I don\u2019t believe the people of this nation will stand for it,\u201d Biden said Sunday. \u201cI appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens, please follow your conscience,\u201d Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said. \u201cDon\u2019t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don\u2019t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country.\u201d In the days since Ginsburg\u2019s death, the Trump campaign has ramped up its calls for Biden to release a list of possible Supreme Court justices as the President has done. Shortly before Ginsburg\u2019s death was announced, Biden indicated he would not release such a list before the election. He elaborated on his decision not to release a Supreme Court list on Sunday, saying he would not want to create the appearance of influencing a \u201cperson\u2019s decision-making as a judge\u201d if they were on a list. He also cautioned that any one on a list could become the subject of \u201cunrelenting attacks\u201d without the ability to defend themselves and said he would want to make his choice with bipartisan input from the Senate. Biden has previously said he would name a black woman to the Supreme Court if he was elected and a Supreme Court vacancy occurred. Biden thus far has also resisted some calls to add additional seats to the Supreme Court, a position embraced by some of his rivals during the Democratic primary. In an interview with an Iowa outlet last year, Biden said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not prepared to go on and try to pack the court, because we\u2019ll live to rue that day.\u201d Biden\u2019s upcoming health care push comes as the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States nears 200,000 and as the Supreme Court prepares to hear the Affordable Care Act case. Biden stands solidly behind the Affordable Care Act\u2019s strong protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which bar insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on a person\u2019s medical history. Trump has also repeatedly promised that he would maintain protections for those with pre-existing conditions. But his actions say otherwise. His administration asked the Supreme Court in June to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, which would wipe out the key provisions that protect those who are sick or have been in the past. The case stems from a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican state attorneys general who argue that when Congress cut the tax penalty on the uninsured to zero, it rendered that individual mandate unconstitutional. The group also contends that the entire law should fall because the mandate was intertwined with a number of other provisions. Trump\u2019s Justice Department has largely backed the Texas-led coalition, though it recently argued that the ruling should only apply to the 18 states that brought the challenge. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on November 10, one week after the presidential election. Health care was also a key issue that helped propel Democrats to the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, an approach the Biden campaign and its allies hope to replicate heading into November. \u201cPeople are more mindful than ever of the need for health insurance, health coverage, protection from the virus, the stresses on the health care system,\u201d Neera Tanden, the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress, said. \u201cWith the pandemic, these issues have become even more salient for people.\u201d The Biden campaign has focused some of its TV ads on health care, including a pair of new battleground ads on the issue unveiled this week, as they\u2019ve tried to tie the issue of health care to the pandemic. Biden\u2019s plan seeks to expand health care coverage by making Affordable Care Act policies more affordable, particularly for middle class Americans who don\u2019t qualify for federal help buying plans. He would create a government-run insurance plan, known as the public option, which would provide the same broad coverage as the policies on the Obamacare exchanges. The former vice president also would expand the federal subsidies offered on the Affordable Care Act exchange policies so that no one would have to pay more than 8.5% of their income toward monthly premiums. And Biden would automatically enroll uninsured, low-income Americans either in the public option or in Medicaid, depending on whether their state expanded Medicaid. In a concession to the party\u2019s progressive wing, Biden proposed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60, instead of 65. He also has proposed an array of measures aimed at reducing prescription drug costs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and letting consumers buy medication from other countries. Still, Biden\u2019s plan would not cover everyone. The campaign estimated it would insure 97% of Americans, though this was before he proposed reducing the Medicare eligibility age. Trump has long promised to unveil a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 including at a town hall last week \u2013 but has yet to issue a comprehensive proposal. Instead, the President and his administration have put forth a series of smaller measures that officials and the campaign point to as his health care efforts, though many remain in the proposal stage. They seek to increase the transparency of hospital prices, combat opioid addiction, improve kidney health and make Medicare Advantage plans more attractive, among others. In recent weeks, he issued four executive orders that largely recycle previous proposals aimed at reducing drug costs, including allowing the importation of drugs from Canada and tying prices of certain Medicare drugs to their cost in other countries. One Trump health care executive order that has gone into effect: The expansion of short-term health plans, which do not have to adhere to Obamacare\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is now not just downplaying the coronavirus \u2013 he\u2019s resorting to absurd historical allusions about great World War II leaders to try to disguise his culpability in 190,000 American deaths. Trump ridiculously invoked the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a Thursday night rally, claiming that like them, he had tried hard to calm public panic in a dark hour. It was a historically illiterate gambit, since unlike Trump in the pandemic, both statesmen leveled with their people about grave national crises. But it reflected his struggle to explain his failure to tell the American people the truth about the seriousness of the virus \u2013 even though he told Bob Woodward in interviews for his new book in February that it was \u201cdeadly stuff.\u201d In a low-energy news conference earlier in the day, Trump doubled down on falsehood, declaring that \u201cI did not lie\u201d when he warned Woodward the pathogen was worse than the flu while publicly comparing it to the seasonal illness.   In one stunning moment, he said that if the Washington Post reporter, whose book \u201cRage\u201d comes out Tuesday, was so concerned about what was said in their taped conversations, he should have gone to the \u201cauthorities\u201d so they could prepare the country. Of course, under the Constitution, the President is the ultimate authority and whether Trump likes it, the buck stops with him for the pandemic and every other national crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to jump up and down and start screaming death, death,\u201d Trump said, after Vice President Mike Pence bizarrely suggested Trump\u2019s negligence in fact typified a British propaganda campaign that was never widely used during the war and has become part of marketing kitsch in recent years: \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On.\u201d At his Michigan rally, Trump jumped on the metaphor, comparing himself to the wartime prime minister. \u201cWe have to be calm. We don\u2019t want to be crazed lunatics. \u2026 When Hitler was bombing London, Churchill, a great leader, would oftentimes go to a roof in London and speak. And he always spoke with calmness,\u201d Trump said, mangling the history of Churchill\u2019s late night trips to view the raids with his separate radio addresses to the British people. Trump's historic dereliction of duty laid bare The comparison doesn\u2019t hold up since Churchill left his country in no doubt of the challenge ahead when he became prime minister in 1940, warning of an \u201cordeal of the most grievous kind\u201d and adding, \u201cWe have before us many, many long months of struggle and suffering.\u201d Trump never came close to a similar steeling of national resolve at the start of the pandemic. His choice to look away from the threat and hope it would just pass actually has more in common with another British Prime Minister of the era, Neville Chamberlain, who elected not to confront the rising Nazi menace in 1938 in appeasement policies that many historians believe squandered a chance to stop Adolf Hitler before he reached a point of maximum danger. The President also ludicrously compared himself to Roosevelt, who told Americans in his inaugural address in 1933 that \u201cthe only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.\u201d The quote was ripped out of context and is a poor match for Trump\u2019s denialism over the coronavirus. Unlike the current President\u2019s conduct in this crisis, Roosevelt didn\u2019t ignore the banking meltdown that he faced in the middle of the Great Depression. He explained it in understandable but powerful language to Americans and summoned them to a great national effort. Trump, by contrast, said that the pandemic wouldn\u2019t be a great problem and would just disappear, even though he knew full well how serious it was. Trump\u2019s meanderings were not just evidence of his slim grasp of history. They were the latest sign of how he has shirked his duty and minimized the current emergency. On Thursday, for instance, he urged New York City to go much faster after it announced that restaurants could soon begin serving food inside at 25% capacity after long and painful months slowly reducing the once out-of-control epidemic. At his evening rally, he called on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, to \u201copen up\u201d her state. He urged schools to reopen and called for Big Ten college football to come back, cherry picking science about the impact of the virus on kids and ignoring their potential to infect their elders who are more at risk of complications. This was despite growing signs of the danger posed to teachers \u2013 three of whom recently died from Covid-19 complications. He disregarded 40,000 cases of Covid-19 already recorded in higher education with many institutions canceling football games and in-person classes. The administration has not furnished a national plan to help schools go back safely, other than US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on reopening. It has also threatened to defund schools that don\u2019t get kids back in class. Flying to Michigan to greet several thousand maskless supporters packed together exemplified his defiance of his own government\u2019s guidelines for battling the pandemic. And Trump\u2019s admission to Woodward that he knew the virus was transmitted through the air back in February is training fresh scrutiny on his decision to hold a string of rallies through February and early March. The President\u2019s latest positions mirror those he took at the beginning of the summer when he goaded supportive state governors to open up their economies and mocked mask wearing, thereby helping set off a disaster in the Sun Belt. The impression then was the same as it is now: the President is desperate to restore at least an illusion of normality and to juice up the economy to boost his chances of reelection \u2013 ignoring the human cost of his actions. \u201cThis is the single largest public health failure in the modern history of the United States, certainly, in the last hundred years,\u201d said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University. \u201cAnd it happened because of the refusal by the White House to launch a national campaign and a national strategy against the virus. So it\u2019s beyond upsetting,\u201d Hotez told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Trump\u2019s explanation that he had not wanted to panic Americans by explaining the true threat from the virus also came under severe examination. \u201cWe could have had one-fifth the deaths we\u2019ve have had, and part of this is a failure to communicate,\u201d Tom Frieden, the former director of the CDC, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cWe will pass 200,000 deaths in the beginning of October, by all estimates, and this is a number that is just almost inconceivable,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cThis is an enormous number of people dying and it\u2019s tragic to recognize that if we just had a more organized, well-led response with clear communication, many of those deaths could have been avoided.\u201d The Woodward revelations, piled on top of previous evidence of Trump\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic, are likely to have a devastating impact on the President\u2019s legacy. What is less certain less than eight weeks from Election Day is how they will affect his immediate political fortunes. There is little chance that after nearly four years of scandals, dramas and outrages, Trump\u2019s bond with his loyal voter base will be hurt. Proof of that can be read in the reaction from Republican lawmakers to the Woodward book and their unwillingness to criticize the President, apart from a few exceptions, like Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has broken with Trump before and said the material was \u201cvery, very, very concerning.\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn declined to comment since he had no \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the President\u2019s remarks \u2013 even though they are on tape and have been playing on television for two days. Biden on Trump concealing coronavirus threat: 'It's almost criminal' North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who\u2019s facing a tough reelection, told CNN, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a crisis situation, you have to inform people for their public health but you also don\u2019t want to create hysteria.\u201d Democratic nominee Joe Biden launched a fresh attack on the President over his handling of the crisis that plays into the core argument of his campaign that Trump is temperamentally and intellectually unfit for office. \u201cHe said there\u2019s no need for social distancing, don\u2019t bother wearing a mask. He actually went so far as to suggest it was a violation of American freedom to maintain you had to wear a mask,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an exclusive interview. \u201cAnd look what\u2019s happened. Again, 190,000 dead and climbing. And what\u2019s he doing now? He still has not moved.\u201d The explosion over the Woodward books comes just two weeks after a Republican National Convention that made Trump\u2019s campaign strategy clear \u2013 avoid discussion of the pandemic at all costs. But as Trump\u2019s struggles on Thursday showed, he\u2019s finding it all but impossible to change the subject. For example, he could try to exploit Biden\u2019s vulnerabilities on trade and China. The former vice president voted to admit Beijing into the World Trade Organization as a senator and also supported the North America Free Trade agreement. Those positions offer an opening to Trump in a political climate that has turned against free trade agreements. But the grim and looming milestone of 200,000 US deaths from Covid-19 is likely to drown out the President\u2019s message within days. And with the first debate with Biden on September 29 fast approaching, time is dwindling for the President to get the campaign back onto ground he prefers.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said President Donald Trump \u201cseems to have no conception of what constitutes national security\u201d after Trump revealed in interviews with Bob Woodward the existence of a classified nuclear weapons system. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, the former vice president said Trump\u2019s comments to Woodward \u2013 made in a series of 18 interviews for the journalist\u2019s upcoming book \u201cRage\u201d \u2013 were \u201cnot a surprise.\u201d \u201cYou wonder why people in the intelligence community wondered from the very beginning whether you could share data with him, \u2018cause they don\u2019t trust him. They don\u2019t trust what he\u2019ll say or do,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe seems to have no conception of what constitutes national security, no conception of anything other than, what can he do to promote himself?\u201d Biden on Trump concealing coronavirus threat: 'It's almost criminal' Biden cited an Axios report that Trump asked whether nuclear bombs could be dropped in the middle of hurricanes to dissipate them before landfall, which Trump has denied. He also pointed to Trump\u2019s comment last year that the Continental Army \u201ctook over the airports\u201d from the British in the Revolutionary War, more than a century before airplanes existed. Trump blamed a faulty teleprompter at the time. \u201cThis is the guy who said maybe the way to deal with hurricane is drop a nuclear bomb on them. I mean \u2013 seriously, he said it!\u201d Biden said. \u201cI mean, God. Or you know, the problem with the Revolutionary War was they didn\u2019t have enough airports. I mean, I just \u2013 it is beyond my comprehension.\u201d Biden then pointed to The Atlantic\u2019s recent report that Trump had referred to those killed and injured at war \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d He highlighted his deceased son Beau Biden\u2019s service in Kosovo and in the Iraq war, \u201cand all the people with him, the people who died. They\u2019re suckers? I mean I can\u2019t fathom.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cThey\u2019re heroes. They really are heroes. Duty, honor, country,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe talks about can you repeat four words in a row or whatever his little IQ test or dementia test he took, he doesn\u2019t understand duty, honor, service, country. He doesn\u2019t get it. Or if he gets it he doesn\u2019t care about it.\u201d He added: \u201cUnrelated to my running, he should not be the commander-in-chief of the United States military. It\u2019s just \u2013 no commander-in-chief\u2019s ever, ever, ever, acted like this man.\u201d The interview took place the day Biden visited Macomb County, a key swing region in Michigan. Trump won Macomb County by 12 percentage points in 2016, making him the first Republican to win the county since 1988. It\u2019s representative of the type of territory that Barack Obama won twice, then Trump won four years ago, that Biden hopes to shift back into the Democratic column on November 3. Asked whether Trump could claim victories \u2013 renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and ending trade advantages for China \u2013 that eluded Biden, the former vice president conceded that Trump\u2019s renegotiated US-Mexico-Canada Agreement is \u201cbetter than NAFTA.\u201d \u201cBut look what the overall trade policy has done even with NAFTA. We now have this gigantic deficit in trade with Mexico. Not because NAFTA wasn\u2019t made better, because overall trade policy and how he deals with it made everything worse,\u201d Biden said. Biden also touted his role in the Obama administration\u2019s economic recovery effort in 2009, and pointed to the auto industry bailout. And he complained that Trump has not enforced \u201cBuy America\u201d laws. Biden criticized Trump\u2019s dealings with countries like North Korea and Iran, saying he has lent them credibility. \u201cI mean, this \u2018America First\u2019 has made America alone,\u201d he said. He also criticized the tax cuts enacted by Trump and a then-Republican-led Congress. Biden also said he would raise taxes on those making more than $400,000 per year, lift corporate income taxes to 28%, and would impose new penalties for corporations that send jobs overseas to manufacture goods that are then sold back into the United States. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get people investing. And so the idea that we take that money and put it into new investments and manufacturing and education, and health care, I mean, you know, these are things that matter to middle class families,\u201d Biden said. The 77-year-old Biden said he would not conceal anything about his health status if he is elected president. Previous presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, have not disclosed issues related to their health. Trump made a surprise visit to the Walter Reed Army medical center last year. Trump had undergone a \u201cquick exam and labs\u201d as part of his annual physical out of anticipation of a \u201cvery busy 2020,\u201d the White House had said of the trip at the time. In a new book, The New York Times\u2019 Michael Schmidt writes, however, that he learned \u201cin the hours leading up to Trump\u2019s trip to the hospital, word went out in the West Wing for the vice president to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized.\u201d Trump and his doctor asserted after Schmidt\u2019s reporting that an ambiguous trip to Walter Reed last year was not in response to a mini-stroke \u2013 though neither Schmidt nor other news outlets had suggested Trump had suffered a mini-stroke. \u201cAnything can happen. I\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate \u2013 a great respecter of fate. I\u2019ve seen too much of it in my family related to accidents alone. And so I guarantee you, I guarantee you, I will be totally transparent in terms of my health, and all aspects of my health,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd when it comes to Donald Trump versus me, just look at us. OK? Just look at us. Who seems to be in shape? Who\u2019s able to move around?\u201d Biden said, laughing about Trump and his allies calling him \u201cSlow Joe.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump \u2013 just look at us both, watch us, and determine whether or not you think I\u2019m misleading anyone. Not you personally, but the public,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou know, look at me. Judge me based on \u2013 I know what the job takes. I\u2019ve sat for hundreds of hours in the Situation Room. For eight years I was vice president in every major decision. I know how difficult the job is.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd one more thing I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll take responsibility.

            "article_content": "The House approved legislation Saturday to allocate $25 billion to the US Postal Service and ban operational changes that have slowed mail service around the country. The bill passed 257-150, largely along party lines, with Democrats supporting it. More than two dozen Republicans joined Democrats in voting for the measure, defying House GOP leaders and President Donald Trump, who actively urged Republicans to oppose it. On the eve of the vote, the White House threatened to veto the bill. The measure isn\u2019t expected to reach Trump\u2019s desk, however, as the Republican-held Senate is unlikely to vote on it. The Republicans who crossed party lines to vote for the legislation include a handful of members facing competitive reelections or retiring, others who sometimes buck their party and several from deep-red districts. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had predicted bipartisan support for the USPS legislation ahead of the vote Saturday. \u201cWe will pass the bill and it will be in a bipartisan way today and then we will send it to the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said, adding that Republicans \u201cwill be hearing from their constituents because this hits home \u2013 not receiving your mail in a timely fashion, hits home.\u201d Democratic leaders introduced the measure, based on a bill sponsored by House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, after the Trump administration made policy changes at the USPS. Those moves included cutting overtime for employees, limiting post office hours, and removing some high-volume mail sorting machines from USPS facilities. Democrats argue the policies were intended to impede mail-in voting ahead of the November election. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, an ally and donor of President Donald Trump, has denied the claims, saying the changes were intended to increase efficiency and save money. Ahead of the vote, the House Oversight Committee on Saturday released new internal USPS documents that show postal service declines and delays since the beginning of July. The August 12 internal USPS slide presentation prepared for the postmaster general, which was obtained and released by the committee, shows that there has been an overall drop in service across the board in first-class and priority mail, marketing and periodicals. \u201cTo those who still claim there are \u2018no delays\u2019 and that these reports are just \u2018conspiracy theories,\u2019 I hope this new data causes them to re-think their position and support our urgent legislation today,\u201d Maloney said in a statement Saturday. \u201cWe have all seen the headlines from every corner of our country, we have read the stories and seen pictures, we have heard directly from our constituents, and these new documents show that the delays are far worse than we were told,\u201d she added. A USPS spokesperson on Saturday referred CNN to a fact sheet that includes information on the postal service\u2019s handling of election mail and its operational changes. The spokesperson told CNN DeJoy \u201clooks forward to appearing\u201d before the House Oversight Committee on Monday. DeJoy said earlier this week that he would halt the changes until after the November election. Congressional Democrats were unsatisfied with the announcement. Pelosi said in a letter to members on Thursday that DeJoy\u2019s decision is \u201cwholly insufficient and does not reverse damage already wreaked.\u201d The Postal Service controversy, explained \u201cTherefore, in the name of our democracy and the veterans, seniors, families and small businesses who depend on the Post Office, we will pass the Delivering for America Act,\u201d Pelosi wrote. In a Senate hearing on Friday, DeJoy said the Postal Service is able to handle election mail. \u201cAs we head into the election season, I want to assure this committee and the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation\u2019s election mail securely and on time,\u201d DeJoy told senators during the hearing. He also claimed he never spoke with President Donald Trump or anyone else at the White House about Postal Service changes or their potential impact on the November election. The fight over the postal service is unfolding as Democrats and the Trump administration have not yet come together to successfully negotiate a new stimulus bill. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tweeted to Democrats on Saturday, saying, \u201cIf you really want to help Americans, how about passing relief for small businesses and unemployment assistance ALONG with postal funding?\u201d Congressional Democratic leaders have argued that the next stimulus should be a comprehensive package, and have indicated they do not want to take a piecemeal approach that will leave out what they describe as key priorities. Asked to respond to Meadows\u2019 criticism at a news conference Saturday, Pelosi said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything about schools. He didn\u2019t say anything about crushing the virus. He didn\u2019t say anything about people who are being evicted. He didn\u2019t say anything about food insecurity among millions of America\u2019s children. He didn\u2019t say anything about state and local. That\u2019s completely unacceptable.\u201d The House\u2019s early return for votes on Saturday disrupted members\u2019 August recess plans. The chamber had previously been scheduled to next return for votes in the middle of September. Initially, Democrats sought to include funding for the USPS in a larger coronavirus stimulus package, but negotiations between congressional Democrats and the White House for such a bill have broken down. During talks over the relief bill, the White House did reach a tentative agreement to include $10 billion for the Postal Service, people involved with the talks told CNN. Administration officials are opposed to a USPS-specific bill, like the one passed Saturday. Meadows has called instead for a measure that would include pieces of the relief talks where the two sides agree, like another round of direct payments for Americans. This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday. Phil Mattingly, Sam Fossum and Kelly Mena contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When I wrote Wednesday about the crisis of kids not being in school and linked to a story written by a nurse and arguing teachers are essential workers and that kids should be in the classroom, I invited them to email me their hate mail. A lot of teachers and their families took me up on it and sent in some thoughtful notes. Here\u2019s what they said. I was kind of flip in asking them to send in hate mail and, while one person told me to \u201cgo to hell you damn fool,\u201d several people made a point to say what they were writing was not \u201chate mail.\u201d Barbara Cole, a nurse who wrote in saying health care workers have a much different responsibility than teachers, said her message was \u201cnot hate mail! We haven\u2019t the time for that. Wear the mask.\u201d A woman who described herself as an essential worker in a hospital said there\u2019s a big difference between a school and a hospital. Please do not \u201cshame\u201d the teachers. As an essential worker in a hospital \u2026 I see where you are going with your argument. But, the health care arena is totally different from school. We do NOT encounter large groups of patients as these teachers will be encountering large groups of children in class. Kelly Crite is a retired junior kindergarten director: I wish you would\u2019ve highighted the fact that schools do have a safe option, albeit imperfect. Virtual learning is available for students and it is obviously the safer option. This type of learning also stops the spread of the virus, which in my humble opinion is the current priority goal. Nurses and doctors cannot \u201cvirtually\u201d treat the sickest patients. Walmart employees cannot \u201cvirtually\u201d restock shelves or sanitize stores. Another woman said school is not essential to life in the way health care and groceries are, and that people should patiently wait a few months. School isn\u2019t essential in a life or death situation, which we ARE in. To demand teachers risk their lives because \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d and because others are truly essential to LIFE, is wrong. We will need all these teachers to be alive and well and ready to do everything for our kids, WHEN IT IT SAFE FOR THEM AND THE STUDENTS! There are plenty of Americans who would debate her on this point. This is from a man who wrote in from north of Atlanta and asked not to be identified: The analogy of teachers vs. grocery store workers is also flawed \u2013 stocking shelves and moving people through a register line one by one is hardly the same as moving 1,000 children through a crowded hallway or being forced into a room with 30 of their germy little hands, noses and mouths. Teachers are generally older and have greater health issues than other essential services professions. \u2026 I\u2019m a teacher, and my district is engaged in a group hallucination right now, fantasizing that we can safely cram thousands teenagers into a building where they will all social distance, wash their hands and wear masks. As we\u2019ve already seen in dozens of photos from around the country just in the past week, it ain\u2019t happening. I for one will not be singing the school fight song with my last, wheezing breaths, and if politicians won\u2019t gather for their conventions in two-to-three weeks, why should I gather for politicians\u2019 children\u2019s Covid parties? Renee Longshore also equated the story with teacher shaming. Teachers are highly trained professionals whose job is to help educate the next generation, and the next after that. They are (for the most part) selfless and giving more to the job than they ever get paid for. But using your article to shame us into stepping into a classroom (aka poorly ventilated and highly saturated germ factory) in the middle of a pandemic (when 1-2% of those infected will die), so parents can go back to work, is irresponsible. What happens when a vaccine comes out and it is safer to start our economy back up again? Who will educate (or babysit) the students then? I am sure no one will be looking to enter a profession where you have to give of yourself so fully to only get a parent\u2019s (and journalist\u2019s) chastisement in response. Greg Smith is a pastor and former teacher in Gwinnett County, Georgia. His wife is a teacher still: My wife and I are both over 60. I have a compromised health problem. In a normal time she sees up to 150 different students per day in her classroom. To put it bluntly, she is breathing the air from 150 different homes, without knowing who is Covid-positive but asymptomatic. As of this morning (yes, I watched CNN) your network reported over 158,000 people in this country have died with this virus. Neither my wife or I want to become one of your statistics. So, why are you advocating putting children, teachers, families and entire communities at further risk? Instead, use your national platform to advocate that schools provide for a safe environment. Inform people of what it takes to protect children, teachers and staff before the students arrive. Advocate that our federal, state, and local governments invest the funding so our schools can create a safe environment. That is the best way to get children back into school and their parents back on the job. Seriously, safety must come first! Teachers want to teach Janet Lake works at a charter high school in New York and she\u2019s ready to take class outside. I will teach American history under a tree if I have to. Wearing gloves, winter coat and scarf. Government just needs to make sure all students have extra winter gear and enough nurses. And a bag lunch. Let\u2019s go. A lot of people see the need for creative solutions. One man said he\u2019s developing a contraption (it sounds sort of like an airport metal detector) that would take kids\u2019 temperature as they walk in the building and also douse them in a \u201cconcentrated disinfecting fog.\u201d Sheryl Wright is a fourth grade teacher in Merced, California, and she\u2019s taking early retirement. Her husband died from cancer nine years ago and she doesn\u2019t want her children to lose another parent. I teach in a sardine can, otherwise known as a portable. There is no running water or sink in my classroom. The ventilation is of poor quality. There is a door and two windows (which I\u2019ve never opened before.) I live in a part of California that maintains 90-100 degree temperatures through September, so it is unlikely that the windows would be open during these months. Our custodians have removed any tables in the room to accommodate the mandated 3-foot distance between desks. (Please note that the distance decreased from 6 feet to 3 feet.) In a grocery store or other public setting, we need to stand 6 feet apart to maintain safety. However, in the sardine can of a classroom I will have 25-32 kids sitting ALL DAY in isolated desks in rows that extend the width of my room at only 3 feet apart, breathing the poorly ventilated air conditioned air for 6-7 hours daily. A woman from Ohio wrote: I am not a teacher. I am a public high school administrative and guidance secretary. And I have been reporting every day to work. Many nights and weekends too. Along with custodians, bus drivers and cafeteria workers. I had to pick up the slack and work as the middleman so to speak between teachers and students who were able to work from home. I was the one students and parents relied on to be available and work at any given time to get academic needs organized and distributed, even making home deliveries. While teachers sat at home. I made calls and met students/parents at any time on any day. While teachers worked from home, I had to fix, reorganize and,for some teachers, do their jobs that they \u201cdidn\u2019t feel comfortable or safe\u201d doing, so they could stay home \u2026 Please do us some justice and quit referring to just teachers for school openings. Please cover us all and replace teachers with school staff! Some people\u2019s comments were more about spelling and style. One person noted that I misspelled a word in the email version of this newsletter. \u201cMisogynist is spelled misoginyst,\u201d she said, and adding: \u201cFor shame!\u201d Indeed. (Editor\u2019s note: Sorry about that, our bad.) Another woman said I should not use the word \u201cliterally\u201d as a device, as I did when I said \u201cthe sky is literally falling.\u201d \u201cI enjoy your newsletter but was disappointed when I read \u2018the sky is literally falling\u2019 on the school children. Don\u2019t use literally when something is not literal. It like saying a false fact.\u201d She\u2019s right, obviously. I\u2019ll do better.

            "article_content": "A day before the Trump administration is expected to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, House Democrats unveiled a plan Wednesday to strengthen the landmark health care law. The move, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, seeks to draw a sharp contrast between the parties on health care, a key concern in the 2020 election that\u2019s become even more pressing amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt was wrong anytime,\u201d the California Democrat said of the administration\u2019s stance. \u201cNow, it\u2019s beyond stupid.\u201d The House bill aims to make Obamacare policies more affordable by bolstering federal premium subsidies. It would provide more assistance to those just above the poverty level, and it would limit monthly premiums to 8.5% of enrollees\u2019 income, instead of nearly 10% under the current law. Obamacare, Trump and the Supreme Court, explained Also, it would enable more middle-class folks to receive help by eliminating the current eligibility cap of four times the poverty level, or roughly $50,000 a year for an individual and $103,000 for a family of four. These provisions are similar to those pushed by former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The House is expected to vote on the bill early next week, but neither it nor House drug price legislation is expected to get through the Republican-led Senate. The drug bill tries to entice more states to expand Medicaid to low-income adults by covering 100% of the cost for the first three years. This provision mirrors the one in the Affordable Care Act, which paid the full expense initially and then ramped down to covering 90%. Some 14 states have yet to expand Medicaid. The legislation also calls for extending Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program coverage to new mothers for one year after birth to help combat maternal mortality. It also would reverse several moves made by the Trump administration to weaken the law. The House bill calls for shortening the duration of short-term plans, which the administration had extended to just under a year, and for restoring funding for marketing and enrollment assistance during the Obamacare annual sign-up period. Lawmakers would pay for these provisions with savings generated by a bill the House passed in December that would allow the federal government to negotiate prices on up to 250 prescription drugs and cap the cost based on the price in certain developed countries. The legislation unveiled Wednesday would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by an average of 4 million a year between 2022 and 2030, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The Trump administration is set to submit briefs Thursday in a case that could upend the Affordable Care Act, which has extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The administration has generally sided with a coalition of Republican attorneys general, who argue that the law\u2019s individual coverage mandate was rendered unconstitutional when the Republican-led Congress in 2017 reduced the tax penalty for the uninsured to zero and therefore the entire law should fall. This would eliminate Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions. The Justice Department has also argued recently that the entire law should fall but the ruling should apply only to the 18 states that brought the challenge. The House and a coalition of Democratic attorneys general are defending the law. A federal appeals court held in December that the mandate was unconstitutional but asked a district court to consider whether the entire law should be invalidated. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case in its next term. This story has been updated with a more precise Congressional Budget Office estimate.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the Democrat hoping to unseat him, are raking in millions for their campaigns at high-dollar events but have not fully disclosed details about the elite fundraisers who collect cash on their behalf, campaign-finance watchdogs say. With the exception of federal lobbyists who serve as campaign bundlers, federal law does not require presidential candidates to release their full lists of the political fundraisers who help \u201cbundle\u201d together donations from friends, relatives and business associates to underwrite costly White House campaigns. But presidential nominees over the years, including George W. Bush, John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, voluntarily disclosed so-called bundler information. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Obama, for instance, publicly updated his list of fundraisers quarterly and divided them into broad tiers, ranging from those who had collected more than $500,000 apiece to those who collected between $50,000 and $100,000 each. \u201cWithout knowing who these campaign bundlers are, the public has no way of knowing if they have undue influence because of their ability to raise large sums of money for candidates,\u201d said Michael Beckel, research director of Issue One, which supports transparency in fundraising. Issue One joined more than a dozen other watchdog groups last year in urging presidential candidates to make details about their big-money fundraisers public on a regular basis. Biden released a bundler list late last year, disclosing the names and hometowns of more than 230 individuals and couples who had collected at least $25,000 for his campaign. It includes heavy hitters from the worlds of politics and Democratic fundraising, such as Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, Bill Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and private equity investor Alan Patricof. But the list, released in late December, was virtually unchanged as of Thursday morning, months after Biden became the presumptive nominee and began to raise money in earnest for the general election. And the list did not include any details on how much each bundler had raised on his behalf. A Biden campaign aide this week declined to discuss future bundler disclosure. Biden\u2019s campaign does grant journalists access to fundraising events, which have been conducted \u201cvirtually\u201d in recent months because of the coronavirus pandemic. And Biden\u2019s team identifies those serving as the main hosts. A recent Biden event, for instance, raised $4 million \u2013 setting a single-day record for the campaign \u2013 and featured as its lead hosts San Francisco billionaire and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and other Silicon Valley figures focused on climate change. On Tuesday, another virtual fundraiser, hosted by Sen. Kamala Harris of California and the state\u2019s lieutenant governor,. Eleni Kounalakis, raised $3.5 million for Biden. Trump is set to raise eye-popping sums this week \u2013 his first in-person fundraising events since the pandemic upended traditional campaign activity. A fundraiser he was to attend Thursday in Dallas has brought in $10 million, according to a Republican National Committee official. The event at a private home in Dallas came with a steep entry fee: $580,600 per couple. About 25 people are expected to attend. Trump also is slated to appear at a Saturday fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. About 25 people are expected to attend, at $250,000 a head. Both events benefit Trump Victory, the campaign\u2019s joint fundraising operation with the Republican National Committee and nearly two dozen state committees. (An individual cannot donate more than $5,600 directly to a presidential candidate for the primary and general election. But legal changes in 2014 eased restrictions on donations to political parties \u2013 paving the way for six-figure checks to the joint political operations that candidates establish with party committees. Biden\u2019s joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic Party entities seeks as much as $620,600 from donors to support him and other Democrats.) Trump, who relied heavily on small-dollar donors and his own personal wealth at the start of his 2016 campaign, has stepped up his use of bundlers to help underwrite his reelection. In May 2019, the campaign formally rolled out its bundling program and quickly attracted 200 enrollees. Earlier this year, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality and the girlfriend of presidential son Donald Trump Jr., assumed the role of national chairwoman of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, where she is credited with expanding its ranks of fundraisers \u2013 including allowing middle-class donors to \u201cbundle\u201d grassroots donations for the campaign. Trump bundlers who raise $1,000 in contributions from five other contributors, for instance, receive a \u201ccommemorative gift\u201d and VIP access for two to a Trump campaign rally. Those who collect $25,000 can join the \u201cTrump Train\u201d and get more perks, including conference calls with campaign surrogates. Today, it counts more than 3,000 people as bundlers, operating in seven tiers, according to the campaign. And Team Trump has created new bundling programs, recently announcing that nearly two dozen Republican House members would raise money for Trump\u2019s reelection as newly minted \u201cHouse congressional captains.\u201d A Trump campaign spokesman declined to discuss whether the campaign would release more details about bundlers moving forward. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map As required by law, Trump Victory has disclosed details about federal lobbyists who collect money for the committee. Its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission shows six lobbyists raising nearly $4 million during the first three months of the year. This list was led by Texas lobbyist Kent Hance, whose clients include the drug industry trade group PhRMA. He raised more than $1.5 million for Trump Victory, the filing shows. Beth Rotman of Common Cause, one of the groups calling for greater disclosure, said bundlers are crucial to campaigns because they allow candidates to quickly scoop up vast sums without exceeding legal donation limits. Political fundraisers often go on to win top government jobs and plum assignments as ambassadorships. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin oversaw Trump\u2019s fundraising operation in 2016; Trump\u2019s ambassadors to Italy and the United Kingdom also were top campaign bundlers. \u201cThis is absolutely at the crux of the reason that we have contribution limits at all,\u201d Rotman said, \u201cthe idea that excessive money wields excessive influence in our government.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sarah Mucha contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A new reality is dawning for Democrats: The November election will likely hinge on the way American voters see President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus. That belief has grown clearer over the last month, as nearly every Democratic organization has focused their time, messaging and paid media on framing the President\u2019s response as an abject failure that highlights the chaos around his White House and the unpredictability he has ushered into American politics. The full extent of Trump\u2019s impact on controlling coronavirus, a pandemic that has wholly remade American life, is likely months away from being revealed. But Democrats aren\u2019t waiting \u2013 for either voters to reengage with electoral politics or for the full results of Trump\u2019s mitigation efforts to become clear \u2013 an acknowledgment that they believe they must define the President as a failure now to have success come November. \u201cWe have to make the arguments about why he hasn\u2019t done a good job as president,\u201d said Steve Schale, a veteran Florida political operative who runs Unite the Country, a PAC supporting former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. \u201cFrankly, there\u2019s not a clearer moment than now that we\u2019re in this mess, not because he created the coronavirus, but for 50, 60, 70 days, he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\u201d Democratic super PAC turns up focus on Trump's coronavirus response The thinking among Democrats is that while Trump isn\u2019t to blame for coronavirus, he can be blamed for the federal government\u2019s delayed response. Additionally, Democrats believe that the virus has crystallized issues they have long faulted Trump for: the chaos around his administration, the unpredictability he has injected into American life and Republican health care policy. \u201cThere is no question that Donald Trump and the Trump administration\u2019s response is going to be central\u201d to the election, said Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA. \u201cBut I also think it is going to highlight some of the issues we have been talking about this entire time\u201d like health care. Political ad spending over the last month makes clear how dramatically coronavirus has shifted political messaging: With most American remained under stay-at-home orders, Democrats dominated the broadcast television and national cable spending with anti-Trump ads focused on coronavirus, even as most political spending is down. Super PACs, like Priorities USA and American Bridge, have released scores of television and digital ads focused on Trump\u2019s handling of the virus and his early comments diminishing the spread. Biden\u2019s campaign has released a series of digital ads on the virus, including one that tracked Trump\u2019s comments as the virus spread. And the Democratic National Committee has worked with state parties from Florida to Michigan to Pennsylvania to slam how Trump\u2019s handling of coronavirus has impacted the battleground states. The tonal shift is an acknowledgment that, even as aspects of the presidential campaign continue, nearly every American voter is focused on their health and safety above all else. The virus is \u201cfront and center in the election,\u201d said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge 21st Century, a super PAC that has blistered Trump with attack ads about his response to the pandemic. \u201cThis is the unifying issue that has taken over immediately because one, this is a crisis affecting every American\u2019s daily life and two, this is an economic issue that is ongoing and developing.\u201d The latest round of digital advertising from American Bridge juxtaposes the rise in coronavirus cases with Trump\u2019s words downplaying the crisis. The ad, which will target voters in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, also charts all the times the President played golf as the outbreak spread. \u201cTo hold Trump to account on Covid-19,\u201d said Beychok, \u201call you need is a calendar and a camera.\u201d Jim Messina, a longtime Democratic operative and adviser to former President Barack Obama, said he was watching focus groups recently and was struck by how \u201cvoters won\u2019t and can\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d \u201cYou literally couldn\u2019t\u201d get insights on other topics, Messina recalled. \u201cThere\u2019s just no appetite for it.\u201d The strategy of hammering Trump for coronavirus is not without risks. Many Americans \u2013 including some Democrats \u2013 want the President to succeed in combating coronavirus, meaning an overly negative campaign that looks like it is cheering the virus\u2019 spread could backfire. Cecil said his team has tried to do so primarily by using the President\u2019s words against him, something they believe is more sensitive than a more sensationalized ad. \u201cIt is really important that when we are communicating with people about this that we understand the context and that we are sensitive to the real trauma they are going through,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cOur goal is not to add to the trauma, it\u2019s to inform people.\u201d The Trump campaign has called out the Democratic efforts. \u201cWhile President Trump is leading the nation in the war against the virus, Joe Biden and his Democrat allies have decided to serve as the opposition in that war,\u201d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. And the Biden campaign isn\u2019t necessarily fighting this accusation that they are opposing Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cWe\u2019re paying the price for Donald Trump\u2019s malpractice, and we deserve a president who will rebuild the American middle class while restoring competence and empathy to the Oval Office,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman. This pivot to coronavirus messaging comes at what would have been a key time in the campaign, as Biden and Trump turn to the general election now that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race. Ordinarily, both campaigns would be spending millions to further define their opponent. That is still happening \u2013 Trump\u2019s campaign released a factually questionable ad this week that attacked Biden\u2019s ties to China and raised questions about his mental ability but now within the context of the pandemic. A new seven-figure digital ad from the Republican National Committee praises Trump for his response to the outbreak. \u201cOur latest ad buy further fuels our robust digital presence as we continue to meet voters where they are right now \u2013 online and in their homes,\u201d said Richard Walters, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cThe American people have seen President Trump respond to this crisis with unprecedented leadership, and they will respond with their votes in November.\u201d One of the biggest concerns among Democrats is that Trump, because of the platform the White House offers, is spending hours on national television every day, compared to Biden\u2019s one-off interviews from the basement studio he built in his Delaware home. Biden campaign braces for general election: 'This is the beginning of a very difficult race' Trump has taken to headlining daily White House briefing and touting them as moments for his supporters to watch his real-time response to the virus. Trump has lauded the ratings the briefings have been getting, seemingly replacing the television time has received from his weekly raucous rallies across the country with daily sparring matches with the press. \u201cAmericans want to see their President out front and leading in a time of crisis and that\u2019s exactly what President Trump is doing,\u201d Murtaugh of the Trump campaign said. Democratic allies have openly worried about the exposure Trump receives from the briefings. \u201cThe only thing the President is willing to engage in around this crisis is to appear like the commander in chief, not the counselor in chief, no the government in chief, not being effective, but to appear like he is in control,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten said that she views the briefings as an extension of his rallies, because \u201cmuch of what he is doing (during them) is political, not factual.\u201d There is new evidence, though, that Trump\u2019s daily briefings may have downsides. Polls show public support for Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak declining. A majority of Americans \u2013 55% \u2013 now say the federal government has done a poor job preventing the spread of the virus in the US, up about 8 points in a week, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And the Wall Street Journal\u2019s conservative editorial board this week warned that Trump\u2019s \u201coutbursts\u201d against his critics during the briefings are \u201cnotably off key at this moment\u201d and encouraged him to let Vice President Mike Pence lead on communicating with the public and press. This comes after Trump\u2019s initial response, and his time at the press podium in the White House, raised his approval rating. \u201cTrump saw an initial sugar high in his ratings on handling of the crisis because, as a citizen, if you have fear and anxiety, you want to look to the President for some encouragement,\u201d American Bridge\u2019s Beychok said. \u201cBut he can\u2019t help himself from trying to cause distractions or disagreeing with the experts, and I think when people see that, it\u2019s reversed its course.\u201d Even as Democrats turn their focus to coronavirus, the last month has seen a huge drop in overall advertising in the presidential race, an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project shows. Part of the drop is attributed to the end of the Democratic primary and the departure of the big-spending former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \u201cThe messaging and the attacks that we\u2019ve seen on (coronavirus) do feel louder \u2026 in part because there are fewer messages overall,\u201d said Erika Franklin Fowler, who teaches government at Wesleyan University and co-directs the political advertising project. A direct focus on health care helped Democrats win back the House in 2018 and even before the coronavirus outbreak, health care was emerging again as a top issue in 2020 advertising for Democrats. So, Fowler added, it\u2019s not surprising that Democrats appear poised to focus on the pandemic and the Trump administration\u2019s response to it as part of their larger strategy to hit Trump and Republicans on health care. Campaign advertising adapts to new coronavirus reality Democratic candidates and groups are also dramatically outspending Republicans on the airwaves as both political parties jockey for advantage amid the coronavirus outbreak that has upended everyday American life and suspended normal campaign activity. Democrats have spent more than $15.4 million on broadcast TV and national cable ads focused on federal races since March 16 when the Trump administration first announced guidelines to slow the spread of the deadly virus, according to data from Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. That\u2019s nearly three times the $5.4 million spent by Republicans during the same period. The analysis covered advertising through Tuesday. \u201cI think a major reason we\u2019re seeing such a disparity between the two parties ad spending in recent weeks is that the Democrats taking advantage of what they perceive to be a poor response to the pandemic from the President,\u201d CMAG\u2019s Mitchell West said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting in hits wherever they can in an otherwise quiet political landscape.\u201d After a sustained onslaught from liberal groups, Trump\u2019s allies have begun to respond. In addition to the RNC\u2019s digital buy, a super PAC supporting Trump, America First Action, plans a $10 million TV, digital and mail campaign to attack Biden in three key battleground states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. That effort is slated to begin next week.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a wide lead over President Donald Trump in the national race for the White House, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Biden leads Trump 53% to 42% among registered voters, roughly steady from CNN\u2019s poll in early March. The nationwide picture shows Biden starts with an edge among voters generally, but national polling cannot address the state-by-state electoral college race which ultimately determines the presidency. The coronavirus pandemic has drastically altered presidential campaigning. Biden and Trump have paused in-person campaign events, and states have pushed back primary elections until the summer months. Biden holds an edge over Trump as more trusted to handle several key issues, including the response to the coronavirus outbreak (52% to 43%), health care (57% to 39%) and helping the middle class (57% to 38%). Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race But Trump narrowly tops Biden on who would do a better job handling the economy, with 50% saying the President would and 46% saying Biden, despite a down tick in Trump\u2019s approval rating for handling the economy and a sharp rise in negative views of the nation\u2019s economy, according to data from the same poll released earlier this week. Biden\u2019s advantages on health care and helping the middle class are bolstered by crossover from those who approve of Trump \u2013 around one in 8 Americans who give Trump positive reviews think Biden would do a better job than him on health care and helping the middle class. And even though very few Democrats defect from Biden on those two issues, the President\u2019s edge on the economy gets a boost from the 16% of Democrats who say Trump would do a better job than Biden on the issue. In the general election match up, however, there is very little crossover support for either Biden or Trump among partisans: Biden is supported by 91% of Democrats, while Trump holds 96% of Republicans. Independent voters break for Biden, 52% behind the former vice president, 40% for Trump. The demographic divides that defined the 2016 election seem likely to persist in 2020. Biden carries 62% of women to 32% for Trump, while Trump leads among men (51% to 44% for Biden). Biden performs well among voters of color, 72% of whom support him, while white voters break toward Trump (52% for Trump, 44% for Biden). And the poll suggests Biden holds a broad advantage among younger voters, who tended to be more supportive of Sanders in the Democratic primary fight. Among those under age 35, 62% back Biden, 31% Trump, while Trump\u2019s support is stronger among seniors (55% Trump to 42% Biden). As calls for increased voting by mail rise amidst the coronavirus outbreak, most Americans say they think it is important for states to continue to offer in-person voting (54%). A sizable number (41%) would like to see November\u2019s vote go all mail. But there is a big partisan split behind those numbers: 57% of Democrats say all voting in the presidential election should be conducted by mail, just 28% of Republicans say the same. Independents prefer offering some in-person voting, with 56% saying it\u2019s important that it is still offered and 40% saying go all mail. On Friday at a White House press briefing, Trump denounced mail voting, saying it\u2019s easy to cheat. It was reported that Trump voted using mail ballot in 2018. With the nation focused firmly on the coronavirus, enthusiasm for voting in the presidential election among registered voters has dipped down nine percentage points, from 66% who said they were extremely or very enthusiastic in March to 57% now. Overall enthusiasm is down more among Democrats than Republicans \u2013 falling 12 points for Democrats, while remaining steady for Republicans. And as of now, those who say they support Trump are far more enthusiastic about voting (70%) than are those who back Biden (50%). Biden\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination has cleared since the poll fielded from Friday through Monday. His chief rival, Bernie Sanders, announced he was suspending his campaign on Wednesday. The poll found that before Sanders ended his bid, 65% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent voters backed Biden, while 30% backed Sanders. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS April 3 through 6 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For the sample of 875 registered voters, it is 3.9 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race following another round of disappointing finishes in primary contests across the country on Super Tuesday. The Massachusetts senator, who centered her bid on a promise to wipe out corruption in Washington, announced her decision on a staff call Thursday morning and later held a news conference outside of her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cI announced this morning that\u00a0I am suspending my campaign for\u00a0president,\u201d Warren told reporters. She continued: \u201cI say this with a deep sense of\u00a0gratitude for every single\u00a0person who got in this fight,\u00a0every single person who tried\u00a0out a new idea, every single\u00a0person who just moved a little\u00a0in their notion of what a\u00a0President of the United States\u00a0should look like.\u201d The senator said while she will no longer seek the Democratic nomination, \u201cI\u00a0guarantee I will stay in the\u00a0fight for the hardworking folks\u00a0across the country who have\u00a0gotten the short end of the\u00a0stick over and over.\u201d Warren said she was not going to make an announcement about endorsing another candidate for president on Thursday. \u201cI need some space around this,\u201d Warren said, \u201cand I want to take a little time\u00a0to think a little more.\u201d Warren\u2019s path to the nomination has been narrowing since the first round of voting in Iowa, where she placed third. In subsequent contests in New Hampshire and Nevada, she dropped down to fourth. In South Carolina, she came in a distant fifth. The New York Times first reported that Warren is exiting the race. In photos: Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren Despite the mounting setbacks, Warren\u2019s campaign was as recently as Sunday touting a plan to amass delegates through the late spring and make a play for the nomination, as a unity candidate, during the Democratic National Convention this summer. But those hopes were effectively dashed on Super Tuesday, when she failed to win her home state of Massachusetts, finishing third behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, and mostly underperformed in a series of key states. Her exit officially leaves Biden and Sanders as the final top contenders for the Democratic nomination. Her departure follows those of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the latter of whom finished ahead of Warren in each of the four early state contests. Their rush to Biden, and the moderate consolidation that followed, combined with Sanders\u2019 lock on progressive voters left Warren in a political no-man\u2019s land. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg exited the race on Wednesday. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Both Klobuchar and Buttigieg endorsed Biden on Monday. Warren, a respected progressive leader who has been fiercely critical of the former vice president and, at least until the current campaign heated up, a friend and ally of Sanders, has not yet indicated who she will support moving forward. Sanders said he spoke to Warren on Wednesday, but did not share any details from their conversation. Once considered a leading contender for the nomination, Warren\u2019s plummet began months before the first ballots were cast in what was a crowded primary field that saw multiple candidates shoot up in the polls before being batted down by their rivals. Of those who dropped out of the race before her, she was endorsed only by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. He threw his support to Warren in early January, about a month before Iowa, but despite his passionate advocacy, failed to arrest her slide. Warren was, at first, tripped up by the controversy surrounding her decision to publicize a DNA test meant to prove her Native American ancestry. She apologized to Native American leaders for both the DNA test and her controversial past claims. She swore off big donors and began a trail tradition that became one her trademarks: a \u201cselfie\u201d line that followed her events and allowed voters to share a brief but intimate moment with the candidate Warren touted her grassroots fundraising efforts by posting clips online of her calls to small dollar contributors and began doing a \u201cpinkie promise\u201d with some of her youngest female supporters, \u201cso that they\u2019ll remember that running for president is what girls do.\u201d Her campaign really took off in the spring and summer 2019 as she rolled out a comprehensive suite of what would eventually add up to more than 70 policy plans, addressing everything from anti-corruption legislation to the Green New Deal. By the fall, she was leading in a number of early state polls and appeared to have gained a foothold with liberal voters around the country. They embraced her as the candidate with \u201ca plan for that\u201d \u2013 an identity the campaign embraced and ran with \u2013 and, in some progressive circles, was viewed as the more electable option over fellow favorite Sanders. But her standing began to slip in the fall, when her support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the universal, government-run medical insurance program, came under stricter scrutiny from moderate rivals like Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg. In response, she released a pair of proposals: one to finance Medicare for All without raising any taxes on middle class voters and another that would have effectively broken up the bill into two pieces. Warren\u2019s attempts to quiet the critics backfired. Opponents of Medicare for All, boosted by an industry spending campaign designed to drive down its popularity, continued their attacks. Progressives, too, became dissatisfied, voicing concerns over the senator\u2019s commitment to passing the legislation. By the Iowa caucuses, Warren had fallen behind Sanders and had begun to see a sizable number of her more moderate supporters flock to Buttigieg, who, despite their political differences, also appealed to more affluent, white college-educated voters. But the crushing blow likely came later, in South Carolina, where she finished a distant fifth. Throughout the campaign, Warren kept up a concerted effort to directly address the African-American community. Her targeted plans-within-plans sought to combat economic and social inequality with proposals that acknowledged and offered policy solutions that she argued would begin to undo generations of systemic discrimination in everything from housing to health and business. But when the contest arrived in down South, her attempts to make inroads into the community fell flat. Despite those setbacks, the campaign continued to argue that Warren was the only candidate who could bridge the Democratic Party\u2019s divisions \u2013 a progressive with the credentials and charisma to win over voters across the ideological spectrum. By February, though, the campaign \u2013 which had spent its dollars in anticipation of a long nomination fight \u2013 was in a cash crunch. She got a fundraising boost after a lauded debate performance in Las Vegas, where she targeted Bloomberg over the billionaire\u2019s past treatment of women at his company and his support for \u201cstop and frisk\u201d during his time as mayor of New York City. But because of high early voting in Nevada, which happened before the debate, the bump that followed didn\u2019t translate into a surge of support in the state\u2019s caucuses days later. In the final weeks of her campaign, Warren also relented on her long-standing refusal to accept the support of a super PAC, which ended up spending heavily \u2013 in excess of $13 million during its brief run \u2013 across the Super Tuesday map, arguing that she would not unilaterally disarm in an increasing expensive campaign. As her prospects dwindled, Warren increasingly turned her fire on Sanders, arguing that, for all their policy agreements, he was \u2013 unlike her \u2013 an ineffectual legislator with a short resume of accomplishments during three decades in Congress. The turn began to upset some progressives who worried that her criticism would damage the Vermont senator at a time when moderates were coalescing around Biden. But there is no clear sign that Warren\u2019s departure, without a vocal endorsement and energetic campaigning on his behalf, will benefit Sanders. Her coalition of support was ultimately too thin to vault her into the upper tier of the primary, but its ideological diversity likely means that it will splinter among the remaining candidates. This story has been updated with additional reporting from Warren\u2019s staff call and with reporting from her news conference.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden Saturday surged to a strong victory in the South Carolina primary, revitalizing a stalled presidential bid and establishing himself as the main moderate rival to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination. The 77-year-old Biden notched his first-ever nominating contest win, more than three decades after he launched the first of his three campaigns for the White House. Biden drank the moment in as he took the stage in Columbia, South Carolina, to make victory remarks. He looked forward to the Super Tuesday states and the upcoming race against Sanders, alluding to the Vermonter\u2019s history as an independent. \u201cIf Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the NRA and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd if the Democrats want a nominee who\u2019s a Democrat. A lifelong Democrat. A proud Democrat. An Obama-Biden Democrat, then join us.\u201d The question now is whether Biden can use South Carolina as a launchpad, two days ahead of this week\u2019s Super Tuesday contests in 15 states and territories in which Sanders, who finished in second, is hoping to build up an unassailable lead in the delegate count. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for all 2020 news The contest took place in a charged political atmosphere as Democrats assail President Donald Trump over his handling of the growing coronavirus crisis, as the stock market tumbles and fears of recession threaten to reshape the 2020 battlefield. It also marked the end of the road for businessman Tom Steyer, who sunk more than $20 million into South Carolina and appeared headed for a distant third place finish in the race. After anemic performances in the first three nominating clashes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Biden bet everything on the Palmetto State and its diverse, more moderate electorate. A loss would likely have meant a humiliating end to a half-century-long presidential career, but his win will unleash a comeback narrative. Biden is likely to walk away with the lion\u2019s share of 54 pledged delegates on offer on Saturday \u2014 which represent more than half of the 101 delegates previously doled out in the contest. Going into Saturday, Sanders led the delegate count, with Buttigieg, Biden, Warren and Klobuchar following. Biden\u2019s win quickly shot him into second place after 14, just a portion, of South Carolina\u2019s delegates were projected. A total of 1,991 pledged delegates are needed to win the nomination at the first convention ballot. He can now make the case that he is the only candidate who can inspire one of the most critical slices of the Democratic electorate \u2013 African American voters. And the win raises new questions about Sanders\u2019 claim to have broadened his demographic appeal following his failed 2016 campaign. Minority voters \u2013 especially in cities like Cleveland, Philadelphia, Charlotte, Atlanta and Detroit \u2013 are critical to Democratic hopes of winning back swing states that Trump claimed in 2016 and putting new battlegrounds on the map. Exit polls suggest that the South Carolina electorate was far more moderate and African American than the states in which Sanders has prospered. The former vice president\u2019s securing of last-minute endorsement of the state\u2019s political icon Rep. James Clyburn last week also appears to have been crucial. On stage in Columbia, Biden paid tribute to that endorsement. \u201cMy buddy Jim Clyburn, you brought me back,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s win was built on a base rooted in black voters, those over the age of 65 and moderates, according to preliminary results. Biden won around 3 in 5 black voters, dominating over Sanders, his closest competitor who got almost 1 in 5 of the group. Steyer came close to Sanders, with around 1 in 7 black voters. Almost 3 in 5 voters over the age of 65 supported Biden in his run in South Carolina, followed by Steyer and Sanders with slightly more than 1 in 10. Biden led among moderate voters with more than half of the group supporting him. However, Biden also won over voters who consider themselves very liberal, with around 2 in 5 of the group, surpassing Sanders with 3 in 10. Warren followed Sanders with around 1 in 7 very liberal voters. The former Delaware senator\u2019s big win in South Carolina also poses a challenge to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who jumped into the race in the belief that Biden was a weak candidate. Undecided voter asks Biden 'what is your fire?' Bloomberg has splashed half a billion dollars on the race so far. Some party moderates fear he could siphon centrist votes away from Biden and open the door for Sanders. Biden\u2019s victory represents the most significant triumph yet in a long political career that spanned highs \u2014 including his two wins on a ticket with President Barack Obama \u2014 and devastating personal losses, as he buried a wife and two of his children. Saturday\u2019s result will underscore Biden\u2019s resilience after an uninspiring campaign that has included a string of sub-par debate performances, but that has also opened a window into the former vice president\u2019s humanity in interactions with voters who, like him, have suffered aching personal bereavements. \u201cAll of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind \u2013 this is your campaign,\u201d Biden said to raucous cheers in Columbia. \u201cWe are very much alive.\u201d Still, the former vice president may still have his work cut out in overhauling Sanders. While South Carolina may provide a preview of the several state contests on Tuesday, Alabama and North Carolina for instance, Sanders is favored in delegate-rich states like Texas and California. The former vice president\u2019s victory will also spark intensifying questions about the viability of other candidates competing with him for the moderate lane in the Democratic primary. That includes Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both candidates have failed to capitalize on encouraging performances earlier in the race. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren may also emerge from Super Tuesday primaries with no clear path to the nomination \u2014 given that Sanders is beating her among the most progressive voters. Both Klobuchar and Warren are in danger of losing their home states to Sanders, who hopes to ride his coalition of young, liberal voters to multiple victories on Tuesday night. The Vermont senator has also made inroads with Hispanic voters over the last four years, as evidenced by his win in Nevada. Sanders has insisted that he should emerge as the nominee if he wins a plurality of the votes. But other candidates have not ruled out an effort to thwart him at the convention in July. Some party leaders are worried that Sanders and his \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d is too extreme to win a general election. But depriving him of the nomination could convince his legions of liberal voters to stay home in November. Biden told reporters Saturday morning he was in good shape in South Carolina, striking a balance between underlining the importance of the race and controlling expectations. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic, I\u2019m optimistic not just about today, I\u2019m optimistic about the whole process from here on out,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cAll I know is I think I\u2019m going to do well here, and I think that\u2019s going to put me in a position to do well in North Carolina and Alabama and other states in the Democratic primary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think I can do well but I don\u2019t think it will even be over after Super Tuesday.\u201d The writing was already on the wall for Sanders in South Carolina. The front-runner was campaigning Saturday in Massachusetts and Virginia, already looking to Super Tuesday. Trump, as is now his habit, flew to South Carolina on Friday night to goad the candidates and to underline his dominance in the state. He urged his supporters to vote for Sanders in the state\u2019s open primary. The President wants to create as much chaos in the Democratic race as possible and his campaign team sees Sanders as their preferred opponent in November. Here's how GOP is using 'Operation Chaos' to boost Sanders Trump accused Democrats of seizing on the coronavirus, as examples of community transmission start to be discovered in the United States, as their latest \u201choax\u201d to damage him. A picture of the President, alongside the state\u2019s two Republican senators, covered most of the front page of the \u201cThe State\u201d newspaper Saturday, overshadowing they Democratic race.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders, the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was asked over the weekend how much his various plans would cost if implemented. He didn\u2019t know. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Here\u2019s the exchange between Sanders and Anderson Cooper on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d: Cooper: Do you know how all \u2013 how much though? I mean, do you have a price tag for \u2013 for all of this? Sanders: We do. I mean, you know, and \u2013 and\u2013 the price tag is \u2013 it will be substantially less than letting the current system go. I think it\u2019s about $30 trillion. Cooper: That\u2019s just for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d you\u2019re talking about? Sanders: That\u2019s just \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d yes. Cooper: Do you have \u2013 a price tag for all of these things? Sanders: No, I don\u2019t. We try to \u2013 no, you mentioned making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling all student debt, that\u2019s correct. That\u2019s what I want to do. We pay for that through a modest tax on Wall Street speculation. Cooper: But you say you don\u2019t know what the total price is, but you know how it\u2019s gonna be paid for. How do you know it\u2019s gonna be paid for if you don\u2019t know how much the price is? Sanders: Well, I can\u2019t \u2013 you know, I can\u2019t rattle off to you every nickel and every dime. But we have accounted for \u2013 you \u2013 you talked about \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d We have options out there that will pay for it. What? So, Sanders not only a) isn\u2019t sure how much all of his proposals would cost but also b) isn\u2019t able to say how he would pay for these programs. That strikes me as a potential weak spot if/when Sanders winds up as the Democratic nominee against President Donald Trump. Which is the point that former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign immediately sought to make. \u201cFor the second time in the last month, Senator Sanders has admitted that he does not know the astronomical price tag that his massive new programs would force onto American families,\u201d said Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. \u201cThat\u2019s untenable.\u201d And in a weekend memo from the Democratic centrist group Third Way warning the party of the perils of nominating Sanders, authors Jonathan Cowan and Matt Bennett write: \u201cExperts estimate that Sanders\u2019 major proposals would cost a staggering $60 trillion and would double the size of the government (while his tax plans fall $27 trillion short of paying for it). There\u2019s a reason that, when pressed on the cost of his plans, Sanders simply refuses to answer, saying he actually has no idea and \u2018no one does.\u2019\u201d That $60 trillion number comes from The Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein, a CNN contributor, who broke down the costs of Sanders\u2019 proposals like \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and free tuition at public colleges and arrived at that stunning price tag. Just how big a number is that? This, from Brownstein, puts the $60 trillion in spending proposals in very clear context: \u201cThe Vermont independent\u2019s agenda represents an expansion of government\u2019s cost and size unprecedented since World War II, according to estimates from his own website and projections by a wide variety of fiscal experts. \u201cSanders\u2019 plan, though all of its costs cannot be precisely quantified, would increase government spending as a share of the economy far more than the New Deal under President Franklin Roosevelt, the Great Society under Lyndon Johnson or the agenda proposed by any recent Democratic presidential nominee, including liberal George McGovern in 1972, according to a historical analysis shared with CNN by Larry Summers, the former chief White House economic adviser for Barack Obama and treasury secretary for Bill Clinton.\u201d Now consider that there is no estimate from any credible budgeting service that suggests that the government would be able to bring in the sort of revenue needed to pay for that spending surge over the next decade. Sanders\u2019 plan to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations would close some of that gap, but a study from a fellow at the Manhattan Institute (a conservative think tank) cited by Brownstein suggests the top end of revenue from the Sanders\u2019 tax increases is $23 trillion. Sanders doesn\u2019t talk much about the price tag of what he\u2019s proposing or the very real likelihood that his tax plan will not be enough to fill the spending gap he would create. Which makes sense \u2013 because, politically speaking, the idea of raising taxes on what we broadly consider the middle class isn\u2019t terribly popular among, well, the middle class. (Raising taxes on the wealthy or corporations, on the other hand, is a stone-cold winner politically.) But Sanders once did admit the harsh reality of how his plans would be paid for during a debate over the summer. Here\u2019s the exchange between Sanders and NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie (bolding is mine): Guthrie: Will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration? Sanders: People who have health care under \u201cMedicare for All\u201d will have no premiums, no deductibles, no copayments, no out of pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care for what they get. So, here\u2019s what we now know about Sanders\u2019 plans for America: 1) He isn\u2019t sure how much they will cost. 2) He isn\u2019t totally sure how he will pay for them. 3) It\u2019s likely they will be paid for by an increase in taxes on the middle class. Whoo boy. Maybe Sanders is right that America is ready for a fundamental reorienting of how we value ourselves, our society and our money. But if he\u2019s not \u2013 and this election winds up being like virtually every other election in which people vote on who is going to let them keep more of their money \u2013 then Sanders (and Democrats by extension) have a big problem.",

            "article_content": "The walls are closing in on Elizabeth Warren. After a devastating fourth place finish in New Hampshire Tuesday night, the Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s path to her party\u2019s nomination for president has drastically narrowed. It is a bleak new political reality for the senator, who was topping national and early state polls as recently as a handful of months ago, and at her peak, seemed to have unstoppable momentum. Instead, the first two Democratic contests in Iowa and New Hampshire showed that progressives are coalescing around Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won New Hampshire and came in a close second place in Iowa behind former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. To add insult to injury: Warren\u2019s Senate colleague, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, rode a late surge into a surprising third-place finish Tuesday night with more than double Warren\u2019s vote share. The pair of disappointing finishes leaves Warren treading water in a muddled race, with the Nevada caucuses \u2013 a contest where her campaign had long hoped her populist message would resonate \u2013 just 10 days away. Only a fraction of the delegates that will decide the Democratic primary have been awarded, but no candidate in modern political history has overcome such dire finishes in the first two contests. Warren\u2019s publicly stated plan for now? Run a marathon. Her campaign insists they have every intention of sticking it out through the Super Tuesday contests in early March, pointing to the vast majority of the delegates that are still up for grabs and touting their large organization and investments across the country \u2013 a tenuous strategy that could become unfeasible if her fundraising dries up. The candidate and her advisers have also shown no indication that they plan to make substantive changes to Warren\u2019s anti-corruption, \u201cbig structural change\u201d message \u2013 a message that made Warren a progressive icon long before she decided to run for president, but ultimately wasn\u2019t enough to win over voters in Iowa and New Hampshire most preoccupied with defeating President Donald Trump in November. Unlike former Vice President Joe Biden, who left New Hampshire for South Carolina before the final results were in, Warren stuck around on Tuesday night long enough to address supporters at her election night party in Manchester. She also stayed for one more photo line with supporters \u2013 a signature facet of her campaign. In a speech that began and ended before the state was officially called for Sanders, Warren offered an unusually stark assessment of the race. \u201cThe fight between factions in our party has taken a sharp turn in recent weeks, with ads mocking other candidates and with supporters of some candidates shouting curses about other Democratic campaigns,\u201d Warren said in Manchester. \u201cThese harsh tactics might work if you\u2019re willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing. They might work if you don\u2019t worry about leaving our party and our politics worse off than how you found it.\u201d For Warren, the solution was simple: Come together and win. If Democrats \u201cfall into factions,\u201d she warned, they will \u201csquander\u201d their opportunity to unseat Trump in the fall. It was a message Warren has been pushing in earnest for weeks, centered around the importance of party unity to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. But her words on Tuesday clashed with the tone of a pointed new memo released hours earlier by her campaign manager, Roger Lau, which included a section he described as a \u201csober look\u201d at her competitors\u2019 prospects. Sanders, he argued, \u201cstarts with a ceiling that\u2019s significantly lower than the support he had four years ago\u201d and \u201chasn\u2019t yet faced the scrutiny of his record that will surely come with any further rise\u201d; Biden is now \u201cnow polling under 30% even among older voters and African-American voters\u201d; Buttigieg has trouble up ahead in \u201cstates with more diverse electorates\u201d; and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, despite \u201cgetting a well-deserved look from voters for the first time,\u201d lacks the \u2018infrastructure\u2019 to sustain her in a long race.\u201d From there, Lau dug into the campaign\u2019s plan to accumulate delegates across the map and, by his estimation, eventually end up in a three-way race with Sanders and Biden, the only early favorite she has finished ahead of in the first two contests. \u201cIt\u2019s not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map, and the process won\u2019t be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines,\u201d Lau wrote, jabbing the media\u2019s coverage of the early state contests. \u201cThat\u2019s never been our focus \u2013 our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere.\u201d But the campaign did not win any delegates in New Hampshire, where Warren fell short of the 15% threshold. And it left Iowa with only 8. The writing had been on the wall for weeks, if not months. Lau, in a separate memo last month, emphasized the importance of the post-February states. By then, public polls had already made it clear that Iowa and New Hampshire were starting to look tough for Warren. \u201cWe expect this to be a long nomination fight,\u201d he said, \u201cand have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins.\u201d Warren had been riding high throughout the summer, rising to become the leader in Iowa by September. But that surge made her the top target of more moderate contenders, who sought to portray her plans as unrealistic in an effort to stoke voters\u2019 doubts about her candidacy. She never quite seemed to regain her footing. During a mid-October debate in Westerville, Ohio, Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar used Sanders\u2019 frankness about the fact that taxes would go up for middle class under his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, which Warren had embraced, as a cudgel against the Massachusetts senator, who kept insisting \u2013 without fully explaining how \u2013 she would not do the same. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d Buttigieg, who was then locked in a battle with Warren for college-educated voters, also pounced \u2013 attempting to portray her as a shifty creature of Washington. \u201cThis is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular,\u201d Buttigieg said, noting Warren\u2019s refusal to give a straight \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to the tax question. \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2013 except this,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cNo plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion hole in this Medicare-for-All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d With the pile-on mounting, Warren made a fateful decision. Less than a week after the debate, on October 20, Warren announced that she would release a financing blueprint of her own. A day later, as she tried to keep the focus on an unrelated education plan, reporters at an event in Iowa fired off questions about the structure and timing of the forthcoming plan. Visibly exasperated, she asked repeatedly if anyone wanted to discuss her education rollout, before ultimately addressing the issue that was dominating the headlines. Warren would, over the coming weeks, release two plans \u2013 one to pay for Medicare for All that included no hike in middle class taxes, and another that marked a firmer break with Sanders. Instead of pushing the legislation written by the Vermont senator \u2013 which she had cosponsored on Capitol Hill \u2013 she decided to effectively break it in half, with a promise to massively expand public health insurance during her first days in office, then push to pass the bill in its entirety by her third year in office. The shift angered some progressives, who believed she was backing off her position, and emboldened moderates, who continued to rail against the program\u2019s cost and question whether it was a promise anyone could deliver on in a divided Congress. Warren\u2019s standing on the left was further complicated when CNN broke the news before January\u2019s debate in Iowa that, in a private meeting more than a year earlier, Sanders had, according to Warren, said that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency. Sanders denied making the claim. Warren insisted he did. Progressives groups panicked and, onstage after the debate, Warren accused Sanders of calling her \u201ca liar on national TV.\u201d \u201cYou know, let\u2019s not do it right now. If you want to have that discussion, we\u2019ll have that discussion,\u201d Sanders said in an exchange captured by studio microphones. \u201cYou called me a liar,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cYou told me \u2013 all right, let\u2019s not do it now.\u201d Both campaigns sought to turn down the heat in the days after and, during an event in South Carolina to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., marched together, arm-in-arm. They have been going in separate directions ever since. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "As Democrats push forward in the fight for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, one issue is at the top of voters\u2019 minds: Health care. Both the New Hampshire primary exit polls on Tuesday and the Iowa caucus entrance polls last week showed that health care has been a key priority. But these voters remain divided over what the future of health care should be \u2013 shifting to a government-run Medicare-for-All-style system or shoring up the current programs, primarily Obamacare. That split is a key reason the party is fracturing over the question of who should be the Democratic nominee against President Donald Trump, who continues to undermine the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. More than one-third of Democratic voters going to the polls in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote, beating out climate change, income equality and foreign policy. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the clear favorite among this group, drawing support from about one-third of voters, according to exit polls. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar each attracted about 1 in 5 of these voters, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits. Six in 10 voters supported a single-payer system \u2013 with Sanders attracting close to 40% of those voters and Buttigieg attracting more than 2 in 10. Among those who oppose single-payer, more than 3 in 10 backed Buttigieg and more than a quarter voted for Klobuchar. Biden received 13% of the vote, while Sanders and Warren were in the single digits. The Granite State vote came a week after Iowa caucusgoers affirmed that health care was the most important issue for choosing a nominee. But the 42% of respondents who picked health care in Iowa were split between Sanders and Buttigieg, with about a quarter supporting each. Almost 2 in 5 supported Warren while 1 in 6 backed Biden and the same for Klobuchar. Almost 3 in 5 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers supported replacing private health insurance with a government plan, with the rest opposing it. Health care has been at the forefront of the campaign since the beginning, but the party is split between radically overhauling the nation\u2019s health insurance system or taking smaller steps. Sanders, an independent, has led the fight to create a national, single-payer government plan, called \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d It would essentially replace private insurance, providing sweeping benefits at no cost to patients. But its price tag \u2013 estimated at around $32 trillion over 10 years \u2013 has spooked many people, providing a line of attack by rivals Biden and Buttigieg. While Sanders has acknowledged he\u2019d have to raise taxes on the middle class, he hasn\u2019t laid out specifically how he would cover the tab. Providing a detailed financing plan for Medicare for All may have contributed to the decline of Warren\u2019s popularity. Her poll numbers took a nose dive after she laid out a proposal in November that called for states, employers, corporations and the wealthy to pay for the single-payer system, which she also supports. Meanwhile, moderates such as Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar favor building on the Affordable Care Act. They would add to the Obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. They would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage. Looking ahead, the candidates are entering very different terrain. The next stop is Nevada, which has a large unionized casino industry. Sanders and Warren have had some trouble garnering support from certain unions, who typically fight hard for premium health benefits. They aren\u2019t as eager to give them up in exchange for a government plan, even though the senators have said they\u2019d press employers to give workers higher wages in exchange. The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers and has a long history fighting for their health care, is circulating fliers that warn against supporting Sanders and Warren, saying they will end or replace Culinary Healthcare, while the other candidates will \u201cprotect\u201d it. Biden, in particular, has hit Sanders on the impact of Medicare for All on union plans. While the path ahead for the Democratic candidates remains in flux, there\u2019s one party leader who is maintaining a steady course ahead of the November election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is setting up her lawmakers as protectors of the Affordable Care Act and of people with pre-existing conditions, following the program laid out in 2018, when Democrats\u2019 defense of the law helped them take back control of the House amid Republican efforts to repeal it. The House has since joined a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general who are defending the landmark health reform law in a lawsuit filed by a group of Republican state attorneys general and backed by Trump\u2019s Justice Department. Pelosi also spearheaded legislation that aims to lower drug costs by letting the federal government negotiate prices of certain medications with manufacturers. The bill is not expected to advance through the Senate.",

            "article_content": "Democratic voters turning out for Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary say they are looking for a candidate who can beat President Donald Trump over one who agrees with them on the issues by a roughly 2-to-1 margin, according to early exit polls conducted for CNN. Six in 10 Democratic voters in New Hampshire prioritize a nominee who can beat Trump. Yet Democrats seem split over what qualities a candidate ought to have. Just over a third say that they sought a candidate who could bring needed change, while about the same amount said they were seeking one who could unite the country. Far fewer prioritized finding a candidate who cares about people like them, and the share who said they were looking for a fighter landed in single digits. View CNN\u2019s live coverage of the New Hampshire primary Almost 2 in 5 New Hampshire Democratic voters who prefer a nominee who can bring about needed change voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, far more than any other candidate. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Sanders lead among those who prioritize a candidate who can unite the country, with each drawing around 3 in 10 voters in that group. Among voters who prefer a nominee who can beat Trump in November over someone who they agree with on the issues, over a quarter voted for former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, 1 in 5 for Klobuchar, 1 in 5 for Sanders, 1 in 7 for former Vice President Joe Biden, and around 1 in 10 for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Still, more than 8 in 10 who voted today say they plan to vote for the Democratic nominee in November regardless of who it is, while just 1 in 8 say they won\u2019t. Sanders leads among New Hampshire voters who consider themselves \u201cvery liberal\u201d in ideology, with around half of the group voting for him. Warren follows with fewer than 1 in 5 of this group, and Buttigieg at 1 in 7. But the balance of the electorate has shifted since 2016. In 2020, \u201cvery liberal\u201d voters made up about 1 in 5 voters, down from 26% in 2016. Moderate voters were up to just over a third in 2020, from 27% in 2016. Klobuchar and Buttigieg lead among moderate Democrats, around 3 in 10 for Klobuchar and a quarter for Sanders, still a close race. Less than 1 in 5 in that group voted for Sanders and 1 in 10 voted for Biden. Klobuchar drew around a third of white college-educated women, followed by over 1 in 5 for Buttigieg, and slightly less for Sanders. White women without degrees were split between Buttigieg and Sanders. For white men, those without college degrees strongly supported Sanders (over a third), while around a quarter of those with degrees supported him, followed by Klobuchar and Buttigieg. Eight in 10 New Hampshire Democratic primary voters are angry at the Trump administration, the highest share of voters from the non-incumbent party who are angry stretching back to 2000, according to CNN exit polls. Six in 10 Republican primary voters were angry at the Obama administration in 2016, and 40% were angry in 2012. Meanwhile, 62% of Democratic primary voters were angry at the Bush administration in 2008, and 46% were angry in 2004. Almost 6 in 10 of Tuesday\u2019s voters say that impeachment hasn\u2019t made any difference to Trump\u2019s reelection chances, while one in five say it has hurt him and fewer say it has helped. About 6 in 10 who turned out to vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary say they made up their minds since the beginning of February, including nearly half who say they decided on their candidate just in the last few days. That\u2019s double the 25% who decided in the final few days in 2016, and, in early data, the highest in exit polling back to 2000. About half overall say the most recent debate \u2013 held in New Hampshire on Friday night \u2013 was an important factor in deciding their vote for president. And early exits indicate that only about 1 in 8 are first-time Democratic primary voters, down slightly from 16% in 2016 and 19% in 2008. Turnout was expected to be high heading into the primary. According to the most recent CNN tracking poll conducted by University of New Hampshire, 74% of adults in New Hampshire said they were extremely or very interested in the 2020 primary election and a similar three-quarters said they would definitely vote. The eventual Democratic nominee for president has taken first or second place in the New Hampshire primary in every race since 1968. More than one-third of Democratic voters going to the polls in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote. Sanders was the clear favorite among this group, garnering support from more than three in 10. Buttigieg and Klobuchar each attracted 1 in 5 of these voters, while Biden was the pick of 1 in 10. Warren, who has also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits among this group. Just under two-thirds of voters supported a single-payer system \u2013 with Sanders attracting more than one-third of those voters and Buttigieg nearly a quarter. Climate change followed, with about 3 in 10 naming it their top concern. About 2 in 10 rated income inequality as tops and 1 in 10 named foreign policy. The early exit polls also indicate majorities of Democratic primary voters turning out today support more liberal policy positions designed to address both health care and income inequality. Support for a Medicare-for-All-style health care plan, where a single government plan provides coverage for all Americans and replaces the current system of private health insurance, has divided the top candidates in the race for much of the campaign. But almost 6 in 10 New Hampshire Democratic primary voters today said they would support such a government plan, 4 in 10 were opposed. About two-thirds said they would be in favor of making tuition free at public colleges and universities, a plan that has likewise divided the top candidates. Several residents who voted in Manchester told CNN that health care was their top priority and influenced their vote. Moe Abdel, a 24-year-old pharmacist, said he supports \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d \u201cI see firsthand a lot of people who struggle to pay for their prescription drugs, especially older people on fixed incomes,\u2019 said Abdel, who declined to specify whom he voted for. Health care also emerged as the most important issue for choosing a nominee among Iowa Democratic caucusgoers earlier this month, according to the entrance polls conducted there. Two in five Iowa caucus participants chose health care, and about 1 in 5 said climate change, while fewer chose foreign policy or income inequality. Health care has been at the forefront of the campaign since the beginning, but the party is split between radically overhauling the nation\u2019s health insurance system or taking smaller steps. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, has led the fight to create Medicare for All. It would essentially replace private insurance, providing sweeping benefits at no cost to patients. But its price tag \u2013 estimated at around $32 trillion over 10 years \u2013 has spooked many people, providing a line of attack by rivals former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. While Sanders has acknowledged he\u2019d have to raise taxes on the middle class, he hasn\u2019t laid out specifically how he would cover the tab. Providing a detailed financing plan for Medicare for All may have contributed to the decline of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s popularity. Her poll numbers took a nose dive after she laid out a proposal in November that called for states, employers, corporations and the wealthy to pay for the single-payer system, which she also supports. Meanwhile, moderates such as Biden, Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar favor building on the Affordable Care Act. They would add to the Obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. They would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage. The CNN Exit Poll was conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool. Results are based on interviews conducted throughout the day with 1,947 randomly selected Democratic primary voters at 45 wards in New Hampshire. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Athena Jones and Laura Dolan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump just can\u2019t keep out of the Democratic presidential race. Every time they have a nominating contest \u2013 for instance, Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary \u2013 he shows up in Air Force One to loom over their party. When there\u2019s a debate, no one can stop talking about the commander-in-chief. His intervention in the race to dig dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden has already earned him the infamy of impeachment. And just as the Democratic race heats up, the President is suddenly beginning to look like a formidable opponent after three years of weak polling that suggested in might be an easy target. He skated free from his Senate trial last week with his party \u2013 minus Mitt Romney \u2013 in lock step marching toward battle in November. And a low turnout last week in Iowa is worrying Democratic Party leaders who had made assumptions on massive enthusiasm among liberal voters desperate to deprive the President of a second term. Trump\u2019s headline grabbing all-time Gallup poll approval rating high of 49% has injected a note of urgency into calls for the Democratic Party to unite behind a candidate \u2013 a seemingly distant scenario. Most fundamentally, Trump is provoking the question defining the 2020 race: Can any Democratic candidate tame Trump\u2019s fury in November? This is not a President riding a strong economy and a Rose Garden strategy to reelection. Trump keeps getting in the Democrats\u2019 faces, and flew to New Hampshire on Monday in a show of strength before the Granite State\u2019s primary. During the rally, Trump suggested his supporters vote in the Democratic primary the next day. \u201cI hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats,\u201d he said. New Hampshire law allows independent voters to pick which primary they will vote in. Voters who register as Republicans or Democrats must vote in their party\u2019s primary. The President\u2019s comments represent more than an in-person version of the Twitter trolling to which he resorts when one Democratic candidate seems to build a bit of steam. His event, highlighting a larger crowd than most Democrats managed in the state, underlined potency in an important swing state albeit one with four electoral votes. It mirrored a stop in Iowa, three days before last week\u2019s caucuses, and another show of force when the President blitzed the Hawkeye State with family members and political allies. None of this suggests the President is in trouble in the GOP primary. It\u2019s a way of stealing Democratic media coverage and inflaming his own political base in key states. Such tactics reveal a big difference between Trump\u2019s seat of the pants effort in 2016 \u2013 more of a lark than a traditional campaign and the sophisticated political machine he\u2019s bought with millions of fundraising dollars this time. The President stood at 50% approval in New Hampshire in January, according to polling by CNN and the University of New Hampshire, after languishing in the mid-to-low 40s for most of 2019. Trump\u2019s prospects suddenly look brighter than for months, since for most of the campaign, match-up polls have suggested that almost every Democrat would beat the President. But the imprecision of such surveys months from a general election matchup and Trump\u2019s formidable standing among his own base voters means that Democrats would be wise not to underestimate the President \u2013 even if he has never yet cracked 50% in a job approval poll during his three years in office. Trump weaponizes the Presidency after impeachment victory Biden returned to the core theme of his campaign on Monday \u2013 that he is the Trump destroyer \u2013 after a weekend trying to revive his flagging fortunes by attacking Pete Buttigieg over his limited experience as a mayor. \u201cFolks, you know, you might\u2019ve heard, Trump is coming to New Hampshire today,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s coming in person. You know, that\u2019s how interested he is in the Democratic primary I guess,\u201d Biden said, before lashing the President over \u201cHobbesian\u201d choice economic policies that he said meant that the middle class get \u201cclobbered.\u201d Biden\u2019s case is however being challenged by his own halting performance so far in the Democratic race, posing the question that if he can\u2019t beat his fellow party hopefuls, how will he fare against a political street fighter like the President? Trump couldn\u2019t resist a dig at the former vice president\u2019s underwhelming primary run last week. \u201cIt\u2019s also very sad how he\u2019s doing \u2013 how he\u2019s doing in the polls,\u201d Trump told reporters. The Democratic race has included some of the most detailed debates about policy \u2013 especially on health care \u2013 of a Trumpian age when outrage has more often driven politics. Yet the President\u2019s looming presence has sometimes seemed to distort the Democratic race, just as it has many other aspects of political and national life. Daniel Guild, a Democratic activist from New Hampshire who is voting for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, said some voters were choosing a candidate based on their perception of the President. \u201cA lot of people have personal reactions to Donald Trump,\u201d he said, adding that voters who decry chaos might look for normality in a candidate like Biden or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Others might seek to flush away Trump\u2019s untruths with a candidate who shown consistency in his principles for decades, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cSome people are looking for intelligence. I think that\u2019s why Pete Buttigieg has done well over the last two months,\u201d Guild told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan. \u201cAgain, this all goes back to my own personal opinion (about) how we react differently to Donald Trump.\u201d Each Democratic candidate has their own narrative about why they are uniquely well placed to tackle the President in November. Sanders is pushing back on the warnings that his \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d would be a gift for the President by arguing that he\u2019s the only candidate with the  grass roots movement and low-dollar fundraising stream needed for victory. \u201cDonald Trump says that he would love to run against Bernie Sanders. Well, maybe not. Donald Trump lies a whole lot of the time and in fact, what I have read is some of his advisers tell him that I will be the toughest candidate for him to run against,\u201d Sanders said at a \u201cPolitics and Eggs\u201d breakfast in New Hampshire last week. Democratic candidates face critical test in New Hampshire after Iowa fiasco Warren says that her history of taking on difficult causes is proof that she is the best fit for an hour in which Democrats are suddenly realizing Trump might be a tough opponent. \u201cPeople are saying they\u2019re worried that we may not be able to win the fight against Donald Trump,\u201d the Massachusetts senator said on Sunday. \u201cMy view is, I\u2019ve been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life.\u201d Klobuchar is leaning into the argument that Sanders is too left-wing to win the support of critical center ground voters. \u201cTruthfully, Donald Trump\u2019s worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle,\u201d Klobuchar said at Friday\u2019s Democratic debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. \u201cThe people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me.\u201d Buttigieg says his fresh face is the best way to win and that the choice is about \u201cmaking sure we bring the perspective that will be needed into the Oval Office.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t accept or don\u2019t understand the way that Washington works. But we can\u2019t accept the division and the dysfunction that is going on. And I think our best shot to change it, and by the way our best shot to beat Donald Trump, is a focus on the future,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d The campaign of Mike Bloomberg, who is not competing in the first four nominating contests, seized on a new Quinnipiac University national poll showing the former New York mayor at 15% behind Sanders and Biden as proof of his electability. \u201cMike is the strongest Democrat to go head-to-head against Trump,\u201d campaign spokesperson Galia Slayen said. No doubt the President \u2013 who has always seemed to relish publicity good or bad \u2013 enjoys his notoriety in the Democratic race. His name was mentioned 60 times in the debate. It\u2019s a sign that whoever the Democrats pick to carry their banner, November\u2019s election, like the turmoil of last three years will revolve around one man: Donald Trump.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised middle class Americans fresh tax cuts if he wins a second four-year term in office in November, a pledge that might clash with his efforts to reduce yawning federal deficits. Stephen Moore, an outside adviser who was floated last year for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, told CNN that the administration is \u201choming in\u201d on a proposal that would include lower rates for middle class families. Moore also floated the possibility of a savings account that would allow middle class Americans to save up to $10,000 tax-free. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration \u201cis studying numerous proposals that will benefit the middle class and the American worker and promote long-term economic growth.\u201d But another tax cut by the Trump administration would only further widen the country\u2019s mounting deficit, which surpassed $1 trillion for the calendar year in 2019. It hasn\u2019t crossed that symbolic threshold since 2012 after the Obama administration and Congress approved stimulus funding in order to keep the economy afloat following the financial crisis. The deficit is only expected to expand even further over the coming decade, reaching a total of $1.7 trillion in 2030, according to the latest projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released in late January. The Trump administration\u2019s $4.8 trillion fiscal 2021 federal budget proposal released on Monday projected balancing the federal budget by 2035 based on rosy economic projections of 3% annual growth. Trump didn\u2019t mention tax cuts in his State of the Union address last week or in his latest budget proposal, raising speculation by some analysts that the plan may have fallen from the administration\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe get the sense that still another tax cut, for the middle class, has moved from the front burner to the back burner,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist for AGF Perspectives wrote in a note to clients. Trump pledged a \u201cgiant\u201d middle class tax cut in 2017, but under the final legislation passed that year by the Republican-controlled Congress richer households and corporations got bigger cuts than the average household, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. At this point, tax policy analysts agree on two things: any new plan by the President will be no more than a campaign document heading into 2020 and that Democrats have zero appetite for passing any law to benefit the middle class that would give the President a win before the November election. Here\u2019s a look at what the White House could include in its plan: Many of the sweeping tax changes signed into law by the President in 2017 will expire for individuals and families in 2025. That means policy changes put into place will remain so for the foreseeable future. The downside political risk, however, is that the impact of the benefit wouldn\u2019t be immediate. \u201cTaxpayers also wouldn\u2019t notice any difference right now. They would only notice a difference relative to this hypothetical world in which the tax cuts were allowed to expire,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. The other longer run economic risk, however, is that the country would run even larger deficits then already projected. The Congressional Budget Office recently updated their forecast, predicting that the country would amass trillion-dollar deficits for the next decade, ultimately reaching $1.7 trillion by 2030. One way to help middle class Americans who aren\u2019t paying much income tax to begin with is through tax credits. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no income tax to cut for a lot of households, so the only way to provide even more tax relief is to expand refundable tax credits for those households,\u201d said Pomerleau. The Trump administration could consider expanding refundable credits \u2013 like the child tax credit or the earned income tax credit \u2013  to those particular families. Some Republicans, particularly Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, advocated for expanding the earned income tax credit in the 2017 law, but those changes never made it into the final bill. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said it was a political miscalculation by the Trump administration not to have included it in the law. \u201cThey could have done it and it would have gotten them a lot of credibility,\u201d said Gleckman. \u201cIt would have taken an issue away from Democrats in the upcoming election and they just didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Some analysts expect the Trump administration is probably more likely to boost the child tax credit, which a few Democratic presidential candidates have also been in favor of. But that policy is likely to face some political opposition among certain factions of the Republican party, who believe everyone should pay at least some money to Uncle Sam. Millions of American employees pay 6.2% of their salary in \u201cpayroll taxes,\u201d which chiefly funds social safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare. This past August, Trump suggested that he would consider providing a payroll tax cut for American workers but later waved off plans to do so in the near future. The measure has been previously used by prior administrations during economic downturns. Former President Barack Obama, seeking reelection, signed a law in 2012 extending a payroll tax cut for workers and unemployment benefits as part of the administration\u2019s economic recovery plan following the financial crisis. And former President George W. Bush repeatedly provided a tax credits, deploying rebate checks of up to $600. Another option the administration could revisit is changing the federal government\u2019s tax brackets. The 2017 tax law did eliminate some brackets, and as a result widened some others, but most of those changes impacted the country\u2019s highest income earners. Any new changes could have only limited impact on the middle class, say tax policy analysts. For example, lowering a 24% rate down to 20% would unlikely directly target many middle class families that have a much lower tax liability already. Tax policy analysts also argue the Trump administration could have seized the opportunity two years ago to make further adjustments, but ultimately didn\u2019t making them skeptical whether the White House would turn to it again as a potential tool. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine when it was all free money and they didn\u2019t do it then, they\u2019re going to do it now,\u201d said Gleckman.",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders paced the Democratic presidential field in the Iowa caucuses \u2013 and on Friday night, five of their leading rivals tried to blunt their momentum. The eighth Democratic presidential debate, this one ahead of Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary, turned into a pile-on against the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and the Vermont senator. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the most direct in her challenges. But Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren dinged Buttigieg over his answer on marijuana arrests in South Bend. Former Vice President Joe Biden sharply criticized Sanders\u2019 1990s votes on gun control. Businessman Tom Steyer played his most central role in any debate yet. And entrepreneur Andrew Yang took a shot at Buttigieg. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Here are seven takeaways from the debate: If you didn\u2019t know Buttigieg had the momentum in New Hampshire coming into tonight\u2019s debate, it was clear in the first few minutes. Sanders, Biden, Klobuchar, Steyer and Yang all took swings at him within the first 30 minutes of the debate. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was the target of attacks over his experience, his take on President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial and his lack of much experience in business. Klobuchar, in particular, challenged Buttigieg over his comments dismissive of Washington experience. \u201cWe have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us,\u201d she said at one point. Later, she took a thinly veiled shot at Buttigieg by noting she is \u201cnot a political newcomer with no record.\u201d Still, one of the harshest lines of questioning did not come from a candidate, but from ABC debate moderator Linsey Davis, who challenged Buttigieg on his record in South Bend, especially over arrests for marijuana possession during his tenure as mayor. Buttigieg struggled to defend himself, saying, \u201cSystemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system and my city was not immune.\u201d When Warren was asked if his answer was substantial, she bluntly said, \u201cNo.\u201d These focused attacks on Buttigieg underscored how much of the Democratic field views its top objective as stopping his momentum before New Hampshire\u2019s primary on Tuesday. And the questions about South Bend highlight perhaps the biggest obstacle in his path to the Democratic nomination: his lack of support among voters of color, who make up a large and important bloc of the Democratic primary electorate as the race moves past Iowa and New Hampshire. Iowa didn\u2019t deliver in quite the way Sanders hoped, but he was treated like a front-runner by his rivals on Friday night. Months ago, Biden praised Sanders for his honesty \u2013 in discussing middle class taxes \u2013 when it came to the question of how to pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d But that was when Warren was surging, and Sanders\u2019 words were a useful cudgel against her. Much has changed. \u201cSo how much is it going to cost? If you ask Bernie that \u2013 I\u2019ll ask him again tonight \u2013 he says, \u2018Go figure,\u2019 \u201d Biden said, referring to Sanders\u2019 recent refusal to offer his own specific estimate. Biden went on to suggest Sanders would get laughed out of Congress if he arrived there, as president, without more details. Moderator George Stephanopoulos also confronted Sanders with recent attacks from Trump, who ripped \u201csocialism\u201d in his State of the Union speech and in an ad before the Super Bowl. Asked why Democrats shouldn\u2019t be worried those lines will stick, Sanders hit back at Trump and defended his primary rivals. \u201cBecause Donald Trump lies all the time,\u201d he said to applause from the audience. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Donald Trump says.\u201d Pressed by Stephanopoulos over the modest turnout in Iowa, where Sanders had been plumping for a progressive explosion, Sanders conceded again that he was disappointed by the numbers. \u201cI think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters,\u201d Sanders said, before pivoting to a more flattering metric. \u201cBut if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama\u2019s historic 2008 campaign. And if that happens nationally, we\u2019re going win and defeat Trump.\u201d Klobuchar continued to do what\u2019s allowed her to become a finalist in a field that started with two dozen candidates, turning in another in a string of strong debate performances. She landed the punches she came in to deliver: She called Buttigieg\u2019s experience into question. She cast doubt on Sanders\u2019 electability. And she knocked Steyer for his lack of government experience. \u201cI think we are not going to be able to out-divide the divider-in-chief,\u201d she said of the effect Sanders\u2019 ideology could have on Democrats\u2019 chances of winning in November. \u201cI think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out.\u201d And the senator personally spoke about her family, detailing how she was the \u201cgranddaughter of an iron ore miner\u201d and \u201cthe daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman.\u201d The reality for Klobuchar, though, is that she has consistently turned in strong debates but hasn\u2019t climbed past any of the four candidates who have long made up the field\u2019s top tier. The Minnesota senator invested heavily in Iowa, and while she over-performed where many polls put her by garnering 12.3% of state delegate equivalents with 100% of precinct reporting, she still finished fifth. Her lack of support from black voters is even more acute than Buttigieg\u2019s, and she\u2019s behind in building infrastructure in Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 which means she\u2019s even more dependent on gaining altitude from a strong New Hampshire finish on Tuesday. This debate may have helped in one key area, though: Money. Wow, our campaign has had our best fundraising hour ever. We have a goal to raise $1 million before midnight tonight, can you help us get there? Donate here now: https://t.co/4z3T9gqBxy Amid the aggressive policy debates Friday night, the seven contenders on stage sprinkled in some kind moments. The crowd cheered when Klobuchar, and then Sanders, mentioned the name of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney \u2013 the lone GOP senator to vote for Trump\u2019s removal from office. When Sanders mentioned that he doesn\u2019t get many newspaper endorsements, Klobuchar \u2013 who\u2019s picked them up in bunches in recent weeks \u2013 helped him out: \u201cYou got the Conway endorsement.\u201d When a moderator quoted Hillary Clinton saying that no one likes Sanders, Klobuchar said, \u201cI like Bernie just fine,\u201d and Biden walked over and draped his arm over Sanders\u2019 shoulder for a brief hug. And Buttigieg came to Biden\u2019s defense when asked about the political impact of Republicans targeting the former vice president and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the President,\u201d Buttigieg said, while ABC kept a camera focused on Biden, who seemed moved by the answer. \u201cLook, the vice president and I and all of us are competing but we\u2019ve got to draw a line here. To be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being, who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united\u201d to beat Trump, Buttigieg said. The former vice president\u2019s weak fourth-place finish in Iowa called into question how a candidate whose calling card is his electability could withstand losing elections. On Friday night, he showed debate-watchers he was still capable of mixing it up with his rivals \u2013 delivering, and at times shouting, passionate answers. The subject line of the fundraising email his campaign sent moments after the debate: \u201cI fought like hell tonight.\u201d He lambasted Sanders over votes against gun control measures in the 1990s, highlighting the Vermont senator\u2019s support for legislation that made it impossible to pursue civil liability claims against gun manufacturers and his five votes against the Brady handgun violence bill. Sanders said that while his views have changed, he was representing the constituents of his rural state at the time. \u201cThink of all the thousands and thousands of people\u201d who were killed by gun violence, Biden said to Sanders, \u201cwhile you were representing your constituency.\u201d Biden even defended what Buttigieg called the \u201cpolitics of the past\u201d \u2013 turning it into another opportunity to tie himself to former President Barack Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat is it that he wants to do away with?\u201d And he produced one of the night\u2019s most memorable moments, urging the crowd to give a standing ovation to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council who testified during the impeachment hearings and was ousted by Trump\u2019s White House hours earlier Friday. \u201cI think we should all stand now and give Col. Vindman a show of support,\u201d Biden said, throwing his hands above the podium. \u201cGet up there!\u201d Steyer\u2019s strategy on Friday was clear: Continue to make inroads with black voters by taking down Biden, whose support among African Americans has proven resilient. Steyer called for reparations for African Americans, faulted his opponents for saying \u201cnot one word\u201d about race and \u2013 in a direct moment \u2013 demanded the Biden disavow Dick Harpootlian, a prominent supporter in South Carolina, who accused Steyer of buying the endorsement of the chairman of the state\u2019s Legislative Black Caucus. \u201cAnyone who thinks that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality,\u201d Steyer said. The trio of debate moments made clear that Steyer sees his path to becoming a viable contender for the Democratic nomination running through South Carolina. The billionaire businessman has had strong poll numbers in the state recently. A Fox News poll released in mid-January found Steyer at 15% \u2013 behind Biden but ahead of Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg. Warren seemed to disappear from the debate\u2019s hottest moments in the early stages, largely sticking to her script and avoiding confrontations with the other candidates as she tries to make her case as the primary\u2019s \u201cunity\u201d candidate. Over past few days, as the Iowa caucuses spiraled into a historic political fiasco and candidates like Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg exchanged attacks, Warren doubled down on her pitch. She mostly stayed out of the fray, off and onstage, as she sought to position herself as the one hopeful who can pull a fractured party together. But on a debate stage, where conflict draws attention, she didn\u2019t draw much. Until she seized it. \u201cI lived in an America in which abortion was illegal. And rich women still got abortions,\u201d Warren said, the crowd rapt as she warned that the Supreme Court, like many red states, was on a path to banning or making it near impossible for women to obtain them. The stakes, she added, were clear \u2013 and \u201cif we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our bodies, then it\u2019s going to mean we can\u2019t simply rely on the courts.\u201d Noting that a strong majority of American voters support abortion rights, Warren said the only recourse now was to push \u201cfor a congressional solution.\u201d \u201cIt is time,\u201d she said, \u201cto have a national law to protect the right of a woman\u2019s choice.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday morning walked back comments he made that his top competitor ahead of next week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, Bernie Sanders, is not a Democrat. Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, signed a Democratic Party pledge last year affirming that he would run for president as a Democrat and would serve as one if elected. The comments from Biden reflect the heated competition between the two former Senate colleagues ahead of the critical Iowa caucuses, and polls show the two are locked in a very tight race there. \u201cBernie is a Democrat. He calls himself a Democratic socialist,\u201d Biden said Friday in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden attributed the shift in tone to a difference in context. \u201cHe should be running. That wasn\u2019t the question,\u201d Biden said on ABC. On Thursday, Biden told reporters that the contrast between Sanders and him is \u201cself-evident,\u201d and when asked to expand, said simply, \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d Pressed on whether he believes that means Sanders is not, he said, \u201cWell, he says he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not registered as a Democrat.\u201d Biden said another difference between the two is that Sanders has not acknowledged how much his health care plan will cost, whereas Biden said he had. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve suggested to you, that I want to do, I\u2019ve figured how to pay for it. He\u2019s acknowledged he doesn\u2019t even know what \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 is going to cost, and how he\u2019s going to do it. How do you get something done that way?\u201d Biden said at an impromptu Dairy Queen stop in Pella, Iowa. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN that \u201clast-minute, cheap barbs borne of desperation aren\u2019t a good look for a candidate who proclaims his desire to unite the party.\u201d The swipes come just days before Monday\u2019s caucuses and as Biden has attempted to stay above the fray ahead of the nominating contests. His campaign released an ad Thursday on the importance of character, where a narrator reads over a photo of the Resolute Desk in the oval office, \u201cCharacter matters. Maybe more here than anywhere.\u201d And at a campaign event just before the ice cream stop where Biden made the comments about Sanders, he had told caucusgoers that Democrats cannot let the race \u201cslide into a negative treatment of one another\u201d and invoked former President Barack Obama. \u201cThe temptation is too much for some running. We just can\u2019t do it,\u201d he urged, calling for unity in the party. \u201cAs Barack said, the last thing we need to do is form a circular firing squad. We have differences. We can argue about our differences. But we have to be able when we come out of this, whoever the nominee is, to unite the party.\u201d Earlier in the day, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg had called out both Biden and Sanders by name. In response to a Biden television ad that claims this is no time to \u201ctake a risk,\u201d Buttigieg responded at a town hall in Decorah, Iowa, that history has shown that the \u201cbiggest risk\u201d that could be taken is \u201cto look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a President like Donald Trump who is new in kind.\u201d Biden responded by making light of the comments, saying he\u2019s not sure what Buttigieg is talking about. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Biden said of Buttigieg, \u201cand that must be a sign that things are getting a little tight. A Washington playbook, I\u2019m not sure what he means. What I\u2019m advocating for the American people, the middle class and giving people a shot, and a Dairy Queen!\u201d This story has been updated with Biden\u2019s comments on Friday morning.

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg on Thursday accused Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, by name, of forcing the debate among Democratic presidential contenders to be too focused on the past rather than the future. Buttigieg\u2019s naming of his rivals is a significant shift just days ahead of the Iowa caucuses, something the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has avoided doing in recent weeks. The move signals that Buttigieg sees the former vice president and the Vermont senator as his main opponents in the key early state. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cI hear Vice President Biden, saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.\u201d Earlier this month the Biden campaign released an ad in which a narrator tells voters, \u201cThis is no time to take a risk.\u201d Buttigieg then went after Sanders. \u201cThen I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s coming at the very moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just aligned around what it is we\u2019re against, but agreeing on what it is we\u2019re for.\u201d Buttigieg has made both of these points before, but Thursday\u2019s town hall in Decorah represents the first time the former mayor has taken on his opponents by name. Buttigieg even strenuously avoided mentioning Sanders by name in a lengthy gaggle with reporters that focused on how the former mayor\u2019s campaign was fundraising off Sanders\u2019 surge in Iowa. Buttigieg then continued with the thrust of his argument: The debate between Biden and Sanders, the two Democrats leading in most statewide polls in Iowa, are too focused on the past. \u201cLook, I feel very strongly about the Iraq War, but hearing arguments over who said what when the 2003 is, leaving aside the fact that this is 2020 and we\u2019ve got, not only to learn the lessons of the war in Iraq, but to make sure we don\u2019t get sucked into a war with Iran,\u201d Buttigieg said. He added: \u201cI feel passionately about protecting Social Security. That\u2019s exactly why I don\u2019t want us to get caught up in an argument over who said what when about Social Security in the 1990s when Donald Trump is threatening Social Security and announcing cuts to Medicaid today. That\u2019s happening today.\u201d Biden and Sanders sparred over their respective records on the Iraq War during a debate earlier this month in Iowa. And the two campaigns have been engaged in a tense back-and-forth over their past comments about Social Security. Biden responded to Buttigieg on Thursday by making light of the comments, telling reporters that he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat Pete\u2019s talking about.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy, and that must be a sign that things are getting a little tight,\u201d Biden said at an Iowa Dairy Queen. \u201cA Washington playbook, I\u2019m not sure what he means. what I\u2019m advocating for the American people, the middle class and giving people a shot, and a Dairy Queen!\u201d After the town hall, Buttigieg discussed his criticism of Biden and Sanders with reporters. \u201cI want to make sure that, as we go into these closing days, there is a clear understanding of the different paths that we offer,\u201d he said. \u201cI am meeting so many Iowans who are focused, above all, on making sure that we win and defeat this President.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the way to do that is to move past the old arguments that have dominated the conversation, turn the page and on something different. And it is just a different approach to what Vice President Biden or Senator Sanders are offering and I want to make sure that choice is as clear as possible, especially for Iowans still making up their mind in these crucial final hours.\u201d Buttigieg said he was not concerned that calling them out by name would be a turn off for prospective Iowa caucusgoers. A Monmouth University poll released this week found Biden at 23% in Iowa and Sanders at 21%, with Buttigieg trailing both of them at 16%. This story has been updated with a response from Joe Biden.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has earned the Democratic presidential endorsement of Iowa Rep. Cindy Axne, giving the former vice president a boost at a critical time \u2013 just nine days before the state\u2019s caucuses. Axne, a first term congresswoman, was one of two Iowa Democrats to flip a Republican held district in the state in 2018, and districts like hers could be critical in maintaining the Democratic majority in the House in November. \u201cI believe we need a Democratic nominee who not only has the vision to rebuild our alliances and strengthen our middle class, but who can win in November - which is why I\u2019m proud to endorse Joe Biden for President,\u201d Axne said in a statement. Axne will appear with Biden at his event in Ankeny, Iowa, Saturday evening, according to the Biden campaign\u2019s Iowa spokeswoman, Julia Krieger. Biden now has the support of two of Iowa\u2019s three Democratic congressmembers. Rep. Abby Finkenauer of Iowa, who also turned a red district blue in the 2018 midterm elections, announced her endorsement of the former vice president earlier this month.  Rep. Dave Loebsack, the third Democratic member of Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation, is backing former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Biden also has the support of former Iowa Governors Chet Culver and Tom Vilsack. Ahead of the caucuses, Biden has leaned heavily into arguing that having his name at the top of the ticket would help Democrats in down ballot races. \u201cI\u2019m just asking the rhetorical question \u2013 Bernie\u2019s at the top of the ticket in North and South Carolina, or Warren\u2019s the top of the ticket. How many Democrats down the line you think are gonna win?\u201d Biden told The State newspaper this week. To support this argument, Biden\u2019s campaign has rolled out several endorsements from swing district members across the country. This weekend three Democrats who turned red districts blue \u2013 Finkenauer, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, and Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, are traveling through Iowa on a \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d tour. Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, who also won a Republican district in a 2018 special election, campaigned with the former vice president in the state earlier this week. The former vice president is set to return to Iowa on Saturday as he prepares for the final stretch of campaigning before Iowans caucus on February 3. The race in Iowa remains fluid as Biden is joined by Buttigieg and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the top tier of contenders. And, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released this week showed Sanders improving his standing in the race, joining Biden in a two-person top tier above the rest of the field. A majority of Democratic caucusgoers have not firmly made up their minds about who they will support on caucus night.",

            "article_content": "At a time when President Donald Trump seems to permeate nearly every aspect of American discourse, it might come as a surprise that the first movie from Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s production company, Higher Ground, never mentions him by name. But subtlety is part of the power of \u201cAmerican Factory,\u201d the new Netflix documentary that charts the reopening of a factory in Dayton, Ohio. Over the course of two hours, the movie, directed by the seasoned documentarians Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, serves as a quiet historical and political corrective, offering their portrait of the state of America\u2019s industrial heartland and prodding viewers to rethink who, exactly, is part of the American project. \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d starts on December 23, 2008, as a crowd gathers to learn that the General Motors plant in Dayton has shuttered. The movie then fast-forwards to 2015, when the plant reopens as a new enterprise, as Fuyao Glass America, the American arm of a Shanghai-based company that manufactures automotive glass. One man makes Fuyao\u2019s expanded mission crystal clear: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re melding two cultures together: the Chinese culture and the US culture. So we are truly a global organization.\u201d Obamas inaugurate Netflix deal with 'American Factory' As some critics have pointed out, \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d is, in important ways, a commentary on the unpredictability of globalization; a New York Times review frames the movie as underscoring \u201cthe new global haves and have-nots.\u201d But it\u2019s also much more than that. The movie arrives at a moment when the Trump White House continues to make vociferous, bold claims about the state of the American economy, particularly manufacturing. That\u2019s despite the increasing concerns of economists and the warnings of history that a recession could be on the horizon. There\u2019s also the sobering contrast between Trump\u2019s rhetoric about how job growth has ballooned during his presidency and the reality of a broader factory slowdown slamming states \u2013 including Ohio \u2013 that helped win him the 2016 presidential election. No, \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d doesn\u2019t specifically name Trump, but that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t have to. The movie, instead, shines a light on a promise that the early years of his presidency have yet to fulfill: extinguishing severe economic malaise among, in particular, blue-collar, middle-class workers. By bringing the experiences of these workers \u2013 including one, Shawnea, a glass inspector who made about $29 \u201cand some change\u201d an hour at GM and then, as of the filming, only made $12.84 an hour at Fuyao \u2013 center stage, the movie retains a tight, sympathetic focus on some of the people most beleaguered by a wobbly economy. It\u2019s no surprise that the Obamas, who focused their campaign rhetoric on helping struggling Americans survive the Great Recession, chose this film. \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d does something else, too. Beyond setting the record straight on the country\u2019s economic landscape, the movie also dramatically widens what America means, as well as who\u2019s meaningfully involved in that process of expansion. One of the most common criticisms to come out of the 2016 presidential election is that people of color rarely, if ever, figure in conversations about America\u2019s heartland. In its own way, the Obamas\u2019 documentary provides a rejoinder: The first person viewers see on screen is a black man, who sets the tone for the announcement of GM\u2019s closure; and one of the primary narrative arcs is that of Bobby, a black furnace off-loader. In addition, there\u2019s the fact that \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d zooms in on a very specific culture clash: the one between American and Chinese workers. Some of the movie\u2019s most enjoyable moments are when Fuyao\u2019s diverse army of employees parse various cultural differences. For instance, Rob, a furnace supervisor, recalls inviting Chinese workers over to his house for Thanksgiving and their interest in his 12-gauge shotgun, pistols, and Harley motorcycle. It\u2019s the kind of scene that at once softly critiques some American-specific attachments \u2013 guns, big bikes \u2013 and also illustrates, to heartwarming effect, that two disparate cultures can coexist in seemingly unlikely places. In that, the movie appears to offer yet another subtle statement that\u2019s at odds with the Trump White House and its exclusionary mythology of greatness: that America is a country that has always relied on labor unseen \u2013 on the labor of poor Americans, of Americans of color, of foreigners, of immigrants. Even without mentioning Trump, \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d provides one of the most fascinating investigations yet of an era where his name is on everyone\u2019s lips.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this story first published in September 2019. The story has been updated with additional administration actions. An impeachment trial looms and a major Middle East crisis is unfolding with Iran. Still, the Trump administration has remained steadfast in pursuit of one of its signature policy goals: the gutting of environmental regulations, which include those aimed at curbing climate change. From changes in early January to curb key parts of a landmark environmental protection law to relaxing restrictions on power plant emissions, Trump has attempted to remove many of the guardrails installed by the Obama and previous administrations that can limit the scope of global warming. The world is already feeling the dangerous impacts of climate change, and has been for some time. Earth just endured its second hottest year on record. The typically frozen Arctic is melting at an alarming rate. And Australia is battling hellish wildfires, made even worse by global warming. For years now, the world\u2019s top climate scientists have warned that waiting any longer to drastically cut global emissions of planet-warming gases risks exposing millions more to the worst consequences of the climate crisis \u2013 more frequent droughts, wildfires and even food shortages. \u201cHe is locking in permanent, irreversible damage to our environment through his irresponsible environmental policies, including his efforts to block progress on climate change,\u201d said Dr. Michael E. Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University and the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center, said of Trump policies. \u201cOnce we go beyond key tipping points \u2013 the melting of the major ice sheets \u2013 there is no going back.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some of the most consequential climate policy rollbacks: On January 9, the Trump administration announced plans to rewrite decades-old regulations in order to make it easier to build major infrastructure projects without considering the potential impacts to greenhouse gas emissions or of climate change, including sea level rise. The changes announced to how the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act is enforced would apply to projects like pipelines, highways and mines, which had been required to undergo in-depth environmental impact assessments. According to The New York Times, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt called the changes the administration\u2019s most impactful deregulatory move yet. The proposed changes have outraged many environmental groups, and are all but guaranteed to face legal challenges. In 2018, the Times reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax fuel efficiency and auto emissions benchmarks, a shift that would stamp out one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate initiatives. If the proposed change goes into effect, it could have profound consequences for the planet: Transportation emits more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the US economy, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. But California and several other states have sued to block the change, and there are signs that even some automakers are not on board with Trump\u2019s rollbacks. Last year, Trump also announced he was revoking California\u2019s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards, a move that the state\u2019s attorney general has vowed to challenge in court. In a boost to electrical utilities and the struggling coal industry, Trump\u2019s move to replace Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan could have serious consequences for the health of humans and the planet. The Clean Power Plan placed flexible limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and, according to analysis by Obama\u2019s EPA, would have reduced CO2 emissions from power generators by 32% compared with 2005 levels by 2030. Trump\u2019s replacement for the Clean Power Plan is called the Affordable Clean Energy rule and allows states to set their own emissions standards for coal-fueled power plants. Last year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler touted the plan, saying it gives power companies \u201cthe regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans.\u201d But the new rule could cost American lives. By EPA\u2019s own analysis, Trump\u2019s rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than under the Clean Power Plan. Many states and cities are also suing to block the new regulations from going into effect. Many scientists warn that keeping fossil fuels in the ground is critical to tackling the climate crisis. But the Trump administration has moved the US in the opposite direction, opening vast stretches of land and water offshore to oil and gas drilling. In 2017, the administration shrank two of Utah\u2019s national monuments \u2013 Grand-Staircase Escalante National Monument and Bear\u2019s Ears \u2013 by 51% and 85%, respectively. The moves took land areas spanning twice the size of Rhode Island out of protected status and were part of the largest reduction of public lands in US history, according to a study published in the journal Science. The changes open the areas removed from the national monuments to oil and gas development, but both decisions face challenges in court. The administration has also pushed to open Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters offshore along the East and Pacific coasts, and the Arctic. \u201cThe pipeline projects potentially lock in long-term extraction of natural gas and petroleum, and therefore have a very long legacy that will extend beyond the next administration,\u201d Mann said. Trump\u2019s move to begin formally pulling the US out of the landmark Paris climate accord, which was agreed to by nearly all of the world\u2019s countries, was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US \u2013 which can\u2019t officially leave the agreement until the day after this year\u2019s presidential election \u2013 would not be leading the global fight against climate change. And studies have shown the decision has had global implications: A report last year found that Trump\u2019s decision has made it easier for other countries to renege on their climate commitments. Last year, Trump\u2019s EPA announced that it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors that detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines. At a time when the US has become the world\u2019s biggest natural gas and oil producer, the move is significant because of the potency of methane\u2019s heat-trapping capabilities. Though the gas doesn\u2019t last in the atmosphere as long as CO2, 1 ton of methane has 84 to 87 times more global warming potential than the same amount of CO2 over a 20-year period. Another key global agreement to limit planet-warming gases went into effect last year, but Trump has yet to send it to the Senate to ratify it. The treaty is called the Kigali Amendment, and it deals with a little-known but highly potent class of greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used in refrigerators and air conditioners. The gases are sometimes called \u201csuper greenhouse gases\u201d because of their capacity to trap huge amounts of heat in the atmosphere; they have more than 1,000 times greater warming potential than carbon dioxide. The climate change solutions organization Project Drawdown has found that phasing out these chemicals would be the most impactful solution to stop global warming \u2013 more than eating less meat, driving electric cars or switching to renewable energy.

He is a partner in the Dentons US LLP law firm and the head of its Georgia public policy team.  The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Simon and Garfunkel famously sang, \u201cWhere have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, our nation turns its lonely eyes to you?\u201d As Georgia Republicans prepare for two grueling US Senate runoffs \u2013 which will determine the balance of power in the Senate \u2013 they might want to think about replacing \u201cJoe DiMaggio\u201d with \u201cRonald Reagan,\u201d hum a couple of bars and harken back to the lessons taught by the former president. Reagan believed in the importance of building a broad-based Republican Party to include individuals who may not always agree on every issue but could come together to build a better society. And that\u2019s exactly what the Georgia GOP will need to do to win. This may seem an unnecessary step, given that Republicans have a historical advantage in the state. Georgians have not elected a Democrat to the US Senate since 2000, and, aside from President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s recent narrow victory, any Democrat running for any state or federal office statewide since 2006. Moreover, since 1992, Republicans have won every general election runoff \u2013 including two Senate runoffs: in 1992, when Paul Coverdell won, and in 2008, when Saxby Chambliss won. Furthermore, Democrats have also not improved their chances this year by nominating two candidates \u2013 Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff \u2013 with decidedly progressive roots, and one of whom has shown a willingness to embrace the Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont. However, the electoral path to victory for the two Republicans \u2013 first-term Sen. David Perdue and recently appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler \u2013 is far from certain. Heading into these contentious and expensive runoffs, Georgia Republicans face immediate and long-term challenges on multiple fronts: many within their base are bitterly focused on pointing fingers over the President\u2019s now certified statewide loss, some traditional allies in the suburbs have drifted blue, and new voters, trending more demographically diverse, are suspicious of the Grand Old Party. What Chuck Schumer doesn't understand about Georgia The bitter true believers. South of Savannah this fall, motorists traveling down I-95 through rural marshlands could spot a billboard loudly proclaiming, \u201cOnly God and Donald J. Trump Can Save America.\u201d If Trump\u2019s campaign rallies sometimes take on the feel of a religious tent revival, it is because many of his supporters treat it that way. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is not merely a campaign slogan but a rallying cry for a movement his supporters believe is critical to saving the US from a myriad of perceived threats, ranging from over regulation to socialism. In fact, Trump\u2019s declaration that \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d in reference to America in 2016, is reminiscent of the words of Eugene Talmadge, a Georgia governor in the Great Depression, whose supporters ardently believed when he declared, \u201cYou only have three real friends: Jesus Christ, Sears Roebuck and Gene Talmadge.\u201d This level of devotion drove up turnout for the President in many small towns and rural areas of the state this year, but it also heightened the sincere belief among his supporters that the race was rigged against Donald Trump when he lost. Encouraged by the President\u2019s unsubstantiated claims, which his own attorney general has since refuted, his fervent allies have brought lawsuits claiming fraud and seeking to overturn the results. GA Lt. Gov. 'alarmed' at election misinformation still circulating Many have even turned on Republicans Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Gov. Brian Kemp and others, declaring them disloyal RINOs (Republicans In Name Only). The President himself called Raffensperger an enemy of the people and said he was ashamed to have endorsed the governor in 2018. On Facebook and Twitter, and in protest marches and car caravans, Trump\u2019s supporters echo his claims that only a rigged election can explain his loss and demand that the election be decertified. At a suburban Republican breakfast last Saturday, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel was peppered by grassroots workers who were convinced the President was the victim of fraud in his election. These workers, thinking there would be fraud in the runoff, asked why they should invest \u201cmore money and work when [the runoff election] is already decided?\u201d This is the last thing candidates and party leaders want to hear from their base when grassroots campaigning and turnout will be so critical in this hotly contested race. The former allies. At the other end of the state\u2019s traditional GOP coalition were many formerly staunch Republican middle-to-upper middle-class, college-educated voters. In formal gatherings and informal chats during this election season with friends, neighbors and political acquaintances, I heard many give the same refrain \u2013 a longing for normalcy, civility and what they perceived as basic competence. They usually agreed with many of the President\u2019s policies, but they were turned off by his often-divisive rhetoric, theatrics, alleged ethical lapses and governing style. Why the GOP is so rattled by Rev. Warnock's faith-based Georgia Senate campaign Not surprisingly, they and many others in their communities turned on the President in the election. In one North Atlanta Buckhead neighborhood, for instance, support for Trump dropped by over 20 percentage points compared to the GOP ticket eight years ago. Similar drops in support occurred across the suburbs in Cobb and Fulton counties in the greater Atlanta area. A changing state. Georgia Republicans are also facing the reality of increasingly diverse demographics in the state. As the state\u2019s overall population grows, Georgia\u2019s White registered voters have decreased from 68% of the population in 2000 to roughly 53% today, while African-American, Hispanic, Asian and other ethnic groups have all increased. These demographic changes have already contributed to Cobb and Gwinnett counties, two formerly suburban Atlanta GOP strongholds, flipping blue. Georgia Democratic Party leaders, including its two Senate candidates and progressive organizer Stacey Abrams, are actively courting these new groups of voters, as well as young people, in the hopes of fueling both their immediate runoff campaigns and their party\u2019s longtime political revival in the Peach State. The challenge for Republicans now and in the future will be to court these increasingly diverse constituencies. All of this brings me back to Reagan and the Georgia GOP\u2019s need to \u201cturn its lonely eyes\u201d to his example. Reagan\u2019s \u201cbig tent\u201d philosophy of politics focused on addition and multiplication rather than subtraction and division. While he was still governor of California, Reagan delivered a speech to his fellow Republicans that still resonates today. He called for an end to \u201cinternal fighting, backbiting and throat-cutting\u201d and argued that \u201c[t]here is room in our tent for many views; indeed, the divergence of views is one of our strengths.\u201d This philosophy carried Reagan to two terms as president, on the backs of a coalition comprised of fiscal conservatives, libertarians, social conservatives, defense hawks and blue-collar Democrats.  As part of this optimistic expansion, Georgia Republicans must reach beyond a narrow focus on wedge issues, which merely galvanize its existing base. Negative ads, catnip for political consultants and third-party groups, may have a place in politics but alone they do little to expand a party\u2019s reach. Instead, the GOP must redirect its efforts to gateway issues, which require advocating for solutions to critical problems in communities that may have been historically in the Democratic camp but could allow voters in those communities to give Republicans a second look. Concretely, that means that Perdue, Loeffler and the party at large must focus on solutions to some of the most pressing issues \u2013 everything from the Covid-19 crisis to the rising cost of health care to the need for a swift economic recovery. While Democrats\u2019 recent progressive shift in a traditionally more conservative state remains a gamble, Republicans can ill-afford the continuing division within their ranks and must make strides to reach out to disaffected former allies and potential new ones in Georgia\u2019s growing diverse tapestry.  To accomplish this challenge, it is time for Georgia Republicans to embrace the optimistic \u201cbig tent\u201d Reagan philosophy.",

Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Europe, but particularly France and Germany \u2013 the two motor nations of the continent \u2013 are holding their collective breath for the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s American presidential election. They recognize that the future of the trans-Atlantic relationship, the very nature of the Atlantic alliance, which has preserved the peace in Europe for three-quarters of a century, hangs in the balance. However, there is a dawning recognition in both nations that some elements of a decades-long trans-Atlantic partnership may be all but irrevocably lost \u2013 regardless of who wins in America next month. There is considerable uncertainty both in Paris and Berlin as to just how much the United States can be trusted any more. \u201cDonald Trump has not fallen down from the sky out of nowhere,\u201d Jana Puglierin, head of the German office of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) told me in a Zoom conversation from Berlin. \u201cHe has not taken half of the American population hostage and kind of brainwashed them. So there is a reason why he is there, and the reason remains even after he leaves.\u201d Is Donald Trump leading America toward a Belarusian model presidency? Still, Germans, and especially the French, may be forgiven for being somewhat distracted at this moment. Even more immediate and frightening for Europe than the US elections is the sudden resurgence of coronavirus infection for which the United States has been of little help and certainly no model for containment. With France counting more than 270,000 new cases in the last week, President Emmanuel Macron told the French people in a nationwide address Wednesday evening that a second nationwide lockdown was coming Friday for a nation already approaching paralysis. Germany, too, headed for a second partial shutdown. The elections across the Atlantic, of course, can hardly be ignored. Yet at the heart of all feelings among French and Germans today is the increasingly intransigent belief that the will of the American electorate is so unpredictable, their choice of a leader so self-centered and dependent on forces spiraling out of control, that Europe may be unable to count on a solid and dependable United States over the long term. The ECFR found, in a continent-wide survey, that even if Joe Biden were elected, voters in France and Germany believe Europe should \u201cmaintain good relations with the US, [but] prepare for disengagement.\u201d Should Trump win, however, voters in Belgium, Sweden, Austria and Croatia also believe preparation for disengagement would be necessary. In France, most commentators, as well as officials within the Macron government, have become persuaded that even a Biden victory \u201cwould not mean a return to old times, often wrongly mythologized,\u201d as Le Monde\u2019s diplomatic commentator Piotr Smolar put it recently. Vote the whole ballot. The next decade depends on it Macron, who sees himself as the rightful heir to the mantle of European leadership that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will be relinquishing when she retires next year, has already begun campaigning for the creation of a European defense force that could make Europe less dependent on the American military, even if Biden reverses Trump\u2019s announced plan to begin withdrawing thousands of US troops from bases in Germany. The French are still hoping for a more realistic military perspective from a Biden victory. Like Trump, Biden has pledged an end to America\u2019s involvement in \u201cforever wars,\u201d particularly in the Middle East. Yet Biden has pledged to leave residual forces in some key countries, particularly Iraq, to maintain stability and prevent the rise of terrorist groups that could be threats to American interests. \u201cI think we need special ops capacity to coordinate with our allies,\u201d Biden told Stars and Stripes last month. Of course, not every European initiative opposed by Trump has been embraced by Biden unequivocally. The contentious Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to bring cheap Russian natural gas to Germany and that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has long believed is a critical building block for future German prosperity, has been vigorously opposed by Trump. But equally, as it happens, by Biden who described it four years ago as \u201ca bad deal\u201d for Europe that would lock in \u201ca greater dependence on Russia.\u201d Biden\u2019s views, though unchanged, are likely to be somewhat more nuanced than Trump\u2019s escalating threats of retaliation if the pipeline project were to continue. These have been described as \u201cblackmail\u201d by Manuela Schwesig, premier of the German state where the pipeline would terminate.  Still, French and Germans are in many respects equally desperate for the return of Americans on a host of different levels. Leaders of both nations want the United States to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran nuclear agreement (JCPOA), as well as the World Health Organization and assume a joint role in the battle against Covid-19 and the development of vaccines and treatments. That in turn could lead to relief for millions of unemployed in the service sectors of both countries who hope for the return of American tourists and their desperately needed dollars. But above all, French and Germans want a restoration of a degree of consistency in trans-Atlantic relations \u2013 an end to rule by tweets and the feeling that they are constantly perceived as somehow second class citizens. What they most fear, however, is a second Trump administration with a president utterly unchained and unhinged. Though few are prepared to spell out just what that might look like, for fear it could come to pass.",

Read more opinion on CNN. For all of the distraction and uncertainty around this year\u2019s veepstakes, there was a certain air of inevitability around the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s running mate, as confirmed in Wednesday\u2019s historic introduction of the full Democratic ticket. With robust credentials and solid support from the party establishment, Harris who would be the first Black woman, the first Asian American and just the fourth woman on a major US party ticket, was the odds-on favorite nearly as soon as she suspended her own campaign. And with Biden becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee at a time of unprecedented consciousness around issues of race and gender, the practical and symbolic advantages of picking a younger, nonwhite woman as his running mate were clearly magnified. Biden held his VP announcement on the third anniversary of the march in Charlottesville, the horrific parade of torch-bearing white supremacists that Biden has cited as the primary motivation for his entry into the presidential race. \u201cFor me, it was a call to action,\u201d he said in his introduction of Harris. \u201cAt that moment I knew I couldn\u2019t standby and let Donald Trump, a man who went on to say\u2026 \u2018there were very fine people on both sides,\u2019 \u2026 continue to attack everything that makes America America.\u201d But symbolism alone won\u2019t accomplish the campaign\u2019s critical goals if it wants to achieve, to quote Harris\u2019 words from Wednesday\u2019s speech, \u201cmore than a victory\u2026we need a mandate.\u201d The ticket needs to energize Black voters, who will be weighing Harris\u2019 pioneering status against lingering criticisms of her record as California\u2019s \u201ctop cop.\u201d It needs to connect with young voters, who have seen the social contract of their parents and grandparents implode under the establishment politics of the decades in which they\u2019ve been alive. And it needs to bridge the jagged rift between the Democratic Party\u2019s centrists and its insurgent progressive wing, itself a fragmented mosaic of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and yes, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard supporters, encompassing factions who prioritize class-based politics and those more focused on social equity and restorative justice. Picking Kamala Harris makes history, but will it make a difference in November? That\u2019s the challenge the newly unveiled running mates have ahead of them, one that\u2019s been amplified by the magnitude of the crises our country now faces. As Biden and Harris both underscored, this is a \u201clife changing election for our nation\u201d \u2014 one that will \u201cdecide the future of America for a very, very long time.\u201d Harris, Biden said, was the right person to join in addressing this challenge: Smart, tough, experienced, a \u201cproven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class,\u201d and ready to do the job of VP \u2014 or POTUS, if needed \u2014 on day one. He sought to present her prosecutorial history around the theme that Harris herself has returned to again and again, as a career spent fighting \u201cfor the people,\u201d echoing the phrase that Harris said time and again as San Francisco D.A.: \u201cKamala Harris, for the people.\u201d He also promised that she would be the sharp sword in the campaign\u2019s scabbard against Trump and Mike Pence, leveraging her background as a router of corruption and courtroom interrogator against the leaders of an administration that has repeatedly and gleefully flouted laws, standards and ethics. Why Kamala Harris won the VP contest Yet still, in both Biden and Harris\u2019 remarks, the historical significance of the moment came back again and again: \u201cThis morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little Black and brown girls that feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today \u2014 today just maybe they\u2019re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way as president and vice presidents,\u201d Biden said. As Harris famously said during the debate where she confronted Biden on his record regarding school busing to promote integration, \u201cThat little girl was me.\u201d This is a moment that needs to be celebrated, among our Black and Asian communities and by all Americans, for what it is \u2014 emblematic evidence of the sea change in our nation\u2019s social fabric; a defiant rejection of the racist and misogynist themes that have been woven into America\u2019s political \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d; a statement of hope for more and greater inclusion in the future. We\u2019ve never been closer to having a Black woman VP than now. We\u2019ve never been closer to having an Asian VP than now. The likelihood that we\u2019ll see an Asian American president in my lifetime, something I would have found difficult to imagine just a few decades ago, is higher than it has ever been. But getting there will require connecting this moment to the movements surging around it, movements that want real change, real soon. Harris, in her acceptance speech, noted that the \u201ccivil rights struggle is nothing new to Joe \u2026 And, today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of America\u2019s march toward equality and justice as the only who has served alongside the first Black president and has chosen the first Black woman as his running mate.\u201d The reality is that that struggle looks very different today than it did when President Barack Obama was elected in 2008. Today, there is a fiery hunger, as one friend on social media put it, for \u201ctransformation, not just representation.\u201d The kind of deep structural change being demanded isn\u2019t what might have sprung to mind when one imagined a Biden/Harris 2020 ticket in the earliest days of this electoral cycle. And yet, it\u2019s undoubtedly what\u2019s necessary, given the breadth and complexity of the crises this nation faces. It\u2019s encouraging that Biden, in recent weeks, has embraced rhetoric and policies that reflect the influences of the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing \u2014 I even joked that I was getting excited by the seeming emergence of the chimera candidate \u201cJoelizabeth Warden.\u201d It\u2019s also promising that Harris directly referenced the passion for social change that is the legacy of her parents, immigrants from India and from Jamaica who first connected at Bay Area rallies for civil rights. Harris talked about how her parents met \u201cas students in the streets of Oakland, shouting for this thing called justice\u2026 My parents would bring me to protests strapped tightly in my stroller. And my mother, Shyamala, raised my sister Maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching.\u201d  The symbolism of this ticket is undeniable. Voters, especially progressive voters, will now be looking for the substance behind it \u2014 how the ticket intends to address a pandemic that, as Harris noted, is killing an American every 80 seconds; how it will reform health care; how it will protect women\u2019s right to choose, root out systemic racism, protect voting rights and reaffirm this nation\u2019s commitment to immigrants. As Harris acknowledged at the conclusion of her speech, \u201celecting Joe Biden is just the start of the work ahead.\u201d We should celebrate this historic moment. And then get to work making Donald Trump history.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. No president is above the law \u2013 and there were powerful arguments made to support that view in Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court proceeding. The court heard oral argument on a group of highly consequential presidential immunity cases involving subpoenas issued by various House committees and the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office to obtain Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. These cases are not only critical for the investigations into President Trump, but they are being closely watched because of what the rulings will mean for the parameters of executive power for this and future presidents. The arguments proceeded in two phases: one involved the consolidated cases related to the House subpoenas issued in connection with the House\u2019s power to investigate for legislative purposes; the other concerned the Manhattan DA\u2019s subpoena, issued by a grand jury in connection with a criminal investigation over payments to women alleging affairs with Trump and possible tax law violations. In all of the matters on the docket, the President had appealed against lower court rulings holding the subpoenas valid. It is always a challenge to read the tea leaves from oral argument. But there were some enlightening exchanges, and in important ways many of the justices seemed to be on the same page, providing at least some clues about how they are likely to rule. The justices seemed to be united in important ways in the case in which Trump sued to stop Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance from enforcing a subpoena to the President\u2019s accountants and businesses for tax returns and other financial documents for an eight-year period before the 2016 election. Trump's refusal to wear a mask is the most revealing thing Trump\u2019s legal team, represented by Jay Sekulow, swung for the fences. Sekulow argued, as he had in the President\u2019s losing efforts in the lower courts, that Trump is entitled to \u201ctemporary absolute presidential immunity\u201d from the subpoenas at issue along with all other forms of criminal process, even if the case is directed not at the President but at other parties, and even if it relates to conduct having nothing to do with being the President. The justices didn\u2019t seem to be buying what Sekulow was selling. Even the President\u2019s staunchest defenders were skeptical, with all of the conservative justices closely questioning Sekulow about his extreme position. The Department of Justice, represented by Solicitor General Noel Francisco, also weighed in. He didn\u2019t argue that Trump is absolutely immune to process (though Francisco punted on the point when asked, saying that it is too soon to consider such a claim),  but proposed that \u2013 before issuing its grand jury subpoena \u2013 the DA should be forced to go to federal court to make a heightened showing of proof demonstrating, among other things, a \u201ccritical need\u201d for the information sought in order to make decisions about charges, and an inability to get the information from other sources. Carey Dunne from the Manhattan DA\u2019s office countered that while a case-specific inquiry is appropriate to ensure that the subpoena does not unduly burden the President\u2019s exercise of his duties under Article II of the Constitution, the standard offered by the Department of Justice is too stringent, too burdensome on local prosecutors and their investigations, and would harm the grand jury process. Supreme Court is taking away tools prosecutors use to fight corruption After seeming to reject the extreme position of the President, the justices drilled down on what a workable standard might look like, carefully probing the arguments of the Manhattan DA and the Department of Justice. They questioned whether the Court\u2019s precedent in Clinton v. Jones had to be applied in this case. In the Clinton ruling, the Court held that President Bill Clinton was subject to subpoena for testimony in a civil suit brought by Paula Jones, who alleged that Clinton had sexually harassed her while he was governor of Arkansas (claims which he denied), in spite of the burden that preparing and giving such testimony would impose on the President. Most of the justices noted and asked the parties about the fact that the criminal penalties in Trump\u2019s case are arguably more serious but the burden imposed by the subpoena is much less. And they asked whether, as Sekulow and Francisco darkly hinted, there is a danger that with thousands of local DAs in the country the President could be overwhelmed with such subpoenas issued for political purposes, or whether that concern is overstated in light of the number of civil suits that could theoretically move forward under the Clinton v. Jones precedent. Ultimately I expect that the justices will reject, perhaps even unanimously, Trump\u2019s assertion that he is absolutely immune from process and therefore above the law. It remains to be seen what standard will be adopted, and whether the ruling will require further litigation by a lower court before the DA\u2019s office will collect their subpoenaed documents. But, particularly given the facts of this case, including that the DA\u2019s office has acted in good faith and not with any political motive, I expect that at some point the DA will be permitted to proceed with its case without having to wait for Trump to leave office. The arguments on the House subpoenas revealed more significant divisions among the justices. The subpoenas came from two committees that sought records about the hush-money payments; the way in which Trump had valued his assets on financial statements and other records in connection with possible violation of money laundering and other laws. Each of these committees asserted that their investigations were for the purpose of potential legislation on these issues. The primary issue explored during the arguments was the amount of power Congress has to engage in an investigation for legislative purposes and where the limits to that power may be. Once again, President Trump\u2019s legal team, this time represented by Patrick Strawbridge, took an extreme position, claiming that Congress has very little power to investigate the President as part of its legislative function because the Presidency is a separately created office under the Constitution. Strawbridge also claimed repeatedly that the House committees acted with political motivation in seeking the President\u2019s records. And at a minimum, he argued, the House should have to meet the \u201cdemonstrated needs\u201d standard from prior Supreme Court precedent on executive privilege. I signed the call for William Barr to resign. This is why The Department of Justice, this time represented by Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, also argued that the House failed to show a need for the information they sought. House counsel Doug Letter, however, maintained that the House subpoena did what it needed to do in issuing the subpoenas at issue, and that arguments cited by counsel for Trump and DOJ missed the mark because they relied on cases dealing with executive privilege, which all parties agreed does not apply here. The justices\u2019 questions explored these issues, with at least some of the President\u2019s reliable backers, like Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, expressing significant skepticism of the motives behind the subpoenas, pointing out where the information requested seemed at odds with the reason for the subpoena, and questioning the expansiveness of the House\u2019s view of its authority to seek information from the President for legislative purposes. Even the justices who seemed more accepting in theory of the House\u2019s right to investigate in this manner had questions about limits on the House\u2019s power and expressed some frustration when the House\u2019s counsel Doug Letter couldn\u2019t provide an example of when a subpoena request might cross the line. For example, many justices wanted to know whether the House could seek the President\u2019s medical records in connection with considering general healthcare legislation, or income information in connection with considering a tax cut for the middle class, suggesting that subpoenas along those lines would be problematic. Some justices, like John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Brett Kavanaugh, were tough to read, at times seeming supportive of Congress\u2019s right to obtain information imposing some burden on the President, but also expressing concern about how far Congress could go without any sort of meaningful check. Justices were also clearly thinking about the separation of powers, and the difficult position the courts find themselves in when dealing with disputes between the other two branches.  In short, the House cases raise a lot of thorny issues that did not seem to get resolved during today\u2019s argument. In addition, I couldn\u2019t help but think that the House could have saved itself some of the tough questioning (and even potentially an unfavorable result) if they had more carefully and specifically crafted their subpoenas in the first place to carefully match the information sought to the legislative purpose described; the arguments revealed weaknesses in that regard that the House lawyer had trouble countering. For these reasons, the House subpoenas case is likely to split the justices more evenly than the Trump v. Vance case, where the court should speak clearly to reject the President\u2019s claim of absolute immunity. The President is not above the law. These cases are now submitted, so the Supreme Court finally has its opportunity to say so.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. There\u2019s a theory that every new president balances out the previous occupant of the Oval Office. So Jimmy Carter\u2019s promise of honest and ethical government was a counterweight to Richard Nixon and Watergate. Confident California conservative Ronald Reagan ran as the anti-Carter. After Bill Clinton\u2019s scandals, George W. Bush said he\u2019d \u201crestore honor and decency\u201d to the White House. Freshman Senator Barack Obama offered a stark departure from George W. Bush\u2019s dynastic presidency. And, of course, Donald Trump was the polar opposite of  \u201cNo Drama\u201d Obama \u2013 a man he\u2019d baselessly accused of not being born in the United States. By this logic, it\u2019s easy to understand why some folks see Bernie Sanders as the ultimate contrast to Donald Trump: a Democratic socialist and Sixties-style revolutionary who rails against millionaires and billionaires. But take a step outside the class-warfare paradigm and let\u2019s look at contrasts in character and experience \u2013 qualities which typically drive a decision of who to hire for a big job. Even his critics concede that Joe Biden is known for his decency and empathy among longtime colleagues in the Senate. \u201cAs good a man as God ever created,\u201d attested a teary-eyed Senator Lindsay Graham back in 2015, before he went full Trump. Here\u2019s what John McCain said about him: \u201cHe is a good and decent man, God-fearing and kind, a devoted father and husband and a genuine patriot who puts our country before himself.\u201d Every line in McCain\u2019s tribute offers a clear contrast to President Trump. Even his defenders would not offer up \u201cgood and decent\u201d and \u201cdevoted husband\u201d as the President\u2019s prime attributes. In fact, according to an AP-NORC Center poll, among the first words that Republicans associate with President Trump are \u201cbumbling\u201d and \u201cjerk.\u201d And at a time when the key criteria for major government positions, like Director of National Intelligence, seems to be unquestioning loyalty to Trump, a candidate who embodies experience with a record of putting country above self-interest would be a huge relief to many Americans. With Sanders and Biden the two candidates most likely to scoop up delegates on Super Tuesday, we\u2019ll get some insight into who is seen as the strongest alternative to Trump. In the last 24 hours, we\u2019ve seen the center-lane in the Democratic field clear up considerably with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, two proud Midwestern moderates, bowing out and endorsing Biden. It would be a disaster for us to have to choose between Sanders and Trump That\u2019s the downstream effect from Biden\u2019s blowout win in South Carolina that revived his campaign like Lazarus. After losses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Biden won every county in South Carolina. Every. Single. One. Amid massive turnout, he got more than 260,000 votes \u2013 nearly two-and-a-half times more than Sanders, who came in second with over 105,000. To put this in perspective, Biden won more votes in South Carolina than Sanders won in the first three states combined. In fact, while Sanders leads in delegates, Biden has actually won more votes in the Democratic contest to date. Not only was South Carolina far more diverse than Iowa or New Hampshire, it was the most representative of the overall Democratic Party. In terms of ideology, 19% of SC primary voters described themselves as very liberal, 30% as somewhat liberal, 41% are moderates and 9% call themselves conservative. This is broadly in line with a 2019 Pew analysis of the Democratic Party by ideology.. Biden\u2019s landslide was so large, he won all the ideological groups across the board. The threat Sanders poses to Texas Democrats African-Americans made up a majority of the South Carolina primary electorate, and Biden won 61% of the black vote \u2013 thanks in part to Representative Jim Clyburn\u2019s decisive endorsement \u2013 while Sanders carried just 17%. But Biden cleaned up across almost all demographics \u2013 winning men and women, veterans and independents as well as first-time voters. Biden won urban, suburban and rural voters. While Sanders carried voters under 30, people who said they never attended church and non-college educated white men (white women without a college degree went for Biden). Now, the momentum may have shifted back to Biden \u2013 who led in most polls throughout 2019 \u2013 but he had just 72 hours to translate that energy into Super Tuesday, when roughly a third of all Democratic delegates will be decided. X-factors abound. Super Tuesday will be the first time we\u2019ll see Mike Bloomberg on the ballot, testing the power of the hundreds of millions of dollars he\u2019s spent already as well as campaigning in states that the other candidates have essentially ignored while they have wrestled for success in the first four states.  Bernie will have the benefit of his front-runner status that presumably will give him a boost in early voting. But we\u2019ll see if Biden\u2019s strong showing among African-Americans in South Carolina will boost his chances in Southern states voting on Super Tuesday, including Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia \u2013 where Biden recently received the endorsement of Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, former Governor Terry McAuliffe and former Republican Senator John Warner. As we sift through the Super Tuesday vote totals later this week \u2013 including California and Texas \u2013 it\u2019s worth asking which candidate has the best chance of carrying purple and even red-leaning states in the fall and not just in a polarized Democratic primary. We have plenty of evidence from Team Trump that they want to run against  Sanders \u2013 with the President even encouraging Republicans to vote for Sanders in South Carolina. In contrast, we know that President Trump was so nervous about running against Joe Biden \u2013 who is less susceptible to pre-fab \u201cradical socialist\u201d attacks in the general election \u2013 that the President pushed Ukraine to announce an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter to hurt the former vice president\u2019s candidacy. It led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. The GOP\u2019s talk of Hunter Biden and Burisma has been comparatively quiet in the weeks since Sanders won New Hampshire and Nevada. We\u2019ll see if it reignites in Republican circles now. I\u2019d bet yes. Bernie Sanders absolutely could win it all this November But let\u2019s get back to that core question of contrast in terms of character and experience. For better or worse, Joe Biden is a known quantity \u2013 someone who won his Senate seat at age 29 in 1972, when Sanders was a Castro-admiring activist. It was nine years before Sanders would be elected the socialist mayor of Burlington.  When Biden first ran for president in 1988, Donald Trump was building his brand as a real estate tycoon in New York City, before his first bankruptcies and subsequent reality TV stardom. The 1988 campaign was famously chronicled by Richard Ben Cramer in a classic tome called \u201cWhat It Takes.\u201d The chapters on Biden show a scrappy, middle-class kid from Scranton with a stutter who was \u201ctough from the neck up.\u201d He was flawed but fearless and fought for what he thought was right. He took on a two-decade Democratic incumbent in a race no one thought he could win.  Soon after, he suffered the loss of his first wife and unborn daughter in a car crash that severely injured his sons. But he worked through the pain and deepened his faith. In the Senate, he was a JFK Democrat wary of extremes and elites who might alienate middle class and blue-collar workers from a compassionate vision of government that helped everyone get ahead in life. He thought that special interests \u2013 in the words of Cramer, \u201chad become so wedded to their programs \u2014 old \u2018solutions\u2019 \u2014 that they made busing the issue, instead of equality in education. They let food-stamp fraud become the issue, instead of food for the hungry.\u201d By the time the 1988 campaign came around, Cramer described a Joe Biden driven by the conviction that people did not want to go back to the \u201cfiction of an America that was right, and white, and neatly authoritarian in its prejudice [and] politics\u2026If Biden was right, what the country wanted was a more perfect realization of its old ideals: Liberty, Justice, Compassion.\u201d In 2020\u2019s deeply polarized America, those old school ideals \u2013 just like the personal virtues of decency, empathy and experience \u2013 might provide the most compelling contrast to the Trump presidency. It might attract a broad coalition \u2013 including swing voters in swing states \u2013 and it might even help begin the daunting task of reuniting the nation.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. How bad will it get? That was the question this week, but it applied to several things: the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus around the world, the resulting stock market plunge and the concern about whether America\u2019s political leaders are up to the challenge. An outbreak of the disease is inevitable in the US, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but \u2026 a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Dr. Leana Wen, Baltimore\u2019s former health commissioner, wrote that the disease \u201cwill test our government\u2019s response and resiliency. How we weather the outbreak also hinges on our trust that the government has our best intentions at heart.\u201d She added that, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know if the trajectory of COVID-19 will be mild, moderate, or severe\u201d but it makes sense to prepare for the worst case. Wall Street apparently agreed, with the Dow plunging 3,583 points, making it by percentage terms the worst week since October, 2008. In the Perspectives section of CNN Business, Paul La Monica recalled covering that financial crisis. \u201cThat was a terrifying time \u2014 but this seems a lot scarier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYes, the Fed can do lots of things to help soothe frayed nerves when stocks are in free fall, but there is little that the Fed \u2014 or President Trump and Congress, for that matter \u2014 can do to solve this biological crisis for the markets and the economy.\u201d \u201cThere is no chance the virus will leave America\u2019s economy unscathed,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cEven if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That\u2019s because China has become a global economic powerhouse.\u201d And by now the virus has gone well beyond the borders of China. \u201cThe best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts \u2013 not to the President. He\u2019s not telling the truth. He\u2019s gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts,\u201d Ghitis wrote. She noted, \u201cIt\u2019s not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump\u2019s \u2018black swan,\u2019 the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection.\u201d In the Washington Post, David Ignatius wrote that, \u201cone of President Trump\u2019s failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts \u2014 more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors\u2026Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner\u2019s suggestion that the CDC was \u2018exaggerating\u2019 the threat.\u201d Taking it further, at a South Carolina rally Friday, Trump said, \u201cthe Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus\u201d in what he called \u201ctheir new hoax.\u201d Presidents are called upon to reassure the nation in the wake of traumatic events, wrote Joe Lockhart \u2013 Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn after the 9/11 attacks. So far, Trump is failing that leadership test, Lockhart said. \u201cHe has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home.\u201d Chelsea Clinton and the co-author of her book on global health, Devi Sridhar, noted that, \u201cPresident Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding \u2013 thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress.\u201d Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the effort to combat the virus.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a worse choice for a job that requires respect for public health,\u201d wrote Pence biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cIn addition to his climate-change skepticism\u2026he is known for penning, when he was running for Congress, what could be generously termed a nutty article that said, \u2018despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u2019\u201d As we wait to see the extent of the virus outbreak, here\u2019s some useful advice from Dr. Colleen Kraft, the associate medical director of Emory\u2019s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: \u201cUse soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers.\u201d The Democratic primary is at a critical moment. Joe Biden scored a decisive victory Saturday in South Carolina, but will he have the momentum to unseat Bernie Sanders as the Democrats\u2019 frontrunner? \u201cModerate voters may well snap back into the Biden camp,\u201d wrote Jeff Yang, \u201cand other centrist candidates may feel the pressure to make an increasingly hard decision: Whether to stay in the race and continue to fragment the vote against Sanders \u2014 or bow out and lend support to Biden.\u201d On Super Tuesday, March 3, roughly a third of the delegates will be chosen and the race could be decided within weeks \u2013 or remain hotly contested until the Democrats meet for their convention in Milwaukee in July. Elliot Williams summed up the moderates\u2019 feeling: Sanders \u201cstruggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). He all but ensures that his Republican opponent will make the election a referendum on socialism\u2026Attack ads from President Donald Trump and his allies assailing Sanders\u2019 views on Fidel Castro and Soviet Russia practically write themselves. And don\u2019t get me started about the conduct of some of his supporters and even some of his staffers online.\u201d \u201cTake a deep breath\u201d anyway, Williams added. \u201cBernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump \u2013 maybe even a better one.\u201d When Sanders praised some aspects of dictator Fidel Castro\u2019s regime in Cuba, critics called it an unforced error and said it would hurt him badly with Cuban-American emigres in Florida. Rebecca Bodenheimer agreed that it was \u201cill-advised\u201d but argued that it wasn\u2019t wrong: \u201cBoth the things he said were true: the Castro regime (and the successive iterations of it under Ra\u00fal Castro and now Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel) was and is authoritarian\u2026And, early on in the 1960s, Castro initiated a grassroots program that resulted in a massive increase in literacy in Cuba, as well as building a strong universal healthcare and educational system.\u201d Sanders is stirring excitement around the country, Dean Obeidallah noted: \u201cSanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000. Two weeks ago, the night before the New Hampshire primary, Sanders packed more than 7,500 into an arena, with USA Today noting that this \u2018event easily marked the largest in the Democratic contest in New Hampshire.\u2019\u201d The Vermont senator could win it all, wrote John Avlon, but he has a hill to climb because he\u2019s out of sync with much of the country ideologically. \u201cBernie Sanders has built a movement and he has momentum. But there are plenty of rational reasons to think that nominating a democratic socialist in a center-right country is a real risk \u2013 and could deliver Donald Trump a second term.\u201d A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent contemplated the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race with real dread. \u201cBoth represent two sides of the same coin,\u201d Dent wrote. \u201cThey both appeal to anger. They scream that the system is rigged, you\u2019re a victim, and that they can give you your country back if only you follow them.\u201d Millions of voters are in the middle, between the left and the right, he said. They \u201cwant a candidate who believes in capitalism, reasonably regulated market-based solutions to problems, social tolerance and acceptance, and constructive international engagement\u2026Most of all they\u2019ll want someone who conducts himself or herself in a thoughtful, deliberate and measured way. They want stability, not chaos and recklessness.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 South Carolina debate was fierce, with the moderators letting candidates talk over each other. It \u201cwas somewhere between an episode of \u2018The Jerry Springer Show\u2019 and a \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 reunion: messy, chaotic and embarrassing for nearly everyone involved,\u201d wrote Raul Reyes. \u201cIt was inevitable that, as the stakes have grown higher in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, there would be a greater sense of urgency among the candidates to stand out. But that did not mean the event had to devolve into a free-for-all.\u201d \u201cModerates across the country exhaled a collective sigh of relief after Tuesday\u2019s debate,\u201d wrote Tara Setmayer. \u201cJoe Biden is back. It was clear the former Vice President was much more comfortable and cogent on the debate stage this time around in South Carolina.\u201d  Elizabeth Warren picked up where she left off at the Nevada debate, with blistering attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg. But the former New York mayor seemed much more prepared this time. \u201cMayor Michael Bloomberg fought his way back into contention in the Democratic primary for president by obeying a simple rule: never let an attack go unanswered,\u201d wrote Errol Louis. The sheer force of Bloomberg\u2019s money cascade is keeping him a major factor in the election. He could wind up spending billions on advertising in pursuit of the presidency, wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, who argued that whatever its political impact, it is a financially savvy move. \u201cAs an aging billionaire many times over, Mayor Bloomberg sees the clock ticking.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s fortune has been estimated at more than $60 billion. Whatever he doesn\u2019t spend or give away will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax. So if he spends $5 billion to get to the White House, the US Treasury will ultimately lose out on $2 billion in taxes, McCaffery pointed out. \u201cThis is in no way a condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg, who has presumably earned his money legally, and can spend it however he wants, again perfectly legally\u2026 It is, rather, a condemnation of a tax system that both allows some billionaires to amass wealth and to spend it, tax free and with no questions asked.\u201d For more on politics: Todd Graham: In South Carolina, an underdog came out on top Julian Zelizer: Reagan vs. Carter holds a crucial lesson for 2020 Dems Jill Filipovic: For once, Michael Bloomberg had a good night Merrill Brown: Michael Bloomberg\u2019s other problem The onetime Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault and rape charges that could send him to prison for a minimum of five years. It was a win for the #MeToo movement, wrote Caroline Polisi. The \u201cverdict will encourage more victims of sexual assault to come forward and report their abuse, with the knowledge that although the road to justice will not be easy, it will at least be a possibility. And that is so much more than they ever had before.\u201d Two things have to happen now, wrote Kara Alaimo. There needs to be more visibility about non-disclosure agreements that have been used to bury allegations against powerful abusers, she said. \u201cSecond, lawmakers need to help victims learn their rights and avenues for redress \u2013 especially those who are most disenfranchised. If it\u2019s hard for Hollywood actresses like Ashley Judd \u2013 whose sexual harassment case against Weinstein was thrown out of court by a judge and characterized as not justified by Weinstein\u2019s attorney \u2013 to pursue justice, consider how difficult it would be for people with far fewer resources.\u201d Wazhma Frogh is nearly 40 but she can\u2019t forget the raid on her Kabul public school when she was in fifth grade. \u201cI still remember the exact words of those bearded men, Kalashnikovs on their shoulders, batons in their hand \u2013 as they yelled, \u2018Get out of here. Girls don\u2019t belong in schools!\u2019 I can even remember the cries of several of our teachers, who were wearing skirts and were beaten in their legs, as the Mujahedeen shouted that their skirt wearing days were over.\u201d It was the start of a civil war that closed down the schools. Frogh, now the leader of the Women and Peace Studies organization in Kabul, wrote that she \u201cnever saw my classmates or my teachers ever again.\u201d She argued that, as the US embarks on a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, it\u2019s vital that the experience of the early 1990s \u2013 \u201cwhen civil war and extremist forces came to dominate our politics and our lives\u201d \u2013 not be repeated. Peter Bergen wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. \u201cFor the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and he could just as easily pull the plug entirely.\u201d The agreement calls for a full withdrawal over a 14-month period but officials say that is dependent on what the Taliban does.

When she was told that women didn\u2019t participate in the briefings at NASA; she asked whether there was a law against it. There wasn\u2019t. So Katherine started attending briefings.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Chrissy Houlahan is the US Democratic representative from Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th District. She is the New Democrat Coalition\u2019s freshman leader. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Dear Iowa and New Hampshire voters, You will have immense influence over who our 2020 presidential Democratic nominee will be. There are many compelling candidates from which to choose, but on behalf of Democrats everywhere, I ask one important thing: Send us someone who can win a state like mine in the general election this November. I represent a competitive district in Pennsylvania, one of the battleground states that decided the last election and could very well decide this one. And Pennsylvania isn\u2019t alone. If less than 80,000 well-placed votes across three states \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 had changed in 2016, Hillary Clinton would be president. And no matter what early polls are saying right now, President Donald Trump could win these states again. To help in your decision, let me tell you a little bit about the state I come from. Like the other so-called \u201cBlue Wall\u201d states, Pennsylvania voted for every Democratic presidential nominee from 1992 to 2012. That was before falling to Trump by a scant 44,000 votes in 2016. Interestingly, in the county encompassing Pittsburgh, Clinton outperformed President Barack Obama, and in the county encompassing Philadelphia, Clinton came close to Obama\u2019s turnout. What Trump could do to the Iowa caucus Compared with 2012, the problem wasn\u2019t turnout in urban areas. Rather, Trump overperformed in several high-turnout rural counties in Pennsylvania. So, how do we beat Trump in 2020? The same way Democrats in swing districts like mine did in 2018 across the country: by staying mindful of the middle-class jobs that are supporting small towns and rural America across the county. A quick example is trade. Many of the farmers I know are by nature independent. They aren\u2019t tied to partisan loyalty and might vote for a Democrat, but not if many Democrats appear to reflexively believe that all trade deals are bad. The simple fact is that farmers need better trade agreements to sell their goods. We have to show them we\u2019re ready to help. In Pennsylvania, our mushroom farms are woven into the fabric of Pennsylvania life, but they\u2019re struggling. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs have raised packaging costs, while the ongoing trade war has put them on their heels against overseas competition. Michael Bloomberg: Starting with Iowa and New Hampshire hurts Democrats and helps Trump It isn\u2019t just Pennsylvania, either. Two dairy farms are closing every day in Wisconsin, another important swing state, in part because of Trump\u2019s trade policies. Farmers know what\u2019s happening. Rural Americans live the reality that other Americans read about only in the headlines. That\u2019s going to matter, and Democrats need to speak to those concerns. Take health care as another example. For years, union workers collectively fought for the best health care benefits among middle-class families nationwide. Many sacrificed raises and other benefits to do so. Those same workers will not be willing to trade those victories in for a single-payer Medicare for All plan. It may not be as good as the coverage they already have and may come with higher taxes for the middle class. The way to win on health care is by building on the Affordable Care Act to cover everyone, making sure people can keep their employer coverage, and most importantly, lowering people\u2019s out-of-pocket costs. That\u2019s true for union workers in Pennsylvania. But make no mistake, it will also be true in Michigan, which voted for Trump by less than 12,000 votes and has a tremendous union presence.  Trust me. I help lead the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus of forward-looking Democrats in the House, which includes members who flipped seats blue in 2018 \u2013 ushering in a new Democratic majority. They won by meeting voters where they are on issues like trade and health care, and proposing practical, pragmatic solutions for the American people. If we are to win back the White House, this is how we will get it done. To the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, please keep that in mind when it comes time to vote in February.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In the hours after the Pentagon announced the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani on Thursday, \u201cWorld War III\u201d was trending on Twitter. Traffic to the US Selective Service, the agency that would be responsible for any eventual military draft, spiked so high that the website crashed. Also trending was \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d the 1997 movie that conjured up the notion of a president trying to distract from a scandal by spreading news of overseas conflict. Remarkably, that dark comedy was officially released just days before news broke about President Bill Clinton\u2019s real-life scandal, his relationship with a White House intern. That scandal played out as the US fired missiles at Iraq and resulted in an impeachment trial in the Senate.  \u201cWag the Dog\u201d became a pop culture meme, and some of President Donald Trump\u2019s critics trotted it out to question the timing of the killing of Soleimani, who commanded Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force. It\u2019s much more complicated. \u201cThe significance of Thursday\u2019s US strike against Qasem Soleimani cannot be overstated because he ran Iran\u2019s military operations across the Middle East,\u201d Peter Bergen wrote. \u201cSoleimani also oversaw operations against US servicemen in Iraq by Shia militias in which hundreds of American servicemen were killed following the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.\u201d The general had \u201cthe blood of many Americans on his hands.\u201d Retired US Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling noted, \u201cWhile the Ayatollah Ali Khameini once described Iran\u2019s premier general as his \u2018living martyr,\u2019 most Americans \u2013 myself included \u2013 and many Iraqis, Kurds and Syrians who faced him and his forces on the battlefield will describe Soleimani as a mass murderer, a war criminal, a terrorist and a despicable demon.\u201d Soleimani\u2019s killing was a sharp escalation in an already tumultuous conflict. It came days after protesters stormed the US embassy compound in Baghdad in response to American airstrikes on an Iranian-backed militia. Christiane Amanpour wrote that Soleimaini was \u201ca shadowy spymaster mythologized among Shiites and loathed by Iran\u2019s American adversaries\u201d and the world is watching \u201cto see how and where Iran retaliates after three days of official mourning end.\u201d The key question now: \u201cWhat\u2019s the strategy against Iran? In the words of a former UK ambassador in the region, does the Trump administration have a plan to prevent this killing from being more than just \u2018drive-by adventurism\u2019?\u201d Writing before the general was targeted, Aaron David Miller noted \u201cthe inconsistency and vulnerability of the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward both Iran and Iraq. Like a modern-day Gulliver, President Trump is metaphorically wandering around a Middle East where he\u2019d rather not be, tied up both by smaller powers whose interests are not his own \u2014 and by America\u2019s illusions about the region, perpetuated by Trump who somehow believes he can force Iran to bend to his will.\u201d American officials justified the strike by saying Soleimani was developing plans to attack American interests, but legal experts questioned it. \u201cAssassination cannot be justified by the law of self-defense,\u201d wrote Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, a professor at Notre Dame\u2019s law school. \u201cTrump is not the first president to carry out drone assassinations in violation of international law,\u201d she noted. But \u201che has taken the practice to a new level of lawlessness.\u201d The Soleimani killing grabbed headlines hours after news broke of a previously redacted email linking President Donald Trump directly to the controversial withholding of congressionally approved lethal aid from Ukraine, the matter at the heart of the impeachment articles voted by the House. \u201cWhatever praise or condemnation President Trump is drawing from the latest US actions in the Middle East, they in no way diminish the power of the legal bombshell that just exploded in the United States with new evidence of his behavior regarding Ukraine,\u201d observed Frida Ghitis. \u201cIf Trump had a coherent explanation, a viable defense, he would put it forward. He doesn\u2019t. The more we learn, the guiltier he looks. That\u2019s why he blocks every release of information, blacks out key pieces in court-ordered document releases.\u201d When the New York Times reported that three top administration officials tried in vain to talk Trump out of withholding the Ukraine aid, Elie Honig warned, \u201cthis is a cover-up, unfolding right before us.\u201d The three officials \u201chonored Trump\u2019s blanket instruction to executive branch officials not to testify \u2026 It is precisely because of the crucial missing evidence that we need a real trial in the Senate.\u201d That trial is on hold, awaiting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision on when to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate.

Investigators later found anti-Semitic journal entries in the attacker\u2019s home, indicating that the stabbings were the latest in a series of purposeful attacks on Jews. Frimet Goldberger, a former member of a Hasidic community in New York, wrote, \u201cwhile the Hasidic community is reeling, it is also resilient.\u201d The community \u201cis one where everyone knows everyone, and where one person\u2019s woe is the community\u2019s affliction,\u201d she added. \u201cTheir togetherness is such that one mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis is a call for communal prayer and for a clamoring of balabustas (\u2018homemakers\u2019) to deliver meals and ease the patient\u2019s burden,\u201d Goldberger said. \u201cIt is a community that desperately needs our support now \u2014 from Americans and Jews everywhere alike.\u201d \u201cIf you think this is a New York problem, or a Jewish problem \u2014 or perhaps a far-right, or a far-left, or a black or white problem \u2014 you should think again,\u201d observed Frida Ghitis. \u201cAnti-Semitism is a symptom of a larger societal problem. Sure, when Jews are unsafe, it is they who are most at risk, but Jews are the canary in the coalmine, an early warning sign of a community or a nation losing its moorings. The coalmine is filling with toxic fumes.\u201d Meanwhile, West Virginia authorities pushed back strongly against one episode of symbolism associated with hate, noted Jill Filipovic: \u201cThere is a tiny bit of good news at the tail end of the trash fire that was 2019. A Nazi salute will, in some corners of America, get you fired.\u201d The members of a class of correctional cadets in West Virginia, along with several staff members were dismissed after they were photographed appearing to give such a salute. Actress and TV host Ricki Lake posted on social media about her struggle with hair loss and shared a photo of her shaved head. \u201cLake has set a brave example by talking about her hair loss and candidly revealing her fears,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas. \u201cWhile it is a shame that she felt she needed to explain her decision to cut her hair \u2014 and incredibly likely that, had she not, it would have prompted speculation \u2014 one advantage of doing so on social media is that she is able to control the narrative. \u201cHaving spent years presenting a version of herself which, as she put it, caused \u2018deep pain and trauma,\u2019 she was finally able to be \u2018liberated.\u2019 Lake\u2019s fears illustrate how damaging stigmas of appearances can be, perhaps more than appearances themselves. Here\u2019s hoping her decision can spur others to choose the same form of freedom.\u201d Theresa Brown: What AI reading of mammograms could do for women Gayatri Devi: A new way to think about Alzheimer\u2019s disease Jeffrey Sachs: What\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s nonsense on windmills and light bulbs Don Lincoln: Will Betelgeuse go supernova?

And so, it was only natural to take stock and compile lists. We took the opportunity to look back at 100 op-eds from the first decade of CNN Opinion, curated by Pat Wiedenkeller, with the aid of Laura Juncadella and Margaret Vorhaben. Jane Carr looked back at the highlights of the year in culture and Yaffa Fredrick corralled predictions from our contributors about what will happen in 2020. John Sutter traced the discouraging story of the decade\u2019s impact on climate change but found a big ray of hope: \u201cyoung people are waking up. They are shouting, loudly and with purpose.\u201d Former President Barack Obama released his annual year-end reading list and, as Dean Obeidallah observed, it made for quite a contrast with the books President Trump has been touting. \u201cWhile the books that Obama recommends will make readers more well-rounded and informed, Trump\u2019s list is filled with books that will make the reader angrier and more supportive of Trump.\u201d In the Washington Post, humorist Dave Barry provided an acid-laced year in review: \u201cCan we say anything good about 2019? Was there any positive news, a silver lining, a reason to feel hopeful about the future \u2014 to believe that we, as Americans, can recognize our common interests, overcome our differences and work together to build a better tomorrow, for ourselves, for our children and for the world? \u201cNah.\u201d",

More than 65.5 million people have cast their votes for next week\u2019s presidential election, already more than the total number of early voters in 2016. As we enter the last mail-in voting stretch, a federal judge has ordered the US Postal Service to ensure ballots are delivered quickly ahead of voting deadlines by allowing extra and late delivery trips. Meanwhile, President Trump tried to appeal to women voters during a campaign rally in Lansing, Michigan, last night. He also attacked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u00a0and appeared to both downplay and take credit for thwarting the recent plot to kidnap her. The Trump campaign also suffered an attack of its own when its campaign website was briefly defaced in an apparent hack. In Georgia, Joe Biden gave a closing argument at the home where FDR healed from polio, saying the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d is at stake in this election. There are 44 potential Covid-19 vaccines in human trials, but experts say we may not know which ones work best \u2013 or whether they work at all \u2013 until after people start getting them. That may mean settling for a vaccine that prevents severe infections instead of providing outright immunity. The Trump administration is set to announce soon that Medicare and Medicaid will cover out-of-pocket costs for any potential coronavirus vaccine that\u2019s granted emergency use authorization. And help can\u2019t come soon enough. More than half of US states reported their highest daily number of coronavirus cases ever this month. Some areas are back to the way they were at the first dark peak of the pandemic, with packed ICUs, taxed medical systems and victims\u2019 remains filling refrigerated units. Demonstrators took to the streets of Philadelphia for a second night after the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. The 27-year-old Black man was killed Monday during a confrontation in West Philadelphia. His family said he suffered from bipolar disorder and was in crisis at the time. Some largely peaceful protests in the city devolved into violence and looting, leading police to ask residents in some districts to stay indoors. City officials acknowledge the shooting raises questions and are investigating. The case draws fresh attention to fatal use of force by police after months of protests over how officers treat Black people. The US economy has rebounded over the last few months, but experts worry the recovery is losing steam. To add to the uncertainty, the ongoing stimulus scuffle in Washington could lead to further pain in struggling sectors like the travel industry and among small businesses if aid isn\u2019t issued soon. A CNN analysis shows hotel occupancy is 29% below pre-crisis levels, and OpenTable reservations are down 56% from before the pandemic. If the 2009 recession is any measure, it could take the airline industry five years to recover from the economic toll of the pandemic. Eased coronavirus restrictions have boosted oil demand, and oil companies like BP have seen slim profits. But with Covid-19 cases on the rise again, the oil sector\u2019s slow recovery could reverse course at any minute. A judicial panel in Lagos, Nigeria, has begun hearings into the killing last week of activists protesting police brutality. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that at least 12 demonstrators were shot dead at two places in the city last Tuesday by soldiers, who then took the bodies away. Witnesses also say they saw the killings. The Nigerian army claimed on Twitter that these reports were \u201cfake news.\u201d Protests gripped Nigeria\u2019s largest city for two weeks as people called for the end of the country\u2019s Special Anti Robbery Squad, or SARS, which has been accused of serious human rights violations. Amnesty says at least 56 people have died across the country since protests began. The judicial panel will look into the claims against SARS, which was disbanded earlier this month, and investigate last week\u2019s deaths.

Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Votes are already rolling in in the New Hampshire primaries, the second stop on the campaign trail for the tight pack of Democratic presidential candidates. Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is the favorite to win the contest, but Sen.\u00a0Amy Klobuchar is hoping a recent surge in the state will help deliver a surprise showing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former VP Joe Biden, who both had disappointing results in Iowa, hope\u00a0New Hampshire voters put\u00a0the wind back in their campaign sails. The bottom line? Iowa didn\u2019t produce a clear front-runner, so New Hampshire may be the place to do it\u00a0(still,\u00a0Sanders leads a new national primary poll, followed by Biden and Michael Bloomberg, who\u2019s not on the New Hampshire ballot). Meanwhile, President Trump held a rally last night in New Hampshire, continuing to try to draw\u00a0attention away from the Democratic contest. The number of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus has risen to more than 1,000, with all but two of those deaths in mainland China. The WHO has arrived in China to help control the epidemic and hopefully usher in a larger international team soon. Today also marks the end of the quarantine period for the first group of American evacuees from Wuhan, who have been staying at California\u2019s March Air Reserve Base since late January. No signs of the coronavirus were\u00a0detected among the group. Across the Pacific, another group of Americans isn\u2019t so lucky: 24 Americans are among the 135 people diagnosed with coronavirus aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, now quarantined in Japanese waters with more than 3,000 passengers. The White House has submitted a $4.8 trillion federal budget proposal for 2021, and some of the provisions are sure to invite controversy. The proposal would slash billions of dollars in federal support from Medicaid, food stamps and other safety net programs for the poor, while largely sparing the Medicare program that benefits seniors. It would also eliminate an existing student loan forgiveness program for\u00a0public workers, which provides\u00a0quite the contrast to\u00a0Democratic candidates who are touting sweeping student loan forgiveness programs on the campaign trail. NASA would get a $25 billion boost from Trump\u2019s\u00a0plan, with the aim of sending astronauts back to the moon by 2024.\u00a0All in all, despite calling for major cuts, the budget would fail to eliminate the national deficit over the next 10\u00a0years. While some of the budget provisions could pass the Democratic House, others, like the elimination of the student loan forgiveness plan, will have a much harder time getting through. Germany\u2019s political future is mired in uncertainty after longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s hand-picked successor, Annegret\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer, unexpectedly announced that she will not run for chancellor in the 2021 general election. Merkel, who has led Germany for 15 years, is not planning to run for reelection. But\u00a0if\u00a0Kramp-Karrenbauer won\u2019t fill her shoes, that leaves the contest open for more right-leaning leaders (and their far-right allies) to step in and drastically change the direction of German\u00a0politics. This new destabilization probably means\u00a0Germany will be focusing on its own issues in the coming months, which is bad news for the European Union. Germany is a major power in the bloc, which is looking for strong leaders now that the UK has pulled out.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump unveiled two controversial rules on Friday aimed at reducing drug prices \u2013 a last-ditch effort to fulfill a key 2016 promise that immediately sparked legal threats from the pharmaceutical industry and condemnation from Democrats. If the two measures announced Friday survive legal challenges, they will radically transform the nation\u2019s drug price system. One will have Medicare pay the same price for certain expensive prescription drugs as other developed nations, a \u201cmost-favored-nation price.\u201d The other will effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers \u2013 a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies will be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. During a 22-minute press conference, Trump ran through a laundry list of drug price efforts his administration undertook in his four years in office. Many, however, remain in the proposal stage, were stopped by courts or had little impact. Prices have continued to rise, though the pace has slowed under his presidency. He also alluded to the fact that he may not be in office next year. \u201cI just hope they keep it. I hope they have the courage to keep because the powerful drug lobby, Big Pharma, is putting pressure on people like you would not believe,\u201d Trump said, referencing one of the rules. The new rules come just days after Pfizer and Moderna announced the results of their coronavirus vaccine trials. The President accused the companies earlier Friday of withholding the news until after the election in retaliation for his efforts to reduce drug prices. The rules stem from a series of executive orders Trump released in July and September. The most-favored-nation rule allows the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other countries \u2013 since Congress has banned Medicare from negotiating with drug makers. Other nations typically pay far less for medications, in large part because their governments often determine the cost \u2013 which runs counter to Republicans\u2019 allegiance to the free market system. Though Trump has slammed socialist health care systems that exist in other countries and attacked his Democratic rivals for seeking to implement such a setup here, he has celebrated linking US prices to peer nations\u2019 lower costs. \u201cIn short, with this rule, the head of the Republican Party is endorsing the proposition that Americans should not pay higher prices than do the citizens of other countries \u2013 and he is willing to endorse adopting European price controls to reduce prices here,\u201d tweeted Rachel Sachs, an associate law professor at Washington University. The model, which will operate for seven years, will test paying the most-favored-nation price for 50 Medicare Part B drugs that are administered in doctors\u2019 offices. These medications account for about 73% of Part B drug spending. This will replace the current system, which pays the average sales price plus a 6% add on. The rule, which takes effect at the start of 2021, could save patients $28 billion. The President\u2019s executive order in July expanded the initiative to include certain Part D drugs sold at pharmacies, but Friday\u2019s rule only referenced Part B medications. The Part D version is under development, said Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump first outlined an International Pricing Index proposal to set Medicare reimbursement levels for certain drugs on their cost in other countries in October 2018, seeking to bolster Republicans\u2019 standing on health care days before the midterm election. It called for the \u201ctarget price\u201d to be 126% of the average of what other countries pay. The second rule will effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers \u2013 a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies will be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. On Friday, HHS said that patients may be able to save nearly 30%. It will affect patients whose out-of-pocket costs are tied to a drug\u2019s list price \u2013 for instance, those who must meet a deductible, use a drug not covered by their insurance or pay co-insurance that is tied to the list price. Those with high medication costs will benefit the most. However, the Trump administration backed down from issuing this rule last year after it was found to raise costs for seniors and the federal government. The proposed rule was expected to raise Medicare premiums, while only saving money for the 30% of Medicare Part D enrollees who spend a lot on medication, according to the administration\u2019s estimates from 2019. It would also have cost the federal government $177 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump\u2019s executive order in July called for putting this rule in place but only if it didn\u2019t increase costs. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Friday that there were a wide range of actuarial estimates, some which of which showed the rule would produce savings. He doesn\u2019t believe the measure will hike premiums based on trends in rebates and premiums over the past 15 years. Experts took issue with this claim. \u201cDespite actual analysis of the effect of this rule on spending and premiums showing HUGE increases, Azar says it won\u2019t matter because he just knows,\u201d tweeted Stacie Dusetzina, associate health policy professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. It will take effect at the start of 2022. Pharmaceutical industry groups immediately criticized the rules, promising to consider all options to stop the measures. PhRMA, the drug makers\u2019 lobbying group, said that the most-favored-nation rule will threaten medical innovation in the US and harm patients. \u201cIt defies logic that the administration is blindly proceeding with a \u2018most favored nation\u2019 policy that gives foreign governments the upper hand in deciding the value of medicines in the United States,\u201d said PhRMA CEO Stephen J. Ubl. \u201cHistory proves that when governments take unilateral action to set prices, it disrupts patient access to treatments, discourages investment in new medicines and threatens jobs and economic growth. Industry organizations representing insurers and pharmacy benefit managers slammed the rebate rule. \u201cSimply put, the [Health and Human Services] Secretary\u2019s decision to advance the previously withdrawn rebate rule will drastically increase Medicare Part D beneficiary premiums and taxpayer costs,\u201d said JC Scott, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers. \u201cPCMA will explore all possible litigation options to stop the rule from taking effect and destabilizing the Medicare Part D program that millions of beneficiaries rely on.\u201d House Democratic leaders, who have put forth their own plan to reduce drug prices, lashed out at Trump. \u201cWhile the coronavirus surges across the country, President Trump is spending his twilight days in office pushing through half-baked proposals that will likely be struck down in court because he\u2019s desperate to cover up his administration\u2019s failure to actually lower drug prices,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. of New Jersey and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden lambasted the Trump administration\u2019s argument in the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down, calling it \u201csimply cruel and needlessly divisive\u201d and saying that doing so would leave 20 million Americans\u2019 health coverage \u201cripped away in the middle of the nation\u2019s worst pandemic in a century.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear about what\u2019s at stake: The consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s argument are not academic or an abstraction. For many Americans, they are a matter of life and death, in a literal sense,\u201d Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cThis isn\u2019t hyperbole. It\u2019s real \u2013 as real as it gets,\u201d he said. The speech comes the day Supreme Court justices heard oral arguments in a case that seeks to invalidate the landmark health reform law. They will likely take initial votes at their private Friday conference and begin the process of writing opinions, though a decision isn\u2019t expected until the first half of 2021.   Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said the case is \u201ca blatant attempt to overturn the will of the people,\u201d pointing out that Biden campaigned on protecting Obamacare and won the most popular votes in the history of the United States. \u201cI know we all know that we just had an election in America \u2013 an election where health care was very much on the ballot. Our country had a clear choice in this election,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEach and every vote for Joe Biden was a statement that health care in America should be a right and not a privilege. Each and every vote for Joe Biden was a vote to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, not to tear it away in the midst of a global pandemic.\u201d Both laid out the benefits of the landmark health reform law, with Harris stressing Obamacare\u2019s advancements for women, including barring insurers from charging women more and from considering pregnancy to be a pre-existing condition. Also, she pointed out, the Affordable Care Act provides free birth control. Biden also noted that millions of coronavirus survivors could be labeled as having a pre-existing condition if Obamacare falls, making it harder for them to obtain affordable coverage in the future. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is looking to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law. And even with Biden set to take office on January 20, there is little he can do: Even if his administration switches sides and argues in favor of Obamacare, the case will continue because the original lawsuit was brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general. Protecting Obamacare was a central theme of Biden\u2019s campaign. During the Democratic primary, he argued for expanding the law by adding a \u201cpublic option\u201d that would allow Americans to buy into a government-run health insurance plan and by beefing up federal premium subsidies that would make Affordable Care Act coverage more affordable. He opposed more progressive rivals\u2019 push to scrap private insurance entirely in favor of a single-payer, \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-type system. The President-elect promised to start working with Congress in January to implement his health care agenda as soon as possible. His transition team plans to start fleshing out the details soon. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything in our power to ease the burden of health care on you and your families,\u201d Biden said, noting, in a nod to progressives, that health care is a right for all. \u201cThat starts by building on the Affordable Care Act with the dramatic expansion of health care coverage and bold steps to lower health care costs.\u201d Trump\u2019s administration and the Republican-led House and Senate failed to repeal Obamacare during Trump\u2019s first two years in Congress. Trump and the GOP in late 2017 did enact a tax law that gutted Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate by setting the penalty for not having insurance at $0. Trump\u2019s administration later joined the Republican-led states who argued in court that Congress\u2019 action rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional, and since it\u2019s a linchpin of the Affordable Care Act, the entire law should be invalidated. Tuesday\u2019s speech comes as Biden\u2019s transition becomes more contentious, with Trump refusing to concede and making a series of baseless claims that seek to undermine the legitimacy of the election. His administration has not yet taken the legal step necessary to allow the transition process to begin by giving Biden\u2019s team access to $6.3 million set aside for the process, as well as access to federal agencies.

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden made the pitch that he was the most electable Democrat during the primary season. It was a big reason why primary voters ultimately nominated him. A look at the still compiling returns demonstrates that Democrats made the right bet. Biden is projected to win an election that another Democrat, especially a more liberal one, may very well have lost. While Biden is leading in states worth 306 electoral votes, the race for president was actually decided on a razor\u2019s edge. Biden and President Donald Trump ended up within a few points of each other in the states that made the difference. Biden is currently ahead by less than a point in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Without winning at least some combination of these states, Biden would not be able to reach the necessary 270 electoral votes to win the election. Track the presidential election results The fact that the election was closer than pre-election polls indicated might be used as an indictment of Biden. It shouldn\u2019t be. Compare how Biden is doing to Democratic House candidates in each of these states. If Biden were a weaker candidate than average, these Democrats should, on the whole, be outrunning Biden. The opposite happened: Biden is outrunning the House Democrats in all these pivotal states. More to the point, Republican candidates for the House are actually getting more votes than their Democratic counterparts in all these states. As of this writing, the margin is less than 10,000 in Arizona, while it\u2019s over 90,000 in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Note: Democrats and Republicans had a candidate on the ballot for each House race in these states.) In other words, it seems quite conceivable that the baseline Democrat may not have actually won the states that he or she would have needed to win the Electoral College. The pattern of Biden doing better than Democratic House candidates was seen in the national House and presidential popular vote, as well. This matched pre-election polling in which Biden\u2019s lead over Trump was larger than the Democratic advantage on the generic congressional ballot. As I noted before, it is unusual for an challenger in a presidential race to run ahead of his party in the race for House control when his  party controls the House. The reason being that you\u2019d expect Trump and the House Democrats to have some sort of an incumbency advantage. Obviously, it is difficult to disentangle why Biden was running ahead of the congressional Democrats. It could be because Biden was unusually strong or Trump was unusually weak. It\u2019s probably a bit of both. What is clear is that Biden was liked by the electorate. Biden\u2019s favorable rating was above his unfavorable in pre-election polling. The national exit poll showed Biden with a 52% favorable rating to 46% unfavorable rating. Biden won because he took almost all of the voters (94%) who had a favorable view of him. That was in sharp contrast to four years ago when Hillary Clinton\u2019s unfavorable rating was above her favorable rating in the exit polls. Just 43% of voters held a favorable view of Clinton. This was above Trump\u2019s (38%), but it left 18% of the electorate with an unfavorable rating of both Clinton and Trump. Trump won those voters by 17 points. Biden, simply put, closed the door on Trump\u2019s making this a contest between the lesser of two evils. One (of a number of reasons) that Biden was better liked than Clinton may have had to do with ideology. Biden was seen as more moderate than Trump by voters in pre-election polling. This stood in contrast to Trump being viewed as more moderate than Clinton in 2016. Biden, of course, ran as a mainstream Democrat. Biden used his ideological position as an argument for his candidacy during the primary season when he ran a few points stronger than Sens. Bernie Sanders and especially Elizabeth Warren in general election polling. Biden\u2019s belief was backed up by years of research suggestive of the fact that candidates on the ends of the ideological spectrum tend to do worse. You could see this play out in races like that for Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Biden easily took the district by nearly 7 points and earned himself an extra electoral vote in a state that awards an electoral vote to the winner of each of its congressional districts. The Democratic candidate for the House, Kara Eastman, wasn\u2019t so fortunate. She lost by 6 points to Republican Rep. Don Bacon. The fact that there was such a strong difference between the House and presidential voting patterns in an age of tremendous polarization is telling. Eastman was backed by the progressive groups Justice Democrats and stood for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d That distinction between Biden and the left may have made all the difference in what ended up being a presidential race that took four days to call. Without Biden at the top of the ticket, Trump may very well have stunned the world again and earned a second term in the White House.",

We are supposed to talk about things in the way where we mean what we\u2019re talking about. If we don\u2019t mean we should defund the police, we shouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d 2) The talk of socialism Again, Spanberger: \u201cWe want to talk about funding social services, and ensuring good engagement in community policing, let\u2019s talk about what we are for. And we need to not ever use the words \u2018socialist\u2019 or \u2018socialism\u2019 ever again. Because while people think it doesn\u2019t matter, it does matter.

Her race, like that of many House Democrats representing suburban areas \u2013 Spanberger\u2019s seat includes the western suburbs of Richmond \u2013 was far closer than most pre-election predictions suggested. The Cook Political Report, for example, rated Spanberger\u2019s seat as \u201clean Democratic.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Broadly understood, Spanberger was blasting liberals in the House Democratic conference for advocating policies and views that might be popular in their overwhelmingly Democratic districts but that endangered their colleagues in swing seats, where the majority is typically won and lost. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most visible liberals in the party, immediately pushed back on the notion that liberals hurt swing district Democrats in 2020. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell the Black, Brown, & youth organizers riding in to save us every election to be quiet or not have their reps champion them when they need us,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cOr wonder why they don\u2019t show up for midterms when they\u2019re scolded for existing. Esp when they\u2019re delivering victories.\u201d Added AOC: \u201cAnd btw I\u2019m happy to cede ground on things that aren\u2019t working in some areas! But finger pointing is not gonna help. There\u2019s real workable & productive paths here if the party is open to us.\u201d What\u2019s beyond debate is that Republican strategists took comments made by liberals within the Democratic Party and used them to blast everyone from Spanberger on down. As Parker Poling, the lead staffer at the House Republican campaign arm, told me on Thursday about the messaging that worked for her side in the election: \u201cIf you put all of the messages into a single broad category, it would be the extreme leftward lurch of the Democrat Party. That was messaged in different ways in different districts. In New York state, bail reform was extremely unpopular and meshed well with defund the police, so a public safety angle was the most effective. In some districts, it was \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 and the loss of private health insurance. In a number of suburban districts, we talked about pocketbook issues like higher taxes under Biden. And in other districts, we focused on the extremism of the \u2018Green New Deal.\u2019 And in south Florida especially, it was socialism more broadly. All of those messages fit within the rubric of extremism.\u201d The question is whether the party \u2013 almost certain now to have a professed moderate in Joe Biden in the White House \u2013 will listen to the likes of Spanberger or continue to move leftward, driven in that direction by AOC and other high-profile liberals. Will they seek to pass centrist legislation that has a chance of passing in what will likely be a Republican-controlled Senate and being signed by Biden? Or does the left push for the boldest possible progressive legislation \u2013 and let the chips fall where they may in the Senate? Which way Democrats go strategically will have a real effect on their fate in the 2022 midterms \u2013 not to mention the 2024 election. CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The biggest surprise of the 2020 election wasn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s likely loss to Joe Biden or even Senate Republicans\u2019 seeming ability to keep their majority intact. It was that House Republicans, facing predictions from the political prognosticators of potential double-digit seat losses, will wind up picking up seats when all the votes are counted. How did they do it? And why were so many independent analysts so wrong? I put those questions to Parker Poling, the executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s House campaign arm. Our conversation \u2013 conducted via email and lightly edited for flow \u2013 is below. Cillizza: Every political handicapper predicted losses for House Republicans on Tuesday. That didn\u2019t happen. Were you surprised? Why or why not? Poling: We were surprised but not shocked. Basing your informed opinions on public polls or data that is selectively shared with you is a fundamentally flawed way to handicap, but we\u2019ll see what accountability measures exist for that. Clearly the Democrat conference is starting their own autopsy to try to figure out where their data operation went wrong. Our polling and modeled data of absentee and early vote returns said we realistically had a path to pick up seats. At our final staff meeting before the election, our consensus was that we would net +4 seats. Our data showed that we were within striking distance in nearly every competitive race, with most of them trending in our direction. The President closed strong in our battleground districts and our candidates had their own unique appeal that won late deciding voters. Cillizza: Did you see a single message or issue break through with voters in swing districts? Was there an attack that particularly hurt Democrats? Poling: If you put all of the messages into a single broad category, it would be the extreme leftward lurch of the Democrat Party. That was messaged in different ways in different districts. In New York state, bail reform was extremely unpopular and meshed well with defund the police, so a public safety angle was the most effective. In some districts, it was \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the loss of private health insurance. In a number of suburban districts, we talked about pocketbook issues like higher taxes under Biden. And in other districts, we focused on the extremism of the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d And in south Florida especially, it was socialism more broadly. All of those messages fit within the rubric of extremism. Cillizza: President Trump was a major anchor for House Republicans in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms. Why wasn\u2019t he this time? Poling: I disagree with the premise of your question. Many of President Trump\u2019s voters (8.5 million, to be more exact) stayed home in 2018. Those are by and large votes for House Republicans as well, which would have more than kept us in the majority. Yes, base Democrats in the midterms were motivated by animus toward the President to turn out, but Democrat candidates ran and won because they had no voting record that was tied to Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and the far left of their party. Their candidates got to portray themselves as whatever they wanted and that helped them win independent and persuadable voters. When the President\u2019s supporters didn\u2019t match base Democrats turnout and they won independents, it was easy to see how they won in both Trump territory and districts Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. They showed up again in 2020 and independents broke to our candidates when these Democrats exposed their ties to the extreme of their party. Cillizza: Polling was, again, way off \u2013 particularly at the House district level. Why? And how do you fix it? Poling: Not all polling was wrong. There are polls either the NRCC, our candidates or allied groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund released publicly in every one of our pickup districts that showed where we would win. I think there ought to be a real reckoning in the media and among the prognosticators about why they believed Democrat partisan polling more than Republican partisan polling. In general, most of our competitive races were within the margin of error. Democrats kept saying they were beating some of our incumbents, and our data was not showing that. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cThe biggest lesson for House Republicans out of the 2020 election was ________.\u201d Now, explain. Poling: \u201cThe biggest lesson for House Republicans out of the 2020 election was this is a center-right country.\u201d The American people, and particularly swing voters, want to elect representatives who reflect the values this country was founded on. They will reject radical propositions like defunding the police and destroying the American economy. They want to safely reopen the country. Those are the values reflected by House Republicans and our candidates.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration took another step to weaken the Affordable Care Act with Election Day looming, approving Georgia\u2019s controversial request to make fundamental changes to its Obamacare exchange. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Sunday gave the state permission to stop using the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, for enrollment in the individual market and shift to a private sector Georgia Access Model, starting in 2023. Supreme Court threat looms over Obamacare open enrollment State officials argue that the move will give residents access to a broader array of options from web brokers, health insurance companies and agents \u2013 which will have a greater incentive to enroll consumers in coverage. They estimate the waiver will lower premiums and increase enrollment by 25,000 people. Advocates, however, fear that it could shift healthier people to less comprehensive, non-Obamacare plans and leave those with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums for Affordable Care Act policies. Plus, consumers could unknowingly sign up for skimpier policies. \u201cConsumer could end up in insurance plans that don\u2019t cover everything they think it would cover,\u201d said Tara Straw, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Share your story: How have you been helped or hurt by Obamacare? What\u2019s more, the Georgia waiver would eliminate residents\u2019 ability to go to a single website to see all their options. Instead, they would have to navigate a fragmented system of broker and insurers \u2013 similar to what existed prior to the landmark health reform law, Straw said. This would likely decrease coverage and raise premiums. The waiver does not meet the federal requirements for approval, including covering as many people with the same affordable and comprehensive coverage as without the waiver, Straw said. This will open up the approval to legal challenges. The agency opened the door for states to create alternatives to Obamacare in 2018. The Peach State, which has the nation\u2019s third highest uninsured rate at 13.4%, is the first to seek this enhanced power to reshape its individual market. About 433,000 Georgians were enrolled in Obamacare exchange plans, as of February, according to federal data. The approval came on the same day as open enrollment for 2021 began and 10 days before the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could bring down the law. The Trump administration is backing a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general, including Georgia\u2019s, who argue that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional after Congress reduced the penalty for not having insurance to zero as part of the 2017 tax cut law. As a result, the entire health reform law must fall, they argue. Health care has taken center stage in the 2020 presidential campaign. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has hammered President Donald Trump for trying to take down the law and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Trump has repeatedly said he has a replacement plan that would continue those safeguards but has yet to produce one. The administration has pursued multiple avenues to overturn the Affordable Care Act in its first term. After efforts to repeal the law in Congress failed in 2017, officials started undermining it from within, including shortening the annual enrollment period to obtain coverage on the exchanges and slashing the budget for outreach and assistance. It also broadened the availability of alternative plans, primarily short-term health insurance policies that typically have lower premiums but are allowed to base coverage and premiums on people\u2019s medical histories. Georgia also received permission Sunday to implement a reinsurance program, which typically reduces premiums by protecting insurers from high-cost patients. More than a dozen states have received federal approval to do this. Last month, the administration approved Georgia\u2019s waiver request to provide Medicaid coverage to certain low-income residents if they work or participate in other qualifying activities for at least 80 hours a month.",

            "article_content": "On Wednesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced rules for insurers to cover the cost of administering a Covid-19 vaccine when one is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Yet on the campaign trail, former Vice President Joe Biden has been warning that if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, as the Trump administration is attempting to do, vaccines would not necessarily be covered by insurance, and that many people will have to pay for them out of pocket. \u201c[O]verturning the ACA could mean that people have to pay to get Covid-19 vaccine once it\u2019s available,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s right. The law that says insurers are required to cover vaccines for free is the Affordable Care Act.\u201d When asked whether the authority to require that health plans cover a Covid vaccine depends on the ACA, a CMS spokesperson told CNN that its commitment to provide free vaccines \u201cis unwavering and would remain in place regardless of future court actions.\u201d Facts First: According to health experts, Biden is correct when it comes to private insurance. Without the ACA, experts say there is no mechanism for the federal government to guarantee that Covid-19 vaccines will be covered by private insurance plans. Trump\u2019s Justice Department is trying to overturn the ACA, a case for which the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in November. Experts say the administration\u2019s Wednesday announcement depends on the ACA as a legal framework, and that private insurance wouldn\u2019t be required to cover a Covid vaccine if the law were overturned. The ACA requires private health plans to cover a range of preventative care, including vaccines recommended by a committee in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under the ACA, health plans have one year to cover these services after a vaccine is recommended. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act \u2013 the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill passed in March \u2013 reduced that time for a coronavirus vaccine to just 15 days. According to health insurance expert and associate professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law John Cogan, this was the only significant change the CARES Act made to the existing law. \u201c[E]very other part \u2026 relies completely on the ACA,\u201d Cogan told CNN. Cogan, along with two other health experts CNN spoke with, also said that if the ACA were overturned it\u2019s unclear how health plans would be forced to cover a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cIf the ACA goes down the tubes, it\u2019s going to be a complete statutory mess,\u201d Cogan said. \u201c[If] the underlying ACA requirement were to go away, health plans would not be required to cover preventative services,\u201d Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNN. \u201cThe former vice president\u2019s statement is correct,\u201d Linda Blumberg, an institute fellow at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center, told CNN. \u201cThe authority comes from the ACA. The CARES Act references the ACA - if the ACA is no longer law, the CARES Act would not provide the federal authority to require insurers to [provide coverage for a coronavirus vaccine].\u201d In June 2018, the Trump administration chose not to defend key provisions of the ACA in a lawsuit brought by Texas and other Republican-led states, saying the law\u2019s individual mandate is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over the future of the ACA on November 10, one week after the presidential election.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama on Tuesday harshly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic and faulted him for turning the White House into a \u201chot zone.\u201d \u201cMore than 225,000 people in this\u00a0country are dead.\u00a0More than 100,000 small\u00a0businesses have closed.\u00a0Half a million jobs are gone in\u00a0Florida alone.\u00a0Think about that,\u201d Obama said, speaking from Orlando as he campaigned for Democratic nominee Joe Biden. He continued, \u201cAnd what\u2019s his closing argument?\u00a0That people are too focused on\u00a0Covid. He said this at one of his rallies. Covid, Covid, Covid, he\u2019s complaining. He\u2019s jealous of Covid\u2019s media coverage. If he had been focused on Covid from the beginning, cases wouldn\u2019t be reaching new record highs across the country this week.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Obama, an important surrogate for Biden, campaigned for his former vice president for the second time in four days in Florida. The key battleground state could play a decisive role in the outcome of the election, and recent polls show a tight race between Trump and Biden. Obama\u2019s Orlando speech built on a blistering rebuke of Trump he delivered last week in Pennsylvania, his first foray onto the campaign trail since a speech to the Democratic National Convention earlier in the year, and over the weekend in Florida. Obama\u2019s speeches have shown how he is keeping tabs on the day-to-day news about Trump, and how the Biden campaign is deploying him to deliver some of its harshest attacks on the current President and his administration. Former presidents usually avoid directly attacking their successor in the White House, but Obama has delivered full-throated criticisms of Trump while campaigning for Biden. But Trump, with the way he has continually attacked Obama, even suggesting he should be indicted, has changed the calculus, thrusting the former president onto the campaign trail. Democrats hope Obama can help gin up enthusiasm among the Democratic base and encourage Black men, Latinos and younger voters in battleground states to turn out and vote. He accused Trump of failing to take preventative measures to contain the virus across the nation and in the White House. He also pointed to the second recent outbreak among White House staff, which infected several aides including Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short. \u201cLet me say this: I lived in the White House for a while,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a controlled environment. You can take some preventive measures in the White House to avoid getting sick. Except, this guy can\u2019t seem to do it. He\u2019s turned the White House into a hot zone.\u201d Obama criticized the comments made over the weekend by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d \u201cWe are not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas.\u201d \u201cListen, winter is coming,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re waving the white flag of\u00a0surrender.\u00a0Florida,\u00a0we\u00a0can\u2019t afford four\u00a0more years of this.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u00a0cannot afford this\u00a0kind of incompetence and\u00a0disinterest.\u201d The former President also criticized senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, for recent comments he made about Black Americans. Kushner said Monday on Fox News, \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve seen in a lot of the Black community, which is mostly Democrat, is that President Trump\u2019s policies are the policies that can help people break out of the problems that they\u2019re complaining about. But he can\u2019t want them to be successful more than they want to be successful.\u201d Obama seized on the comments, saying, \u201c(Trump\u2019s) son-in-law says Black folks have to want to be successful. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d After a short pause, an incredulous-sounding Obama continued, \u201cWho are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to?\u201d Trump responded to Obama\u2019s speech on Twitter, noting that the remarks were airing on Fox News and claiming his predecessor was drawing a small crowd and giving a \u201cfake speech\u201d for Biden. \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got a President right now, he wants full credit for an economy that he inherited, he wants zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. But you know what, the job doesn\u2019t work that way. You\u2019ve got to be responsible 24/7. You\u2019ve got to pay attention 24/7. Tweeting at the TV doesn\u2019t fix things. Watching TV all day doesn\u2019t fix things. Making stuff up doesn\u2019t fix things,\u201d Obama said. One week from Election Day, Obama encouraged Floridians to vote early in-person or by mail. \u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u00a0Put it in the mail or drop it\u00a0off at a dropbox location today.\u00a0Don\u2019t take any chances, just get\u00a0it done,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have to turn out like never before, Orlando. We have to leave no doubt. We can\u2019t be complacent. We were complacent last time. Folks got a little lazy. Folks took things for granted. And look what happened. Not this time,\u201d Obama said. Obama praised his former vice president, describing Biden as a man of \u201cprinciple and character\u201d and highlighting his empathy and decency. \u201cHe made me a better president,\u00a0and he\u2019s got the character and\u00a0the experience to make us a\u00a0better country,\u201d Obama said. Obama laid out the ways Biden has said he would get the pandemic under control, including making coronavirus tests free and widely available, distributing a vaccine to every American at no cost and providing enough personal protective equipment to all front-line workers. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make sure that small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely, and he understands that we\u2019re not going to rebuild the economy and put people back to work until we get this pandemic under control,\u201d Obama said. He lambasted Trump and Republicans for attempting to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s landmark health care plan. \u201cLast week, Trump flat out said he hopes the Supreme Court takes your health insurance away. Said it out loud,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote,\u201d he said, repeating a favorite line of his when the crowd booed. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on the future of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, next month. Obama said if elected, Biden and his running mate Sen. Kamala Harris of California would \u201cprotect your health care, they will expand Medicare, they\u2019ll make insurance more affordable for everybody, because Joe knows that a president\u2019s first job is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic, and microscopic.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comments from former President Barack Obama.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration is set to announce as early as this week that Medicare and Medicaid will cover out-of-pocket costs for a potential coronavirus vaccine that is granted emergency use authorization, according to a person familiar with the matter. Coming days before the election, the move could help President Donald Trump among seniors and lower-income Americans even though top medical experts don\u2019t expect a vaccine to be approved before Election Day. In the run-up to the election, Trump has applied intense pressure on agencies to deliver policy wins that might help his reelection, aides said. Officials have been working for several weeks on changing regulations to allow for Medicare and Medicaid recipients to receive free vaccines. It\u2019s not clear whether Trump himself will make the announcement of the rule change in the final days of the election, though he is working to appeal to seniors during stops in Florida later this week. Politico first reported the coming changes. There are currently four US Phase 3 trials of coronavirus vaccines as part of the federal government\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine program, Operation Warp Speed. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said Sunday that experts will know by early December whether a potential coronavirus vaccine is safe and effective, but widespread availability will likely not occur until several months into 2021. Operation Warp Speed aims to have Covid-19 vaccines moved to administration sites within 24 hours of an emergency use authorization or Food and Drug Administration license \u2013 with the goal of providing the vaccine free of charge. \u201cIn terms of a principle and an aspiration, it\u2019ll be that no American has to pay a single dime out of pocket to get a vaccine,\u201d Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the US Department of Health Human Services, said back in September. The federal government already struck a deal earlier this month with retail pharmacies CVS and Walgreens to help distribute the coronavirus vaccine \u2013 once one or more gets authorized \u2013 to long-term care facilities like nursing homes, with no out-of-pocket costs. CNN\u2019s Jamie Gumbrecht and Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "For months, the Trump administration has been warning of the dangers of political interference by China in the US election. In April, President Trump said Beijing wanted him out of the White House. Attorney General William Barr and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Beijing was a bigger threat than Russia. And Bill Evanina, Director of the United States National Counterintelligence and Security Center, listed the ways that China had been \u201cexpanding its influence efforts.\u201d Yet, this week, China didn\u2019t feature in the latest warning about election interference. On Thursday, US national security officials accused Russian state-sponsored hackers of targeting state and local governments and of successfully stealing data in at least two instances. The allegations came shortly after officials accused Russia and Iran of using US voter registration information to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign. Russian hackers targeting state and local governments have stolen data, US officials say By contrast, very little evidence of China\u2019s alleged meddling has emerged, weeks before the vote. The China-backed foreign misinformation efforts that have been made public had a minuscule reach compared Russia\u2019s efforts before the 2016 US presidential vote. \u201cChina studied what the Russians did in 2016 very closely,\u201d said cybersecurity expert James Lewis, a former foreign service officer at the Departments of State and Commerce. \u201cThey\u2019d like to be able to do what the Russians do, but they aren\u2019t that good at it.\u201d However, experts predict that China\u2019s influence operations will become more formidable in the coming decades. They warn China will own more parts of the global telecommunications networks and export its system of censorship and propaganda to other governments. According to Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and information warfare expert who testified before Congress about Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, Chinese influence operations \u201cwill be more prolific over time and successful over time because they can control the entire information environment, which is different from the Russians.\u201d In August, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman said China had never interfered in a US election and \u201chad no interest to do that in the future.\u201d Russia\u2019s use of disinformation dates back far before the last presidential election. The Soviet Union used the art of \u201cdezinformatsiya\u201d to forge documents, plant fake stories in the media to benefit Russian interests, and infiltrate activist groups during the Cold War. Those strategies came from the Tsarist era, when the secret police would fake materials to discredit enemies. The difference now, of course, is that those tactics have moved online. In 2014, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a secretive technology company with close ties to the Kremlin, began using fake social media accounts and group pages to target US audiences around divisive issues in the lead up to the 2016 election, according to the Mueller report. Pamela Brown presses Facebook exec on how company will use misinformation tools The IRA bought troves of Facebook ads and flooded Twitter with posts that boosted Trump and denigrated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the report said. In mid-2014, employees from the IRA even traveled to the US to get information and photographs to use in their social media posts. Some IRA employees, posing as Americans, communicated with the Trump campaign to try to coordinate political activities, including political rallies. More than 1,000 employees reportedly worked from an office block in St. Petersburg to run the influence campaign \u2013 with the goal of getting Trump elected to benefit Russian interests. Those tactics are still being used, but better disguised, now that the playbook has been publicized. A CNN investigation earlier this year found a network of social media accounts targeting the US that came from people in Ghana and Nigeria, working on behalf of Russia. This September, Facebook and Twitter announced the IRA created a fake progressive website called Peace Data that engaged with real Americans and even hired some Americans to write articles, which were then shared on different social media platforms. For a long time, China\u2019s online influence operations focused inward, using censorship and propaganda to control what information its citizens can see at home. A 2017 Harvard study estimated that the Chinese government produces 488 million fake social media posts a year to cheerlead the authorities and distract public attention from discussions critical of the regime. The study concluded that the Chinese government uses an enormous workforce of mostly government employees, contributing part time, to fabricate the posts. But as China\u2019s economic and political ambitions have grown, the country has increasingly applied domestic propaganda tactics to target global audiences \u2013 ironically, using platforms it blocks at home, such as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter. So far, this has been with limited success. Right now, China\u2019s disinformation efforts are \u201csloppy and get caught very easily,\u201d said Watts. While China has set up a vast censorship and propaganda apparatus at home, the country does not have as much practice manipulating foreign social media platforms. \u201cThey\u2019re used to playing on a field where they control the terrain,\u201d says Nimmo, of Graphika. \u201cIt\u2019s a steep learning curve.\u201d The pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong last year, however, appeared to have accelerated China\u2019s focus on global influence operations. As international news organizations reported on demonstrations in the city and protesters\u2019 demands for more civil liberties, Beijing launched a state-backed disinformation campaign about the protests on Western platforms. In August 2019, Facebook and Twitter removed accounts from China that sowed political discord and amplified messages to undermine the legitimacy of the protest movement, portraying demonstrators as violent, extreme and dangerous. One of the posts had an image of Hong Kong protesters next to ISIS fighters, with the text: \u201cEven though the weapons are different, the outcome is the same!\u201d The operation\u2019s use of automated accounts to spread disinformation and amplify divisive topics resembles Russia\u2019s tactics, according to Nick Monaco, an online disinformation expert and research director at the Institute of the Future. Some of Russia\u2019s strategies were also on display in the first public disclosures of Chinese influence operations pushing content about global issues that matter to China, such as the South China Sea, but also the 2020 US election. Facebook recently shut down more than 150 accounts from China that used fake profiles to pose as locals in countries they targeted. The accounts boosted their own content, managed Facebook pages, and liked and commented on other people\u2019s posts. Facebook said only a small amount of the overall activity was focused on the US, where the operation gained almost no following. According to Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the misinformation, the group first became active in late 2016 by posting about Taiwan from a pro-Mainland position. In 2018, the operation began posting about the Philippines and Chinese influence in the region, as well as defending China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea. Meme wars: The power of a Photoshop Activity around US politics only began in April 2019, when the operation started making Facebook profiles to pass as actual Americans on both sides of the aisle. For instance, \u201cKate Selina\u201d was one of the fake profiles that posed as a conservative American, and shared posts criticizing Medicare-for-all and gun control policies. A liberal account posted that President Barack Obama \u201cis my best president ever,\u201d while also sharing a meme of Trump with the words \u201cnobody likes me\u201d right next to his face. The network also created Facebook pages for various US presidential candidates, including one supporting former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The page only had two members. The operation also created a Biden-Harris group that had around 1,400 members. The Trump group only attracted three followers. In contrast, leading up to the 2016 US Presidential election, some pages run by Russia\u2019s IRA attracted hundreds of thousands of followers each. According to Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, which worked with Facebook to analyze the accounts, the US-focused part of the operation from China appeared \u201cto be in the audience-building stage.\u201d The network did not push for one candidate over another. The purpose could have been to draw attention and build an audience in order to push pro-Beijing content to the groups in the future. Graphika estimated that the overall activity of the operation was limited, producing just 1.6 million interactions \u2013 of which just a tiny fraction were related to the US \u2013 between September 2016 and September 2020. In contrast, ahead of the 2016 Presidential elections, IRA-controlled Facebook accounts reached 126 million people, and the agency\u2019s Twitter accounts had tens of thousands of followers each, including high-profile political figures who retweeted its content, according to the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, released by the Department of Justice last year. China also faces another challenge: it is starting its influence operations in the West when social media platforms, law enforcement and independent researchers have increased efforts to detect fake activity. \u201cChina is coming to the game later, when defenses are a lot stronger,\u201d Nimmo said. If China\u2019s threat is less severe than Russia\u2019s, that\u2019s partly because in the past, it simply hasn\u2019t cared as much about US elections. The next president won\u2019t change Washington\u2019s bipartisan consensus to be tough on China. Russia\u2019s geopolitical ambitions, however, stand to benefit far more from a Trump reelection. Trump has helped advance the Kremlin\u2019s objectives: eroding solidarity with European allies, denying Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, withdrawing from Syria, and bolstering Russia\u2019s position in Crimea and Ukraine. That sentiment is reflected in state media, with Russian outlets publishing significantly more English-language content about the presidential election than Chinese ones, according to analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute. There\u2019s no presidential candidate \u2013 not Biden or Trump \u2013 especially post Covid, that\u2019s going to improve relations with China Clint Watts, former FBI special agent Russia\u2019s narrative is also more divisive. It\u2019s been pushing predictions of widespread election rigging and fraud via mail-in-balloting, according to Watts, the former FBI special agent. \u201cRussia has a clear bridge to America. They have consistently communicated and connected with Americans to influence them and support policies and candidates favorable to them,\u201d Watts said. \u201cChina has no such aims. There\u2019s no presidential candidate \u2013 not Biden or Trump \u2013 especially post Covid, that\u2019s going to improve relations with China.\u201d In the long-term, what makes China a potentially greater threat than Russia is its involvement in the global communications infrastructure, and the software that sits atop of it. Over the past decade, Chinese state-owned or affiliated companies have built internet, television and phone networks for scores of foreign governments, especially in developing countries. Experts have cautioned that China could leave backdoors in those networks \u2013 accusations the Chinese government has vehemently denied. \u201cWith the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) they will have surveillance, and with surveillance they can implement censorship,\u201d said Watts. 37 times Trump was soft on Russia More simply, as Beijing provides televisions with its state media channels across Africa and beyond, Chinese mobile phone companies put handsets in people\u2019s pockets, and the country\u2019s apps are installed on those phones, China has ever-greater access to people in the global south. China aims to reframe global opinion of the country, and according to Watts, China has more compelling global narrative to tell than Russia\u2019s approach of \u201cdegrading democracy worldwide and breaking up alliances\u201d without offering a substitute. \u201cChina is going around and saying, \u2018Why democracy? Let\u2019s talk about meritocracy. Human rights? America isn\u2019t handling Covid, and it can\u2019t help its low-income people.\u2019\u201d Professor Titus Chen of the National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan expects that in the developing world, China\u2019s message will eventually become as accepted as information from established media. But in the West, Beijing\u2019s persuasion will be limited, he says. \u201cThis is not a regime type or government that people in the world \u2013 or at least the Western world \u2013 want,\u201d Chen said. \u201cSo how do you spin it? It\u2019s quite a daunting task for a propaganda system.\u201d For both Russia and China, the job of fanning fake information and creating divisions in society has been made easy, by a sitting President who frequently tweets and says misleading things. US counterintelligence chief says foreign adversaries are exploiting Trump's lies to influence election The recent presidential debate between Biden and Trump, who pushed an avalanche of misinformation during a raging performance, helped bolster China\u2019s critique of US democracy. Afterwards, the editor of the Beijing-backed tabloid Global Times, wrote that: \u201cSuch a chaos at the top of US political reflects division, anxiety of US society and the accelerating loss of advantages of the US political division.\u201d For Watts, the biggest threats on election day will be domestic, not foreign. \u201cWhat could Russia or China do at this point that America is not already doing to itself?\u201d Watts wrote in a 2020 report. \u201cFor Putin and Xi, it\u2019s easier to ride the American tide of democratic destruction than make the wave.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday outlined his plan to address the coronavirus pandemic, including providing free vaccines to all Americans, as he began delivering his closing argument to voters. \u201cOnce we have a safe and effective vaccine, it has to be free to everyone, whether or not you\u2019re insured,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware.\u00a0He said that if elected, he would direct the federal government to \u201cbulk-purchase as\u00a0many doses as necessary of the\u00a0Covid-19 vaccine so we can\u00a0provide it free to those who are\u00a0uninsured, under-insured or\u00a0Medicaid-eligible.\u201d Eleven days from Election Day, Biden homed in on his four main priorities to combat the pandemic. In addition to distributing a free vaccine, he said, he would ask governors to mandate masks in their states, put a national testing plan in place and increase the production and distribution of personal protective equipment. In each section of his speech, a screen behind him provided visuals to illustrate his argument. As he spoke about mandating masks, for example, pictures of people wearing masks appeared onscreen. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Despite the speedy timeline that President Donald Trump has suggested, Biden cautioned it would still be \u201cmany months\u201d before a vaccine is widely available to Americans. But if one does become ready for distribution, he said, the country needs a president who will ensure that it is given out \u201cin a way\u00a0that\u2019s equitable and\u00a0accountable.\u201d The former vice president, in laying out his plan to tackle the pandemic, criticized Trump for attempting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act during a global health crisis. Trump has vowed for years to overturn the ACA, also known as Obamacare, but has not offered a comprehensive plan that he would install in its place, despite teasing one several times. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on the future of the ACA next month. \u201cUnder the ACA, insurers are required to cover recommended vaccines for free, so overturning the ACA would\u00a0mean people have to pay to get\u00a0a Covid-19 vaccine.\u00a0That\u2019s wrong.\u00a0Very, very wrong,\u201d Biden said. In September, the federal government released plans detailing how it would distribute Covid-19 vaccines once they\u2019ve been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Operation Warp Speed aims to have Covid-19 vaccines moving to administration sites within 24 hours of an FDA license or emergency use authorization, and the goal is to make them free, CNN previously reported. During the final presidential debate on Thursday, Biden said he would build on Obamacare by adding a public health insurance option. It would \u201cbecome Bidencare,\u201d the former vice president said. He said he wanted to add an option for people to buy into a Medicare-like program. Echoing his other speeches on the campaign trail, Biden lambasted Trump for his administration\u2019s mishandling of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, as the United States surpassed 223,000 deaths from the virus as of this week. \u201cWe\u2019re more than eight months\u00a0into this crisis, and the\u00a0President still doesn\u2019t have a\u00a0plan.\u00a0He\u2019s given up.\u00a0He\u2019s quit on you.\u00a0He\u2019s quit on your family.\u00a0He\u2019s quit on America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe just wants us to grow numb\u00a0and resign to the horrors of\u00a0this death toll and the pain\u00a0it\u2019s causing so many Americans.\u201d Biden said Trump \u201ccan\u2019t erase his own words or\u00a0deeds.\u201d He pointed to the reporting by journalist Bob Woodward that shows the President admitted he had known weeks before the first confirmed US coronavirus death that the virus was dangerous and repeatedly played it down publicly. \u201cCovid-19 dwarfs anything we\u2019ve\u00a0faced in recent history and\u00a0isn\u2019t showing any signs of\u00a0slowing down,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe virus is surging in almost\u00a0every state.\u201d In his speech, Biden echoed his attacks during the debate, in which he accused Trump of denying responsibility for the virus\u2019 spread in the United States, and predicted that a \u201cdark winter\u201d is coming with more deaths.

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama delivered a scathing speech on the campaign trail on Wednesday, rebuking President Donald Trump. Read the full speech here: Hello, Philadelphia. Man, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. What beautiful weather we got here. Little Indian summer. I know the president spent some time in Erie last night, and apparently he complained about having to travel here. And then he cut the event short, poor guy. I don\u2019t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania. You guys delivered for me twice and I am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the White House for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I want to thank Mr. Philadelphia, Charlie Mack, his daughter, India Marie. What an outstanding young lady she was. Those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when you see your daughters just shining. I know a little bit about that. And it was great to see representatives, Brendan Boyle, Mary Gay Scanlon, Governor Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Mayor Jim Kenney. Philadelphia we got 13 days. That\u2019s our lucky number right here. 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes. And you don\u2019t have to wait for November 3rd to cast your ballot. You\u2019ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person through next Tuesday. Anybody here voted early already? If you haven\u2019t, just go to iwillvote.com/pa and find out where you can vote early. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Just go to iwillvote.com/pa to request your ballot right away. And before you send it back, Pennsylvania\u2019s got this thing where you\u2019ve got to use both envelopes. So you\u2019ve got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts. And if you\u2019ve already voted, then you\u2019ve got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote. Take them with you if you vote early, or if you vote in-person on election day, because this election requires every single one of us to do our part. And what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come. Now, last time I was in Philadelphia, I was at the constitution center and I was delivering a speech for the Democratic National Convention this year. And I said, during that speech, I\u2019ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. And they are very different people. I explained that I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but I did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously, but it hasn\u2019t happened. He hasn\u2019t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention. And by the way, even then his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him. But the thing is, this is not a reality show, this is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously. At least 220,000 Americans have died. More than 100,000 small businesses have closed. Millions of jobs are gone. Our proud reputation around the world is in tatters. Presidents up for reelection usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago. I\u2019ll tell you one thing, four years ago you\u2019d be tailgating here at the Lincoln instead of watching a speech from your cars. The only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts. Right now as we speak, Trump won\u2019t even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic. But he\u2019s been doing all right by himself. As it turns out, this was just reported in the last 48 hours. We know that he continues to do business with China because he\u2019s got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? How is that possible? A secret Chinese bank account. Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for reelection. You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would\u2019ve called me Beijing Berry. It is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas. That\u2019s not a good idea. I mean, of the taxes Donald Trump pays, he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the United States. His first year in the White House he only paid $750 in federal income tax. Listen, my first job was at a Baskin-Robbins when I was 15 years old. I think I\u2019m might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream. How is that possible? How many people here pay less than that? It\u2019s just possible now that if you are living high on the hog and you only pay $750 in taxes that maybe, just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in Pennsylvania. We cannot afford four more years of this, Philadelphia. But the good news is right now you can choose change. Right now you can vote for my friend Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris as the next president and vice president of the United States of America. Now, Joe\u2019s no stranger to here. He\u2019s a native son. Scrappy kid from Scranton. You know him and he knows you. But let me, let me tell you how I came to Norman and how I came to love him. 12 years ago, when I chose Joe Biden as my vice presidential running mate, I didn\u2019t know Joe all that well. We had served in the Senate together, but we weren\u2019t super close. He and I came from different places. We came from different generations. But I came to admire Joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect, living by the words his parents taught him, no one\u2019s better than you Joe, but you\u2019re better than nobody. And that empathy, that decency, that belief that everybody counts, that\u2019s who Joe is. That\u2019s who he\u2019ll be. And I can tell you the presidency doesn\u2019t change who you are, it reveals who you are. And Joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he\u2019s got the character and experience to make us a better country. And he and Kamala- A better country. And he and Kamala are going to be in the fight, not for themselves but for every single one of us. Well, I get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn\u2019t work that way. Tweeting at the television doesn\u2019t fix things. Making stuff up doesn\u2019t make people\u2019s lives better. You\u2019ve got to have a plan. You\u2019ve got to put in the work. And along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores. They probably used it to I don\u2019t know, prop up a wobbly table somewhere. We don\u2019t know where that playbook went. Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. Donald Trump isn\u2019t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can\u2019t even take the basic steps to protect himself. Just last night, he complained up in eerie that the pandemic made him go back to work. I\u2019m quoting him. He was upset that the pandemic\u2019s made him go back to work. If he\u2019d actually been working the whole time, it never would\u2019ve gotten this bad. So, look, here\u2019s the truth. I want to be honest here. This pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this up. It\u2019s just not true. I\u2019ll give you a very specific example. Korea identified it\u2019s first case at the same time that the United States did. At the same time, their per capita death toll is just 1.3% of what ours is. In Canada, it\u2019s just 39% of what ours is. Other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they\u2019re not doing as bad as we are because they\u2019ve got a government that\u2019s actually been paying attention. And that means lives lost. And that means an economy that doesn\u2019t work. And just yesterday, when asked if he\u2019d do anything differently, Trump said, \u201cNot much.\u201d Really? Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive? So, Joe\u2019s not going to screw up testing. He\u2019s not going to call scientists idiots. He\u2019s not going to host a super spreader event at the White House. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available, to get a vaccine to every American cost free and to make sure our frontline heroes never ask other countries for their equipment they need. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy but America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama-Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump-Pence administration. How you figure that? And that was before he could blame the pandemic. Now, he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in American history but just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up. The economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs. Joe\u2019s got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic $2 trillion investment to fight climate change, to secure environmental justice. And he\u2019ll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires. And Joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester\u2019s classes, the shift worker who\u2019s always on the edge of getting laid off, the cancer survivor who\u2019s worried about her preexisting conditions, protections being taken away. Let me tell you something Pennsylvania. This I know to be true, Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare and expand Medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody. Republicans love to say right before an election that they\u2019ll protect your preexisting conditions. Now, Joe and I actually protected your policies to make sure people with preexisting conditions could get health insurance and have coverage. We did it through something called the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare. And Republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times. And when they\u2019ve been asked about, they keep on promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great replacement.\u201d They said, \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d It\u2019s been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years. Where is it? Where is this great plan to replace Obamacare? They\u2019ve had 10 years to do it. There is no plan. They\u2019ve never had one. Instead they\u2019ve attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Now, they\u2019re trying to dismantle your care in the Supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. It\u2019s shameful. The idea that you would take healthcare away from people at the very moment where people need it most, what is the logic of that? There is no logic. Joe knows that the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic or microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus, a president can\u2019t ignore them. He can\u2019t be AWOL. Just like when Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander-in-chief can\u2019t be missing in action. I can tell you this, Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers. Who does that? He knows these heroes are somebody\u2019s children, somebody\u2019s spouse, somebody\u2019s dad or mom. He understands that. And he\u2019s going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that America\u2019s true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. And with Joe and Kamala at the helm, you\u2019re not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day. And that\u2019s worth a lot. You\u2019re not going to have to argue about them every day. It just won\u2019t be so exhausting. You might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument. You\u2019ll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that maybe seals didn\u2019t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. The president of the United States retweeted that. Imagine. What? What? We\u2019re not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn\u2019t support him or threaten them with jail. That\u2019s not normal presidential behavior. That\u2019s not normal presidential behavior. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a high school principal. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a coach. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate it from a co-worker. We wouldn\u2019t tolerate it in our family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere. I mean, why would we expect and accept this from the President of the United States? And why are folks making excuses for that? \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s just him.\u201d No. There are consequences to these actions. They embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist, and it frays the fabric of our society, and it affects how our children see things. And it affects the ways that our families get along. It affects how the world looks at America. That behavior matters. Character matters. And by the way, while he\u2019s doing all that, it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government, actions that affect your lives. The Environmental Protection Agency that\u2019s supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free reign to dump unlimited poison into our air and water. The Labor Department that\u2019s supposed to protect workers and their rights, right now it\u2019s run by a corporate lobbyist who\u2019s declared war on workers, guts protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages. The Interior Department, that\u2019s supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces, our wildlife and our wilderness. And right now that\u2019s run by an oil lobbyist who\u2019s determined to sell them to the highest bidder. You\u2019ve got the Education Department that\u2019s supposed to give every kid a chance, and that\u2019s run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for profit colleges and stiffs arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. I mean, the person who runs Medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of Medicaid instead of sign them up for Medicaid. Come on. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they\u2019re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists, but they\u2019re going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you, for your job, for your family, for your health, for your security, for your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. They actually care about every American, including the ones that don\u2019t agree with them. And they\u2019re going to fight for you every day. They care about you and they care about this democracy. They believe in a democracy. The right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn\u2019t be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote. They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn\u2019t un-American. That\u2019s the most American thing there is. That\u2019s how this country was founded, protesting injustice. They understand we don\u2019t threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail, just because we disagree with them. They understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo-ops. It depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it\u2019s convenient. Our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up. And we\u2019ve just become numb to it. We\u2019ve just become immune to it. Every single day, fact checkers can\u2019t keep up. And, look, this notion of truthfulness and democracy and citizenship, and being responsible, these aren\u2019t Republican or democratic principles, they\u2019re American principles. They\u2019re what most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents. They\u2019re not White or Black or Latino or Asian values, they\u2019re American values, human values, and we need to reclaim them. We have to get those values back at the center of our public life. And we can. But to do it, we\u2019ve got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election, because you know the President\u2019s already said, \u201cIf this is even close, I\u2019m going to just make stuff up.\u201d He\u2019s already started to do it. So we can\u2019t have any doubt. We can\u2019t be complacent. I don\u2019t care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time, didn\u2019t work out, because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time, not in this election, not this time. Listen, listen. I understand why a lot of Americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn\u2019t make a difference. Even supporters of mine, during my eight years, there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn\u2019t get done and people said, \u201cWell, gosh, if Obama didn\u2019t get it done, then maybe it\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d Look, government is not going to solve every problem, it\u2019s true. Every elected officials going to make some mistakes. This is a big complicated country and the system\u2019s designed so that change happens slowly. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. And believe me, I\u2019ve got firsthand experience with the way Republicans in Congress abused the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress. But we can make things better, and we shouldn\u2019t be making things worse. A president by himself can\u2019t solve every challenge in a global economy. But if we\u2019ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House at a House and Senate that are focused on working people, it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need. A president by himself can\u2019t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we\u2019ve got district attorneys and state\u2019s attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. In Pennsylvania, you\u2019ve just got to flip nine seats in your State House, just five seats in your State Senate, to give Democrats control and new life for policies that\u2019ll make a real difference to working families right now. It can make things better. In the end, Pennsylvania, that\u2019s what voting\u2019s about, making things better, not making things perfect, but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, \u201cThings got better starting now.\u201d And that\u2019s what voting\u2019s about. Voting\u2019s about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that\u2019s more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations. And the fact that we don\u2019t get 100% of \u2026 \u2026 and future generations. And the fact that we don\u2019t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we\u2019ve got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it right. And we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted, when I hear people say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re voting don\u2019t make a difference.\u201d We don\u2019t know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote. We get 50, 55% of people voting. And then people say, \u201cWell, look, not enough change happened.\u201d Well, imagine what would happen if 60% voted? What about 70%? Imagine January 20th, when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess, who believe in science, and they have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, and who care about working Americans, and they have a plan to help you start getting ahead. And who believe in racial equality and gender equality, and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation, and are willing to bring us closer to an America where no matter what we look like and where we come from, who we love and what our last name is, if we go out there and we work, we can make it. And we\u2019re part of an American family. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach, if we vote. Because let me tell you something Pennsylvanians, people ask me sometimes, they say, \u201cMan, how have you been able to take these last four years, just watching all this? How do you keep your spirits up?\u201d And I tell him, I say, look for all the times, these last four years that we\u2019ve seen our worst impulses revealed, we\u2019ve also seen what our country can be at its best. We\u2019ve seen folks of every age and background who\u2019ve packed city centers and airports in town squares, just so families wouldn\u2019t be separated. So another classroom wouldn\u2019t get shot up, so our kids wouldn\u2019t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We\u2019ve seen Americans more racist, joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. We\u2019ve seen folks, our essential workers, our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else\u2019s loved ones. We\u2019ve seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now. That\u2019s true in Pennsylvania, that\u2019s true all across the country. America is a good and decent place, but we\u2019ve just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it\u2019s hard for us to remember. Philadelphia, I\u2019m asking you to remember what this country can be. What it\u2019s like when we treat each other with respect and dignity, what it\u2019s like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly. I\u2019m asking you to believe in Joe\u2019s ability, in Kamala\u2019s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, and help us build it back better, because we can\u2019t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can\u2019t abandon the children who aren\u2019t getting the education they need right now. We can\u2019t abandon those protesters who inspired us. We\u2019ve got to channel their activism into action, we can\u2019t just imagine a better future. We\u2019ve got to fight for it. We\u2019ve got to out hustle the other side, we got to outwork the other side, we\u2019ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan right now, for how you\u2019re going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can. Tell your family, tell your friends how they can vote. Don\u2019t stop with Joe and Kamala, make sure you vote all the way down the ticket. And if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days, if we vote up and down the ticket, like never before, then we will not only elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. We will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people, and the values and ideals that we embrace. What Lincoln called the better angels of our nature, those are still in us. We see them operating every single day. We see them in neighborhoods, we see them in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples. We see them in people helping out a neighbor. We see them them inside our own families. We see that what is best in us is still there, but we\u2019ve got to give it voice, and we\u2019ve got to do it now. So let\u2019s get to work people. Let\u2019s bring this home. I love you, Philadelphia. Honk if you\u2019re fired up, honk if you\u2019re ready to go. Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? Let\u2019s go make it happen. I love you Philadelphia. Thank you. I love you. Come on.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Joni Ernst was already facing a tough reelection fight in Iowa \u2013 and then came the soybean question. At a televised debate late last week, when asked to state the price of soybeans in Iowa, she initially delivered a long response about trade policy, but didn\u2019t answer the question. A veteran Iowa news anchor pressed her, saying: \u201cYou grew up on a farm, you should know this.\u201d Ernst hesitated another moment before finally responding: \u201cProbably about $5.50.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a couple dollars off, I think, because it\u2019s $10.05,\u201d said Ron Steele, a longtime anchor of a Waterloo TV station, who was among the moderators of the debate. \u201cBut we\u2019ll move onto something else then.\u201d It\u2019s an open question whether that uncomfortable moment, which unfolded during the middle of Iowa\u2019s harvest season, will complicate the race for Ernst. And it may be difficult to tell, considering she is already locked in an unexpectedly tough challenge with her Democratic rival, Theresa Greenfield, who nailed an answer about the price of corn during the same debate. Two weeks before the voting ends in Iowa, a bigger challenge for Ernst could be the headwinds she is encountering from President Donald Trump. He won the state by 9 percentage points, but is now locked in a tight race with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Republican fortunes \u2013 and their Senate majority \u2013 are tied to the President. Party officials in Iowa are keeping an anxious eye on the suburbs in the state, just as their counterparts are doing across the nation, as Trump\u2019s shaky support threatens his party\u2019s control of the chamber. A week before the soybean episode, Ernst made clear she was in for a difficult race, telling supporters at a campaign stop: \u201cIt is a tough, tough, tough year, but you know what? I\u2019m going to finish first!\u201d The voters, of course, will decide that. 7 of the 10 most expensive Senate races EVER are happening right now Brendan Conley, a spokesman for Ernst, said the debate had several technical difficulties. Ernst appeared remotely from Washington, where she had spent the week in Supreme Court Confirmation hearings. Earlier in the debate, viewers could plainly see Ernst struggle to hear when the audio clearly wasn\u2019t working. Yet the problem seemed to be resolved during the corn and soybeans question because the senator did give an answer when asked at what price farmers could break even. \u201cThere were countless issues throughout the debate, as both candidates experienced, and it was clear Joni wasn\u2019t able to hear the question well,\u201d Conley said in a statement. \u201cAs Joni said, the breakeven price depends on each farmer and what their operations looks like. Joni is a relentless and proven fighter for our farmers which is why she has the full backing of the Iowa Farm Bureau, the Iowa Cattlemen\u2019s Association, and the Iowa Corn Growers.\u201d Iowa is the second-highest soybean producing state in the country, so a question about commodity prices is hardly out of left field during a political debate, particularly for two candidates like Ernst and Greenfield who have talked extensively about their farm roots. For Ernst, it\u2019s been a central part of her political biography, since first gaining national attention in 2014 by airing a television ad comparing the castration of hogs to cutting spending in Washington. \u201cLet\u2019s make \u2018em squeal,\u201d Ernst famously said in one ad, which was among the most memorable political spots of the election cycle. During her first month on the job, Republican leaders selected her to deliver the party\u2019s response to the State of the Union Address in 2015. In that nationally televised message, she introduced herself to the country, saying at one point: \u201cAs a young girl, I plowed the fields of our family farm.\u201d It was in that context that the question \u2013 and answer \u2013 reverberated. Greenfield pounced, saying on Twitter: \u201cA Senator from Iowa should know the price of soybeans.\u201d Latest House and Senate ratings show Democrats increasingly competitive in Republican areas But over the weekend as false information spread on social media that the Iowa Farm Bureau was rescinding its endorsement of Ernst, the agriculture group came to her defense and released a statement amplifying its support. \u201cSenator Joni Ernst understands agriculture and works tirelessly to increase the economic opportunities for Iowa farmers and rural America, and that is why the Iowa Farm Bureau was proud to designate her as a Friend of Agriculture,\u201d a Sunday statement said. \u201cShe continues to have our full support.\u201d Ernst has run a farm-focused campaign. During the hearings last week for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, she spoke in support of Iowa\u2019s corn growers, bringing up a case decided in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals that found the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority in granting Renewable Fuel Standard-related waivers to some oil refiners. She joked that the \u201creally sexy topic\u201d of agency rulemaking was important to her state. \u201cThe problem here, bottom line, is that the EPA wasn\u2019t following the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took the law that Congress passed, they twisted it, and interpreted it for the benefit of oil producers, and that harmed our Iowa farmers.\u201d Democrats have tried to undercut Ernst\u2019s Iowa-centered image by airing ads charging that she bought a condo in Washington, DC, and is now beholden to special interests. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is airing a television ad calling Ernst an \u201cutter failure\u201d for Iowa\u2019s seniors, saying she would undermine Medicare, Social Security and protections for those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 health care attacks the Ernst campaign has rejected. In it, an actor squeezes the udders of a cow, while a narrator says the senator is \u201cmilking Iowa seniors for everything they\u2019ve got.\u201d Greenfield has a slight advantage in the race, according to recent polls by CBS and Quinnipiac, but she has recently dominated the fundraising battle. In the last financial quarter, Greenfield raised more than $28 million, more money in three months than any Iowa Senate candidate has raised in an election cycle, compared to Ernst\u2019s nearly $7.2 million. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify that false information was spread over the weekend regarding the Iowa Farm Bureau\u2019s endorsement of Sen. Joni Ernst. The organization reiterated its support of Ernst on Sunday.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration has taken a step to weaken the Affordable Care Act in a key battleground state, with only weeks to go until Election Day as well as Supreme Court arguments that could determine the landmark law\u2019s future. The administration this week approved Georgia\u2019s waiver request to provide Medicaid coverage to certain low-income residents if they work or participate in other qualifying activities for at least 80 hours a month. It\u2019s the latest state to receive permission to require work as a condition of coverage, though implementation elsewhere has been halted by federal courts or state officials. The future of Obamacare is at risk again. Here's what's at stake Also, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it had completed its review of Georgia\u2019s more controversial request to make fundamental changes to the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act exchange. The agency, which opened the door for states to create alternatives to Obamacare in 2018, is still finalizing the terms for approval. The Peach State, which has the nation\u2019s third highest uninsured rate at 13.4%, is the first to seek this enhanced power to reshape its individual market. Georgia and federal officials say that these efforts will make coverage more available and affordable to residents, but consumer advocates say they are the latest attempts to undercut the law. \u201cIt\u2019s a road map of what they would allow were the ACA to be struck down and were they to win election again,\u201d said Judy Solomon, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. These moves come as health care takes center stage in the 2020 presidential campaign. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has hammered Trump for trying to take down the landmark health reform law and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Trump has repeatedly said he has a replacement plan that would continue those safeguards but has yet to produce one. Also, Trump\u2019s Justice Department is backing a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general, who argue that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional after Congress reduced the penalty for not having insurance to zero as part of the 2017 tax cut law. As a result, the entire health reform law must fall, they argue. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case on November 10. The administration has pursued multiple avenues to overturn the Affordable Care Act in its first term. After efforts to repeal the law in Congress failed in 2017, officials started undermining it from within, including shortening the annual enrollment period to obtain coverage on the exchanges and slashing the budget for outreach and assistance. It also broadened the availability of alternative plans, primarily short-term health insurance policies that typically have lower premiums but are allowed to base coverage and premiums on people\u2019s medical histories. Also, officials took the unprecedented step in 2018 of allowing states to institute work requirements in Medicaid, a longtime Republican goal. However, the effort has been set aside by federal courts in four states, prompting the six others that had received approval (prior to Georgia) to stop implementation. Another eight states are awaiting permission from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Georgia is not looking to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The waiver only applies to those earning up to the poverty level, or $12,760 for an individual. Many will also have to pay monthly premiums. The federal approval also allows the state to pick up part of the tab for employer coverage if eligible residents have access. Implementation will begin July 1. Nearly 65,000 Georgians will gain coverage, according to state estimates. Nearly 650,000 residents could enroll if the state fully expanded Medicaid to those earning up to 138% of the poverty level, according to an Urban Institute estimate, which does not take into account changes wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. The administration did not approve the state\u2019s request to receive the more generous federal match that comes with full Medicaid expansion. Georgia is also seeking to make two changes to its individual market. It is looking to implement a reinsurance program, which typically reduces premiums by protecting insurers from high-cost patients. More than a dozen states have received federal approval to do this. But the Peach State also wants to shift the platform used for enrollment in the Affordable Care Act individual market from the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, to a private sector one called the Georgia Access Model in 2023. State officials argue that the move will give residents access to a broader array of options from web brokers, health insurance companies and traditional agents. Advocates, however, fear that it could shift healthier people to less comprehensive, non-Obamacare plans and leave those with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums for Affordable Care Act policies.",

Kamala Harris of California, will meet in Utah at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday night for the only vice presidential debate of the campaign. How to watch tonight's vice presidential debate Their showdown comes with the highest stakes for a vice presidential debate in recent memory, in part because President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis has made it unclear if and how additional presidential debates will take place. It will also mark a historic moment, as Harris becomes the first Black and South Asian woman to participate in a general election presidential campaign debate. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race. It comes at a chaotic moment in Washington. Coronavirus is spreading rapidly through Trump\u2019s White House and among his top campaign allies. And on Tuesday, Trump abruptly halted stimulus talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pence and Harris share tickets with two of the oldest men to run for president \u2013 the 74-year-old Trump and the 77-year-old Democratic nominee, Joe Biden \u2013 putting an extra emphasis on their roles as the second in command. Here are five things to watch in Wednesday night\u2019s debate: Even before the pandemic is mentioned at Wednesday night\u2019s debate, its presence will be obvious. Debate organizers, in response to the spread of the coronavirus inside the White House and the fact that Pence was at an event that was seemingly the genesis of the White House spread just over a week ago, made a number of changes to their safety protocols, including putting Pence and Harris more than 12 feet apart, using acrylic glass for barriers between the candidates and requiring everyone in the audience wear masks. Commission to allow Pence to debate without plexiglass barriers around him The coronavirus risks around the debate led some Democrats to question why the contest was even happening, particularly given Pence\u2019s proximity to those who have recently tested positive. Jesse Schonau, Pence\u2019s physician, said in a memo released Tuesday that the vice president does not need to quarantine because he was not a \u201cclose contact\u201d of anyone who has tested positive as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pence has had multiple negative coronavirus tests. But the changes to the format will make a point that Pence, who chairs the administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, and the Trump campaign are seeking to avoid: The pandemic has upended nearly every aspect of American life, including the way the country holds political debates. Pence\u2019s team challenged the installation of acrylic barriers around him at the debate after the commission announced that they would be used, before ultimately agreeing to their installation. But their resistance highlighted how the Trump campaign wants to avoid the omnipresence of the coronavirus and the worry among some in the President\u2019s orbit that it could set a precedent for the forthcoming debates between Trump and Biden. Trump has tried to cast his Covid diagnosis and supposed recovery as a bonus. In his telling, he\u2019s a fearless leader who took on the virus and triumphed \u2013 setting a model for bravery in the face of a pandemic. He\u2019s made no mention of those in his inner circle who\u2019ve fallen ill, nor the others on the White House staff \u2013 political and nonpartisan professionals \u2013 who are sick now. Empathy for the more than 210,000 Americans to die from the disease, and their families, has also been absent from his public statements. Harris' goal in vice presidential debate: Focus on Trump, not Pence For Harris, the challenge is to use this massive stage and draw a line \u2013 clear enough for anyone to see and impossible to ignore \u2013 from Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic as President to the growing fiasco inside his administration. She must do this while the President\u2019s own prognosis remains unknown. And even if, as Biden said on Monday night, his infection is largely the result of his own refusal to follow standard safety procedures, personal broadsides against him while he is battling the virus could carry some potential risk. It has been a chaotic week for the Trump campaign, punctuated by the President himself testing positive for the virus and spending three days in the hospital but beginning with a frenzied debate between the President and Biden. Pence\u2019s goals in Wednesday night\u2019s debate are to project a calm that Trump was unable to signal last week, while defending the administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic and delivering the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging that the virus should not dominate American life. Pence preps for debate as chances to shake up the race dwindle It\u2019s a difficult task: More than 210,000 Americans have died from the virus, small businesses across the country have been decimated and the prospect of more economic stimulus for Americans was rejected on Tuesday evening when the President urged Republicans to walk away from negotiations with Democrats, tanking the stock market. But Pence, according to people who know him well or have debated him in the past, is one of the most skilled politicians at redirecting a question to a topic he wants to focus on. \u201cMike is a good debater,\u201d said John Gregg, an Indiana Democrat who went to law school with Pence and ran against him for governor in 2012. \u201cOn certain questions that he gets, if he doesn\u2019t want to answer it, he is just a master at not answering it and pivoting to talking points.\u201d Harris entered the Democratic presidential primary as a supporter of \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d the national health insurance plan written and championed by her competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. By the time she dropped out, in December 2019, the senator from California had rowed\u00a0back her support and unveiled her own plan,\u00a0which called for transitioning to a government-run program over 10 years but allowing private insurers to participate. Now she is making the case for Biden and his proposal to beef up the Affordable Care Act and create a public option on top of it. Trump and Pence don\u2019t have a credible health care plan of their own, but that won\u2019t stop the vice president from trying to paint Harris as a tool of the \u201cradical left\u201d over both her initial backing of Medicare for All and her own proposal. Her ability to pivot out of that conversation and into one about the current administration\u2019s policies, both on the pandemic and their support for a lawsuit that threatens the ACA, could be a defining moment. In the first presidential debate, Biden wouldn\u2019t directly answer a question about whether he would support increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court. He has also not given a yes-or-no answer to whether he would support \u2013 if Democrats win control of the Senate \u2013 abolishing the filibuster. Trump couldn\u2019t get answers from Biden, but Pence might try to press Harris on those questions as he seeks to argue that the Biden-Harris ticket is beholden to the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing, which has sought the changes. Pence, meanwhile, could have to address Trump\u2019s seesawing tweets Tuesday about an economic stimulus. The President took to Twitter to announce that he had ended negotiations with Pelosi over a massive economic package. Then, hours later, he tweeted \u201cTrue!\u201d in response to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell arguing for more financial help from Congress.",

            "article_content": "When Joe Biden said on Tuesday night that he did not support the Green New Deal, President Donald Trump lit up. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t? Oh, well, that\u2019s a big statement,\u201d Trump interjected. \u201cYou just lost the radical left.\u201d The exchange was hardly the show-stopper the President hoped for. Biden\u2019s position on the climate plan was well-known to progressive activists, who have largely been encouraged by his willingness to include some of its goals, if not its grandest ambitions, into his own proposal. But their support is rooted in more elemental concerns \u2013 which only grow with each passing day \u2013 over the prospect of Trump\u2019s reelection. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cIf Joe Biden wins, the left will have many opportunities to exert leverage and push him towards progressive priorities like the Green New Deal,\u201d said progressive organizer Max Berger, a veteran of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s primary campaign. \u201cIf Trump wins, we will see full blown authoritarianism in America. We\u2019re not confused about what Joe Biden or Trump stand for, or what\u2019s at stake.\u201d After sealing the Democratic nomination in April, Biden and his team set about knitting together Democratic factions \u2013 for at least a few months \u2013 behind a singular, shared goal: defeating Trump in November. Those efforts, which included a series of \u201cunity task forces\u201d with Sanders\u2019 allies, yielded a more ambitious climate plan and gave the left\u2019s leaders some assurance that their concerns would be heard by the Biden campaign. Still, progressive activists and high-profile lawmakers remain clear-eyed about the status of their relationship with Biden. It is one borne of convenience and necessity \u2013 rooted in an understanding that the only path to realizing their policy agenda runs through a Democratic administration. That Biden hasn\u2019t entirely bought into the Green New Deal, and would say so publicly, surprised few. Instead, Trump\u2019s attacks have only further solidified an uneasy alliance and hardened the commitment of leading progressives, who largely view the President as an existential threat to American democracy. To the extent there was disquiet on the left after the debate, it was over what some felt was a missed an opportunity for Biden to bolster his support with younger voters who, as Sunrise Movement political director Evan Weber told CNN, view the Green New Deal as \u201ccode for bold and progressive climate action of the scale of the crisis.\u201d Weber also said that Sunrise made contact with the Biden campaign after the debate to offer \u201cfeedback,\u201d and described the nominee\u2019s team as \u201cvery receptive.\u201d \u201cThe Biden campaign has worked collaboratively with Sunrise Movement, our allies like (Rep.) Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, labor unions and frontline environmental justice communities to build a really bold and ambitious climate platform that is much stronger than what he was running on in the primary,\u201d Weber said. Biden has not given much way on the issues that galvanize progressives \u2013 he still opposes \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health insurance, is averse to liberal calls to change Senate rules in a tit-for-tat over the Republican push to confirm Trump\u2019s new Supreme Court nominee, and has kept his distance from the Green New Deal. Trump on Tuesday night sought to exploit those divisions, prodding Biden to publicly disavow the left wing of the party and potentially depress support for its nominee. The reality, though, was much different. Trump, perhaps more than any party leader or progressive champion, has been the glue that keeps together the seams of the Democratic coalition. His relentless and often racist attacks on members of the progressive lawmakers known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d particularly Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, have the effect of closing Democratic ranks \u2013 even for those who readily acknowledge Biden was not their first or second or even third choice going into the primary. \u201cI think (Trump\u2019s effort) backfired and united anti-fascist, socialists (and others) to do everything we could to elect Joe Biden, because it\u2019s not about an individual,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a leading progressive group, and a CNN political commentator. \u201cThis is about, as AOC says, letting democracy live another day.\u201d Trump, Rojas added, fundamentally misunderstood how the left views the coming election \u2013 and had, in ignorance, projected his own way of thinking, which prizes personal loyalty over any policy-driven political agenda. \u201cWhat he doesn\u2019t understand is that we can think about not just ourselves, as individuals and our feelings and what we care about, but we can recognize there\u2019s actually this really existential threat against our democracy, our planet, our country right now,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cAnd instead of looking at it and cowering in fear, we\u2019re going to tackle it head on alongside whoever\u2019s on our team right now, knowing that there\u2019s going to be lots of fights ahead when we do have, hopefully, a Democratic majority across the White House, the Senate and in the House.\u201d The lack of interest on the left for alternatives to Biden has also been illustrated by the struggles of the Green Party, which has been polling well below its 2016 levels, and is struggling to get on the ballot in a number of states. One of the reasons, Green presidential nominee Howie Hawkins told CNN recently, was that, at least in Wisconsin, typically progressive-friendly law firms didn\u2019t return their calls or help with their access fight \u2013 causing his campaign to turn to Republican-aligned lawyers. They ultimately lost in court. Asked whether Trump\u2019s goading and Biden\u2019s distancing himself from the Green New Deal could threaten the relationship between the nominee and the left, Jamaal Bowman, the Justice Democrats-backed progressive who defeated New York Rep. Eliot Engel in a June Democratic primary, laughed. \u201cIt has absolutely no effect whatsoever,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWe are all crystal clear that we need to get Trump out of the White House \u2013 like, yesterday. And we are all crystal clear that we need to flip the Senate and grow our numbers in the House. Because only then can we have a fully Democratic Congress and White House, and only then can we push Biden to the left in the way that we need to and hold him accountable. So when Trump does that, it has literally no effect.\u201d The state of relations between Biden and progressives came under scrutiny following the debate, when the former vice president, on a whistle-stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, told reporters he had not recently spoken to Ocasio-Cortez. He quickly followed up to note that he \u201cappreciated her endorsement.\u201d The Green New Deal, Biden continued, is \u201cnot a bad deal, but it\u2019s not the plan I have.\u201d On debate night, Biden batted away Trump\u2019s frequent claim that he was beholden to the \u201cradical left\u201d by reminding viewers that he had defeated Sanders \u2013 \u201cby a whole hell of a lot\u201d \u2013 and said, in victory, he had become the face of the party. Biden took a softer tone the day after, but didn\u2019t back off his fundamental point. \u201cWe negotiated, we debated and we had a primary election. And I won and I\u2019ve laid out what we\u2019re going to do, so I\u2019m not worried about losing the left, right or the center of the party,\u201d he said in Alliance, Ohio. \u201cThis is a big party. But I have one of the most progressive records (that) any Democrat\u2019s run on.\u201d The latter claim might raise some eyebrows on the left, but with a little more than a month to Election Day, the specter of another four years with Trump in the White House has pushed intra-Democratic squabbles off the table. Sanders has led the way in framing the stakes, campaigning virtually for Biden and warning, as he did in his Democratic convention speech, of the consequences of factionalism in a political crisis. \u201cUnder this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country. I and my family, and many of yours, know the insidious way authoritarianism destroys democracy, decency and humanity,\u201d Sanders said during his primetime speaking slot. \u201cAs long as I am here, I will work with progressives, with moderates, and, yes, with conservatives to preserve this nation from a threat that so many of our heroes fought and died to defeat.\u201d His message to supporters, in smaller gatherings like a video call with delegates before the convention, has included more nuanced arguments about power and political realism. He explained that night, in an almost professorial tone, the importance of \u201ccoalition politics\u201d and how it applied in the current context. \u201cIn politics, you got to think long term,\u201d he said in an interview the next day. \u201cThat\u2019s what coalition politics is about. It says, look, we disagree with you on health care, we disagree with you on aspects of criminal justice. We disagree with you on aspects of education. Fine, we\u2019re going to have a fight after the election \u2026 But right now, at this moment, we all \u2013 and that is Biden supporters, my supporters, other candidates\u2019 supporters, independents, and Republicans \u2013 have got to come together to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The Pennsylvania Republican Party is pushing back against an explosive report earlier this week in The Atlantic that said the GOP-run legislature is already strategizing how to overturn the statewide results if Trump loses. The Atlantic quoted Pennsylvania GOP chair Lawrence Tabas, who said this scheme, in which Republican legislators could appoint their own slate of electors, \u201cis one of the available legal options set forth in the Constitution\u201d and that he had \u201cmentioned it\u201d to the Trump campaign and hopes \u201cthey\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d In an emailed statement to CNN, Vonne Andring, executive director of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said that while what Tabas said was factually true, \u201cThe Atlantic used that interview to spin an out of context, pre-emptive farce.\u201d She did not, however, definitively rule out using the legislature to overturn the statewide results. \u201cAs the Chairman said, all of us want a swift, accurate result,\u201d Andring said. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen and Pamela Brown point out the statement also noted that Republicans, who control the legislature, recently passed a bill that would speed up ballot-processing. That provision has bipartisan support, but the bill has other measures that are opposed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, like banning new dropboxes and easing rules on partisan poll-watchers. Add to that this weird announcement from the Justice Department that it was, according to another Cohen report, \u201cinvestigating \u2018potential issues with mail-in ballots\u2019 in the swing state of Pennsylvania and, in a highly unusual disclosure, revealed that several ballots marked for President Donald Trump were \u2018discarded.\u2019\u201d What happened? \u201cUS Attorney David Freed said a preliminary inquiry determined that nine \u2018military ballots were discarded\u2019 and that seven of them \u2018were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump.\u2019 The incident occurred in Luzerne County, a swing county in northeastern Pennsylvania.\u201d But on Friday, Cohen reports, county officials said the problem was caused by a \u201ctemporary seasonal independent contractor\u201d on their third day of work helping the elections office. They said the contractor \u201cincorrectly\u201d threw the ballots into the office trash. The officials called this an \u201cerror\u201d and said the fact that it was quickly noticed and investigated proves that \u201cthe system of checks and balances\u201d is working to protect the election. Why is this weird? Cohen again: \u201cThe statement was highly unusual because it highlighted the fact that the ballots were marked for Trump \u2013 which immediately raised suspicions that the Justice Department was trying to furnish material that Trump could promote for political gain. Indeed, Trump and other White House aides used the information, even before it was made public, to attack mail-in voting.\u201d What\u2019s supposed to happen? Election officials go to extraordinary lengths to protect ballot secrecy. It\u2019s unclear how investigators figured out who the votes were for, and why they made that information public. And the county also said it learned on Thursday \u2013 from the Justice Department\u2019s unusual press release \u2013 that seven of the ballots has been cast for Trump. But Trump was talking about the case even before it had been announced, in an interview on Fox News radio. There\u2019s a completely different drama in North Carolina, where the two Republican members of the state election board resigned this week citing a court settlement over mail-in voting practices. Republicans have asked the Department of Justice to look into the board\u2019s efforts to count ballots postmarked by Election Day but that arrive later and allow people to cure mail-in ballots that are rejected for technical problems, as will happen in a number of states. Read more here. So what\u2019s going on? These are all variations on the theme of Republicans taking a cue from Trump and trying to discredit mail-in ballots in small ways all over the country. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb has a very good story on that here. The involvement of the Department of Justice is the latest development. And while Attorney General Bill Barr is aiding Trump\u2019s theories about voting, FBI Director Christopher Wray agrees with experts and evidence that there is no widespread voter fraud effort. That appears to have put Wray on the outs with the White House. There\u2019s more. The Florida Attorney General is, according to NPR, asking law enforcement agencies to investigate Mike Bloomberg\u2019s effort to pay the fines of Florida felons so they can vote. Cash cards. Trump wants send $200 drug discount cards to seniors on Medicare, a group he\u2019s struggling to attract \u2013 and that Democratic nominee Joe Biden is doing well with. Which, wow. How\u2019s he going to pay for that? We don\u2019t know so much. Read this column by CNN analyst and elections expert Rick Hasen in Slate, where he argues that the Pennsylvania reporting, all the different legal fights and Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to claim there\u2019s voter fraud all work together as an effort to pre-empt the democratic vote. \u201cWe should not think of the litigation and the wild claims of voter fraud as separate from one another. Instead, they are part of a play to grab power if the election is close enough. There are good legal arguments against a power grab, but if another body tries to overturn the will of the people in voting for president, there will be protests in the streets, with the potential for violence. Tom Friedman, the New York Times columnist, was even more alarmed and told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Thursday that he fears the US is headed for a second civil war. Watch that moment. That might be alarmist, but we are definitely in a place where serious people are wondering if the country can handle this election.",

            "article_content": "In his latest bid to show that he\u2019s lowering drug prices, President Donald Trump said Thursday \u2013 less than six weeks before the election \u2013 that he will send $200 drug discount cards to 33 million Americans on Medicare. The unprecedented move, however, has raised many questions, including how the roughly $6.6 billion in benefits will be funded. And the timing has fueled accusations that the effort is a late-stage attempt to curry favor with senior citizen voters, who polls show favor Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The White House says that the cards will be offset by savings from another of Trump\u2019s drug price proposals, which would link the cost of certain Medicare drugs to the price in other countries. But that controversial measure was unveiled in an executive order in mid-September, and it\u2019s unclear when it will actually take effect, if ever. \u201cIt\u2019s illusory savings because they don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard University. \u201cIt\u2019s a program that\u2019s just sketched out in the broadest terms in an executive order just last week. To think this is the balance that they would use is unprecedented.\u201d Asked about the funding Friday, a senior administration official said the details are still being worked out and the White House will release more information soon. The Wall Street Journal reported that the money will come from a Medicare trust fund. The White House also pointed to a section of the law that gives the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the authority to waive Medicare payments and benefit statutes to conduct demonstration projects. The agency uses demonstrations to test innovations that have been shown to be successful in improving access and quality and/or lowering health care costs. Experts, however, question what test the agency is undertaking with the discount cards, which are aimed at helping seniors cover their drug co-pays. The plan may be to see whether the additional financial help prompts beneficiaries to better adhere to their prescribed medicines, the White House told the Wall Street Journal. But dozens of studies have already found that to be true, plus it would be difficult to make that assessment based on a one-time payment, Kesselheim said. The cards will be mailed in coming weeks, the White House said. But a senior administration official said not all would be in the hands of Medicare beneficiaries by Election Day. Trump\u2019s announcement of the cards, which came during a speech listing the health care actions he\u2019s taken during his first term, is the President\u2019s most recent effort aimed at convincing Americans he\u2019s fulfilling his pledge to lower drug prices. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that money came from Big Pharma back from their pockets in the pockets of American seniors,\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Thursday. \u201cIf they have any question about if he\u2019s for real, wait until that card is received in the mail.\u201d The move follows a series of executive orders he\u2019s signed in the past two months that largely recycle prior proposals, including allowing the importation of drugs from Canada and effectively banning drug makers from providing billions of dollars in rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. However, a single infusion for seniors will not help lower drug prices, said Craig Garthwaite, director of the Program on Healthcare at the Northwestern\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cI was just a bit baffled what from a policy standpoint this could be other than currying favor with particular groups,\u201d said Garthwaite, noting that discount cards that drug companies send consumers are viewed as pushing up prices. During recent negotiations over drug costs, Trump had pushed the pharmaceutical industry to send $100 cash cards to millions of seniors, according to the New York Times. But drug companies balked at sending what some called \u201cTrump Cards,\u201d and the deal collapsed. The main industry lobbying group said it did not have any additional information about the $200 cards, but voiced its opposition to the idea. \u201cAs we\u2019ve previously said, one-time savings cards will neither provide lasting help, nor advance the fundamental reforms necessary to help seniors better afford their medicines,\u201d according to a statement from PhRMA. The White House did not answer a question about whether the cards would have Trump\u2019s name on them.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is touting what he calls his health care \u201cvision,\u201d but the executive orders he\u2019s planning to sign Thursday afternoon largely punt on addressing two major issues facing Americans. The measures, which fall far short of a comprehensive proposal, come less than six weeks before the presidential election and serve as a political play to shore up concerns at a swing state event. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has already committed to making health care a focal point of the rest of his campaign, highlighting Trump\u2019s actions to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and the unprecedented protections the law already provides for people with pre-existing conditions. The President is also looking to shift attention away from criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 200,000 Americans have died from the virus over the past six months. The first executive order will state that it\u2019s US policy that people who suffer from pre-existing conditions will be protected, the President said. Any legislation Congress sends to his desk must include this provision, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting it down in a stamp, because our opponents, the Democrats, like to constantly talk about it and yet pre-existing conditions are much safer with us than they are with them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd now we have it affirmed. This is affirmed, signed and done. So we can put that to rest.\u201d The President and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly said they will safeguard these Americans, even as they try to tear down the Affordable Care Act that already protects them. In a call with reporters, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declined to specify how the administration would guarantee these protections if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark health reform law in a case it will consider this term. White House again promises health care plan roll out in coming weeks The second executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing by the end of the year, and if lawmakers don\u2019t achieve this, Azar will seek to do so via executive or regulatory action. Trump already called for an end to the practice in a 2019 speech and in his State of the Union address earlier this year. Though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree, legislation has been stymied by differing views on who should cover the tab \u2013 insurers or providers. Though the President has repeatedly promised to roll out a health care proposal, the administration has decided to bill the wide variety of measures Trump has taken as his vision. In his speech, Trump laid out what he calls his America First Healthcare Plan, which includes many measures his administration put forth during his first term \u2013 some of which have been enacted, but others that remain proposals or tied up in court. Among them: Broadening less-expensive alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, requiring hospitals to disclose prices they negotiate, reducing insulin costs for senior citizens and improving kidney health. He also noted that Americans insured through Medicare Advantage have seen premiums drop. Trump also said that senior citizens will receive $200 cards in the coming weeks to help them purchase prescription medications. A senior administration official told CNN the money will come in the form of discount cards for prescription drug copays. The official said the cost for the cards will be offset by savings from Trump\u2019s recent \u201cfavored nations\u201d executive action, which calls for Medicare to test paying the same price for certain expensive prescription drugs that other developed countries do. Funding for the cards will come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a designated Medicare demonstration project. The orders are the latest health care-related actions Trump has taken in recent weeks as he seeks to take back control of the issue from Biden. Health care rocketed into the spotlight again with the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, which heightens the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act\u2019s fate in the nation\u2019s highest court. The justices will hear oral arguments on a case seeking to take down the law on November 10, one week after the election. The Trump administration has asked the court to invalidate Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions have proved among its most popular provisions. Democrats\u2019 defense of the law helped them capture control of the House in 2018. The protections include barring insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people based on their medical history \u2013 both common practices in the individual market prior to Obamacare. An estimated 54 million Americans \u2013 or 27% of non-elderly adults \u2013 have conditions that would have rendered them uninsurable under the old system, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The law also requires insurers to provide comprehensive benefits in the individual market and bans them from imposing annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Though the President has said repeatedly that he will continue these protections, his actions say otherwise. The administration is largely backing a coalition of Republican-led state attorneys general, who say that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional when Congress reduced the penalty for not having insurance to zero in 2017. As a result, the entire law must fall, they contend. This case is now before the Supreme Court. Administration officials also contend that Obamacare doesn\u2019t truly protect those with pre-xisting conditions because its premiums and deductibles are unaffordable. However, Trump\u2019s alternative \u2013 short-term health plans, which he expanded through an executive order in 2017 \u2013 come with lower monthly premiums in large part because these policies don\u2019t have to adhere to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations. Also, the President\u2019s efforts to continue the protections do little to help people afford health insurance should Obamacare be declared unconstitutional. The act provides generous subsidies to low- and moderate-income Americans to buy policies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and supports states that expand Medicaid to low-income adults. Some 38 states, plus the District of Columbia, have broadened Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. The President has also spoken several about solving the problem of surprise medical billing, another one of Americans\u2019 big health care concerns. Patients are often hit with surprise medical bills when they receive emergency care from an out-of-network provider that they did not choose. Roughly 1-in-6 emergency room visits or in-hospital stays generated at least one out-of-network bill in 2017, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Efforts to address the issue in Congress have been bogged down amid a lobbying and advertising blitz by the health care industry. Insurers favor the government setting a benchmark rate, but hospitals and other providers \u2013 often backed by private equity firms \u2013 strongly support resolving the matter through arbitration. In recent weeks, the President has sought to renew attention on his efforts to lower drug prices, one of the main promises of his campaign and first term. The high cost of prescription medicine has long been one of Americans\u2019 chief health care complaints. He has issued four executive orders since late July that largely recycle controversial ideas his administration has proposed in the past, including importing less-expensive medications from Canada and basing the cost of certain Medicare drugs on their prices in other developed nations. But his measures, which also included calling out drug manufacturers on Twitter, have not resulted in lowering drug prices, though the rate of price growth slowed between 2015 and 2019. Manufacturers hiked prices on 857 drugs by an average of 6.8% in the first six months of this year, according to GoodRx, which follows several thousand brand name and generic medications. The administration is also committed to giving consumers more information about health care prices as a way to control their growth. Officials issued a historic rule in November requiring hospitals to disclose the prices they privately negotiate with insurers. The measure stems from an executive order Trump issued in the summer of 2019. A district court judge this summer rejected an attempt by a coalition of hospital groups to block the rule, though the hospitals have filed an appeal. Trump officials have also proposed a separate rule that would require insurers to provide consumers with estimates of their out-of-pocket costs for all health care services through an online tool. Some experts, however, say the rules won\u2019t help many consumers because people don\u2019t typically shop for medical services. CNN\u2019s Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump will lay out his vision for health care in the coming two weeks, the White House claims, after blowing through a number of self-imposed deadlines to produce a long-promised plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe President in the next week or so will be laying out his vision for health care. Some of that has already been put out there \u2013 telemedicine and lowering the cost of drugs \u2026 and protecting pre-existing conditions. But the President will be laying out some additional health care steps in the coming, I would say, two weeks,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Tuesday when asked if the President\u2019s health care plan exists. Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News Tuesday that Trump\u2019s health care plan will include taking executive action to guarantee Americans with pre-existing conditions must be covered by health insurance \u2013 even as his administration works to dismantle those same protections under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe President\u2019s also been very clear that we\u2019re going to make sure that any American with a pre-existing condition continues to have coverage,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe President\u2019s going to take action in the weeks ahead to ensure that and we\u2019re going to continue to take our case to Capitol Hill to pass a new health care reform bill.\u201d Trump is expected to deliver remarks on health care when he visits Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday. Trump finally releases controversial drug price executive order The latest deadline set by the White House is less than two months before the 2020 election, but there is virtually no chance the legislation will be approved by Congress and ready for Trump to sign before November 3. Trump\u2019s attempts to replace the Affordable Care Act while in office go back to 2017, when efforts to pass a Republican health care bill backed by the White House fell apart. GOP lawmakers have shied away from tackling the issue since then. Still, the President has repeatedly promised to unveil a new health care bill. In an interview with Fox News this July, Trump said he would be signing a \u201cfull and complete health care plan\u201d within two weeks. And in an August 3 press briefing, Trump said his health care plan would most likely be released before the end of the month. And at an ABC town hall last week, Trump said that his health care plan is \u201call ready.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing a health care plan very strongly and protect people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters last week that an Obamacare-alternative health care plan will be rolled out sometime \u201cbefore the election.\u201d The plan will be in the form of \u201can executive action with a legislative component that is more visionary,\u201d he said, adding that he is not optimistic that Congress could pass something, which he said was the reason for the significant delay. Since the drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress ended, the President and his administration have put forth a series of smaller measures that officials and the campaign point to as his health care efforts, though many remain in the proposal stage. They seek to increase the transparency of hospital prices, combat opioid addiction, improve kidney health, expand alternatives to Obamacare and make Medicare Advantage plans more attractive, among others. In recent weeks, he issued four executive orders that largely recycle previous proposals aimed at reducing drug costs, including allowing the importation of drugs from Canada and tying prices of certain Medicare drugs to their cost in other countries. Should Trump win reelection, he may find that he has to come up with a plan to replace Obamacare in his second term. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on November 10 on a case that could overturn the landmark health reform law and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The case stems from a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican state attorneys general who argue that when Congress cut the tax penalty on the uninsured to zero, it rendered that individual mandate unconstitutional. The group also contends that the entire law should fall because the mandate was intertwined with a number of other provisions. The Justice Department has largely backed the Texas-led coalition, though it recently argued that the ruling should only apply to the 18 states that brought the challenge.

            "article_content": "More than seven weeks after President Donald Trump signed four executive orders aimed at lowering drug prices, the White House finally released Sunday perhaps the most controversial one. It calls for Medicare to test paying the same price for certain expensive prescription drugs that other developed countries do, a \u201cmost-favored-nation price.\u201d Other nations typically pay far less for medications, in large part because their governments often determine the cost \u2013 which runs counter to Republicans\u2019 allegiance to the free market system. Though Trump has slammed socialist health care systems that exist in other countries and attacked his Democratic rivals for seeking to implement such a setup here, he celebrated linking US prices to peer nations\u2019 lower costs. \u201cJust signed a new Executive Order to LOWER DRUG PRICES! My Most Favored Nation order will ensure that our Country gets the same low price Big Pharma gives to other countries,\u201d he tweeted Sunday. \u201cThe days of global freeriding at America\u2019s expense are over \u2026 and prices are coming down FAST! Also just ended all rebates to middlemen, further reducing prices.\u201d The measure, which is strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, has been somewhat of a mystery since the President signed the original order on July 24. At the time, he said he was holding a meeting with drug company executives to present their ideas for reducing costs and would hold off on implementing the action for a month. That meeting, however, never happened, and the White House has been mum since Trump\u2019s deadline to implement the order passed in late August. The newly-issued order expands the scope of the policy to include certain Part D drugs sold at pharmacies, in addition to some Part B medications administered at hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices. On Sunday, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said the administration gave drug makers a month to come up with a counter proposal. \u201cNegotiations did not produce an acceptable alternative, so the President is moving forward,\u201d he said. The main pharmaceutical industry group, PhRMA, called the move \u201cirresponsible and unworkable\u201d and said it \u201cwill give foreign governments a say in how America provides access to treatments and cures for seniors and people struggling with devastating diseases.\u201d The other actions signed in July mainly recycle proposals the administration has floated in the past, including importing lower-cost medication from other countries and effectively banning drug makers from providing billions of dollars in rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers in Medicare and Medicaid. Unlikely to have any impact before the election, the executive orders come at a time when Trump is trying to fulfill his longstanding campaign promise to lower drug prices, though little movement has been made. Most of the administration\u2019s actions \u2013 including the effort to import medication from Canada \u2013 remain in the proposal phase or have been rejected by the courts. The release comes a day before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer are set to kick off a \u201cYour Health, Your Vote\u201d virtual bus tour with Protect Our Care, a left-leaning advocacy group founded by an Obama administration health official. However, they also come at a time when Trump is courting drug makers to swiftly develop vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 and inking hefty deals to do so. Trump has come under fire for his response to the coronavirus pandemic, including last week\u2019s revelation by journalist Bob Woodward that the President knew in early February how deadly it was but downplayed the threat. In its statement, the pharmaceutical industry also noted that the focus of reforms should include \u201cprotecting the critical work being done to end COVID-19\u201d and the country should \u201cnot gamble\u201d on \u201cour ability to win the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d The President first outlined an International Pricing Index proposal to set Medicare reimbursement levels for certain drugs on their cost in other countries in October 2018, seeking to bolster Republicans\u2019 standing on health care days before the midterm election. It called for the \u201ctarget price\u201d to be 126% of the average of what other countries pay. The concept, which is supported by Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has always failed in the past after running into major resistance from drug companies. CNN\u2019s Jason Hoffman contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "In new letters, House Democrats are demanding new documents about the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 $250 million contract with a marketing firm handling a campaign on coronavirus that Democrats say they want to ensure does not go to propping up the President\u2019s reelection campaign. The contract, which was advertised over the summer to help the administration \u201cdefeat despair and inspire hope\u201d surrounding coronavirus, according to the performance work document sent to communication firms and first reported by Politico in August, is valued at a quarter of a billion dollars. The House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, Jim Clyburn, the chairman of the select committee on coronavirus and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a subcommittee chairman, sent letters to both Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Ben Garthwaite, the chief executive officer for Fors Marsh Group, the market research firm that ultimately got the contract. \u201cWe have grave concerns that, rather than focus on planning and executing a national strategy to contain the coronavirus, the Trump Administration is using a quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer money to fund what appears to be a political propaganda campaign just two months before a presidential election,\u201d House Democrats wrote in their letters. Democrats also wrote \u201cto address the despair many Americans are experiencing during this pandemic, the Administration needs to be honest about the risks Americans face and promote science-based solutions \u2013not political spin \u2013 to finally contain the virus and prevent more unnecessary infections and deaths.\u201d \u201cThe public relations firm hired by HHS will report to Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo, who is a former campaign operative for President Trump and not a public health professional,\u201d the letters say. Fors Marsh Group acknowledged receipt of the letter Friday morning. \u201cWe are reviewing and will certainly respond and cooperate with all parties in doing so,\u201d Fors Marsh Group CEO Ben Garthwaite said in a statement. A public health communication specialist for the US Department of Health and Human Services said the public service announcements will hit several themes. Some, for example, will emphasize \u201cthe three W\u2019s\u201d \u2013 wearing a mask, watching distance (social distancing) and washing hands. Others will educate about vaccines against the flu and Covid-19. Mark Weber is leading the Covid-19 campaign. He\u2019s worked for HHS for 31 years and has developed public health campaigns under five presidential administrations. \u201cI\u2019m all about public health, not politics,\u201d he said. Weber noted the questions being asked about how the contract was awarded. \u201cIt was competed, and those proposals were reviewed by career federal officials, not political appointees, who made the recommendation, and the organization that came in with the best proposal won,\u201d he said. Some of the announcements have already started airing, such as those encouraging donation of convalescent plasma by people who\u2019ve recovered from Covid-19, which went out about a month ago on outdoor and digital advertising in 18 markets that have been hit especially hard by the virus. The campaign is also spending about $650,000 to place announcements aimed at encouraging Black people and Latinos to participate in clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines. Those spots, which were developed by a team hired by the National Institutes of Health, have already started airing. HHS is currently developing announcements that will pair public health experts with actors, musicians and athletes to educate people about Covid-19. The plan is that the experts will include physicians Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration; Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams; Rear Adm. Dr. Erica Schwartz, deputy surgeon general; as well as Alex Azar, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services; Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and Rear Adm. Michael Weahkee, director of the Indian Health Service. The letters come just days after a new audio recordings between President Donald Trump and journalist Bob Woodward revealed the President purposefully downplayed the severity of the coronavirus back in March. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Trump told Woodward on March 19, even as he had declared a national emergency over the virus days earlier. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d It\u2019s not unprecedented for an administration to use a marketing or public relations firm to help craft a message or conduct research about public health. Fors Marsh lists on its websites several previous campaigns it worked on with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration on issues related to childhood asthma and rural health habits. And when former President Barack Obama was trying to educate and sell Americans on the Affordable Care Act, the administration spent millions on advertising to get people to sign up. Still, House Democrats are requesting that the contract between Health and Human Services and Fors Marsh be suspended until they receive documents including the \u201ccomplete and unredacted\u201d contract \u201cand all documents and communications referring or relating to the contract award process.\u201d Democrats also want to receive assurances that no ad campaign will include overtly political messages. The committee is also asking for a staff briefing by September 28. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It had all the makings for another upset. Democratic Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a 30-plus year member of the House, faced a primary challenge from an up and coming mayor 40 years his junior, running to his left. Alex Morse, mayor of Holyoke since he was 22, argued Neal was out of touch with the district, and should be doing more in his powerful leadership position as House Ways and Means Committee chairman \u2013 and hammered Neal over not backing progressive benchmarks like the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Morse\u2019s bid caught the interest and financial support from outside groups with track records for supporting successful primary challenges: Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement and even Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s newly formed PAC. \u201cAll these candidates benefited from a national network of fundraising and we saw Alex beginning to do that, and his fundraising was picking up and he was having bigger events,\u201d said Joshua Karp, an adviser to the Neal campaign. It looked like it could have been a repeat of a story we\u2019re seeing more and more in Democratic races. But it wasn\u2019t. Morse called Neal and conceded on primary election night last week. While there were plenty of developments that made the primary unique, aides and advisers from both campaigns as well as political observers saw lessons learned from the race that other incumbents would do well to keep in mind in the future. If there\u2019s one key message for longtime incumbents, it is to take the race seriously. Neal didn\u2019t make the same mistakes as his now-former colleagues \u2013 he showed up for debates, he raised money and he spent on advertising. He wasn\u2019t caught on hot mic like at least one incumbent who lost this year was. He had also just fended off a primary challenge in 2018, meaning he had a campaign infrastructure already in place. \u201cI think to Neal\u2019s credit, he didn\u2019t take this for granted. He worked really hard,\u201d said Doug Rubin, a Morse adviser. \u201cHe leveraged all the things he could leverage, he had outside groups, and he took it very seriously.\u201d Both sides saw outside spending according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings, including nearly $70,000 from the American Hospital PAC in support of Neal, $311,450 in opposition to Morse from the American Working Families PAC, and $1,392 from Indivisible Action in support of Morse. \u201cIt was always going to be hard,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the Justice Democrats, which also backed Missouri\u2019s Cori Bush and New York\u2019s Jamaal Bowman\u2019s successful primary challenges earlier this summer. \u201cI think this race turned out the way it did for a lot of different reasons but at the end of the day, this was going to be a difficult fight for progressives.\u201d Massachusetts may have a reputation as a deep blue state, but progressive bonafides aren\u2019t the surefire path to victory in the western part. \u201cEven though the progressives pushed (Ed) Markey ahead, especially in the Boston area, and they voted for him here, but they just don\u2019t have the numbers out here to rack up the win for Morse,\u201d said Ray La Raja, political science professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst, citing the Senate race at the top of the Democratic primary ticket. Neal\u2019s longtime ties to the district were especially helpful when the pandemic altered the campaign trail. \u201cHe may be chairman of Ways and Means Committee, but if you ask anyone in the district, he\u2019s still referred to as Richie Neal,\u201d said Candy Glazer, a Neal backer and former longtime chair of the Longmeadow Democrats. \u201cYou have to stay close to your district,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cSome of the upsets either the district changed and the incumbent didn\u2019t realize it, which was not the case here for Congressman Neal, but I think you also have to have a record you can point to.\u201d Massachusetts\u2019 first congressional district is the largest in the commonwealth, made up of 87 cities and towns. Its rural swaths are peppered with small towns and a few small urban areas like Springfield, Holyoke and Pittsfield. \u201cMorse\u2019s progressive message did not resonate in many of these areas. People seem to care more about constituency services than the progressive agenda, so Neal had a huge advantage on that count,\u201d said Howard Gold, professor of government at Smith College in Northampton. The race did get national attention in the run up to Election Day, in part from a scandal with unexpected twists. In early August, the Massachusetts College Democrats sent a letter to Morse disinviting him from future events and accusing the openly gay mayor and former university lecturer of using his positions to leverage sexual or romantic relationships with students, some of whom were made to feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d by the interactions. The school newspaper published parts of a letter, given to them by a source. Morse apologized in an email to the College Democrats on the same day he received their allegation, stressing that all of his interactions and relationships with students had been consensual. The day after the story of the exchange broke, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he\u2019d previously lectured, announced it\u2019d opened a Title IX investigation. Many of Morse\u2019s most prominent supporters, including Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, went silent or announced they would pause their efforts until more information became available. The Victory Fund was one of the few that stuck by Morse, condemning the allegations. \u201cThey were the kind of partners you\u2019d want in a fight like that,\u201d Rubin said. Things then got even more complicated in the days after the student group\u2019s letter was published. The Intercept obtained and published messages between students who, before the accusations became public, appeared to be discussing ways to undermine Morse\u2019s candidacy. The site was also first to report that the Massachusetts Democratic Party had been previously alerted to the allegations and referred the organization\u2019s leadership to a prominent Democratic attorney for legal advice. Neal\u2019s campaign has denied any connection to the writing or dissemination of the accusations and there is no evidence Neal was aware of, or played any role, in stoking them. The incident garnered national coverage \u2013 and Morse\u2019s best week of fundraising. \u201cIn the district, I think it had a very negative impact on Alex whereas nationally it definitely helped increase attention and raise money and raise his profile,\u201d Rubin said. Days before the election, the University of Massachusetts Amherst College Democrats\u2019 executive board apologized for releasing the letter and the \u201chomophobic attacks as a result of our actions.\u201d After the election, Victory Fund criticized Morse\u2019s loss by a \u201chomophobic campaign strategy,\u201d adding: \u201cThe attacks drew national attention to the double standards LGBTQ candidates often face \u2013 especially as it relates to their dating and sex lives.\u201d Facing no Republican opponent this fall, Neal\u2019s reelection is all but assured, and the outcome of this month\u2019s primary could impact his strategy for 2022. \u201cYou can bet Richie Neal is going to be paying attention to these groups and trying to work with some of them so they don\u2019t primary him again,\u201d La Raja said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already proved their point even though Morse lost.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Richard Neal, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, has staved off a primary challenge for his US House seat in Massachusetts, following the concession Tuesday night of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Mayor Alex Morse. \u201cI just want to start off by congratulating congressman Richard Neal on winning his reelection tonight,\u201d Morse told supporters Tuesday evening. \u201cBut I also want to make it very clear how incredibly proud I am of what we fought for over the last 14 months.\u201d Winning his current job as Holyoke mayor straight out of college in 2011, Morse supports \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal \u2013 defining issues for the more liberal wing of the party. Neal, who has been in Congress since 1989 and chairs the House\u2019s powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, is seen by progressives as an unfriendly obstacle on both fronts. Neal said in a speech to supporters declaring victory on Tuesday, \u201cThe breadth of this campaign is substantial and I intend in the next two years to put it to good use. Thank you all very much.\u201d Ousting Neal would have been a two-for-the-price-of-one blow for the left, clearing the way for a new, more liberal committee chairman \u2013 Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett would be Neal\u2019s most likely successor \u2013 while adding another young insurgent to the ranks of a growing bloc of progressive lawmakers, headlined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose political action committee endorsed Morse last month. A victory for Morse, coupled with the renomination on Tuesday of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who co-wrote the Green New Deal resolution with Ocasio-Cortez and overcame a primary challenge of his own from Rep. Joe Kennedy III, would have capped off a bittersweet year for progressives, who made gains in Congress despite seeing their champions, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, lose out in the presidential primary. \u201cTaking on Neal was always going to be our biggest battle. He\u2019s the number one recipient of corporate PAC donations in all of Congress and wields an enormous amount of power over elected officials, labor unions and community organizations as Ways and Means chair,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cWhile Neal walks away damaged and vulnerable, Alex Morse emerges as an inspiration for his community who overcame a culture of fear instilled by the incumbent and desperate, manufactured attacks.\u201d Early voting in the race to represent Western Massachusetts\u2019 1st Congressional District began August 22, a little more than two weeks after a letter written by the state\u2019s College Democrats to Morse, alleging that he had used his positions, as an elected official and former lecturer at University of Massachusetts Amherst, to pursue romantic or sexual relationships with students. The school quickly announced it would open a Title IX investigation and a number of groups supporting his campaign froze in place, as they tried to sort through the accusations. Sen. Ed Markey defeats a Kennedy in Massachusetts Morse, who is gay, apologized at the time, saying that while any relationships he\u2019d had were consensual, he regretted making anyone feel \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d as the letter alleged. But the story took another turn August 12, when The Intercept published messages between students who, before the accusations became public, appeared to be discussing ways to undermine Morse\u2019s candidacy. Neal\u2019s campaign has denied any connection to the writing or publication of the letter and there is no evidence he was aware of or did anything to stoke the controversy. The Massachusetts Democratic Party, which The Intercept was also first to report had referred the student group to a lawyer with ties to the party, has since begun the process of launching a separate probe into \u201cthe actions and decisions that led to the release of the letter by the College Democrats of Massachusetts.\u201d On Saturday, the College Democrats released a statement, addressed to its membership, apologizing for its handling of the situation \u2013 in particular the \u201chomophobic conversation\u201d that followed the publication of the initial letter to Morse. Elliot Imse, communications director for the Victory Fund, a group that works to elect LGBTQ candidates and endorsed Morse in July, told CNN in August that the letter played into homophobic stereotypes. \u201cFor us, it was really important that these political attacks against Alex failed,\u201d Imse said, \u201cbecause if they didn\u2019t, it would only set a precedent to use these types of attacks against LGBTQ candidates in the future.\u201d Justice Democrats, the group that launched the candidacies of Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, the Missouri activist who defeated Rep. William Lacy Clay in an August primary \u2013 her second attempt after falling short in 2018 \u2013 furthered its commitment to Morse after The Intercept\u2019s reporting cast doubt on the motivations behind the letter. Progressive who unseated longtime Democratic congressman says 'people are looking for a fighter right now' By Election Day, Justice Democrats\u2019 independent expenditure arm is expected to have spent more than $600,000 on television, digital and radio ads \u2013 in addition to the group\u2019s fundraising directly for his campaign, which it said came in at $140,000. Indivisible and the Sunrise Movement were among the other high profile progressive organizations to back Morse. Neal received outside support from a group called American Working Families \u2013 not to be confused with the Working Families Party, which backed Morse \u2013 and outspent his challenger, according to filings from the middle of August, by a more than 4-to-1 margin, as he dipped into his deep war chest. Morse\u2019s fundraising spiked in the closing weeks, as voters were casting their ballots early and by mail, but not enough to draw close to the incumbent. Morse and Justice Democrats have centered much of their case against Neal on his donor list, calling him \u201ccorporate America\u2019s favorite Democrat,\u201d and pointing to the amount of money \u2013 no Democrat has taken more \u2013 he\u2019s raised from corporate PACs. Those relationships, progressives say, are behind Neal\u2019s efforts to pushback or water down popular legislation. \u201cIf you contribute to my campaign you buy into my agenda,\u201d Neal said, rejecting those charges, during a recent debate. \u201cI\u2019m not buying into yours.\u201d He has also pointed to his record of spreading those funds around to other Democratic House candidates, arguing that it helped build the party\u2019s majority in Congress. Working Families Party endorses Massachusetts progressives Ed Markey and House challenger Alex Morse House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been among Neal\u2019s most vocal national supporters. She cut an ad for him, touting the \u201cover a billion dollars\u201d he\u2019s delivered to the district. Neal, too, has warned electing Morse, who would arrive on Capitol Hill next year as junior member of the caucus, would make it more difficult to secure those dollars. And unlike some of his colleagues, who lost primaries after losing political touch and clout within their districts, Neal remains a political stalwart in Western Massachusetts, where he gained prominence as the mayor of Springfield in the 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s still the local guy,\u201d said Candy Glazer, the former chair of the Longmeadow Democratic Town Committee and a Neal supporter. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a call if someone in your family dies. He\u2019ll be at the wake. It\u2019s still the old grassroots politics.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke on Sunday backed his friend and former colleague Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy in his primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey. The September 1 election is one of the most closely watched primary fights of the 2020 cycle. \u201cI\u2019ve known Joe Kennedy as a friend, as a colleague in Congress and as a champion for the values we\u2019re most proud of as Democrats. But it\u2019s the times I\u2019ve seen him in Texas that have made the biggest impression on me, and why I proudly endorse him for U.S. Senate,\u201d O\u2019Rourke tweeted. O\u2019Rourke lost a 2018 Senate bid against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz and later ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, dropping out last fall. \u201cOne of the first times I saw Joe in Texas was after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston & surrounding areas. Some had lost their homes, others had lost everything, and they needed help. Joe was on the ground working w/ local leaders to connect them with federal and state services,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe later came back down to help us campaign against Ted Cruz. The conventional wisdom said we had no shot. But he believed in our grassroots campaign & lent a hand at a time that we really needed it. I saw him do that for countless Congressional candidates across the country.\u201d Kennedy also recently secured the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Kennedy rejected the initial calls for him to run for Senate more than a year ago, saying in an interview that the \u201cthought literally never crossed my mind to jump into a Democratic primary\u201d against his friend, Markey, who has served in Congress since before he was born and has known Kennedy throughout his life. Yet after repeated requests, Kennedy took a look and saw that despite 44 years in the US House and Senate, Markey was not beloved in the state. So, the four-term congressman announced a Senate bid in the fall of 2019 focused on \u201csocial and economic justice,\u201d offering generational change. A Kennedy has never lost Massachusetts. But the presumptive heir to the Democratic Party\u2019s family dynasty may have made a risky bet. Markey, 74, has countered the shine of the Kennedy name by projecting the power of some of the party\u2019s stars, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who have fundraised for the senator. Markey supporters say he deserves another six-year term based on his voting record and highlight his co-authorship of the Green New Deal and earlier support of \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d pointing to both as signs that he is of the times. Kennedy, meanwhile, has maintained that he would be a different kind of senator, who will travel across the country and the state to elect Democrats, as he did in 2018 to help the party retake the House.

The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division \u201cis evaluating whether to initiate investigations under the federal \u2018Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act,\u2019\u201d the department said in a statement announcing the request. \u201cThe Civil Rights Division seeks to determine if the state orders requiring admission of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes is responsible for the deaths of nursing home residents.\u201d The department noted in the release that the four states \u2013 New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan \u2013 all \u201crequired nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients to their vulnerable populations, often without adequate testing.\u201d Federal guidelines issued on March 13 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stated, in part, \u201cNursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\u201d In a joint statement on Wednesday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that more than a dozen other states had issued similar orders based on federal guidelines but the Justice Department was targeting these four states because they\u2019re led by Democrats. New Jersey\u2019s Democratic governor said that it \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d that the letter was issued during the Republican National Convention and is focused on four states with Democratic governors. \u201cThe fact that this request from the Department of Justice, sent only to four states with Democratic governors, was announced by press release during the Republican National Convention speaks volumes about the nature of the review,\u201d Alyana Alfaro, Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s press secretary, told CNN, adding that the office doesn\u2019t comment on investigative inquiries. Whitmer\u2019s press secretary, Tiffany Brown, similarly said the timing of the request \u201cshould make it crystal clear that this is nothing more than election-year politics.\u201d CNN has reached out to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf for comment. Nursing homes have maintained a particularly sensitive role in the pandemic, with some of the most devastating hotspots having occurred at facilities across the country, including the Life Care Center in Washington state that was once the US epicenter of the outbreak. Early on, several states, most notably, New York, issued orders requiring nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients. New York\u2019s order, issued in late March, mandated that nursing homes must not deny readmission or admission to people \u201csolely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\u201d Cuomo announced a new policy in May that said a hospital cannot discharge a person who is Covid-19 positive to a nursing home. The DOJ noted in its release that New York\u2019s high coronavirus death toll is comprised of \u201cmany\u201d elderly people. \u201cProtecting the rights of some of society\u2019s most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country\u2019s most important obligations,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Division Eric Dreiband said in the statement. \u201cWe must ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk.\u201d This story has been updated with governors\u2019 responses.

            "article_content": "For more than a year, the story of Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse\u2019s challenge to incumbent Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, in the state\u2019s western 1st Congressional District, followed a familiar narrative. The 31-year-old Morse, backed by Justice Democrats and other leading progressive groups, was taking aim at Neal, 71, over his refusal to embrace \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal and, in his powerful position as the chairman of House Ways and Means Committee, more aggressively pursue oversight of the Trump administration. Morse has described Neal as an absentee representative, detached from struggles of his constituents, and a magnet for corporate campaign cash. By early this month, following a run of insurgent victories over establishment candidates and incumbents, including activist Cori Bush\u2019s unseating of Rep. William Lacy Clay in Missouri on August 4, Morse\u2019s campaign had become a focal point of the progressive left \u2013 a movement that, despite seeing its icon, Sen. Bernie Sanders, fall short in the presidential primary, is poised to enter the next Congress with a larger voting bloc and deeper foothold in the Democratic congressional caucus. But the Morse campaign\u2019s path took a mighty twist a few weeks ago, when, on August 7, the school newspaper at the University of Massachusetts Amherst published parts of a letter, given to them by a source, written by the Massachusetts College Democrats and delivered to Morse, a day earlier, disinviting him from future events and accusing the gay mayor and former university lecturer of using his positions to leverage sexual or romantic relationships with students, some of whom were made to feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d by the interactions. Morse apologized in an email to the College Democrats, stressing that all of his interactions and relationships with students had been consensual, on the same day he received their allegation. The day after the story of the exchange broke, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he\u2019d previously lectured, announced it\u2019d opened a Title IX investigation. That probe, which was handed over to an attorney from a Boston-based law firm, continues. A campaign that believed it had been gaining ground and momentum ahead of the September 1 primary, appeared \u2013 for a few long days \u2013 to be on the brink of collapse. Many of Morse\u2019s most prominent supporters, from Justice Democrats to the Sunrise Movement and Indivisible, went silent or announced they would pause their efforts until more information became available. Progressive who unseated longtime Democratic congressman says 'people are looking for a fighter right now' One notable exception was the Victory Fund, a group that works to elect LGBTQ candidates and has known Morse since around the time he was first elected mayor as a 22-year-old, which almost immediately reaffirmed its July endorsement. Because the rumors that ultimately filled the College Democrats\u2019 letter had been floating around for months, the group told CNN it had been able to discuss them with Morse before they became public. Satisfied by his denial of any misconduct, the Victory Fund, concerned that the allegations would play into homophobic stereotypes, rushed to his defense, while staying in constant contact with indecisive progressive groups. \u201cFor so long, gay men in particular have been branded as pedophiles and sex deviants and all these things that understandably conjure up negative images that no one wants to be associated with,\u201d said Elliot Imse, the Victory Fund\u2019s communications director. \u201cFor us, it was really important that these political attacks against Alex failed, because if they didn\u2019t, it would only set a precedent to use these types of attacks against LGBTQ candidates in the future.\u201d In the days after the student group\u2019s letter was published, its claims came under greater scrutiny. The Intercept obtained and published messages between students who, before the accusations became public, appeared to be discussing ways to undermine Morse\u2019s candidacy. The site was also first to report that the Massachusetts Democratic Party had been previously alerted to the allegations and referred the organization\u2019s leadership to a prominent Democratic attorney for legal advice. Gus Bickford, the Massachusetts Democratic Party chairman, said in a statement that the party was \u201cmade aware of concerns\u201d regarding Morse, but declined to get directly involved, instead connecting them with a lawyer \u201cwho volunteers as legal counsel to the Party.\u201d That attorney, James Roosevelt Jr., recently told The New York Times he advised the College Democrats to keep their contact with Morse private. Subsequent and repeated efforts by CNN to contact the group and its officials named in the Intercept report were unsuccessful. No students have come forward publicly to allege any wrongdoing against Morse since the initial letter was made public. The party, Bickford added, has since \u201cset up a committee to initiate an independent review of the actions and decisions that led to the release of the letter by the College Democrats of Massachusetts.\u201d Neal\u2019s campaign has denied any connection to the writing or dissemination of the accusations and there is no evidence Neal was aware of, or played any role, in stoking them. The Morse campaign has since said it was made aware, earlier this year, that accusations similar to those in the letter \u2013 which does not mention any names or detail any specific incidents \u2013 were being peddled to national news organizations. And in an interview with CNN, Morse, as he\u2019s done in other public forums, said the timing of its publication led him to believe he was the target of \u201ca coordinated smear campaign.\u201d \u201cThere was no evidence, there was no corroboration, there were no folks to go on record,\u201d Morse said. \u201cThis was essentially a blog post that was then picked up and amplified by media from local to state to national. It was three weeks before this primary election, (on) a week of incredible momentum after Cori Bush beat Representative Clay, after we had our best fundraising day \u2013 the same day we got endorsed by MoveOn and the Working Families Party. It was very clear what that email was when I received it on Thursday morning.\u201d Morse said his apology email, sent the same day he received the letter, was a simple, \u201chuman\u201d response. \u201cI thought it was important to respond to that email and express regret,\u201d Morse said, \u201cif I have made someone feeling uncomfortable unintentionally.\u201d If their most recent debate was any indication, both candidates appear eager to move on from litigating the episode. The College Democrats have said they will cooperate with the party\u2019s probe and, in a statement, condemned any homophobic attacks that followed the publication of the allegations. \u201cI read about it, as everybody else did on a Friday night,\u201d Neal said, when asked about the letter by a debate moderator last Thursday night. \u201cThe students then pointed out in a subsequent press release, that what they did was independent of my campaign and my organization. Here\u2019s the point: we had nothing to do with this. The students should be heard. There\u2019s a process in place.\u201d With the probes underway, but unlikely to return any definitive conclusions before the primary, Morse has plowed ahead with the renewed support of progressive groups and leaders. Justice Democrats and the Sunrise Movement, among others, have all doubled down on their endorsements and Morse has, over the last week, unveiled new slates of local officials who are now backing his campaign. His fundraising totals are growing, beating old records, new volunteers are signing on, and the race appears to be neck-and-neck coming into the final stretch of campaigning. On Tuesday afternoon, Morse got another major boost: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s political action committee, Courage to Change, endorsed his campaign. \u201cWhen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took on her own entrenched incumbent in 2018, she changed public service for the better,\u201d Morse said in a statement, \u201cfurther inspiring me and so many others to fight for our districts and empower those who have long been forgotten. But Morse allies, enthused by the backlash but still bitten by the incident, say the abrupt pause in outside activity following the letter\u2019s publication cost the campaign and its supporters precious days of messaging before the start of early voting. \u201cThe Morse campaign has done a really good job of turning an incredibly difficult situation into a positive for their campaign,\u201d said Lucy Solomon, political director for Indivisible\u2019s independent expenditure group. \u201cBut obviously, a lot of folks on (the independent expenditure) side paused their ads right when the letter came out, to figure out what was really happening here, and so those are missed communications with voters.\u201d Morse\u2019s case to those voters has, from the beginning of a campaign that began last summer, centered on the question of how Neal has wielded his indisputable power on Capitol Hill. Neal has been criticized, and not only by the party\u2019s progressive wing, for not pursuing President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns immediately after taking over the Ways and Means Committee at the start of 2019. His considerable support from corporate PACs \u2013 no Democrat has taken more in the 2020 cycle \u2013 and, in particular, donations from individuals at Blackstone Group, have led Morse to accuse Neal of blocking or stalling reform efforts aimed at issues like surprise medical billing. In debates, Neal has denied that his contributors have any effect on his legislative decisions. \u201cIf you contribute to my campaign you buy into my agenda,\u201d Neal said during an exchange last week. \u201cI\u2019m not buying into yours.\u201d He has also pointed to his record of spreading that money around to other Democratic House candidates, arguing that it helped build the party\u2019s majority in Congress. The left, though, sees Morse\u2019s challenge as an opportunity \u2013 as it did in New York, with Jamaal Bowman\u2019s defeat of Rep. Eliot Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee \u2013 to deliver a double blow to the House Democrats\u2019 moderate, establishment infrastructure. House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney, also of New York, narrowly survived her contest, but if Morse can defeat Neal, progressives will have taken down two committee chairs in one summer. The Ways and Means Committee gavel, should Neal be unseated, would be passed to a new chair next year, with Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, considered the favorite. Jamaal Bowman ousts longtime incumbent Eliot Engel in New York \u201cAlex Morse is not going to become the Ways and Means chair, Jamaal Bowman didn\u2019t become the chair of the House Foreign Affairs committee, but we not only picked up a seat, we fundamentally changed the direction of those committees \u2013 for decades, potentially,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats\u2019 executive director. Doggett, she added, is \u201cnot a Justice Democrat, but he is a lot more progressive and actually believes in something like Medicare for All.\u201d A Morse victory would be a capper on a bittersweet primary season for progressives. Joe Biden\u2019s late surge to the presidential nomination set the movement briefly back on its heels. But subsequent victories for newcomers like Bowman and Bush, and steamrolling performances by members of the \u201csquad\u201d \u2013 including Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated her centrist primary challenger by more than 56 percentage points \u2013  has guaranteed the movement will be in a position to pressure a potential Biden administration. Cardi B wants AOC to run for president. She didn't say no The attention and money lavished on the presidential race, first during the primary and now ahead of the general election, opened up a lane for progressives to assert their influence \u2013 and direct their energy \u2013 toward federal and state legislative races. Morse now has the backing of a coalition of progressive groups, which have rallied around his campaign and helped him compete against one of the best-funded incumbents in the House. \u201cWhen it became obvious that Biden was going to be the nominee, we saw a lot of energy and momentum shift to down-ballot progressive campaigns, and our campaign in particular,\u201d Morse said. \u201cWith a Biden administration, it\u2019s more important now than ever before that we have more progressive members of Congress to hold his administration accountable, to make progress on health care and climate change and expand the progressive caucus.\u201d Indivisible, Solomon told CNN, expects to spend $375,000 on Morse by primary day on television, mail and digital ads. Justice Democrats\u2019 independent expenditure arm is on track to eclipse that, a spokesman said, with a projected $500,000 in spending. The group has also raised over $120,000 for the campaign, with an average contribution of $25. Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive advocacy group, spent $325,000 on television ads criticizing Neal over his Blackstone ties. Neal is also receiving considerable outside support. The Democratic Majority for Israel, which has run ads against progressive candidates all year, has spent more than $100,000 attacking Morse. Another group, American Working Families \u2013 not to be confused with the Working Families Party, which endorsed Morse \u2013 has also now shelled out more than $500,000 opposing the Holyoke mayor. The battle with Morse is Neal\u2019s toughest race in years. In the 2018 primary, he fended off another progressive, Springfield-area lawyer Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, who finished with 30% of the vote \u2013 well off the pace, but enough to put keep Neal and the district on the radar two years later. In a sign of how seriously Neal is taking the challenge this year, his campaign has plowed nearly $800,000 into broadcast advertising alone through Tuesday \u2013 four times what he spent at this point in the 2018 cycle, according to Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. The spots include a biographical ad that describes how Neal lost his both parents before graduating from high school and survived with the care of relatives and Social Security benefits. Another features House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, touting the \u201cover $1 billion\u201d she said Neal has delivered for the district. Candy Glazer, the former chair of the Longmeadow Democratic Town Committee and a Neal supporter, said the progressive wave that has swept longtime Democrats out of office is unlikely to topple Neal. Neal, who served as mayor of Springfield in the 1980s, is well-known and liked in the district, said Glazer, a party stalwart in western Massachusetts. \u201cHe\u2019s still the local guy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a call if someone in your family dies. He\u2019ll be at the wake. It\u2019s still the old grassroots politics.\u201d \u201cIt might be trendy to think that if you have gray hair, that\u2019s a strike against you,\u201d she added. \u201cBut in these uncertain times, the need for leadership and experience is even more important.\u201d Although Neal has served in the US House more than three decades, he represents a sprawling district reshaped after the last US Census. It now encompasses 87 towns, Glazer noted. And it includes all of Berkshire County, which stretches from the Connecticut border north to Vermont. Morse has worked to make inroads into the Berkshires, a mix of bucolic landscapes, storied arts institutions such as the Norman Rockwell Museum and a smattering of former industrial towns. On an afternoon in early August, just hours before the allegations about his personal life became public, he stumped in Pittsfield, the county\u2019s largest city. He denounced the 2014 closure of an in-patient hospital in North Adams, a former mill town in the northwest corner of the state, and shortages of treatment beds to help communities grappling with opioid addiction. Pittsfield holds particularly poignant memories for Morse. His older brother, Doug lived \u2013 and died \u2013 there in February, the final chapter in a long struggle with heroin. When Morse discussed his brother\u2019s death in July ad, accusing the incumbent of \u201cusing his power and seniority to fight for the same drug companies that are fueling this (opioid) crisis,\u201d Neal\u2019s campaign responded by accusing him of using the tragedy as a \u201cpolitical football.\u201d Morse bristled at the suggestion, and during a news conference in Pittsfield, shot back, saying \u201cno one is going to tell me or my father or my brother when we can talk about my brother Doug or invoke my brother Doug\u2019s story.\u201d \u201cThis is personal to us,\u201d Morse said. \u201cAnd it makes it political to us.\u201d CORRECTION: The story has been updated to correct the timing of the Victory Fund\u2019s endorsement of Alex Morse. The fund endorsed Morse in July.",

            "article_content": "With no chance of fulfilling his pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare before Election Day, President Donald Trump is playing up his efforts to lower drug prices. \u201cWith what I am doing in the fight with the Drug Companies, drug prices will be coming down 50, 60, and even 70 per cent. The Democrats are fighting hard to stop me with big ad buys, plus. Likewise, Big Pharma. FAVORED NATIONS AND REBATES ARE BRINGING PRICES DOWN NOW. We will win!,\u201d the President tweeted on Wednesday morning. Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Trump\u2019s measures on favored nations and rebates are bringing prices down now \u2013 mainly because they haven\u2019t gone into effect yet. And whether drug prices will be cut by half or more in the future is hard to predict. High drug prices have long been one of Americans\u2019 chief health care complaints, and Trump has long promised to do something about it. His administration released a 44-page blueprint of his vision in May 2018, though most of the measures remain only on paper. Trump has claimed victory in lowering prices in the past, though the data backing up the assertion was shaky. During his State of the Union address in February, he harkened back to a statistic he had mentioned the year before \u2013 that the cost of prescription medications went down for the first time in 51 years. The President was citing the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs for December 2018. However, the data bounces around a lot. Last month, it was up 1.7%. It\u2019s surprisingly hard to answer whether drug prices are rising and by how much. There are many measures, but few, if any, that capture the full spectrum of medications, which include generic, brand name and specialty drugs, and cover those given in a hospital or doctor\u2019s office and those purchased at the pharmacy. Also, there\u2019s the list price of the prescription drug and the net price, which takes into account various discounts. Here\u2019s one way to look at the issue \u2013 through the lens of brand name drugs, which make up only about 10% of prescriptions written, but 80% of the dollars spent. While list prices for brand name drugs are still on the rise, the rate of growth has been declining for at least the past four years, according to SSR Health, which captures price changes for about 1,000 brand name medications. A similar trend  is happening when one examines the list prices of both brand name and less-expensive generic drugs. GoodRx, which follows several thousand brand name and generic medications, found that manufacturers hiked prices on 857 drugs by an average of 6.8% in the first six months of this year. That compares to 933 medications rising an average of 7% over the same time last year, according to the website, which provides cost comparisons and consumer discounts. The number of drugs and rate of price growth also slowed between 2015 and 2019. In his tweet Wednesday, the President refers to two of four executive orders he issued late last month, which resurfaced a kitchen sink of controversial proposals that have advanced little during his term. The favored nations measure, which has not yet been released by the White House, generally calls for setting Medicare reimbursement levels for certain drugs on their cost in other countries \u2013 an idea that runs counter to Republicans\u2019 allegiance to the free market system. The administration first outlined an International Pricing Index proposal in October 2018. Trump said at the signing that he would hold onto the order until Aug. 24 to give drug makers time to present their ideas for reducing costs. But a planned meeting at the White House in late July never took place, and it remains to be seen what Trump will do with the measure. The second order calls for effectively banning drug makers from providing billions of dollars in rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers, a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies would be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. The administration had to back down from this effort last summer, in part because it would have likely raised Medicare premiums. Industry groups, including those representing drug manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers, have slammed various proposals that are unfavorable to their members. They launched ad campaigns shortly after the executive orders were unveiled. Trump\u2019s signing of the executive orders allowed him to draw attention to drug prices, albeit briefly, even as the nation fights the coronavirus pandemic. While his administration has rolled out many proposals aimed at tackling the problem, it remains to be seen whether any will actually have an impact.",

            "article_content": "Read Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\u2019s remarks, as prepared for delivery Friday before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Peters, and members of the Committee. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for calling this hearing.  I\u2019m proud to be with you today on behalf of the 630,000 dedicated women and men of the United States Postal Service. On June 15th, I became America\u2019s 75th Postmaster General. I did so because I believe the Postal Service plays a tremendously positive role in the lives of the American public and in the life of the nation. I also welcomed the opportunity to lead this organization because I believe there is opportunity for the Postal Service to better serve the American public, and to also operate in a financially sustainable manner. Congress established the Postal Service to fulfill a public service mission to provide prompt, reliable, and universal postal services to the American public \u2013 in an efficient and financially self-sustaining fashion. Our ability to fulfill that mandate in the coming years is at fundamental risk.  Changes must be made to ensure our sustainability for the years and decades ahead. Our business model \u2013 as established by Congress \u2013 requires us to pay our bills through our own efforts.  I view it as my personal obligation to put the organization in a position to fulfill that mandate. With action from Congress and our regulator \u2013 and significant effort by the Postal Service \u2013 we can achieve this goal. This year, the Postal Service will likely report a loss of more than $9 billion.  Without change, our losses will only increase in the years to come. It is vital that Congress enact reform legislation that addresses our unaffordable retirement payments.  Most importantly, Congress must allow the Postal Service to integrate our retiree health benefits program with Medicare, which is a common-sense practice followed by all businesses that still offer retiree health care.  It must also rationalize our pension funding payments. Legislative actions have been discussed and debated for years, but no action has been taken.  I urge the Congress to expeditiously enact these reforms. I also urge Congress to enact legislation that would provide the Postal Service with financial relief to account for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition. The Postal Regulatory Commission began a mandated review of our pricing system 4 years ago.  It has been 3 years since the commission concluded that our current system is not working.  The lack of action is astonishing. We urgently require the PRC to do its job and establish a more rational regulatory system for our mail products. Had Congress and the PRC fulfilled their obligations to the American public concerning the Postal Service, I am certain that much of our $80 billion in cumulative losses since 2007 could have been avoided, and that our operational and financial performance would not now be in such jeopardy. The Postal Service must also do its part.  We must adapt to the realities of our marketplace, generate more revenue and control costs.  I believe we can chart a path for our business that accomplishes these goals. In my 67 days as Postmaster General, I have also had the chance to observe the many hidden strengths of the organization, and to appreciate our critical mission of service to the American public. Despite our deep, longstanding financial problems, there is an incredibly strong base to build upon \u2013 and a tremendous desire of the public for the Postal Service to succeed. As we head into the election season, I want to assure this committee and the American public that the Postal Service is fully capable and committed to delivering the nation\u2019s election mail securely and on-time. This sacred duty is my number one priority between now and election day. Mr. Chairman, the women and men of the Postal Service have demonstrated extraordinary commitment to our mission of service throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In every community in America, we continue to work to keep our employees and customers safe as we fulfil our essential role in delivering medications, benefit checks and financial statements the public depends upon. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a public outpouring of support for postal employees as they performed their essential service throughout the nation.  This is a well-deserved testament to their dedication. Mr. Chairman; Ranking Member Peters; I look forward to working with you and this committee and our stakeholders to restore the financial health of the United States Postal Service and to improve the way we serve the American public. This concludes my remarks.  I welcome any questions that you and the committee may have.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has endorsed Rep. Joe Kennedy in his effort to unseat Sen. Ed Markey in an upcoming Massachusetts Senate Democratic primary. The move puts the California Democrat squarely in the middle of a closely-watched fight and could deliver a boost to Kennedy ahead of the September 1 primary election where he is challenging Markey, who served alongside Pelosi for decades as a member of the House of Representatives. \u201cNever before have the times demanded we elect courageous leaders as today. That is why I\u2019m proud to endorse Joe Kennedy for Senate,\u201d Pelosi said in an endorsement video released by the Kennedy campaign on Thursday. \u201cMassachusetts and America need Joe Kennedy\u2019s courage and leadership in the Senate to fight for the change we need,\u201d Pelosi said. A Kennedy has never lost Massachusetts. But Markey, 74, has countered the shine of the Kennedy name by projecting the power of some of the party\u2019s stars, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who have fundraised for the senator. Progressives, who have spent the last five years on the attack, trying to win seats from moderate incumbents in the House, have put their full weight behind Markey\u2019s campaign, and view the defense of his seat as one of their most important fights of the cycle. Markey supporters say he deserves another six-year term based on his voting record and point to his co-authorship of the Green New Deal and earlier support of \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d pointing to both as signs that he is of the times. Kennedy, meanwhile, has maintained that he would be a different kind of senator, who will travel across the country and the state to elect Democrats, as he did in 2018 to help the party retake the House. A Pelosi aide told CNN that Kennedy did not ask for the endorsement, but that the speaker felt compelled as a result of the congressman\u2019s work during the 2018 election cycle that played a key role in Democrats\u2019 efforts to take back the House. The aide said that Pelosi was also concerned over attacks from the Markey campaign, including on the Kennedy family legacy. Markey says, for example, in a recent ad, \u201cWith all due respect, it\u2019s time to start asking what your country can do for you,\u201d taking on the famous line from President John F. Kennedy in which he said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country.\u201d Massachusetts' Ed Markey tries to defend his seat from a Kennedy Progressives \u2013 including Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 reacted to the news of the endorsement with frustration. Party leadership has been aggressive in seeking to defend its incumbents against primary challengers, but Pelosi\u2019s endorsement, they argued, came in defiance of the spirit of that rule. \u201cNo one gets to complain about primary challenges again,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, punctuating the sentence with a happy emoji, before addressing the House Democratic campaign arm. \u201cWhen can we expect you to reverse your blacklist policy against primary orgs?,\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause between this & lack of care around @IlhanMN\u2019s challenger, it seems like less a policy and more a cherry-picking activity.\u201d The \u201cblacklist\u201d refers to a rule instituted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that prohibits party consultants from working for primary challengers. Those who do risk being banned from receiving contracts with other DCCC-aligned campaigns, a fact other progressives cited in calling out Pelosi\u2019s endorsement Thursday. The policy does not apply to Senate campaigns. \u201cWhen progressives challenge Democrats who vote with Trump 2/3rds of the time, Nancy Pelosi cries foul and works with the (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) to make a blacklist for anyone helping the challenger. But when she likes the challenger, or the challenger has a rich and wealthy family, it\u2019s okay?\u201d Sunrise Movement executive director Varshini Prakash, whose group is one of Markey\u2019s leading supporters, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about protecting incumbents, it\u2019s been about protecting big Democratic donors profiting off the status quo. \u201c Justice Democrats, the group that has drawn Pelosi\u2019s ire for launching and supporting progressive primary campaigns against members of her caucus, accused the Speaker of hypocrisy and \u201cusing her power to undermine the next generation of Democratic voters and the progressive champions we choose to believe in.\u201d \u201cFor two years, Democratic Party leadership has endorsed incumbents over progressive primary challengers claiming it is their policy to always back incumbents \u2013 even when the incumbent was anti-choice and endorsed by the NRA,\u201d Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas said. \u201cBut now, when a sitting US Senator champions the Green New Deal while wildfires blanket Speaker Pelosi\u2019s home state in smoke, she chooses to endorse a challenger.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

William Lacy Clay in a Missouri Democratic primary, said Wednesday morning her victory was evidence of surging progressive enthusiasm across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s time for regular, everyday people to have a voice,\u201d the single mother and former nurse told CNN\u2019s John Berman Wednesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cPeople are looking for a fighter right now, a champion, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve exhibited for years, and the community is ready for that. St. Louis said it\u2019s time.\u201d The US House seat, based in St. Louis, has been held by Clay and his father, former Rep. William Clay Sr., one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, since 1969. Bush, who challenged Clay in 2018 and lost, was the first candidate launched by Justice Democrats, the progressive group dedicated to toppling moderate Democratic congressional incumbents, and her win is the latest in a series of successful progressive primary victories against long-serving, establishment-backed Democrats. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Although she\u2019s a staunch supporter of the movement to \u201cdefund the police\u201d \u2013 a platform that generally calls for reallocating money for police departments to other social services \u2013 she said it\u2019s OK that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden hasn\u2019t backed such measures. \u201cWe cannot live under a Trump administration. So we can disagree on an issue, but that won\u2019t stop me from fighting to have a Democrat in that seat,\u201d Bush said of Biden. Bush also cited her experience suffering from Covid-19 earlier this year \u2013 \u201cI was actually off my feet for two months,\u201d she told Berman \u2013 as a key reason why she supports \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She said President Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments that the coronavirus death toll \u201cis what it is\u201d was \u201cabsolutely reprehensible.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have what we needed, and predominantly black areas, we were lacking,\u201d Bush said of St. Louis, adding that a priority for her will be ensuring that minority communities have access to adequate resources and health care. Bush\u2019s stunning upset was evocative of Jamaal Bowman\u2019s recent triumph over 16-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel in New York, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory against veteran party stalwart Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. Asked by Berman if her victory amounted to a warning shot to her party, Bush suggested that Democrats should \u201cdo some things differently.\u201d \u201cBecause the old ways of doing things, let\u2019s retire that, and let\u2019s start making sure that these districts are taken care of and that \u2026 the goals are being met of regular, everyday people, because we\u2019re the ones who have to walk through and live this out,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they\u2019re seeing it\u2019s not impossible anymore.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump pivoted Friday to a longstanding campaign promise \u2013 to lower drug prices. The President resurfaced a kitchen sink of controversial proposals aimed at reducing Americans\u2019 drug costs, which have advanced little during his term. He signed four executive orders, including ones on importing medications from Canada and basing the cost of drugs in the US on their prices in other countries \u2013 both of which progressive Democrats, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have pushed. The efforts, which largely reaffirm the policies of the administration, are unlikely to have an effect before the November election, if they ever do. Most require rule making by the Department of Health and Human Services and could be challenged in court. Notably, however, Trump strongly advocated allowing Medicare to negotiate prices \u2013 a measure he slammed House Democrats for including in their drug price bill last December. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which established Medicare\u2019s Part D drug plan, banned such negotiation to secure the votes of Republican lawmakers. \u201cUnder our ridiculous system, which has been broken for decades, we aren\u2019t even allowed to negotiate the price of drugs,\u201d Trump said Friday just prior to signing the orders. \u201cCan you imagine? What kind of a system is that? It\u2019s going to end.\u201d But he also said that drug company executives, whom he has been courting to swiftly develop vaccines and treatment for Covid-19 and inking hefty deals to do so, were coming to the White House on Tuesday to present their ideas for reducing costs. Trump said he\u2019ll consider not implementing the order on international pricing if talks with drug manufacturers are successful. The pharmaceutical industry swiftly condemned the measures, pointing to Trump\u2019s State of the Union address earlier this year in which he said he would never let socialism destroy American health care. \u201cYet, in the middle of global pandemic, when nearly 145,000 Americans have lost their lives and millions of others have suffered untold economic hardships, this administration has decided to pursue a radical and dangerous policy to set prices based on the rates paid in countries that he has labeled as socialist, which will harm patients today and into the future,\u201d said Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, a leading industry association. Price setting: The President first outlined an International Pricing Index proposal to set Medicare reimbursement levels for certain drugs on their cost in other countries in October 2018, seeking to bolster Republicans\u2019 standing on health care days before the midterm election. Most other nations pay far less for medications because their governments are involved in determining the prices. The proposal, which runs counter to Republicans\u2019 allegiance to the free market system, immediately ran into major resistance from drug companies. Such blowback has doomed prior administrations\u2019 attempts to control Medicare payments. Drug importation: Another executive order pushes allowing drug importation from Canada, where prices are much lower. The Trump administration took hesitant first steps in this direction last year, proposing to allow states, wholesalers and pharmacies to submit plans on how they would import certain drugs from Canada. It would also allow manufacturers to import lower-cost versions of the drugs they sell in other countries. Several states have passed laws to set up such programs and Florida has submitted a proposal, but they all need approval from the Department of Health and Human Services. This concept, long opposed by Republicans and supported by Democrats, has not been embraced by Food and Drug Administration commissioners or, in the past, by HHS Secretary Alex Azar, who called it a \u201cgimmick\u201d in 2018 but has since changed his tune. Concerns include whether the medications would be safe and whether Canada has enough supply to make a dent in US prices. The Canadian government also has expressed reservations, saying it will protect its domestic supply of medication. Drug rebates: Trump also signed an executive order calling for effectively banning drug makers from providing billions of dollars in rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers \u2013 a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies would be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. The administration had backed down from this controversial effort last summer. The proposed rule was expected to raise Medicare premiums, while only saving money for the 30% of Medicare Part D enrollees who spend a lot on medication, according to the administration\u2019s estimates. It would also have cost the federal government $177 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The order directs the HHS secretary to make sure the action will not increase Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 premiums or federal spending. During his remarks Friday, Trump slammed pharmacy benefit managers, who negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers to insurers in exchange for better coverage terms \u2013 often in the form of lower copays for brand-name drugs. Calling these managers shadowy middlemen, the President accused them of \u201cbilking Medicare patients with these high drug prices, while they pocket gigantic discounts.\u201d The pharmacy benefit managers\u2019 industry group said the rebate rule should not be resurrected and objected to the idea that its members are \u201cpadding their bottom line through rebates.\u201d \u201cReviving a rebate reform proposal now does not address the underlying flaws \u2013 that it will drastically increase Medicare premiums for America\u2019s seniors and most vulnerable,\u201d said JC Scott, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. \u201cMost importantly, the proposal on rebates does nothing to address manufacturers\u2019 list prices for prescription drugs.\u201d Drug makers, who used to be the target of Trump\u2019s pricing ire until the pandemic struck, have supported this measure. Insulin prices: The final order directs Federally Qualified Health Centers, which provide primary care services to underserved communities, to pass along discounts on insulin and EpiPens to their patients. In May, amid softening support among older voters during the pandemic, Trump announced a plan to enable senior citizens to get Medicare prescription plans that cap copays for insulin at $35 for a month\u2019s supply. He said he hoped \u201cthe seniors are going to remember it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As states struggle to contain the coronavirus and President Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers tumble, some Republican donors are scrambling to protect their party\u2019s majority in the Senate as a backstop against Democrats taking the chamber. Two of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest contributors, Las Vegas casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his physician wife Miriam, recently made their largest donation of the 2020 election cycle, giving a combined $25 million last month to the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to retain the GOP\u2019s majority in the chamber. \u201cOur donors are very concerned about the political environment and are focused laser-like on making sure we hold the Senate,\u201d Steven Law, who oversees the Senate Leadership Fund, told CNN this week. Law is a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the super PAC is closely aligned with the Kentucky Republican. Among Republican worries, Law said: A Democratic majority could move to gut the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate to advance Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, statehood for Washington, DC, and other Democratic proposals by a simple majority. Democrat Joe Biden has signaled an openness to ending the 60-vote threshold now needed to pass most legislation in the chamber. \u201cWe see the Senate as the last and ultimate firewall to fend off Democratic left-wing policies that we\u2019ve seen tumbling out of the mouths of candidates,\u201d Law said. Chicago executive and longtime Republican donor William Kunkler does not support Trump\u2019s reelection and believes the President \u201cis too far down at this point\u201d in the polls to win another term. But he said he expects to join forces with Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s political team to hold a virtual fundraiser in September for endangered GOP incumbents in the Senate. Kunkler donated $2,800 to Biden earlier this year but said he wants to guard against Biden \u201cgetting pulled too easily to the left\u201d on issues such as forgiving student loan debt by protecting the Republican majority in the Senate. Dan Eberhart, an oil executive and Trump supporter, meanwhile, said he plans to launch an independent effort in the coming weeks to help first-term Republican Sen. Steve Daines fend off a challenge in Montana from the state\u2019s Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Republicans faced a difficult Senate landscape even before the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 140,000 American lives and cost millions their livelihoods. The GOP is defending 23 states to Democrats\u2019 12. Democrats need to net just four seats to reclaim the majority \u2013 or three if Biden wins the presidency and his vice president breaks ties in an evenly divided chamber. Democrats have seats to protect in states Trump won in 2016: Democratic Sens. Doug Jones in deep-red Alabama and Gary Peters in Michigan. And recent campaign filings show Democratic candidates are awash in campaign money. In six of the races viewed as most likely to change hands by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, a nonpartisan handicapper and CNN contributor \u2013 contests in Iowa, Maine, Montana, Arizona, North Carolina and Colorado \u2013 Democratic Senate challengers collectively eclipsed GOP incumbents in fundraising by $20.9 million between April 1 and June 30. Republicans have grown particularly alarmed by Democrats\u2019 fundraising success with small-dollar donors who have provided a financial lifeline to candidates after the coronavirus halted in-person fundraising. Tim Cameron, a Republican strategist and former chief digital strategist for the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, said the \u201cthreat\u201d to the Senate majority has been communicated clearly to major donors, but individual GOP senators need to invest more heavily in outreach to make their case to online contributors. Other Republican senators not on the ballot in November should follow the model of Democrats, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and deploy their email lists to raise money for other endangered colleagues, he said. \u201cThis is a time for everybody to step up and make sure we\u2019re able to secure these seats,\u201d Cameron said. Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota broadcasting mogul and major Republican donor, has written checks to dozens of Republican candidates and committees this cycle, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cThe Senate needs to stay conservative because I don\u2019t want to have us going off the deep end with taxes and other things,\u201d he said in an interview this week. But Hubbard said he\u2019s as committed to helping Trump win reelection as he is to rescuing the Senate majority. Trump, he said, \u201cyaks when he shouldn\u2019t\u201d but the President deserves a second term. \u201cLook at the jobs. Look at the prosperity,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cEverything had been going just great until the Covid hit. The people in charge should get credit.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans are pushing back against key White House priorities for the next economic recovery package, prompting top administration officials to move behind the scenes to shore up a growing split within the party over its response to a crisis that is dominating this election year. Hot button issues \u2013 including whether to have a payroll tax cut, ramp up funding for coronavirus testing and tie additional money for schools to reopening \u2013 have opened up a divide between Senate Republicans and the Trump administration, complicating efforts to put up a united front by the party amid stiff Democratic opposition. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly good idea personally,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said on Monday, rejecting the call by the White House to tie money for schools to reopening. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to let the school districts and local officials decide what\u2019s best. I just don\u2019t think you can come up with a national federal policy that\u2019s one size fits all. The circumstances are very different.\u201d A growing number of Senate Republicans are also throwing cold water on President Donald Trump\u2019s push for a payroll tax cut as part of the package and White House efforts to deny additional money for testing and tracing. The GOP plan has little chance of becoming law since Democrats are almost certainly going to block it. But it will nevertheless serve as an opening bid by Republicans before bipartisan negotiations over the next stimulus begin in earnest. Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, pushed back on the idea of including a payroll tax cut in the emerging GOP recovery plan, saying on Monday that it\u2019s a \u201cpublic relations problem\u201d and would have little economic impact. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned that a payroll tax cut \u201cdivides our conference,\u201d while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not say whether Republicans will accept a payroll tax cut as he walked off the Senate floor Monday afternoon. Trump tweets image of himself wearing a mask and calls it 'patriotic' \u201cThere are a lot of Republicans who don\u2019t like it, for a lot of different reasons,\u201d Thune said of a payroll tax cut. \u201cOne of which is we don\u2019t think it changes behavior. I mean if you get a $60 increase in your check in the fourth quarter of this year, when you already got all kinds of holiday stuff going on \u2013 the difference between that and getting a check in the mail that you actually like \u2026 I think if you want to get something out of it for the economy (direct payments) make a lot more sense.\u201d On the issue of testing and tracing, GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and others stressed to reporters on Monday that more money for testing is essential in the next stimulus, breaking with the White House posture that more money for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for contact tracing and testing shouldn\u2019t be included in the next round of aid. Collins, who is up for reelection, said, \u201cI certainly want to see money for testing. Testing is essential to the reopening.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows met with GOP senators at the Capitol on Monday, including Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, and Rules Committee chair Roy Blunt of Missouri and will meet again on Tuesday in an effort to sort out differences on funding, particularly regarding testing, ahead of the next stimulus bill. Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, who chairs the powerful appropriations committee, told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how to deliver the best thing in this crisis to our schools, our students.\u201d \u201cSchools was a very big component\u201d of discussions, Mnuchin said, adding, there\u2019s \u201ca lot of money\u201d for that proposal. Leaving the meeting with Mnuchin and Meadows, Alexander said he believes \u201cwe should fund testing as generously as it needs to be funded.\u201d Meadows told reporters the meeting was \u201cextremely productive,\u201d and added that \u201cwe\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll be able to find enough funding to meet the needs across the board.\u201d Lawmakers have a major feat to pull off as they attempt to put together a new stimulus proposal that can make it across the finish line in a deeply divided Congress and in the midst of an election year. Democrats and Republicans are already at odds over competing priorities they want to see the bill focus on with no clear way to reconcile major differences. The pushback from top Republicans to the idea of including a payroll tax cut in the legislation, which Trump has been championing, as well as other White House priorities underscores the extent of divisions that will have to be overcome to pass any legislation, not just between Democrats and Republicans, but within the Republican Party as well. The President has recently said that he would consider not signing the stimulus package if the payroll tax is not included in the package. McConnell has not yet indicated whether the GOP will include a payroll tax cut in the Republican proposal despite Trump\u2019s demands, according to a senator who met with the GOP leader on Monday. McConnell also indicated the GOP has not yet sorted out how to extend jobless benefits to those who are losing $600 a week at week\u2019s end. Tough slog lies ahead on negotiations for next round of pandemic stimulus funding Asked about the possibility of a payroll tax cut, Cornyn told CNN on Monday, \u201cI think it divides our conference because the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are not exactly on solid ground.\u201d \u201cWe need to do something in that space anyway, but cutting the revenues by payroll tax is problematic because eventually you\u2019re going to have to raise it anyway and you\u2019re just exacerbating the already difficult status that both of those trust funds are in,\u201d he said. Grassley also warned about how the public may perceive such a cut, since enacting such a tax break would have an effect on the Social Security trust fund. Grassley said that even though Congress would replenish the fund, people would think Washington is \u201craiding it.\u201d \u201cPeople would think that we\u2019re hurting Social Security funds when we\u2019re really not,\u201d Grassley said, explaining why he thinks it could be a \u201cpublic relations problem.\u201d At the White House on Monday, Trump reiterated his support for a payroll tax cut during a meeting with Republican leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s been proven to be successful,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big savings to the people. It\u2019s a tremendous saving.\u201d McConnell said he plans to follow the White House meeting with a discussion among members at Tuesday\u2019s GOP lunch to \u201csee if we can develop kind of a common approach to this on our side,\u201d after which he\u2019ll begin to reach out to the Democrats, he said. In addition to GOP pushback, Democrats are also opposed to the inclusion of a payroll tax cut. But the President has kept championing the idea, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d when it comes to a stimulus package, \u201cI would consider not signing it if we don\u2019t have a payroll tax cut.\u201d Some Senate Republicans have already balked at the enormous price tags associated with the already-enacted stimulus measures, which total in the trillions of dollars, and are reluctant to spend significant amounts of additional money. A payroll tax cut could end up increasing the deficit, a feature of the policy proposal that could make it less likely to win GOP support. Grassley argued on Monday that a better way to stimulate the economy is through another round of stimulus checks \u2013 rather than passing a law to impose a small cut in American workers\u2019 payroll taxes. \u201cIf the purpose of (a payroll tax cut) or a check is to stimulate the economy and help people in need, I think when a person has a check in his hand \u2026 I think that\u2019s going to do more economic good than if we dribble out $30 every paycheck,\u201d Grassley said in the Capitol. \u201cBecause people are going to notice it and maybe take some action as a result.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s open to both stimulus checks and a payroll tax break, Grassley said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can fit them in the approximate (price tag) \u2026 Let\u2019s say approximately $1 trillion: I don\u2019t think you can fit them both in.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

            "article_content": "Three states host down-ballot contests on Tuesday \u2013 in Maine, Alabama and Texas. The most high-profile race is the primary in Alabama, where former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is trying to reclaim his old Senate seat. But Tuesday\u2019s contests in the other two states could go further in shaping the balance of power in Congress next year. National Democrats have made Texas \u201cground zero\u201d for their 2020 efforts to fortify and try to expand their House majority. Several of those competitive November matchups are already set, but Tuesday will determine the final pairings for a handful of races. Democrats are also eyeing the Senate race and will pick their nominee to take on GOP Sen. John Cornyn. And in Maine, which holds one of this year\u2019s most closely watched Senate races, Democrats will settle on a nominee to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins, while Republicans will pick a candidate to take on a vulnerable House Democrat. Texas and Alabama are holding runoffs for House and Senate primaries that weren\u2019t settled in March, and Maine holds its primaries, but with the added twist of ranked-choice voting, which could delay results. Here\u2019s what to watch on Tuesday: Sessions, who left the Senate to serve in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, is trying to reclaim his old seat, after falling from Trump\u2019s good graces. He\u2019s never lost a race, but now he\u2019s in the fight for his political life, up against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who defeated Republican Roy Moore in a 2017 special election, and is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in 2020 given that he\u2019s running for reelection in a deeply red state. (Moore\u2019s fourth-place finish in the March primary was a relief to national Republicans, who wanted to avoid jeopardizing the seat again.) Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, who is a CNN contributor, rates the general election \u201cLeans Republican.\u201d Sessions was the first senator to endorse then-candidate Trump in 2016, but after recusing himself from the FBI probe into Russia interference in the 2016 election, Sessions became a target of the President, who has continued to lash out at him in the lead up to the runoff. The Club for Growth, another former ally, has also turned on Sessions and is backing Tuberville. On Saturday, Trump urged Alabama voters to cast their ballots for Tuberville, calling his former attorney general in a tweet a \u201cdisaster who will let us all down.\u201d Sessions fired back that his \u201chonor and integrity are far more important than these juvenile insults\u201d and claimed that Tuberville is \u201ctoo cowardly\u201d to debate him. \u201cAs you know, Alabama does not take orders from Washington,\u201d Sessions tweeted. Despite some last-minute traction for their progressive challengers, national Democrats\u2019 Senate picks have had a good track record in primaries so far this year: Amy McGrath in Kentucky, John Hickenlooper in Colorado and Theresa Greenfield in Iowa won their nominations in June, and Cal Cunningham in North Carolina prevailed in March. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed Air Force veteran MJ Hegar in Texas and state House Speaker Sara Gideon in Maine. EMILY\u2019s List is also supporting both women. In Texas, Hegar \u2013 who narrowly lost a House race in 2018 \u2013 and her allies are massively outspending state Sen. Royce West, who has attacked her for voting in the 2016 GOP presidential primary for Carly Fiorina (which Hegar has called a protest vote against Trump). In recent days, Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s campaign has waded into the Democratic primary, running an ad that attacks West as too liberal (potentially helping him with primary voters). Republicans tried similar tactics in North Carolina earlier this year, running ads they thought would boost Cunningham\u2019s opponent, who had less money and national support (it didn\u2019t work). Cornyn will face the winner of Tuesday\u2019s runoff in November. Inside Elections rates the Senate race \u201cLeans Republican.\u201d Maine\u2019s Democratic Senate primary features three people. Voters have the chance to rank all candidates by preference in the state\u2019s ranked-choice voting system, which was used at the federal level in Maine for the first time in 2018. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the last-place finisher is tossed out and votes are then tabulated until two candidates remain and one has the majority. Gideon has the most money and highest profile, while activist Betsy Sweet, who finished third in the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial primary, and lawyer Bre Kidman are trying to run to her left. The nominee will inherit nearly $4 million in crowdfunded donations intended for Collins\u2019 challenger. The Crowdpac fund was started during the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Collins is facing the toughest reelection of her career in a race Inside Elections rates a \u201cToss-up.\u201d Dr. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician and Trump\u2019s one-time nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, is locked in a GOP runoff for an open seat in a district Trump carried by more than 60 points. It\u2019s the kind of district where fealty to Trump is usually the most salient factor in a GOP primary, and Jackson has recently endorsed the right-wing \u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy promoted by Trump. Jackson finished second in the 15-person GOP field in March, far behind cattle industry lobbyist Josh Winegarner, who has the support of outgoing 13th District Rep. Mac Thornberry. Trump backed Jackson ahead of the March primary. Jackson isn\u2019t the only doctor running in Texas on Tuesday. Pritesh Gandhi, an Austin physician who posts frequent videos of himself in personal protective equipment, is one of two Democrats vying for the right to take on GOP Rep. Michael McCaul in the 10th District. He\u2019s facing 2018 nominee Mike Siegel, who came relatively close to unseating McCaul two years ago and finished first in the March primary this year. While Siegel has name recognition from having run before, Gandhi\u2019s profile has likely been raised by the pandemic. He\u2019s appeared on CNN several times to talk about the virus and has made his medical experience a focus of his paid media. 314 Action, which supports candidates with science backgrounds, is backing Gandhi with an ad that says, \u201cHe\u2019s fighting on the frontlines\u201d with images of him in PPE. Siegel, who backs \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d has the endorsement of Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, while Sen. Kamala Harris of California is supporting Gandhi.  Inside Elections rates the general election \u201cLikely Republican.\u201d Texas Republican Pete Sessions lost in 2018 when Democrat Colin Allred unseated him in the 32nd District. But now the 11-term former congressman, who was allegedly caught up in efforts to oust the former US ambassador to Ukraine, is trying to come back to Congress \u2013 just in a different (and much more Republican) seat. Sessions had originally considered running against Allred but when GOP Rep. Bill Flores announced he wasn\u2019t running for reelection, the solidly red 17th District came open, and Sessions jumped in. In Tuesday\u2019s runoff, he\u2019s facing businesswoman Renee Swan, who announced earlier this month around the start of early voting that she and her husband had tested positive for coronavirus and would be quarantining. The general election is a \u201cSolid Republican\u201d race. One of those competitive Texas seats Democrats are targeting is the 22nd District, currently represented by GOP Rep. Pete Olson, who\u2019s retiring. Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls, who finished first in the 15-person GOP primary, is up against Kathaleen Wall, who lost a primary bid for a different district in 2018. Wall has put about $8.3 million of her own money into her 2020 campaign, which is a new record for a self-funding House candidate in the state, according to the Houston Chronicle. The winner will take on Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni in November in a race currently rated \u201cTilts Republican.\u201d Trump-backed candidates in North Carolina and Colorado lost primaries in June. But that didn\u2019t stop the President from weighing in on another Texas GOP primary earlier this month \u2013 on the opposite side of Sen. Ted Cruz, who\u2019d stepped in days earlier. Trump backed Tony Gonzales, as have several House GOP leaders and outgoing Rep. Will Hurd, who hasn\u2019t always been a staunch Trump ally in the House. Cruz backed Raul Reyes, saying in an ad from his leadership PAC, \u201cPresident Trump needs more congressmen like Col. Reyes.\u201d The two Republicans are competing on Tuesday to take on Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, who narrowly lost to Hurd in 2018. Inside Elections rates the race \u201cLeans Democratic.\u201d Two Democratic women \u2013 Kim Olson and Candace Valenzuela \u2013 are vying for the nomination in Texas\u2019 open 24th District (GOP Rep. Kenny Marchant is not running for reelection.) If she won the nomination and were elected to Congress, Valenzuela would be the first Afro Latina in Congress. She has the backing of EMILY\u2019s List, End Citizens United and the political arms of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Asian American Pacific American Caucus. VoteVets is supporting Olson, a retired Air Force colonel who lost a bid for state agriculture commissioner in 2018, but finished first in the congressional primary earlier this year. The winner will take on Republican Beth Van Duyne in November, who\u2019s one of the few Republican women so far who\u2019s won a primary in a seat that\u2019s currently rated in the GOP\u2019s favor. Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a freshman Democrat and Marine veteran, hasn\u2019t hesitated to buck his party in Washington \u2013 including on impeachment. He was the only member of the House to split his vote on the two articles, voting to convict the President of abuse of power but not obstruction of Congress. Golden\u2019s victory in 2018 \u2013 in the nation\u2019s first use of ranked-choice voting for a House race \u2013 wiped out the last New England Republican in the House. But now Republicans want to get this seat back, and three Republicans are competing on Tuesday to take on Golden in Maine\u2019s rural 2nd District, which the President carried by more than 10 points in 2016. Former state Sen. Eric Brakey, who challenged Sen. Angus King in 2018, has the most money in the GOP field. The Club for Growth has backed him over former state Rep. Dale Crafts and Adrienne Bennett, who was the spokeswoman for former Gov. Paul LePage. Whichever Republican emerges from Tuesday\u2019s primary will start at a financial disadvantage compared to Golden \u2013 who had more than $2 million in the bank by the end of the pre-primary reporting period \u2013 but because of the competitiveness of the district, the GOP nominee is likely to benefit from significant outside spending.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary, is the latest sign of some progressives rallying around the former vice president now he\u2019s secured the Democratic nomination. \u201cI supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the primary because they gave me hope. I was inspired by their bold progressive vision. Joe Biden was not my pick, and when they dropped out I was devastated. Maybe you felt the same way, and that is exactly why I wanted to tell you why I am supporting him in this election and why I hope you will too,\u201d Barkan, who speaks through a computer, said in a video on NowThis. \u201cI am endorsing Joe Biden for president because he is everything Trump is not: compassionate, intelligent and committed to the public interest.\u201d \u201cUnder a Biden presidency, our progressive movement will be able to harness our new energy and power in pursuit of justice and equity rather than constantly trying to defend ourselves from the latest atrocity,\u201d added Barkan, a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d supporter. Biden has worked extensively to court progressive voters since securing the Democratic nomination. His campaign and allies recently teamed up with progressive leaders on joint task forces to address climate change, health care, the economy, criminal justice and education. Barkan also heavily promoted Biden\u2019s empathy in his endorsement. \u201cJoe Biden has suffered tremendous loss in his life, but he has turned that loss into purpose and he has used his personal tragedies as bridges to connect with the suffering and humanity of others,\u201d Barkan said. \u201cWe have witnessed the danger of a selfish president. What a relief it will be to live in a country with a compassionate president who understands what it means to be in fellowship with others in the face of difficulty, in the pursuit of happiness.\u201d In an interview with CNN last October, Barkan, a lifelong advocate on economic justice issues, explained how he intends to turn his disease into a legacy of health care advocacy. He was diagnosed in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and overwhelming,\u201d Barkan said, describing how difficult ALS has made even the simplest tasks. \u201cFor me, ALS has been a lesson in exactly how broken our health care system is and why it\u2019s so important to fix it.\u201d During the primary, Barkan conducted interviews with several of the Democratic presidential candidates in his home state of California, but not with Biden, who recently sat for a remote conversation with Barkan from his home in Delaware. During the extended conversation with Biden for NowThis, Barkan and the presumptive Democratic nominee discussed their differences on Medicare for All. Biden does not support it but rather has proposed building on the Affordable Care Act, passed during the Obama administration while he was vice president, and providing a \u201cMedicare-like\u201d option. \u201cThank you for that commitment and that bold agenda,\u201d Barkan said to Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I support Medicare for All.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Biden cut in. Barkan continued, \u201cAnd then I endorsed Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the primary \u2026 but you won the nomination and I respect that, and I am fully committed to beating Donald Trump.\u201d In the emotional conversation, which put Biden\u2019s signature empathy on full display, the two bonded over what they hope their legacies will be and why their children are their motivating factors in the work they do. Barkan asked Biden what he hopes his late son, Beau, would say about him. Biden replied that he would hope Beau would say his father was totally \u201cauthentic.\u201d \u201d \u2018Whatever he says he\u2019ll do, he will try to do. He\u2019ll never mislead you. When he makes a mistake, he\u2019ll tell you he makes a mistake and take responsibility. And even if it\u2019s not popular, he will push things that he feels are a matter of principle related to our values.\u2019 I hope that\u2019s what he would say.\u201d Biden added that at the end of the day, what matters to him is how his kids will remember him. \u201cWill they be proud of me?\u201d he asked. Barkan responded, \u201cThat\u2019s why I do the work that I do \u2013 to make sure that Willow and Carl are proud of me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden lambasted President Donald Trump\u2019s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying Thursday that if Trump gets his way, those who contract coronavirus could lose coverage or face higher premiums. \u201cIf Donald Trump won\u2019t end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him,\u201d the presumptive Democratic 2020 presidential nominee said in a speech in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Biden\u2019s comments come as the Trump administration is expected to file briefs asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act \u2013 including popular provisions that protect individuals with pre-existing conditions. It\u2019s the latest Trump effort to repeal Obamacare after the Republican-controlled Congress failed to do so during his first two years in office. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden linked Trump\u2019s bid to undo Obamacare to the coronavirus pandemic, saying that those who suffer the virus could live caught in a \u201cvise\u201d between Trump\u2019s \u201ctwin legacies.\u201d Those, Biden said, are Trump\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect the American people from the coronavirus, and his heartless crusade to take health care protections away from American families.\u201d \u201cIf Donald Trump has his way, complications from Covid-19 could become a new pre-existing condition. Some survivors will experience lasting health impacts \u2013 like lung scarring and heart damage. And if Donald Trump prevails in court, insurers would be allowed to strip away coverage or jack up premiums \u2013 simply because of their battle with the coronavirus,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president called Trump\u2019s effort \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201ccallous,\u201d and said he believes Trump\u2019s motivation behind the long-term effort to repeal Obamacare is that \u201che can\u2019t abide to let stand one of President Obama\u2019s great achievements.\u201d \u201cMr. President, drop the lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cStop trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Stop taking away people\u2019s health care and their peace of mind.\u201d In a press call pre-butting Biden\u2019s appearance, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh pointed to Trump\u2019s pledges to protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 despite Trump having backed legislation to repeal Obamacare, which put those protections in place, and the Justice Department now arguing in court for the law to be scrapped. Biden broadly criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, pointing to Trump telling supporters at a rally in Oklahoma last week that he\u2019d asked his administration to \u201cslow down\u201d coronavirus tests as confirmed cases increased. \u201cHe actually said it!\u201d Biden said. Biden accused Trump of reacting to the pandemic \u201clike a child who can\u2019t believe this has happened to him. All this whining and self-pity.\u201d \u201cWell, this pandemic didn\u2019t happen to him. It happened to all of us. And his job isn\u2019t to whine about it, his job is to do something about it. To lead,\u201d Biden said. Biden campaigned during the Democratic primary on a pledge to defend the Affordable Care Act and seek to expand on it, in part by by beefing up the premium subsidies offered on the Obamacare exchanges and by creating a government-run public option on the exchanges that would compete with private insurance plans. He opposed pushes from more progressive candidates to scrap private insurance altogether in favor of \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The former vice president on Thursday sought to reassure Americans as the country faces the twin crises of a pandemic and the soaring unemployment it has caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, if you\u2019re struggling, if you\u2019re worried about how you\u2019re going to get through the day, I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone. And we\u2019re going to get through this together,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a health care system. We\u2019re going to build on it. We\u2019re going to build our economy \u2013 our country \u2013 back to better than it was before this God-awful crisis, that I promise you.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

The former vice president\u2019s fresh pivot to health care comes days after Trump publicly said he had asked his administration to \u201cslow the testing down\u201d on Covid-19, since fewer tests mean fewer confirmed cases of coronavirus. The campaign hopes to drive home its message on the Affordable Care Act both nationally and in key battleground states in the coming days, a Biden aide said. An important part of the messaging will also be about pointing out benefits of Obamacare for Black and Brown Americans, the aide added. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The Biden aide said it is \u201cunconscionable\u201d that the Trump administration wants to weaken Obamacare in the middle of a pandemic and when millions are out of work. Biden is planning on meeting with \u201cfamilies who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act\u201d tomorrow in Lancaster, according to a campaign advisory for the event. This meeting comes as the Trump administration is expected to ask the Supreme Court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, and although the case will not be heard until next term, Democrats will be looking to see what the Justice Department will say about pre-existing conditions. On a Biden campaign call with reporters Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California made the case for the Affordable Care Act, disparaging the Trump administration for trying to repeal the health care bill. \u201cAs Vice President Biden and so many others have made it clear, Trump\u2019s deadly move comes at a time when there is still so much work left to do,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cNow is not the time to rip away our best tool to address very real and very deadly health disparities in our communities.\u201d The presumptive Democratic nominee hit the Trump administration for its expected Supreme Court filing on Obamacare at a fundraiser Monday, telling donors, \u201cJust imagine if Trump wasn\u2019t still in court trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The Democratic presidential primary focused intently on the issue of health care as progressives pushed for Medicare for All. Biden opposed Medicare for All throughout the race and proposed a public option instead.

            "article_content": "Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will defeat former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in a Democratic primary election on Tuesday for New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, CNN projects. The district, which includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, is heavily Democratic and considered to be a reliably blue seat. It was formerly held for years by veteran Democrat Joe Crowley, who Ocasio-Cortez defeated in a major upset in the 2018 midterm elections. Ocasio-Cortez, who has in her first term in office become a national progressive icon, had significant advantages in the race, including strong national name recognition, devoted supporters and significant fundraising. She had raised more than $10.5 million, an amount that vastly exceeds the fundraising totals of any of her challengers. In comparison, Caruso-Cabrera had raised more than $2 million, according to the latest data from the Federal Election Commission. The Democratic primary match-up had attracted national media attention, in part, because of the congresswoman\u2019s major national profile. Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in March that \u201cit\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to enter the race\u201d when asked about primary challengers, but added that \u201canyone who poses a challenge gets kind of automatically platformed by Republican and far-right publications and they can fundraise off of it. There are major ideological differences between Ocasio-Cortez and Caruso-Cabrera. 5 things to watch in Tuesday night's Kentucky and New York primary contests The congresswoman is an outspoken advocate for progressive caucuses like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All. In contrast, Caruso-Cabrera describes herself as a centrist and a moderate. She has said \u201cMedicare-for-all is not the answer\u201d during her campaign and dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cdivisive policy.\u201d Caruso-Cabrera argued that Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cM.I.A.\u201d and cares more about building a national profile than her constituents. In an interview with CNN, she said the congresswoman \u201cwants to be a national star,\u201d adding, \u201cI want to be a congresswoman for the people of the Bronx and Queens.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in March in response to accusations she isn\u2019t focused on her district, \u201cReally, it just makes the person sound tone deaf because if you think I\u2019m not around, the person who\u2019s not around is you, because you don\u2019t see us and we\u2019re everywhere. But if they want to go out and say things that are not true and run a Trump-ian style campaign, that\u2019s on them.\u201d The congresswoman and her campaign have portrayed Caruso-Cabrera as a candidate backed by corporate interests and Trump allies, highlighting media reports that financial executives and pro-Trump donors have contributed to Caruso-Cabrera. Ocasio-Cortez has also gone after her primary opponent for having once been a registered Republican and living in a Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan before moving to the district last year. In response, Caruso-Cabrera has argued she is more committed to the district than the congresswoman and has said she is a true Democrat, while calling Ocasio-Cortez a Democratic socialist. Crowded field of challengers hopes to take on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar \u201cI am a real Democrat,\u201d Caruso-Cabrera told CNN, adding that residents of the district \u201cdon\u2019t want revolution.\u201d As she argued the congresswoman is absent from the district, Caruso-Cabrera repeatedly attacked Ocasio-Cortez for staying in Washington for a week after the pandemic hit, despite Congress not being in session. Ocasio-Cortez has pushed back, saying she only did so because she felt unwell. During a virtual debate in June, the congresswoman said she has hosted and attended over 200 events in the district, including 17 town halls, and organized 235,000 constituent check-in calls and delivered over 3,000 bags of groceries to constituents during the pandemic. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Senate candidate Amy McGrath is a former Marine fighter pilot and a fundraising phenomenon. But she enters primary day with an unexpected challenge for the party\u2019s nomination. Long viewed as a shoo-in to progress to a showdown with Republican Senate Majority Mitch McConnell in November, McGrath has increasingly turned her attention to progressive primary rival Charles Booker, a Kentucky state representative gaining momentum \u2013 and national attention \u2013 in the aftermath of the police killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. (Mike Broihier, a retired Marine advocating for universal basic income, is also running for the nomination.) The state hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to the Senate since the reelection of Wendell Ford in 1992. It gave President Donald Trump a 30-point victory in 2016. Neither Democratic candidate would be favored to beat McConnell, the longest-serving Kentucky senator. But McGrath\u2019s supporters believe that she would have a better shot. McGrath has raised over $40 million, an astonishing figure, and commands the support of the Senate Democratic campaign arm, a number of labor unions and others who are drawn to her background as a former fighter pilot who flew in combat for the Marines Corps. They note that her moderate views are more in alignment with Kentucky\u2019s traditional electorate than Booker, who supports the Green New Deal (he often refers to it as the \u201cKentucky New Deal\u201d), universal basic income and \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d McGrath in turn favors a public option and a Medicare buy-in for those over the age of 55, rather than overhauling the US health care system with a single-payer program. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The McGrath campaign has zeroed-in on McConnell, trying to portray him as a Washington swamp monster who cares more about Wall Street and special interests than his own constituents. The McConnell campaign views McGrath as an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d whose campaign will waste millions of Democrats\u2019 dollars. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the message that I have had from the very beginning,\u201d McGrath told CNN last week, \u201cwhich from day one is: we need somebody to take on Sen. Mitch McConnell, who\u2019s just going to do what\u2019s right for Kentucky and for our country.\u201d But Booker, the youngest Black Kentucky lawmaker at 35 years old, comes from one of the state\u2019s poorest zip codes and has argued that his message is uniquely suited to the moment. His role in the protests that followed Taylor\u2019s killing, and McGrath\u2019s absence early on from anti-racism rallies in Kentucky, has contributed to the notion that the primary could be closer than anyone expected even a month ago. Booker\u2019s campaign has attracted a late groundswell of support \u2013 and with it, small dollar donations \u2013 from progressives across the country, including endorsements from figures like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who initially signaled support for McGrath, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Kentucky Sports Radio host Matt Jones, who considered running for Senate, also backed Booker. The candidates are bracing for a long night, if not a long week, to hear the returns. State elections officials sharply limited the number of in-person polling places from just under 3,700 locations in a typical election to 170 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Voting rights activists say the changes could result in hours-long lines and the potential disenfranchisement of Black voters. The commonwealth\u2019s two most populous counties, Jefferson and Fayette, the homes of Louisville and Lexington, will each have just one in-person polling location open on Tuesday. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams has pushed back against concerns about the election by noting the number of ballots cast absentee and during early voting. He has also pointed out that the current rules were part of an agreement with Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Adams\u2019 office said Monday that it had issued over 867,311 mail-in ballots in the primary election, while just over half \u2013 442,919 \u2013 have been returned. Both Booker and McGrath have seized on the voting issues, but the insurgent challenger has been far more public as he blankets the state and constantly makes himself available to media. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. And we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the country, it\u2019s not excusable at all,\u201d Booker told CNN. \u201cWe are better than this. This is not what democracy is all about. It should be easy to have your voice heard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Eric Bradner and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A former television news anchor. A retired New York City police officer and high school civics teacher. An attorney who runs a mediation practice and serves as a volunteer minister. These are just a few of the candidates \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 who have lined up to challenge three of the most high-profile freshman House Democrats: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. It\u2019s not easy to unseat a sitting member of Congress, and the three members of the progressive \u201csquad\u201d have a number of built-in advantages as they run for reelection. All three have unusually high name recognition for freshmen members of Congress and devoted national followings. They have the ability to raise significant amounts of money with Ocasio-Cortez and Omar ranking among the top fundraisers in Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And all three represent heavily Democratic, reliably blue congressional districts. But they have become high-profile targets of criticism during their relatively short time in office so far. All three have faced controversy over outside-the-mainstream political positions, frequently facing attacks from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. On a national level, Republicans have worked to turn their outspoken support for progressive politics into a liability for the Democratic Party. At times, they also have frustrated or even been reubuked by members of their own party. Both Tlaib and Omar have faced criticism, including from Democrats, over statements related to Israel with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of House Democratic leadership once going so far as to publicly call on Omar to apologize for comments they said included \u201canti-Semitic tropes.\u201d \u201cThe fame and notoriety of these members can be a double-edged sword \u2013 it helps their fundraising, but also draws attention and competition,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks to the future after a year of making waves Kondik noted, however, that \u201cincumbents hardly ever lose House primaries,\u201d and the congresswomen don\u2019t appear to have the kind of \u201cobvious liabilities\u201d seen in rare instances where a sitting House member ends up losing a primary such as in the recent case of Republican Rep. Steve King, who lost a primary after losing the support of House Republican leadership over racist comments. Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in March that \u201cit\u2019s everyone\u2019s right to enter the race\u201d when asked about the field of challengers, but pointed out that \u201canyone who poses a challenge gets kind of automatically platformed by Republican and far-right publications and they can fundraise off of it.\u201d In New York\u2019s 14th congressional district, Ocasio-Cortez will defend her seat in a Democratic primary on Tuesday where Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor, has emerged as the most high-profile challenger. In Michigan\u2019s 13th congressional district, Tlaib is facing a re-match in an August 4 Democratic primary against Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones. Jones beat her once before to serve out the remainder of former congressman John Conyers\u2019 term, but lost to Tlaib in the full-term election for the seat. In Minnesota\u2019s 5th congressional district, Omar is facing off against several Democrats, though none with a major national profile, in a primary on August 11. And Trump has been vocally supporting Lacy Johnson, one of the Republican candidates in the GOP primary for the seat. Freshman Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts is the only member of the \u201csquad\u201d who does not face a primary challenge. There are major ideological differences between Ocasio-Cortez and Caruso-Cabrera. The congresswoman is an outspoken advocate for progressive caucuses like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All. In contrast, Caruso-Cabrera describes herself as a centrist and a moderate. She has said \u201cMedicare-for-All is not the answer\u201d during her campaign and dismissed the Green New Deal as \u201cdivisive policy.\u201d Caruso-Cabrera has argued that Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cM.I.A.\u201d and cares more about building a national profile than her constituents.

Ocasio-Cortez has also gone after her primary opponent for having once been a registered Republican and living in a Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan before moving to the district last year. In response, Caruso-Cabrera has argued she is more committed to the district than the congresswoman and has said she is a true Democrat, while calling Ocasio-Cortez a Democratic socialist, a label the congresswoman has embraced. Longtime CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera running against AOC \u201cI am a real Democrat,\u201d Caruso-Cabrera told CNN, adding that residents of the district \u201cdon\u2019t want revolution.\u201d As she argues the congresswoman is absent from the district, Caruso-Cabrera has repeatedly attacked Ocasio-Cortez for staying in Washington for a week after the pandemic hit, despite Congress not being in session. Ocasio-Cortez has pushed back, saying she only did so because she felt unwell. During a virtual debate in June, the congresswoman said she has hosted and attended more than 200 events in the district, including 17 town halls, and organized 235,000 constituent check-in calls and delivered more than 3,000 bags of groceries to constituents during the pandemic. Caruso-Cabrera has so far raised more than $2 million, according to the latest data from the Federal Election Commission. It\u2019s a significant amount of money, but just a drop in the bucket compared to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s fundraising, which stands at more than $10.5 million. Anyone who runs against Ocasio-Cortez is guaranteed to share in the national spotlight given how well known the freshman Democrat has become. \u201cThe congresswoman has a huge national persona, so if you\u2019re in the race against her, you\u2019re probably going to get some TV time,\u201d said John Cummings, a retired New York city police officer and the only Republican candidate who qualified for the ballot in the district. As a result, he will face off against the winner of the Democratic primary in the November general election. The district is heavily Democratic and considered to be a safe blue seat. But Cummings has still raised a substantial amount of money, bringing in more than $2.4 million so far. Cummings, who now teaches high school civics in the Bronx, says he decided to get into the race after his students pushed him to get involved in politics. When he saw Ocasio-Cortez defeat veteran Democrat Joe Crowley in 2018, it gave him hope that maybe he could pull off an upset too. \u201cI think I have a lot more in common with the Joe Crowley voters, the Democrat voters, the more moderate voters, than Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez does and if I can get out and mobilize that part of the voting base, I think I have a shot,\u201d he said. Tlaib and Omar, who made history in 2018 as the first two Muslim women ever to serve in Congress, both face primary challengers of their own. The most serious opponent Tlaib faces in Michigan is Detroit City council President Brenda Jones. In a 2018 special election after the resignation of former congressman John Conyers, Jones won out against Tlaib in a four-candidate Democratic primary and went on to win the seat for the remainder of the term. Tlaib, however, narrowly won out against Jones in a six-candidate Democratic primary held at the same time to determine who would serve out the next full term for the congressional district. Jones lost by fewer than 1,000 votes in the race. \u201cI feel I have a really good chance of actually winning and returning back to my seat to represent the people of the 13th congressional district,\u201d Jones told CNN in an interview. Jones describes herself as a centrist Democrat, saying \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself to be far to the left. I don\u2019t consider myself far to the right.\u201d Jones held the seat for only five weeks, but prominently emphasizes her tenure on Capitol Hill with messages on her campaign website calling on voters to: \u201cReturn Brenda Jones to Congress.\u201d The latest available FEC data shows that Jones had raised roughly $37,000 as of March 3. According to her campaign, the total now stands at over $42,000. Tlaib has raised far more at a total of more than $2 million. \u201cMoney helps in an election, but money doesn\u2019t win an election,\u201d Jones said, arguing that she has deep ties to the district and the community. \u201cThe people of the 13th congressional district know me, they know my work.\u201d Tlaib told CNN in April that her focus is on \u201cprotecting my constituents and my residents\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic when asked for reaction to Jones getting into the race. The congresswoman added that her campaign had been working to deliver aid to the community in the midst of the crisis. \u201cPeople can say whatever they want, but I\u2019m telling my supporters, donors, nationally and everywhere, you can support the work I\u2019m doing by supporting front-line organizations that are providing for many of my neighbors that need the help the most right now,\u201d Tlaib said. Denzel McCampbell, a spokesperson for the campaign, told CNN in a statement that \u201cDuring Rep. Tlaib\u2019s first term, she has remained laser focused on delivering exceptional constituent services, while advocating for bold, transformative legislation that will provide equity, justice, and opportunity to everyone in her district.\u201d \u201cDuring the pandemic, Rep. Tlaib has helped residents obtain PPE and access needed unemployment benefits, and has raised tens of thousands of dollars for local service organizations,\u201d McCampbell said, adding that \u201cRep. Tlaib is rooted in the community and has not stopped working for residents.\u201d In Minnesota, Antone Melton-Meaux, an attorney who runs a mediation practice, is one of the candidates running in a Democratic primary against Omar. In an interview, he said of the congresswoman, \u201cA lot of her views are radical and I think they\u2019re out of line and out of touch with this district.\u201d Melton-Meaux, a first-time candidate for elected office who has raised more than $480,000, said that campaigning during a pandemic, where traditional get out the vote efforts are not possible, has been a challenge, but that his campaign has \u201cengaged with residents on issues that matter most to them, like their health and personal safety in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder.\u201d Omar, meanwhile, has raised more than $3.3 million to support her reelection bid. In 2018, Omar received more votes in total than any new member of Congress and outperformed 428 congressional districts out of 435, according to an analysis from the congresswoman\u2019s campaign team. Omar announced earlier this week that she lost her father during the pandemic after he died from coronavirus complications. Then there are Republican challengers, who represent even more of a long-shot in blue districts, but have nevertheless generated attention and, in some cases, raised significant amounts of money. Trump endorsed Lacy Johnson, a GOP challenger to Omar, in May. The presidential endorsement put a national spotlight on Johnson, who has raised more than $1.1 million in his race. Anton Lazzaro, a spokesman for the campaign, told CNN that the President\u2019s endorsement generated a big bump in fundraising as did Trump\u2019s tweet in June saying that Minnesota needs Johnson \u201cNOW.\u201d In an interview with CNN in February, Johnson acknowledged the uphill battle he faces in the heavily Democratic district. \u201cI do have a realistic chance, but let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s the same type of realistic chance I would have of climbing Mount Everest or stringing a tightrope between the two World Trade Center towers and walking between those. I don\u2019t kid myself about the difficulty of the task that lies before me,\u201d Johnson said, but added, \u201d the fact that it\u2019s difficult and hard, I welcome that.\u201d Some Republican candidates hope their campaigns will boost Republican voter turnout in battleground states during the November general election when President Trump will be on the ballot working to win a second term in office. In Michigan, a state that had been a part of the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cblue wall\u201d in the Midwest, but went for Trump in 2016, Republican Al Lemmo, is hoping that will be the case if he makes it to the general election against Tlaib. \u201cThis is going to be a serious effort to win the district and hopefully take some other Republican candidates across the finish line as well,\u201d Lemmo, who has raised close to $490,000 according the latest FEC data, told CNN, citing both President Trump and John James, a Republican Senate candidate vying to take on Michigan Democratic Senator Gary Peters in the fall. \u201cI expect to play a big part in bringing the President across the finish line in the state of Michigan,\u201d Lemmo said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump keeps taking shots at former President Barack Obama. A lot of them are lies. Trump has long been fixated on his predecessor. Since May 1, as his presidential campaign against former Vice President Joe Biden has heated up, Trump has made at least 12 separate false claims about Obama and his record in office. Trump added a new one Tuesday in a speech about police reform, declaring that Obama and Biden \u201cnever even tried\u201d to fix problems in policing. That\u2019s not even close to true. Here\u2019s the list of 12 separate false claims. 1) Obama didn\u2019t try on police reform Trump touted his own efforts to address policing problems, then said, \u201cPresident Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn\u2019t try is because they had no idea how to do it.\u201d Facts First: Obama and his administration took multiple significant steps to try to improve policing. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cabsolutely wrong,\u201d Samuel Walker, an expert on policing policy and a professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, said Tuesday. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice initiated \u201cpattern-or-practice\u201d investigations into troubled police departments and secured court-enforceable consent decrees or other agreements in which cities including Baltimore, Cleveland, Portland and Miami formally agreed to make changes. In the last month of Obama\u2019s presidency, the Department of Justice reported that \u201csince 2009, the Civil Rights Division has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies and is currently enforcing 19 agreements, including 14 consent decrees and one post-judgment order.\u201d In 2014, after the unrest that followed the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, Obama launched the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which in 2015 put forward dozens of recommendations for improvement. The administration provided grants to some departments that were implementing the recommendations. In 2015, following criticism of the police use of military equipment during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Obama placed new conditions on, though did not stop, the transfer of surplus military supplies to police. He also in 2015 secured federal funding for some police departments to buy body cameras. The same year, he launched an initiative to encourage police officers to make more data publicly available, including data on the use of force. The Trump administration has curtailed the use of pattern-or-practice probes and consent decrees and lifted Obama\u2019s restrictions on the transfer of military equipment. 2) Obama didn\u2019t try on criminal justice reform Trump claimed: \u201cI did Criminal Justice Reform, something Obama & Biden didn\u2019t even try to do - & couldn\u2019t do even if they did try.\u201d Facts First: The Obama administration did try to get a criminal justice reform bill passed; a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate during the 2016 presidential election, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided not to bring it up for a vote. The Obama administration nonetheless took its own reform steps that did not require Republican approval, such as banning the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons, working with state and local governments to reduce pre-trial incarceration and the incarceration of people with mental illnesses, and instructing federal prosecutors to try to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders. 3) Obama didn\u2019t start the effort to end HIV/AIDS Trump claimed that the Obama administration \u201cshould have started\u201d the effort to eradicate HIV/AIDS in the US, but \u201cthey did nothing.\u201d Facts First: The Obama administration spent billions on anti-HIV/AIDS efforts, both domestically and globally. 4) Trump was the one who got Veterans Choice passed Trump claimed that \u201cI got Choice\u201d for veterans after others had tried \u201cfor 50 years\u201d to create this health care program. Facts First: Obama signed the Veterans Choice bill into law in 2014; it was a bipartisan initiative led by Sen. Bernie Sanders and the late Sen. John McCain. In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the Choice program. This is one of Trump\u2019s most-repeated false claims. By our count, he made it 59 times between June 8, 2019 and June 7, 2020 alone. 5) The Obama administration left Trump faulty coronavirus tests Trump claimed that the Obama administration left him \u201cbroken\u201d coronavirus tests. Facts First: The faulty initial test for the coronavirus was created during Trump\u2019s administration, in early 2020, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since this is a new virus that was first identified during Trump\u2019s presidency, tests couldn\u2019t possibly have been inherited as \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cobsolete.\u201d You can read a longer fact check here. 6) The Obama administration didn\u2019t leave Trump any ventilators Trump claimed that his administration \u201cinherited nothing\u201d from the Obama administration in terms of medical supplies \u2013 and that \u201cwhen we started, we didn\u2019t have ventilators.\u201d Facts First: While the exact number of ventilators in the national stockpile at the time of Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 is not known, Richard Branson, a professor at the University of Cincinnati\u2019s medical school and editor of the medical journal Respiratory Care, says thousands of ventilators were purchased for the stockpile during the Obama administration and were not used before Trump took office. In addition, journalists personally saw ventilators in the stockpile when they visited facilities in 2016, as FactCheck.org has noted. While the stockpile did have depleted stocks of some supplies like masks, there were significant stores of other items. 7) The Obama administration left the military with no ammunition Trump claimed that the military had \u201cno ammunition\u201d when he took office. Facts First: This is a significant exaggeration. According to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the Obama presidency and early in the Trump presidency. But the claim that there was \u201cno ammunition\u201d is not true; military leaders did not say, at least publicly, that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general. You can read a full fact check of Trump\u2019s claims about munitions levels here. 8) The Obama administration left NASA dead Trump said \u201cthe space program was over\u201d before he took office and that NASA was dead: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done with NASA is amazing. We\u2019ve brought it back from the dead. It was not essentially functioning, and now it\u2019s one of the great centers in the world.\u201d Facts First: Trump is entitled to criticize Obama\u2019s handling of NASA, but it\u2019s a clear exaggeration to say NASA was \u201cdead\u201d or that the space program was \u201cover.\u201d The launch Trump attended in June, in which NASA astronauts were aboard a private company\u2019s spacecraft, was the product of a commercial crew program created under Obama. \u201cIt is NOT correct that NASA was dead under the Obama administration,\u201d said John Logsdon, the founder of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, where he is a professor emeritus, and a former member of the NASA Advisory Council; \u201cmuch was started, like the commercial crew program.\u201d 9) The Obama administration said manufacturing was gone from the US Trump said: \u201cThe previous administration said, \u2018Manufacturing, we\u2019re not doing that. It\u2019s gone from this country.\u2019 They were wrong.\u201d Facts First: The Obama administration never said it was \u201cnot doing\u201d manufacturing. Trump appeared to be referring to a remark Obama made at a PBS town hall in 2016 \u2013 but he was inaccurately describing what Obama said. Obama scoffed at Trump\u2019s campaign promises to bring back what Obama called \u201cjobs of the past\u201d without providing specifics on how he would do so. Contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated claim, though, Obama didn\u2019t say manufacturing was dead or gone; Obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, \u201cWe actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we\u2019ve had in most of our history.\u201d 10) Obama wiretapped Trump Trump claimed that his 2017 tweets alleging that Obama had wiretapped him in Trump Tower had been proven correct: \u201cRemember how you thought that was such a terrible tweet, right? I was right.\u201d Facts First: Trump was not right. There is still no evidence that Trump was wiretapped, let alone that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump. The Justice Department said in a 2017 court filing that there are no records related to wiretaps like the ones Trump described. Then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress in 2017 that \u201cwe have no information to support those tweets.\u201d Paul Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, was wiretapped before and after the election, CNN has reported, and Manafort had a residence in Trump Tower. But a wiretap of someone living in Trump\u2019s apartment building is not the same as a wiretap of Trump himself. 11) Obamacare ended competition among health insurers Announcing an effort to lower insulin costs for people enrolled in Medicare, Trump said: \u201cIn the past, Obamacare prevented insurance providers from competing to offer lower costs for seniors. There was no competition, there was no anything, and they ran away with what took place, and the seniors were horribly hurt.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that there was no price competition among insurers because of Obamacare. \u201cObamacare actually didn\u2019t affect competition in the market for prescription drug coverage. There were reductions in the number of drug plans available during the Obama administration in an effort to root out needlessly duplicative plan offerings, but seniors have consistently had dozens of plan options over the years,\u201d said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Medicare policy program at the Kaiser Family Foundation. 12) Obama got poor poll results on his handling of H1N1 Trump suggested that his response to the coronavirus has polled better than Obama\u2019s response to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009: \u201cWe are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic\u2026Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn\u2019t have a clue!\u201d Facts First: Contrary to Trump\u2019s strong suggestion here, Obama got higher ratings in polls on his handling of the H1N1 pandemic than Trump has gotten in polls on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. As of May 10, the date of this Trump tweet, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s aggregate of polls found that Trump had a 43.5% approval rating on his handling of the coronavirus. A Gallup poll conducted in April 2009, the month of the first confirmed H1N1 cases in the US, found that 66% approved of how the Obama administration was handling the situation. In a CNN poll conducted in late October and early November 2009, 57% approved of Obama\u2019s handling of the response.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is getting what he wants: The country is opening up come what may, despite alarming indications that the coronavirus pandemic is intensifying its assault. Trump says the virus is now reduced to just the \u201cembers\u201d and \u201cashes\u201d of a spent pandemic as patience for nationwide lock downs fades and states aggressively open up. The facts say the opposite. Another 1,299 Americans died on Tuesday and more than 112,000 people in the US have died from the disease. There are now more than 2 million confirmed cases in the United States. Trump is not marking these deaths, just as he was reluctant to immediately honor the first 100,000 Americans who passed away before that terrible milestone was reached \u2013 barely two weeks ago. And this is well before the feared fall resurgence of Covid-19, in the absence of reliable treatments and with a vaccine still months away. The President has been cajoling for reopenings for weeks, banking on the ebbing patience of a gregarious and industrious people who don\u2019t take well to being told to stay home. He\u2019s been ostentatiously moving around the country without a mask \u2013 even if such behavior by the head of the government sets a poor example and shuns precautions that could keep Americans alive. Trump is not just defying the virus \u2013 he\u2019s poking a stick at officials\u2019 warnings to avoid large gatherings, planning a rally in Oklahoma next week and others in four states where infections are heading up after that. Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who heads the White House coronavirus task force \u2013 on Wednesday tweeted a photo of his visit to crammed-together campaign workers, none of whom were wearing masks or social distancing. He later deleted the tweet. Increasingly, as airlines add flights, schools prepare classes for the fall and Americans balk at the idea that trips to the beach are off, it seems he may have made a shrewd bet \u2013 at least within the narrow political calculus that motivates his actions. More and more people seem willing to live with the disease and its awful cost \u2013 at least those who have not personally experienced its deadly potential \u2013 if it means recapturing a semblance of their normal lives. \u201cAmericans are on the move and they can\u2019t be tied down and they can\u2019t be restrained,\u201d Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said on Wednesday. But such decisions are coming without the honest, unprejudiced advice of a President whose most fundamental duty is to keep Americans safe and who has suppressed the ability of public health officials to speak to the nation from an authoritative White House backdrop. The notion of a prolonged battle against a virus that is the \u201cworst nightmare\u201d of the government\u2019s top infectious disease specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci, doesn\u2019t fit into the President\u2019s electoral plans. That\u2019s one reason why Fauci, and the administration\u2019s other top coronavirus expert, Dr. Deborah Birx, haven\u2019t been seen at a presidential podium in days. The default position of the President and many state governors is now implicitly that the country has stopped trying to halt the disease in its tracks \u2013 but will just have to live with it \u2013 though the apparent position has been reached without public discussion. There\u2019s been no moment when the President has come clean about the costs of opening up with the nation he claims has already \u201cprevailed\u201d over the disease. \u201cWe want the continued blanket lockdown to end for the states. We may have some embers or some ashes, or we may have some flames coming, but we\u2019ll put them out. We\u2019ll stomp them out,\u201d Trump said Friday. June 10 coronavirus news Given an apparently unstoppable opening trend, one prominent expert now expects a further 100,000 people to succumb to the virus by September, amid evidence of a spike in hospitalizations since Memorial Day broke the back of the resolve of many citizens to stick to social distancing. Some states that embraced Trump\u2019s vows to open up the economy have fast-rising infections. While nationally, new cases have plateaued or slightly dipped as worst-hit epicenters such as New York and New Jersey emerge from the storm, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the fight against Covid-19 is still far from its endgame. \u201cI think right now, most Americans are not ready to lock back down, and I completely understand that. Here\u2019s the bottom line, though, which is that \u2013 I understand people are willing to live alongside this virus,\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Wednesday. \u201cIt means that between 800 and 1,000 Americans are going to die every single day. We\u2019re going to get another 100,000 deaths by September. So, that\u2019s a catastrophic cost,\u201d Jha said, offering the kind of factual analysis that\u2019s no longer dispensed from the White House. Since Memorial Day, the traditional start of summer, more than a dozen states, including Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have recorded spikes in hospitalizations, according to data from CNN aggregated from the Covid Tracking Project. Infections are rising in 18 states, according to CNN data. The virus is steady in nine states and down in 21. Two states, Michigan and Massachusetts, are not included in the count for temporary technical reasons to do with how they are processing data. Aggressive openers Texas and Florida have both seen recent increases in infections. Arizona just told its hospitals to activate emergency plans amid an increase of cases. A reckoning over race sparked by the death of George Floyd in a new example of police brutality drove the worst pandemic in 100 years from the headlines for days. But the virus doesn\u2019t respect an epochal moment in a nation\u2019s story \u2013 health experts fear and expect that mass demonstrations only helped the virus spread \u2013 and will show up in hospitalizations and deaths in weeks to come. Already, some members of the Washington, DC, National Guard on duty during marches and protests have tested positive for Covid-19. Andy Slavitt, a former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, pointed to studies showing that stay-at-home orders had likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. \u201cOnce we come back out, if we come back to exactly our old habits, it\u2019s going to spread just as fast,\u201d Slavitt told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Tuesday night. \u201cSo we have to be out and take the kind of precautions that are safe precautions. We can get back to normal life. We can live with this virus. But if you\u2019re in a place with these red areas like Arizona, North Carolina, Arkansas, you should be very, very careful.\u201d President Trump announces plans for rally in Tulsa next week Trump denied the threat from the pandemic until it was too late. He failed to properly invoke wartime powers to equip hospitals with protective equipment for doctors and nurses and failed to set up a comprehensive national testing system, then put it all on the states. Even as the pandemic appears to worsen in North Carolina, he\u2019s castigating its Democratic governor for his reluctance to host the Republican National Convention with a crowd that could turn into a massive viral cloud \u2013 even as sports leagues ready plans for reopening without fans in the seats. Trump will hold a rally in Oklahoma next week, which is far from the worst-hit US state, but did record a spike in the last few days. The President is not alone in wanting life to get back to normal \u2013 even if his instincts are being mainly driven by the imperative to get the economy moving in time for the final straight of his reelection campaign. Americans of all ages and political stripes want their lives back.   The longer the virus stalks the country, the deeper are the economic costs of a shuttered economy and the mental and emotional scars of life truncated. Americans are voting with their feet \u2013 last weekend in Ocean City, Maryland, people flocked the boardwalk and many weren\u2019t wearing masks. Elsewhere, crowded restaurant terraces didn\u2019t exactly appear to represent a good example of social distancing. States are announcing all kinds of openings. Schools are set to open in the fall in Rhode Island and Virginia. Arkansas is moving into Phase 2 of social distancing next week, even though there were 288 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. Elsewhere, zoos and theme parks will be coming back. In many cases authorities are asking residents to observe social distancing, and restaurants and educational establishments to operate at reduced capacity. But opening is happening. \u201cThe state is best served moving together even though we have various regions with a current spike in cases,\u201d Arkansas\u2019 Hutchinson said. Such comments reflect the reality that there is no political incentive really for any politician to talk publicly about the possibility of a return to stay-at-home orders that public health experts may recommend in the best of all possible worlds. But it\u2019s still unclear how the political consequences of a resurgent pandemic clashing with aggressive openings may play out. According to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS, half of Americans say they are not yet comfortable returning to their normal lives. And most \u2013 56% \u2013 disapprove of the way the President is handling the pandemic. Some 73% of Republicans do however feel comfortable going back to normal while only 23% of Democrats feel that way. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is zeroing in on Trump\u2019s denial of the pandemic and his chaotic leadership to drive a broader argument also taking into account his recent inflaming of the Floyd protests to stake a case that the President is simply unfit to lead. Five months from the election, we know one thing for sure: Covid-19 is very much going to be a backdrop as Americans vote in November.",

            "article_content": "In one recent ad from the conservative group FreedomWorks, a somber young woman looks into the camera and talks about Covid-19\u2019s disproportionate toll on the elderly. \u201cIf you are healthy, it\u2019s time to demand, we get back to work,\u201d she says, before encouraging viewers to send a text to urge governors to \u201cliberate\u201d their states. Another commercial, this one from the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action, flashes grim images of older Americans wearing face masks and warned of cuts to Medicare by President Donald Trump. Instead of appearing on either cable or broadcast television, these commercials ran on the streaming service Hulu \u2013 a sign of streaming\u2019s growing importance in the world of politics as more Americans cut the cord on cable subscriptions and independent groups, candidates and political parties seek new ways to reach their target audiences. Overall, political spending is expected to soar in this year\u2019s elections. Advertising tracking firms Kantar/CMAG and Advertising Analytics, estimate spending to hit from $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion. And the coronavirus pandemic and the stay-at-home orders it triggered across the country also appear to have accelerated growth for streaming services. Streaming among viewers in the 25- to 54-year-old age group in March increased 100% over the previous year \u2013 as people sought out entertainment, fitness videos, cooking shows and gaming, according to Nielsen data. \u201cIt\u2019s a sizable piece of the pie, and it continues to get bigger and bigger,\u201d Danielle Butterfield, Priorities\u2019 director of paid media, said of streaming. Priorities and its affiliated groups plan to spend at least $200 million in this election cycle in their push to defeat Trump. And, at any given time, Butterfield said, the group is focusing 20% to 40% of its advertising on streaming services. But the migration by candidates, super PACs and political parties to streaming services has set off alarms for some campaign-finance watchdogs because the advertising isn\u2019t subject to the same disclosure requirements that have governed traditional media for decades. Broadcast television stations, for instance, must maintain publicly available files that detail who paid for ads and their costs, along with information about the time slots and programs on which they appeared. Those laws don\u2019t apply to political advertising via the internet. \u201cThe rules governing our campaigns have not kept pace with our changing modes of communication and changing life, even before the pandemic,\u201d said Daniel Weiner, deputy director of the election reform program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThe landscape is changing really, really fast.\u201d Legislation pending in Congress would extend a slew of disclosure requirements to online advertising. The measure has failed so far to gain much traction in the Senate. The disclosure patchwork came into sharp focus after Russian interests, posing as Americans, ran thousands of ads on social media aimed at spreading disinformation and heightening political tensions in the runup to the 2016 presidential election. In the face of public uproar and potential federal regulation, several social media companies, including Facebook and Google, voluntarily created online libraries of the political advertising that has run on their platforms. Other companies have moved to limit or stop political advertising. Last year, Twitter stopped allowing politicians to run ads on its platform. The music-streaming service Spotify also has suspended political advertising. In interviews, political media buyers pointed to Hulu, which boasts more than 32 million paid US subscribers, and the Roku Channel as targets of growing spending. Officials with Hulu did not respond to interview requests. An official with Roku declined to discuss political advertising. Noah Wall, FreedomWork\u2019s vice president of advocacy, said his group spent $50,000 on its recent digital ads that encouraged reopening states. He said Hulu is a useful tool in the group\u2019s arsenal because it allows ad targeting by gender, age and geography. And because viewers in Hulu\u2019s ad-supported tiers can\u2019t fast-forward through commercials, \u201cyou are able to get guaranteed views.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to make sure your message is delivered,\u201d he said. (Wall notes that the recent FreedomWorks commercials don\u2019t meet the strict definitions of political ads because they don\u2019t call for the election or defeat of candidates.) Some Hulu users have complained about the political ads. \u201cPeople like myself, who are cord cutters and use streaming services to AVOID things like this and have a binge-watching escape platform, don\u2019t deserve to be bombarded with political ads based on what state we live in,\u201d one user wrote on Hulu\u2019s \u201ccommunity\u201d forum seven months ago. \u201cI want the choice to block political ads,\u201d another chimed in earlier this year. It\u2019s hard to determine how much candidates and other political players spend with streaming services. In this election cycle, candidates, political parties and outside groups have reported spending more than $1.4 million directly with Hulu, according to a CNN tally of Federal Election Commission records. But political media buyers say that vastly undercounts the activity because third-party agencies often handle the ad buying, making it impossible to track how much most candidates spend with individual companies. Trump\u2019s campaign, for instance, routes its ad spending through a media-buying company, called American Made Media Consultants. The campaign of former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg took a different approach and managed its advertising spending in-house. In all, Buttigieg spent nearly $400,000 with Hulu and more than $240,000 with Roku before the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, ended his White House bid in early March, federal election records show. Maxwell Nunes, the paid media director for the Buttigieg campaign, said the campaign\u2019s approach to ad-buying mirrored its overall strategy: \u201cGo to as many places and reach as many people as possible.\u201d And advertising on streaming, he said, made sense for Buttigieg. At 38, he was one of the youngest candidates to seek the presidency in 2020. \u201cPete is one of the first cord-cutters to run for President, and that ethos sort of gave it a lot of acceptance and (made it) easy to do,\u201d Nunes said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump announced a plan Tuesday he says will drastically reduce the price of insulin for people on Medicare \u2013 relief he tied directly to his own political prospects, saying he hoped \u201cthe seniors are going to remember it.\u201d The message came amid a coronavirus pandemic that has most directly affected older Americans. Trump\u2019s support among older voters has softened during the outbreak, worrying some of his advisers and leading to renewed efforts at the White House to highlight support for senior citizens. The announcement on Tuesday fit within that. Trump said most senior Medicare recipients will be able to get prescription plans that cap copay costs for insulin, allowing them access to various types of insulins at no more than a copay of $35 for a month\u2019s supply. Trump unveiled details about the new Medicare benefit during a Rose Garden news conference on Tuesday accompanied by the heads of insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, as well as insurance representatives and the American Diabetes Association. \u201cToday I\u2019m proud to announce that we have reached a breakthrough agreement to dramatically slash the out-of-pocket cost of insulin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what\u2019s happened to insulin over the years, right? Through the roof.\u201d Trump also used the announcement to disparage former Vice President Joe Biden, his likely 2020 Democratic opponent, claiming that \u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t do this, that I can tell you.\u201d \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it,\u201d Trump said of the new policy, \u201cbecause Biden is the one that put us into the jam because they didn\u2019t know what they were doing, they were incompetent.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Senior citizens are among the country\u2019s most reliable voters and voted for Trump by a 7-point margin in 2016. But a CNN poll conducted by SSRS earlier this month found 56% of respondents over the age of 65 disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, compared to 42% who approved. That was the lowest approval of any age group except those between 18 and 34. The same poll showed 57% of registered voters over 65 would vote for Biden if the presidential election were held today, versus 42% who said they would vote for Trump. The falloff has concerned some of Trump\u2019s political advisers, and the White House has sought to highlight the President\u2019s efforts to combat the virus in nursing homes and among senior citizens. In his remarks, Trump also thanked Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for having \u201cbrought this to my attention a long time ago.\u201d Verma said during a call with reporters earlier on Tuesday that \u201cthese plans will begin starting in January 2021 in all 50 states, DC and Puerto Rico, and seniors can find a participating plan on our \u2018Medicare plan finder\u2019 during the annual open enrollment period, which begins on October 15.\u201d The new benefit will be offered through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans. \u201cThat results in approximately a 66% or two-thirds reduction in out-of-pocket costs,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said during the call with reporters. The move comes as lawmakers across the US have begun a push to cap the cost of insulin after years of skyrocketing prices. Virginia, Illinois and Colorado have passed bills setting payment caps on the drug, with Tennessee lawmakers considering a similar bill. Insulin costs between $2.28 and $3.42 for drug makers to manufacture, yet many people with diabetes pay hundreds of dollars for the lifesaving drug. CMS noted in a press release on Tuesday that more than 1,750 standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage have applied to offer lower insulin costs through the Part D Senior Savings Model for the year 2021. Verma added during Tuesday\u2019s call that CMS will monitor the results of this approach to lowering insulin costs and, if the model proves successful, will expand it to other high-cost drugs. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with insulin, but depending on the progress of this, we will consider offering this flexibility to manufacturers and plans with other drugs, depending on the results,\u201d Verma said. \u201cWe think that this creates a foundation and a platform to fixing some of the problems that we have in the Part D plan. It\u2019s time for that program to be updated.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alaa Elassar contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump unveiled a crash effort on Friday aimed at developing a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year but said the country would return to normal with or without one. \u201cI just want to make something clear, it\u2019s very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back\u201d Trump said during a midday event in the Rose Garden. \u201cAnd we\u2019re starting a process.\u201d LIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus pandemic in the US The formal announcement of \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d came as researchers around the world scramble to develop a vaccine for the virus that has killed more than 300,000 people globally. Many view an effective vaccine as the only way life can return to normal for people under stay-at-home orders or businesses whose operations have been limited. But Trump made clear Friday he does not share that view, insisting the economy is already rebounding as some states loosen their rules. Even as he projected confidence that a vaccine would be available within months, he downplayed the importance it might have in helping Americans return to normal. \u201cWe think we are going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do, we are going to really be a big step ahead and if we don\u2019t, we are going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it\u2019ll go away at some point, it\u2019ll go away,\u201d Trump said. France piles pressure on Sanofi over coronavirus vaccine plans Trump has pushed states to lift their restrictions and hopes for an economic rebound by November\u2019s general election. But even as he was speaking in the Rose Garden, the effects of the outbreak were evident. Loud horns blared from outside the White House gates where truckers were protesting deflated shipping rates. And behind him, many of Trump\u2019s advisers wore masks, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert who Trump publicly rebuked earlier this week. Trump remained bare-faced, and insisted the loud honking in the background was a show of support for him rather than a protest of poor economic conditions. He framed the US vaccine project as an effort unprecedented since World War II and repeated his goal of developing a vaccine by year\u2019s end \u2013 an ambitious timeline that his newly appointed vaccine czar said was attainable, even as other experts have said 12-18 months is a more realistic projection for when a vaccine might be available. \u201cI believe they are very credible. I also believe they are extremely challenging,\u201d said Moncef Slaoui, the former pharmaceutical executive who Trump tapped to lead the vaccine effort. Trump named Slaoui, the ex-head of GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s vaccines division, to lead the effort alongside four-star Army General Gustave Perna. House to vote on $3 trillion Covid aid package and historic rules change to allow remote voting Perna called the effort to develop a vaccine by the end of the year a \u201cHerculean task\u201d on Friday. Slaoui, who has been a venture capitalist since leaving the pharmaceutical giant in 2017, will act as the chief adviser to the vaccine effort. Perna will serve as the chief operating officer overseeing logistics. Both men supplement the vaccine development efforts already underway by the federal government, including at the National Institutes of Health. While Fauci, a leader at that agency, also attended Friday\u2019s event in the Rose Garden, he did not speak. A top White House adviser during the coronavirus pandemic, Fauci has recently come under fire by some of Trump\u2019s allies for his caution on reopening the country, which he said would have grave consequences if not done carefully. Fauci had not appeared alongside the President at the White House since April 29, when he delivered some good news on promising results of remdesivir clinical trials during a meeting in the Oval Office with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. Fauci, like other health experts, has warned that developing a vaccine could take a year at minimum and potentially much longer. He said during his testimony this week it was unlikely a vaccine would be developed in time for students to return to school in the fall. The White House tapped Slaoui to lead the \u201cWarp Speed\u201d vaccine project after interviewing four candidates, according to a senior administration official.   Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, senior adviser Jared Kushner, adviser Adam Boehler, Dr. Deborah Birx, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist, HHS deputy chief of staff Paul Mango and Fauci all participated in the interview process. The decision to select Slaoui was \u201cunanimous\u201d and apparent to all of the administration panelists during the interview with Slaoui, the senior administration official said. Slaoui met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, the official said, and Trump signed off on his selection after getting the unanimous nod from his team. Slaoui\u2019s primary mission will be to determine which vaccines to bet on as the administration moves to manufacture more than one vaccine before trials are completed. Two of the other candidates were Elias Zerhouni and Mark McClellan, the former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services director under President George W. Bush. Slaoui has held seats on the boards of multiple corporations pursuing a coronavirus vaccine, including Moderna. A person familiar with the matter said Slaoui would vacate his seats upon assuming his role in the vaccine effort. Scientists who are part of the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus vaccine project have identified 14 vaccines to focus on for development, according to a senior administration official. Those involved in the effort expect to have six to eight of the vaccines being tested make it to subsequent rounds of trials, the official said. 5 takeaways from Rick Bright's House hearing Officials hope to have three to four vaccines make it through final testing and be made available, but that depends on how the testing and clinical trials proceed and how successful they are. A senior administration official with expertise in the development of vaccines told CNN that the government could reach hundreds of millions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year by taking a big financial risk. In what is called \u201cat-risk\u201d production, the federal government\u2019s coronavirus vaccine project is expected to begin production of a vaccine later this summer with the hope that the vaccine will be effective. The vaccine project can then begin the process of churning out millions and eventually hundreds of millions of doses. The \u201crisk\u201d is financial, the official said. If the doses don\u2019t work, then that the vaccine is ultimately determined to be ineffective. At that point, this official said, those doses are simply discarded, resulting in a financial loss to the government. But if the vaccine works, then the government has achieved the goal of having those hundreds of millions of doses ready by the end of the year. This official noted this is an extraordinary endeavor on the part of the government because vaccines are rarely developed in this fashion. The cost to the government, this official said, could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But, under the circumstances, that cost in dollars is worth the risk, the official said. The HHS division tasked with vaccine development, BARDA, has seen its leadership in flux after the former director Rick Bright was ousted. Bright filed a formal whistleblower complaint alleging his early warnings about the coronavirus were ignored and that his concerns about promoting an untested therapeutic heralded by the President led to his removal. He testified on Capitol Hill Thursday that 18 months may be an unrealistic goal for developing a vaccine. \u201cThere is a lot of optimism. There is a lot of hope,\u201d Bright said in his testimony. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make a vaccine. There\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done to make a vaccine.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats rode a conversation about health care to sweeping victories in 2018 and are keen to do it again this November. The debate, which helped the party take control of the House two years ago, rests on President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated push to have the courts strike down the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping health care law that provided coverage to millions of Americans. But the coronavirus pandemic has further heightened the urgency, leading Democrats from former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign and top super PACs to argue Trump is looking to cut American\u2019s health care in the middle of a global pandemic. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The Trump campaign claims they are eager for the debate, citing Obamacare as an unpopular law that hurt Democrats during Obama\u2019s presidency. But Republicans who saw up close how health care sunk their hopes two years ago warn how detrimental the debate could be to Trump and Republicans in November. \u201cRepublicans can\u2019t afford to litigate health care for the second election in a row,\u201d said a senior Republican strategist. \u201cWe saw how this turned out in 2018 and we didn\u2019t have a global pandemic and economic depression to go along with it.\u201d The latest example of the Democrats\u2019 strategy came last week when Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, released a digital ad hammering Trump for looking to cut back health care coverage. The ad featured Trump recent saying, \u201cWe want to terminate health care under Obamacare.\u201d \u201cOur lives are on pause. We are worried about our health and Trump is asking the Supreme Court to take away our health care,\u201d a narrator says in the spot. \u201cOne-hundred and thirty-three million Americans could lose coverage in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Trump is putting us at risk.\u201d Biden, too, has started to use the same messaging, hitting Trump for wanting to end Obamacare as coronavirus spreads. \u201cDuring a global pandemic, they\u2019re trying to overturn (Obamacare) and strip millions of American of health insurance,\u201d Biden said this month during a virtual roundtable with African-American leaders in Jacksonville. \u201cThey should drop that lawsuit today. And Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment so every American can access coverage today when they need it most.\u201d For Democrats, the focus on health care is a no-brainer, especially after the party won 41 seats to take back the House by relentlessly focusing on the issue ahead of the 2018 midterms. But operatives like Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Priorities USA, believe that argument takes on even more importance as the coronavirus roils the country and has most Americans solely focused on the health and well-being of their families. \u201cIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, we said we needed to talk about health care and the economy. In our lifetimes we\u2019ve never had something more relevant to health care and the economy than COVID,\u201d Schwerin said. \u201cTrump\u2019s team said recently they want to make Trump the health care president. I don\u2019t think they really thought this one through.\u201d Democrats\u2019 messaging on health care focuses on an upcoming Supreme Court hearing on the future of Obamacare, which pits Democrat-led states like California against the Trump administration and more red-states like Texas. Trump, despite concerns from Attorney General William Barr, has fully backed using the Supreme Court to attempt to fully nullify Obamacare. Trump campaign operatives, citing once dim views of Obamacare, said they believe the Affordable Care Act remains an unpopular policy with many Americans, particularly the Republican Party\u2019s base. Driving Republican turnout is a key part of the Trump campaign victory strategy and they believe health care is among the issues that will motivates their voters. \u201cDemocrats are suffering from amnesia if they thought the Affordable Care Act was the solution to America\u2019s health care problems,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesman Rick Gorka, pointing to lapses in coverage, patients being unable to keep the doctor of their choice and premium increases under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt is a weird argument to make in a pandemic.\u201d The issue for Republicans, though: While it is easy for them to downplay the popular aspects of Obamacare and amplify the problems with the program, they still do not have an alternative plan of their own, meaning Democrats can credibly say the party wants to take away health care from millions of Americans without a tangible replacement. \u201cAmericans aren\u2019t looking for a dramatic overhaul of their health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are looking for reform and improvements to the system that is already in place. That is something Republicans have offered.\u201d Republicans also plan to try to turn health care on Democrats, pointing to support of sweeping Medicare for All programs during the party\u2019s primary as proof that Democrats are too extreme on the issue, despite the fact that Biden never backed those comprehensive changes \u2013 instead favoring an expansion of Obamacare as well as the creation of a public option. \u201cThe conversation on health care is more complicated for them in \u201920 than in \u201818 because of Democrats\u2019 debate about Medicare for All during the primary,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Hunt, who worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee  in 2018, added that, \u201cAll roads (for Democrats) eventually lead to eliminating private health insurance.\u201d Tyler Law, an operative who worked for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2018 cycle, said key voters didn\u2019t buy Republican health care messaging two years ago and they are unlikely to again this year. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 healthcare message in 2018 was so effective because there wasn\u2019t any spin on the ball \u2013 Republicans voted to repeal the ACA and strip protections for preexisting conditions, and then sued to dismantle the law,\u201d Law said. \u201cSame principle applies again in 2020 where Republicans are still suing, and Trump is saying on camera that he wants \u2018to terminate healthcare.\u2019\u201d",

And one of the first big decisions Biden has to make in that race is who he will pick as his vice presidential nominee \u2013 a process that he has signaled is already underway. \u201cYou have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as vice presidential candidates and it takes time,\u201d Biden said last week of the VP vetting process. While the veep pick always matters \u2013 less in terms of the electoral map than for what it says about how the potential president goes about making big decisions \u2013 there\u2019s little question that this choice for Biden is a hugely high-stakes move. Biden will be 78 years old if/when he is sworn in as president in January 2021 \u2013 by far the oldest person who has ever been elected to a first term. To his credit, Biden has been open about his age as a factor in the race and the importance it puts on VP pick. \u201c[O]ne of the ways to deal with age is to build a bench \u2013 to build a bench of younger, really qualified people who haven\u2019t had the exposure that others have had but are fully capable of being the leaders of the next four, eight, 12,16 years to run the country,\u201d Biden said last week at a virtual fundraiser. So, who will Biden pick? We know it will be a woman  \u2013 he pledged that at the last Democratic debate last month \u2013 but which one? Below my rankings of the 10 female politicians most likely to be that pick as of right now. (You can see my initial VP rankings here.) Don\u2019t see your pick? Don\u2019t think your favorite is ranked high enough? Never fear! We do this every two weeks! Stay tuned! 10. Michelle Lujan Grisham: The New Mexico governor isn\u2019t well-known nationally \u2013 despite serving three terms in the House before being elected to her current job in 2018. She\u2019s on the list because she\u2019s one of the highest-ranking Latina elected officials in the country \u2013 and she represents an area of the country (the Southwest) that is growing like crazy. (Previous ranking: 10) 9. Stacey Abrams: If political Twitter picked the VP nominee, Abrams, who nearly won the Georgia governorship in 2018, would be the overwhelming No. 1 choice. Her 2018 race made her a star and her work on voting rights issues since then has kept her in the national spotlight. The biggest problem for Abrams? Experience. The highest office she has ever held is the state House. And Biden has repeatedly said that experience matters a huge amount to him; \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to turn and say to your vice president, \u2018This is your responsibility.\u2019 Because the job is too big anymore for any one man or woman,\u201d said the former VP last August. (Previous ranking: 7) 8. Val Demings: The Florida House member barely missed my original Top 10 but the more I thought about her, the more I thought Demings deserved a spot on the list. Here\u2019s why: Prior to coming to Congress, Demings was the first female police chief in Orlando, Florida. In her relatively brief time in the House \u2013 she was first elected to the 10th District in 2016 \u2013 she has rapidly become a rising star. Demings was one of seven House Democrats chosen by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) to serve as managers during the Senate impeachment trial of Trump. (Previous ranking: Unranked) 7. Tammy Baldwin: If you believe that Wisconsin is the Midwestern state that Trump must win in order to claim a second term, well then picking a popular senator from the state makes a lot of sense for Biden. (Baldwin won reelection with 55% in 2018.) Plus, Baldwin would be a historic pick: The first gay vice presidential nominee for either major party. (Previous ranking: 8) 6. Tammy Duckworth: Duckworth is my dark horse candidate to make Biden\u2019s eventual final three. Why? She\u2019s from the Midwest (Illinois). She would be an historic pick as the first Asian American to appear on a national ticket for a major party. And her personal story \u2013 the Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting during the Iraq war was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and Duckworth lost both legs and the full use of her right arm in the incident \u2013 is incredible. (Previous ranking: 6) 5. Elizabeth Warren: The Massachusetts senator drops two spots this week because she doesn\u2019t fit two of Biden\u2019s stated criteria for his second-in-command. One, at 70, Warren is younger than Biden but not exactly of a different generation. Second, Biden said in New Hampshire last month that he wanted a VP with \u201csome correlation between their views and mine,\u201d specifically mentioning support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d as a non-starter. While Warren waffled somewhat in her support for Medicare for All, she was definitely a vocal supporter of a government-run program for much of her presidential bid. (Previous ranking: 3) 4. Catherine Cortez Masto: The Nevada senator isn\u2019t getting nearly as much buzz as some of the three people ranked above her on this list, but that may wind up being a good thing since early buzz isn\u2019t always an indicator of future success. (Remember vice presidential nominee Juli\u00e1n Castro in 2016?) And Cortez Masto has a very powerful advocate in former Senate Majority Leader (and Biden longtime colleague) Harry Reid. According to Mediaite, Reid recently told Biden that Cortez Masto is his pick for VP and Biden responded that she was in his top three. (Previous ranking: 5) 3. Amy Klobuchar: Klobuchar has been in the news a lot of late \u2013 for reasons she\u2019d rather not be: Her husband was diagnosed with coronavirus. Thankfully he returned home from the hospital late last month and the Minnesota senator has spoken about her husband\u2019s battle the virus. Depending on how dominant coronavirus is an issue in November, that sort of personal experience might matter to voters (and hence to Biden). Klobuchar also still has her Midwestern roots, record of winning easily in a swing-ish state and centrist politics working in her favor. (Previous ranking: 2) 2. Gretchen Whitmer: It was lost on absolutely no one that the Michigan governor was one of the first guests on Biden\u2019s new podcast \u2013 and that on it he praised her as an \u201coutstanding governor\u201d and \u201cone of the most talented people in the country in my view.\u201d Whitmer\u2019s pragmatic politics are a nice fit with Biden\u2019s and her age \u2013 she\u2019s 48 \u2013 would make a clear generational bridge for Biden. Plus, Whitmer\u2019s profile has soared of late as she battles coronavirus in her state, and attacks from Trump on the job she is doing. (Previous ranking: 4) 1. Kamala Harris: At a virtual fundraiser Wednesday, Biden praised the California senator for running a \u201chelluva race\u201d for president and adding: \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have you be a part of this partnership going forward. Working together, we can make a great deal of progress. \u2026 I\u2019m coming for you, kid.\u201d Eyebrows raised! Harris checks all the boxes for Biden \u2013 an African American and Indian American woman from a huge Democratic (and donor) state who proved herself to be an able debater during her own run for president.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday, clearing Joe Biden\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination and a showdown with President Donald Trump in November. Sanders first made the announcement in a call with his staff, his campaign said. \u201cI wish I could give you better news, but I think you know the truth, and that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible,\u201d Sanders said in a livestream after the call. \u201cSo while we are winning the ideological battle and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country, I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful. And so today I am announcing the suspension of my campaign.\u201d Sanders\u2019 exit caps a stunning reversal of fortune following a strong performance in the first three states that voted in February. The nomination appeared his for the taking until, on the last day of February, Biden surged to a blowout victory in South Carolina that set off a consolidation of moderate voters around the former vice president. The contest ends now as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, which halted in-person campaigning for both Sanders and Biden and has led many states to delay their primary elections. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Sanders said he did not make the decision lightly, describing it as a \u201cvery difficult and painful decision.\u201d \u201cOver the past few weeks Jane and I, in consultation with top staff, and many of our prominent supporters, have made an honest assessment of the prospects for victory. If I believed we had a feasible path to the nomination, I would certainly continue the campaign. But it\u2019s just not there,\u201d he said. Sanders\u2019 departure from the race is a sharp blow to progressives, who rose up during and after the 2016 campaign and commanded the Democratic Party\u2019s Trump era debates over issues like health care, climate change and the effects of growing economic inequality. \u201cFew would deny that over the course of the past five years, our movement has won the ideological struggle,\u201d Sanders said on Wednesday. \u201cIt was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. Today, they are mainstream ideas. Many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country.\u201d But even as his policies grew more popular over the years and into the primary season, the Vermont senator struggled to broaden his own support and galvanize a winning coalition. Now, as he did after leaving the 2016 primary, Sanders will seek to influence the presumptive nominee through the means he knows best \u2013 from the outside-in. In photos: Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders Biden has already made gestures toward Sanders\u2019 populist base, which formed a movement over the past five years that could be critical to defeating Trump in the fall. Whether the former vice president will take the necessary steps to win over the holdouts, and the extent to which Sanders goes to make the case, will be a running subplot until Election Day. Sanders\u2019 decision to remain on the primary ballot in order to amass \u201cas many delegates as possible\u201d as part of an effort, he said, \u201cto exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions\u201d at this summer\u2019s convention underscores the depth of the divisions both he and Biden still have to bridge. Sanders and Biden spoke Wednesday morning, with the Vermont senator telling the former vice president about his decision to end his presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the call. In a statement after Sanders\u2019 announcement, Biden called the senator a \u201cpowerful voice for a fairer and more just America\u201d and said his campaign\u2019s impact on the election is far from over. He also made an explicit call for Sanders\u2019 supporters to join him. \u201cAnd to (Sanders\u2019) supporters I make the same commitment: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You\u2019re needed,\u201d Biden said.\u201d Sanders also acknowledged on Wednesday that some of his supporters would be disappointed by his exit. \u201cI know that there may be some in our movement who disagree with this decision, who would like us to fight on until the last ballot cast at the Democratic convention. I understand that position,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as I see the crisis gripping the nation, exacerbated by a President unwilling or unable to provide any kind of credible leadership, and the work that needs to be done to protect people in this most desperate hour, I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win, and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour.\u201d The pivot from four- and five-event days came abruptly last month as Americans attempted to combat the coronavirus by staying, sometimes on state and local leaders\u2019 order, inside their homes. The Sanders campaign held its final live public event on March 9, transitioning from packed, raucous rallies to an entirely digital operation. He communicated almost exclusively through virtual town halls and livestreams focused on the coronavirus crisis \u2013 and how his progressive agenda, headlined by \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d might have prevented it or helped cushion the blow. It was a point he returned to on Wednesday morning. \u201cThis current, horrific crisis we are now in has exposed for all to see how absurd our current, employer-based health insurance system is,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe current economic downturn we are experiencing has not only led to a massive loss of jobs but has also resulted in millions of Americans losing their health insurance.\u201d Even in the end, the message remained the same. For Sanders\u2019 supporters, though, the context was jarring. Less than two months ago, the Vermont senator appeared poised to run away with the nomination after a strong performance in Iowa and victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, the latter by more than 25 percentage points, on the strength of his popularity with Latino voters, which had been courted relentlessly by his campaign. But Sanders\u2019 momentum was dashed in South Carolina. Biden routed the field and then cleared it. The anti-Sanders vote rallied around him and, even with Sanders\u2019 win in California, put Biden in the driver\u2019s seat on Super Tuesday. The wind at his back, the former vice president duplicated the feat a week later, delivering the hammer blow in Michigan, a state Sanders won in 2016 and viewed as crucial to his prospects in 2020. A day earlier, public safety measures in response to the coronavirus effectively ended the campaign roadshow. Sanders would return to Vermont, where he has spent most of his time since, while Biden set up headquarters at home in Delaware. The Sanders fundraising machine, the most successful grassroots donor effort in American political history, was over the last month re-purposed into a feeder for public health groups. Sanders entered the race in February 2019 as an early frontrunner. In an email announcing his second run for the presidency, he asked voters to \u201cjoin me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country.\u201d He would quickly hit and surpass that goal and raise, throughout the campaign, more money from small dollar donors than any candidate in American political history. His status atop the early polls, before Biden got in the contest and claimed the lead, underscored the power Sanders had built up since beginning his first presidential campaign as a little-known lawmaker from Vermont who freely called himself a democratic socialist. By the end of the 2016 race, Sanders emerged as one of the most influential figures in Democratic politics.  His policy agenda \u2013 a suite of progressive proposals including Medicare for All, tuition free public college and the Green New Deal \u2013 set the terms of debate among the 2020 candidates. Despite entering with a head start on the field, Sanders\u2019 second campaign encountered some early headwinds as Democratic voters sampled a diverse array of candidates, many of them offering pieces of the progressive vision that Sanders popularized. By the late summer, Sanders appeared to be falling behind fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, his Senate colleague from Massachusetts. Joe Biden is the only Democrat left running for president. These are the others who were once in the race. A campaign on its heels would be knocked to the pavement in early October, when Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. But what many supporters and staff feared would be the end turned out to be a springboard. Sanders recovered quickly and, before leaving Las Vegas, received a call from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The young, progressive star, who had been intensely courted by Warren, told Sanders she was endorsing him. Her early events for Sanders in Iowa were electric, but as the primary heated up, her appearances become fewer and further in between \u2013 an early sign of the tactical tensions that would face the left in the coming months. Still, for a campaign that had scuffled through the summer and into the fall, it felt \u2013 at least for that moment in mid-October moment \u2013 as if a switch had been flipped. Sanders returned to the trail only a couple weeks after falling ill and, after turning in a sterling debate performance in Ohio on October 15, began to climb in the polls. Days later, in a packed riverside park in Queens, New York, after being introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and taking the stage to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d Sanders addressed one of his largest and most diverse audiences of the campaign. \u201cTake a look around you and find someone you don\u2019t know. Maybe somebody that doesn\u2019t look kinda like you, maybe somebody who might be of a different religion than you, maybe they come from a different country,\u201d he said. Aides who had driven and flown in from around the country looked on, rapt like his supporters, some of them watching from across the streets after the park hit its capacity. \u201cMy question now to you is are you willing to fight for that person, who you don\u2019t even know,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cas much as you\u2019re willing to fight for yourself?\u201d The question \u2013 and the call \u2013 would be a centerpiece of his campaign in the weeks and months that followed. Ocasio-Cortez, who looked on as he said those words, tweeted in praise of Sanders after the decision was made public. \u201cThank you Bernie - for doing your best to fight for all of us, from the beginning, for your entire life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you for fighting hard, lonely fights in true devotion to a people\u2019s movement in the United States. Thank you for your leadership, mentorship, and example. We love you.\u201d As Biden, in the aftermath of South Carolina, lined up support and endorsements from moderates across the board, Sanders was unable to do the same with the progressive wing of the party. Warren, buoyed by the late-arriving support of a super PAC, stayed in the race through Super Tuesday. She dropped out the following Thursday, but despite being so closely aligned with Sanders on policy, chose to stay on the sidelines instead of putting her support behind his struggling campaign. Though some Sanders\u2019 supporters lashed out at Warren for not immediately backing him, the writing had been on the wall. The pair had been close, as political figures go, though they took fundamentally different views of how to win and exert power. But the controversy over whether Sanders told Warren in late 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency \u2013 which she confirmed and he denied \u2013 cut off meaningful communications between the campaigns. In the end, and as many on both sides acknowledged privately at the time, it was already too late. Warren on Wednesday tweeted in praise of Sanders and the impact of his two presidential campaigns. \u201cYour fight for progressive ideas moved the conversation and charted a path for candidates and activists that will change the course of our country and party,\u201d she wrote. After losing five of the six contests on March 10, including Michigan, and all three primaries on March 17, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir signaled the beginning of the end. Sanders, he said in a statement, \u201cis going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,\u201d but that \u201cin the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d Sanders batted away questions about the future of his campaign through the latter half of March, as his campaign \u2013 with the exception of a handful of combative surrogates and staff who continued to batter Biden \u2013 largely retrained its focus on the coronavirus. Asked about his plans during a recent visit to Capitol Hill, Sanders bristled, telling CNN,  \u201cI\u2019m dealing with a f**king global crisis.\u201d By then, his livestream conversations and other campaign-adjacent online events rarely made mention of the primary or Biden. As Sanders started to make more television appearances after leaving Washington, he became increasingly frank about his chances of winning the nomination. \u201cThere is a path, it is admittedly a narrow path,\u201d Sanders told \u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers last week. But those acknowledgments were mixed in with public arguments for staying in the race \u2013 and other remarks, more difficult to discern, that offered some insight into Sanders\u2019 own indecision. \u201cI mean, right now, under normal times, I wouldn\u2019t be talking to you from my home\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper in an interview on Friday. \u201cSo yes, the calculus has absolutely changed. And you know, we\u2019re talking to a lot of people, and trying to figure out the best way forward.\u201d Toward the end, the questions often appeared to shape the answers. After being pressed by Whoopi Goldberg on \u201cThe View\u201d last week over his reasons for remaining in the race, Sanders sounded like he was settling in for a longer haul. \u201cLast I heard, people in a democracy have a right to vote,\u201d he said, \u201cand they have a right to vote for the agenda that they think can work for America.\u201d But in his livestream events, conducted with top aides, advisers and friends, Sanders was more expansive. The pandemic, he argued, had pulled the tide out and revealed in the starkest ways possible the ugliest inequities in American life. \u201cI think it is not inappropriate to be trying to ask ourselves, how did we get to where we are today, and maybe where we want to go when all this is behind us,\u201d Sanders said on April 4. \u201cAnd I think some of the questions that we have to ask ourselves, and you have heard me say this a million times, is how does it happen that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right?\u201d He spoke with former President Barack Obama in the last few weeks as he determined the future of his campaign, a source familiar with the conversation tells CNN. Obama, throughout the 2020 Democratic primary, had regular conversations with candidates, including before, during and after their respective bids. \u201cHis private counsel consistently emphasized staying focused on the ultimate goal: Winning the White House in November,\u201d the source familiar with Obama\u2019s calls tells CNN. \u201cHe was impressed by the caliber of our candidates and the strong campaigns they waged \u2013 but always urged them to keep in mind that we must be well-positioned to unify as a Party once we have a nominee.\u201d Five years after Sanders launched a message campaign with the hope of rejuvenating progressive grassroots and keep Hillary Clinton accountable to the Democratic Party\u2019s left flank, and after that bid touched off a movement that has spawned a new generation of leftist leaders, Sanders by the end of his 2020 race had, in many ways, returned to his own beginnings. Whether Sanders\u2019 decision to the leave the contest now, rather than carrying on as he did in 2016 through the end of the primary calendar, will earn him some goodwill with the party establishment he fought so long and hard to upend, is an open question. An earlier departure won\u2019t blot out the ideological divisions that have roiled the party since 2016. But the more immediate question facing Sanders, following his departure, and his supporters is whether and to what extent they will lend their support \u2013 and organizing energy \u2013 to Biden\u2019s campaign. Sanders has been insistent that he would support the eventual nominee, no matter who it was. But his political base \u2013 especially the young, who voted for him by overwhelming margins, and disaffected \u2013 will be more difficult to bring along, no matter how many miles Sanders covers on Biden\u2019s behalf. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan, Jeff Zeleny, Sarah Mucha and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden appeared in his first major interview Tuesday in the two weeks his campaign has been sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic. But in major cities across the United States, no one saw him. Local news networks in New York City, Washington and elsewhere had broken into \u201cThe View\u201d for live coverage of governors\u2019 and mayors\u2019 daily press briefing on the crisis. As the former vice president begins a media blitz aimed at forcing himself into the national conversation, the episode demonstrated how hard it has been for Biden to break through amid the focus on the actions of the federal, state and local governments. It\u2019s an irony of the moment Biden is in: Over five decades in the Senate and as vice president, Biden had an official role in every major crisis the nation faced. Now, on the verge of clinching the Democratic presidential nomination, he\u2019s on the sidelines \u2013 stuck at home with no votes to cast or decisions to make. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Instead, Biden is offering shadow briefings, critiquing Trump\u2019s handling of health and economic matters and detailing what he\u2019d do differently. Biden told hosts of \u201cThe View\u201d that he plans to do interviews regularly from a new studio set up in a recreation room at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. Later Tuesday, he was interviewed by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He chided Trump for suggesting earlier in the day that Americans could return to work by Easter, April 12, and said Trump should use the Defense Production Act to force companies to produce needed supplies like masks and respirators. \u201cHe says he\u2019s a war-time president \u2013 well God, act like one. Move. Fast,\u201d Biden said. Biden also appeared on MSNBC Tuesday, and his campaign scheduled a press briefing for Wednesday. On Monday, Biden made an on-camera public appearance for the first time in nearly a week with a speech focused on the coronavirus response. The speech showed Biden\u2019s team is still working out how to manage its new reality as it grappled with technical miscues. By Tuesday\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d those had been smoothed out. In his speech, he praised New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Cuomo, meanwhile, was midway through his own briefing \u2013 which cable news networks were airing live, ignoring Biden. It was another illustration of Biden\u2019s struggle to break through in an environment in which most media and public focus is on concrete steps being taken in response to the crisis. Aides have said they are looking for new channels for Biden and his campaign to communicate with the public. Rob Flaherty, Biden\u2019s digital director, said among the options being considered are podcasts and long-form videos. Ron Klain, a top Biden adviser who led former President Barack Obama\u2019s Ebola response, did a whiteboard explanation of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response and Biden\u2019s plan that has been viewed 4.3 million times on Twitter, nearly 400,000 times on Instagram and 235,000 times on Facebook. Biden said Tuesday he is beginning his days with back-to-back 90-minute briefings \u2013 one from a team of health experts his campaign assembled; another on the economic fallout of the pandemic. The changes coronavirus has forced Biden to make extend beyond the campaign trail. He said on CNN that everyone who enters his house \u2013 including the Secret Service \u2013 has to wear a mask and gloves. His grandchildren, who live a mile away, visit daily, but Biden and his wife Jill sit on their back porch while his grandchildren sit in the backyard, Biden said. He said he hasn\u2019t experienced any symptoms or been tested for coronavirus, but is following the recommendations of health experts. Adding to the awkwardness of the political moment is that Biden \u2013 while dominant in recent primaries \u2013 hasn\u2019t yet cemented the Democratic presidential nomination, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders remains in the race. With states pushing their primaries back to June, it could take that long for Biden to accumulate the 1,991 delegates necessary to become the nominee. CNN\u2019s estimates show Biden at 1,139 delegates to date \u2013 a 316-delegate lead over Sanders\u2019 823, but not enough to end the race with 42% of delegates yet to be awarded in states that haven\u2019t yet voted. Biden on Tuesday wouldn\u2019t pressure Sanders to drop out, saying that their staffs have had \u201cdiscussions.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s up to Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, I was asked this question about every other person that had been in the race. It\u2019s not for me to tell them to drop out.\u201d Meanwhile, Sanders\u2019 campaign appears set to drift on for the foreseeable future despite the absence of any clear path to the nomination. He has remained active and engaged with supporters through his robust social media channels, but he has largely gone missing from the national political stage, which has shifted to the states at the front lines of the crisis. Sanders returned to Capitol Hill this week, but spent the period before at home in Burlington, Vermont, where he livestreamed a \u201cfireside chat,\u201d joined in-person by  campaign manager Faiz Shakir. Since then, he\u2019s hosted digital roundtables focused on the coronavirus response, tying its shortcomings into his calls for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and debt forgiveness, with progressive allies like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He also held an online rally. On Saturday, the campaign announced that it had raised more than $2 million over two days for five charities on the front lines of the crisis. Sanders has also hired staffers for New York\u2019s late April primary. But Sanders\u2019 absence from Washington over the weekend raised eyebrows, especially when he became the only senator not under quarantine to miss a procedural vote on the still-unresolved congressional stimulus package. \u201cHis absence was effectively a no vote, so he was engaging on policy remotely,\u201d said Keane Bhatt, Sanders\u2019 communication director in the Senate. Sanders acknowledge that the campaign was in a \u201cbizarre moment\u201d during an interview with MSNBC on Monday night. \u201cWhat we are doing is transitioning our campaign to a virtual campaign. We had a wonderful town meeting last night with several of the leading members of Congress, which I thought was very productive, had a large viewing audience,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo we\u2019re kind of moving day by day.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check coverage of the eleventh Democratic presidential debate from Washington, DC, ahead of the nation\u2019s third super Tuesday, where primaries will be held in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio on March 17. In a debate hosted by CNN and Univision, front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads by over 100 delegates, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders faced off in the first one-on-one debate of the 2020 election cycle. In a press conference last week, Sanders specifically listed several questions he would be asking Biden, including what he would do to help those with medically related debt, how he would reduce mass incarceration, and what he would do to tackle climate change, student debt and wealth disparity. In an attempt to show himself as a longtime leader on several progressive fronts, Sanders said Sunday that Biden \u201csince the campaign has come around\u201d on progressive issues, including minimum wage increases. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN\u2019s home for Facts First. \u201cI talked about raising that minimum wage, 15 bucks an hour, four years ago,\u201d Sanders said at Sunday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. \u201cSo did I, and I went out and campaigned for it,\u201d Biden replied. \u201c$15 an hour?\u201d Sanders asked. \u201c$15 an hour in New York City. Go talk to the governor,\u201d Biden shot back. \u201cI will talk to the governor. I am not aware of that,\u201d Sanders said. Facts First: Biden is correct. As Vice President, Biden campaigned with New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2015 to increase the state minimum wage to $15 an hour. The governor signed legislation \u2013 part of the 2016-2017 New York budget \u2013 that will gradually increase the state\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour completely by 2021. \u2013 Holmes Lybrand Asked whether he would order a national lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic, Biden took a swipe at Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal. He pointed to Italy, saying that its single-payer health care system hasn\u2019t worked to stem the outbreak there. \u201cIt has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That would not solve the problem at all,\u201d Biden said at CNN\u2019s Democratic Debate on Sunday night. Facts First: This is partly true. As the experience of Italy and other countries shows, having universal coverage and a government-run health system is not enough on its own to stem the spread of coronavirus. But the US is at a disadvantage in fighting the coronavirus because tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or face high out-of-pocket costs before their insurance kicks in \u2013 which may make people hesitant to seek testing or treatment. Health care experts in the US are concerned that the coronavirus will spread more widely because ill Americans will avoid getting checked out because of the potential cost. Medicare for All calls for all Americans to have coverage with no out-of-pocket charges. Nearly 28 million non-elderly people \u2013 or 10.4% \u2013 were uninsured in 2018, according to the US Census Bureau. And those who have insurance through their jobs still face annual deductibles of about $1,655, on average, before coverage kicks in, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Employer Health Benefits Survey. \u201cAddressing coronavirus with tens of millions of people without health insurance or with inadequate insurance will be a uniquely American challenge among developed countries,\u201d tweeted Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser. \u201cIt will take money to treat people and address uncompensated care absorbed by providers.\u201d But federal and state officials, as well as insurers, have stepped up to make sure that Americans can get the coronavirus test at no cost. Many insurers have said they will waive fees for certain members. Several states have also required insurers to waive the cost of the test for some policyholders. The House bipartisan legislative package, which lawmakers passed in the early hours of Saturday morning, also calls for \u201cfree coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured,\u201d said Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter to House Democrats. President Donald Trump has tweeted his support of the package. The Senate is expected to take up the measure when it returns to session this week. \u2013 Tami Luhby During the debate, Biden claimed that the US chose not to take testing kits for the coronavirus from the World Health Organization (WHO). \u201cLook, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s characterization that the WHO offered the US tests is incorrect. Laboratories in Germany developed tests to detect the coronavirus which the WHO adopted and by last week, the WHO sent out tests to 120 countries. Other countries, like the US and China, chose to develop their own tests, according to the Washington Post. As CNN reported Wednesday, no discussions occurred between the WHO and the CDC about providing tests to the United States, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told CNN on Tuesday, and the WHO did not offer coronavirus tests to the CDC. During a press conference Tuesday, administration officials were asked about Biden\u2019s comments during the debate. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters that organizations and groups \u201ccan submit their testing kits through our regulatory processes, but without that and without a plan, we are not going to accept tests that have not been studied by us.\u201d President Donald Trump, when asked Tuesday about Biden\u2019s comments, told reporters Biden \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and assumed \u201cthat he\u2019ll apologize.\u201d Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, told CNN in response that \u201cDonald Trump cannot deflect responsibility for mishandling of the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The United States lags far behind other countries in terms of having enough tests available for our citizens.\u201d Testing in the US On February 12, the Center for Disease Control reported that some of the coronavirus test kits shipped to labs across the country were not working as they should. As a result, the CDC remade parts of the test kits after some produced inconclusive test results. As of Sunday, almost two months after the coronavirus was first detected in the US, 22,713 specimens had been tested in the US according to the CDC\u2019s website, where you can find daily updates here. Experts have criticized the country\u2019s seeming inability to produce more tests. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the experts leading the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus told Congress Thursday that the US was \u201cfailing\u201d when it came to getting Americans tested. \u201cIt is a failing, let\u2019s admit it,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we\u2019re not set up for that.\u201d CORRECTION: The Facts First finding on Biden\u2019s claim about the US and WHO testing kits was corrected after additional reporting that showed the WHO did not offer coronavirus tests to the CDC. \u2013 Holmes Lybrand In an exchange about how the government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Biden asserted that Sanders voted against a bailout for the auto industry. \u201cPart of that was bailing out the automobile industry \u2013 saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that,\u201d Biden said. Sanders immediately rejected the claim, saying: \u201cNo, I did not vote against that.\u201d Facts First: Sanders is right, but this needs context. Sanders voted for a bill that would have bailed out the auto industry \u2013 but it failed to pass the Senate. He voted against a different bailout measure, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which passed. That program released money to banks \u2013 and a portion of that money eventually went to automakers. In the midst of the financial crisis, the government bailed out failing banks to try to stabilize the economy. Automakers, facing cratering sales, were also headed towards insolvency and the government stepped in to rescue the industry and the jobs it provides. Sanders did vote in December of 2008 to bring an auto bailout bill to the floor. But the motion failed and that particular piece of legislation never came to a full vote. But Sanders voted against TARP, which was used to bail out the banks. When this measure was first proposed, there were no plans to use the money for the auto industry. But first President George W. Bush and then President Barack Obama used some of the TARP funds to bailout automakers. Sanders opposed TARP when it passed in October 2008. He also joined with Republicans who sought to stop the distribution of additional TARP funds in January 2009. \u2013 Katie Lobosco Sanders on Sunday cited two figures about the number of people he claimed die because of the inadequacy of the US health care system. Sanders said \u201cat least 30,000\u201d people died in the US last year because they didn\u2019t get health care when they should have. He also said that \u201cup to 60,000 people\u201d die, \u201cin a good year,\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t get to a doctor on time.\u201d Facts First: The true number of Americans who die because they are uninsured or lack adequate coverage is not known. Some studies suggest the number is in the tens of thousands per year, but other experts have expressed skepticism that the number is as high as Sanders says. When CNN inquired in February about a previous version of Sanders\u2019 claim about 30,000 deaths, the senator\u2019s campaign pointed to a new study in The Lancet medical journal that found \u201censuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68,000 lives\u2026every year compared with the status quo.\u201d But other experts have cast doubt on the findings of the study, noting that the estimate of more than 68,000 lives saved relied on an earlier paper \u2013 from 2009, before the Affordable Care Act came into existence \u2013 that arrived at a higher figure than other analyses have. \u2013 Daniel Dale Biden during the debate was asked what lessons he learned from his 2002 vote to authorize war in Iraq, which he has called a mistake. Biden, who was a US senator at the time of his vote, responded, \u201cI learned that I can\u2019t take the word of a President when in fact they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context. The context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determining whether or not\u2026they were, in fact, producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. They were not.\u201d Sanders responded, \u201cEverybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution you were giving (President George W.) Bush the authority to go to war. And everybody knew that\u2019s exactly what he and (Vice President Dick) Cheney wanted to do.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim is misleading by omission. Biden was an advocate of ending the Saddam Hussein regime for more than a year before the war began in 2003. While Biden did begin calling his 2002 vote a \u201cmistake\u201d in 2005, he was a public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004 \u2013 and he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into Iraq. It\u2019s also unclear whether Bush ever made Biden any kind of promise related to the use of force. In a February 2003 speech in Delaware, before the war began, Biden said, \u201cLet everyone here be absolutely clear: I supported the resolution to go to war. I am NOT opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. I am NOT opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that.\u201d In a July 2003 speech at the Brookings Institution, after the war began, Biden said: \u201cNine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force and I would vote that way again today. It was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today.\u201d You can read longer articles on Biden\u2019s claims about his stance on the Iraq war here, here and here. Bush denies ever having made Biden a promise not to go to war. After Biden made a version of this claim in 2019, saying Bush had made the pledge in an Oval Office meeting, a spokesman for Bush told NPR, \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just an innocent mistake of memory, but this recollection is flat wrong.\u201d It\u2019s true that Biden criticized Bush\u2019s approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, that Biden warned in the lead-up to the war that Bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and that he criticized Bush\u2019s handling of the war from its first weeks on. But, again, Biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism. \u2013 Daniel Dale During an exchange about Sanders\u2019 views on authoritarian countries, Biden claimed that China\u2019s income gains have been \u201cmarginal.\u201d \u201cChina is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, OK. But would anybody deny, any economist deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago? That\u2019s a fact,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe idea that they, in fact, have increased the wealth of people in that country, it\u2019s been marginal the change that has taken place,\u201d Biden responded. Facts First: This is false. China has seen a significant upswing in terms of standard of living over the past two decades \u2013 though the country still significantly lags the US and extreme poverty remains a reality for many. One way to measure standard of living is through a country\u2019s gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. In other words, looking at a country\u2019s GDP per person in international dollars, a hypothetical currency used to measure purchasing parity between different countries. For China, that measure has increased to $18,237 per capita in 2018 from $2,936 in 2000, and $988 in 1990, according to data from the World Bank. However, China is still far from wealthy relative to the US, where GDP per capita at purchasing power parity stood at around $62,795 in 2018. \u2013 Anneken Tappe In an exchange on Social Security, Biden denied Sanders\u2019 claim that Biden talked about \u201cthe necessity with pride about cutting social security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans programs.\u201d Fact First: This Sanders\u2019 claim needs a lot of context. Biden did repeatedly support freezes in Social Security spending and at times called for raising the retirement age. In 2011, he said \u201cchanges\u201d would have to be made to entitlements, saying they wouldn\u2019t be sustainable \u2013 but he didn\u2019t specify what changes. Overall, the claim leaves out that Biden was typically talking about any changes to entitlements in the context of a broader legislative package. Sanders and Biden\u2019s exchanges on Social Security have been covered by fact checkers before from the Washington Post, Politifact, and FactCheck.org. Biden did at least twice discuss raising the retirement age throughout his career as a senator.  And throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Biden supported freezes in Social Security spending during budget reduction negotiations. And comments Biden made during a 1995 speech on the Senate floor show he was willing to make cuts to Medicare, but only as part of a broader deal that did not advocate cuts as big as Republicans want. \u201cYou guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.\u201d Sanders also defended himself tonight when asked by CNN\u2019s moderators about 1996 comments he made, first reported by the Associated Press, where he wrote in an op-ed we will \u201chave to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits \u2014 as Congress has done in the past.\u201d Sanders said Sunday he never supported cuts to Social Security and in the same op-ed he did say he opposed proposed cuts by the Republican-led Congress to entitlement programs. In multiple op-eds and press releases from 1997, Sanders made clear he opposed any cuts to Social Security. The adjustment Sanders was discussing was making the tax system more progressive. \u201cIf we are serious about saving Social Security, not raising taxes on the middle class, and not cutting back on benefits desperately needed by many senior citizens, we must adjust this artificial ceiling on Social Security taxes and make the Social Security tax more progressive.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Kaczynski Sanders confronted Biden about his long history of support for the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funds from being used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or where there is a danger to the life of the mother. Biden responded that he \u201caffirmatively came out and opposed the Hyde Amendment\u201d \u2013 and \u201cdid that a while ago, okay?\u201d Facts First:\u202f Biden reversed his position on the amendment less than a year ago, in June 2019, so the accuracy of the claim depends on your definition of \u201ca while ago.\u201d Biden said upon his June 2019 reversal that he made \u201cno apologies\u201d for his past support of the amendment. He argued that \u201ctimes have changed,\u201d since, he argued, the right to choose \u201cwas not under attack as it is now\u201d from Republicans and since \u201cwomen\u2019s rights and women\u2019s health are under assault like we haven\u2019t seen in the last 50 years.\u201d He also said that he had decided he could not simultaneously put forward a health care plan to give people the option to sign on to a federally funded health insurance program while he also continued to support an amendment that would deny abortion using federal funds. \u2013 Daniel Dale Sanders and Biden had a heated exchange about super PACs. Sanders claimed a super PAC tied to Biden is running \u201cvery ugly negative ads\u201d against him, while Biden argued that Sanders has nine super PACs working on his behalf. Facts First: While it\u2019s unclear which ad Sanders was referring to, at least one super PAC connected to Biden, Unite the Country, ran a large television ad campaign that implicitly criticized Sanders without mentioning him by name.. As for Biden\u2019s claim about Sanders\u2019 nine super PACs, Sanders does have the backing of a network of progressive groups, which includes nine organizations that are part of the People Power for Bernie coalition, as The Washington Post recently has reported. But most groups supporting Sanders are not super PACs, instead operating as politically active non-profits. After decrying super PACs in the past, Biden reversed his position last October as he struggled to raise money for the 2020 campaign, and embraced help from Unite the Country, which has spent more than $10 million to help him. Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG) data shows that Unite the Country has spent more than $1.1 million on a 30-second ad called, \u201cA Democrat,\u201d that takes some digs at Sanders without mentioning him by name. For instance, it includes a clip from a Biden speech, in which Biden says\u201d Democrats want a nominee who\u2019s a Democrat\u201d \u2013 an apparent challenge to the party bonafides of Sanders, who serves as an independent in the US Senate and describes himself as a democratic socialist. As for Sanders, he does have the support a super PAC affiliated with National Nurses United, which has spent about $750,000 so far, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. When Sanders asked Biden to name the nine super PACs in question, the former vice president responded: \u201cCome on. Give me a break.\u201d \u2013 Fredreka Schouten",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden brought olive branches to Sunday night\u2019s debate. But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders preferred what might be one final fight. The 11th Democratic presidential debate took place as the nation confronts the coronavirus pandemic, with the candidates\u2019 podiums set six feet apart serving as a reminder of the global public health emergency. It was the first one-on-one showdown between the primary\u2019s two finalists. The delegate math suggests their race is approaching its end, with the former vice president building a clear lead that\u2019s expected to grow Tuesday with primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. But Sunday night showed that how the end occurs remains an open question. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Sanders repeatedly laid into Biden\u2019s record on Social Security and bankruptcy legislation, trade and more. But Biden \u2013 who appeared to accept midway through that the two wouldn\u2019t find much common ground \u2013 also decided to directly engage with Sanders on his record  as well. He also had an ace in the hole. Biden said for the first time he would pick a female vice president \u2013 a significant development that Sanders didn\u2019t quite match. Here are five takeaways from Sunday night\u2019s debate: The vast gulf between Sanders and Biden on politics and policy, as well as how they would approach the presidency, was on display in their responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Biden sought to offer competency and showcase a detailed understanding of the federal government. He also touted his own experience, pointing to decisions he made during his eight years as vice president. \u201cThis is like a war, and in a war you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people,\u201d Biden said, adding later that he would use the US military to respond. Sanders, by comparison, argued the spread of the coronavirus was something that has exacerbated \u2013 and even highlighted \u2013 the flaws in the current US health care and economic system, casting himself as offering the wholesale change that he feels the country needs. The Vermont senator also channeled the anger about Trump\u2019s leadership during this crisis. \u201cFirst thing we have got to do, whether or not I\u2019m president, is to shut this president up right now,\u201d Sanders said, echoing other Democrats as he knocked Trump for \u201cundermining the doctors and the scientists\u201d who are leading the response. The clearest illustration of their vast differences came in an exchange over economic inequality and the response to the coronavirus. Biden pledged to make people \u201cwhole,\u201d but offered a more focused approach on tackling the issue, while Sanders disagreed, saying it is \u201cnot good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future.\u201d \u201cPeople are looking for results,\u201d Biden said, \u201cnot a revolution.\u201d Biden calmly dropped the biggest news of the night into an answer on protecting women\u2019s rights: He would pick a woman to be his running mate if he wins the Democratic nomination. \u201cThere are a number of women qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president,\u201d Biden said. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash followed up with Biden, asking point blank if he would pick a woman as his running mate. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. The announcement has huge implications. Biden is currently the delegate leader in the Democratic primary and the odds-on favorite to be the party\u2019s nominee. His commitment could end up becoming reality. Biden has long said he wants someone \u201csimpatico\u201d on policy as his running mate. He has also at times named a number of women as potential vice presidential nominees. He has singled out California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former deputy attorney general Sally Yates and New Hampshire Sens. Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen. Sanders was less committal about the idea of having a woman running mate. \u201cIn all likelihood, I will,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So, my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\u201d The nation has only ever had two women vice presidential candidates: Geraldine Ferraro ran as Walter Mondale\u2019s running mate in 1984 and Sarah Palin ran as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008. Biden tried to extend olive branches to Sanders and his supporters Sunday night \u2013 though his rival wasn\u2019t ready to bridge their ideological divides. The former vice president pointed to his moves within the previous two days to embrace free public university tuition for those whose families make less than $125,000 per year and to embrace Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal to undo much of a bankruptcy bill they\u2019d fought over 15 years earlier. \u201cI agree with Bernie,\u201d Biden said as they discussed surging help to hospitals facing the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI agreed with Bernie,\u201d he said later when noting they both believed those on Wall Street responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should have gone to jail. Sanders mostly didn\u2019t reciprocate, which a frustrated Biden pointed out. \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now. I\u2019ve been trying to give him credit for things and he won\u2019t even take the credit,\u201d Biden said. Still, the former vice president sought to minimize his differences with Sanders in a bid to create an open door for the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters to migrate to Biden\u2019s campaign if he wins the Democratic nomination. Though Sanders disagreed, Biden said the two have the same priorities on health care, student debt, education and climate change. \u201cWe disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don\u2019t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything,\u201d Biden said. After a debate in which Biden touted Sanders-backed policies he\u2019s embracing, Biden\u2019s campaign made clear it views Sanders himself as an annoyance to be batted away. Senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn said Biden \u201cfor two hours graciously dealt with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, directly questioned whether Biden can defeat President  Trump in the general election. Sanders pointed to his strong support from young voters and Latinos. He also nodded to exit polls showing his own proposals on issues like Medicare for All being more popular among Democratic primary voters than Biden\u2019s positions, even as Biden has overwhelmingly won most states. \u201cI have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump, who will be a very, very tough opponent, unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI have my doubts that Vice President Biden\u2019s campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout,\u201d he added. Sanders arrived Sunday night ready to lay into Biden over votes he\u2019d cast and comments he\u2019d made over decades, casting the former vice president as too moderate for the modern Democratic Party. They clashed over climate change, free trade, same-sex marriage and more. But the most illustrative battle was over Social Security, with Sanders bringing an attack that\u2019s been a fixture in his campaign ads into a debate. \u201cI am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate time and time again, touting the need to cut Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 programs,\u201d the Vermont senator said to Biden. \u201cThat is not true,\u201d Biden shot back. Sanders told those watching at home to visit YouTube \u2013 where the first search result for \u201cJoe Biden Social Security\u201d is a video posted by Sanders\u2019 campaign in which Biden says to \u201cput all of it on the table.\u201d Biden said he was willing to put changes to Social Security on the table \u201cin order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related.\u201d \u201cBut we did not cut it,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI know,\u201d Sanders shot back, \u201cbecause people like me helped stop that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Amid a gradual shuttering of American society due to the spread of coronavirus, the two leading Democratic candidates for president debated Sunday night \u2013 the first one-on-one debate of the election, between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. I watched, took notes and picked some of the bests and worsts of the night that was. My thoughts are below. * Elizabeth Warren/Kamala Harris/Stacey Abrams/Amy Klobuchar: Biden pledged unequivocally on Sunday night that he will pick a woman to be his vice president. That\u2019s a BIG deal as it will mark \u2013 assuming Biden is the nominee \u2013 only the third time in the history of the Democratic Party that a woman will be on the national ticket. (The other two? 1984 and 2016.) That\u2019s a BIG deal. And if you are Warren, Harris, Abrams or Klobuchar, you just had a surprisingly good Sunday night, politically speaking. * Donald Trump: The President\u2019s handling of the coronavirus \u2013 the ONLY issue anyone cares about right now \u2013 has been shaky to say the very least. He\u2019s made a number of factually inaccurate statements about the threat posed by the virus. He continues to suggest everything is perfectly under control. He refuses to take any responsibility for any of the mistakes his administration has made to date. In short, you would think that he would have been a target-rich environment for both Sanders and Biden, right? After all, the first 30 minutes (at least) of the debate was dedicated to the coronavirus and how each man would fix it if they were president. And yet, with the exception of an occasional mention here and there, Trump was barely mentioned. Much of the rest of the debate was Sanders savaging Biden\u2019s voting record from more than three decades in the Senate \u2013 on everything from the bankruptcy law to Social Security cuts to the Defense of Marriage Act \u2013 that isn\u2019t likely to change the trajectory of the Democratic race (Biden seems likely to win overwhelmingly in states set to vote Tuesday) but provides terrific lines of attack for Trump once Biden is the nominee. * No live audience: The reason there was no live audience at this debate was because of concerns about crowds and coronavirus. While I wish a global pandemic wasn\u2019t the motivator, I do think this debate was FAR better than recent ones in which the cheering, booing and \u201cooohing\u201d from the audience was both distracting and wrongly influential for the TV audience. We need to accept that this is a TV event. The vast majority of the people who are watching are doing so from afar. Why let a few hundred people the campaigns (and Democratic National Committee) choose to invite influence the broader audience? * Elbow bump: Sure, it looked sort of weird when Sanders walked over to Biden and gave him an elbow bump rather than a handshake. It was also a) the right thing to do amid the coronavirus outbreak and b) a powerful symbol to the general public about how we all need to adjust our behavior accordingly. Elbow bump pic.twitter.com/vHxyfOTFDI Also, it gave us these amazing quotes that you could NEVER have foreseen coming up in a presidential debate in 2020. 1) \u201cI am using a lot of soap.\u201d \u2013 Bernie Sanders 2) \u201cI wash my hands god-knows-how-many-times with hot water and soap.\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden * \u201cThe You Tube\u201d: With much of the country committed to staying at home to protect ourselves (and the broader society) from coronavirus, a massive video-sharing website probably doesn\u2019t need any help. But it got some anyway when Sanders urged people to \u201cgo to the You Tube.\u201d * Bernie Sanders/Joe Biden: Both men had good moments. Both had bad moments. But overall, they spent two hours attacking each other\u2019s voting records  \u2013 often focusing on the sort of legislative minutiae (Hyde Amendment!) that the average voter simply tunes out. And in the process, handing the Trump campaign a whole lot of soundbites to be used in the general election. Both men looked small more often than they looked big. And with the country facing a threat unlike any it\u2019s ever seen before, that felt like a major missed opportunity. Let\u2019s deal with Sanders first. The expectation going into the debate \u2013 judging from the tone of Sanders\u2019 announcement last week that he was planning to stay in the race \u2013 was that the Vermont senator would use the one-on-one format with Biden to try to force the former VP to acquiesce to some of his policy proposals but generally avoid taking any big swings at the man who, according to the delegate math, is the near-certain Democratic nominee. Sanders badly missed the mark when he tried to turn the coronavirus conversation into a recitation of his Medicare for All program. His unwillingness to walk back his praise for Cuba under Fidel Castro was a major mistake. That said, if you are a Bernie backer, you likely loved him taking it to Biden on Social Security, the war in Iraq, the Defense of Marriage Act and a few other major pieces of legislation where the two men were on opposite sides. Now, Biden. He clearly benefited from a one-on-one format, making more sense and staying more relevant for the entirety of the debate. He was VERY smart to make news by announcing he would pick a female VP. His focus on the need for trusted leadership during the coronavirus crisis made Sanders look small. But his trademark verbal flubs \u2013 he seemingly mixed up coronavirus, SARS and H1N1 on several occasions \u2013 were there, and immediately picked up on by the Trump campaign. Biden\u2019s answer on whether he put Social Security cuts on the board was not clear or good. He gave the Trump campaign clear openings for attack with his support for no deportations in the first 100 days and support for ending fracking. Neither one came out of that debate looking great. And neither one\u2019s supporters moved an inch closer to each other either. Biden summed things up nicely when asked what he would do, if he is the nominee, to bring Sanders into the fold: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d * Ambitious male Democratic politicians: Sorry, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Andrew Yang. The best you guys are going to do is to make it into a Biden Cabinet (if it happens). Also, credit to Yang for the tweet of the night following Biden\u2019s pledge to choose a female VP: \u201cWow Joe just committed to a woman as VP.  I like it. Though he didn\u2019t mention that to me when we spoke.\u201d Wow Joe just committed to a woman as VP.  I like it. Though he didn\u2019t mention that to me when we spoke.  \ud83d\ude00",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders enter their first one-on-one debate Sunday night under unprecedented circumstances. The debate, which was originally supposed to take place in Arizona in front of a live crowd, will now be held in CNN\u2019s Washington, DC, studios with no in-person audience as a result of the coronavirus pandemic that has also led both candidates to cancel rallies and stay off the campaign trail in recent days. The historic situation will serve as the backdrop to a debate in which Biden and Sanders will look to explain how they would lead the country in a moment of crisis and how their experience and policies make them best suited for the job. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The debate comes ahead of primaries Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio \u2013 four states where Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and where Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to score big victories as he continues his march toward the Democratic presidential nomination. Here are three things to watch in Sunday night\u2019s debate: Biden and Sanders\u2019 responses to the coronavirus have highlighted their unity in opposing President Donald Trump, as both believe he has mishandled this crisis. But their responses have also highlighted the chasm between the two on policy and demeanor. Biden has attempted to demonstrate his competency, hoping that voters can visualize him as a president responding to a crisis. The former vice president argued in a speech on Thursday that the coronavirus \u201claid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration\u201d and said that he, as president, would marshal a \u201ccoordinated, global response\u201d to the virus \u2013 contrasting himself to Trump. He offered specific actions he would take to address the crisis. Sanders similarly delivered a response that excoriated Trump, but the Vermont senator used the moment to drive his policy proposals, including Medicare for All, and highlight the ills the United States faces that could be exacerbated by the virus. Sanders called for a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures and utility shutoffs during the coronavirus pandemic during his speech, and also pointed to pervasive problems that existed before the pandemic began. The difference in response highlights the kind of leadership each candidate has offered throughout the campaign: Biden is pledging competency that leads voters to harken back to how former presidents responded in a time of crisis, while Sanders is promising wholesale change. Biden faces a tricky balancing act as he enters Sunday night with a significant lead over Sanders in delegates. The former vice president is eager to pivot to the general election and focus on taking on Trump. His campaign views the current crisis as the exact contrast he wants American voters to see: Biden remaining calm, leaning on experts and proposing specific steps while Trump claims credit for things that haven\u2019t happened and deflects blame for the slow deployment of coronavirus tests. But he can\u2019t take a potential victory over Sanders for granted and he also can\u2019t risk alienating Sanders\u2019 supporters, especially the young voters with whom he has struggled and will need to eventually win over. In a speech Tuesday night in Delaware, after his victory in Michigan and other primaries, Biden extended an olive branch to Sanders supporters. \u201cI want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and passion,\u201d Biden said. He told them that \u201cthere is a place in our campaign for each of you\u201d and that they share a \u201ccommon goal\u201d of defeating Trump. Whether Biden can continue that outreach while facing criticism from Sanders on the debate stage Sunday is a key question. How aggressive Sanders is with Biden could preview how long this primary battle will last. Sanders comes into the debate with a substantial delegate deficit and a slate of tough contests ahead of him on Tuesday. As a results of the coronavirus pandemic, his campaign is currently unable to hold the large, raucous rallies that have propelled his bid to date. That leaves Sunday\u2019s debate as the best opportunity for the Vermont senator to make up ground. But how Sanders approaches Biden Sunday will set the tone for to the rest of the primary. Sanders signaled earlier this week that he is prepared to keep his focus on the policy differences between him and the former vice president. In a Wednesday speech where the Vermont senator was dour about his current standing, Sanders listed conversations he hoped to have with Biden at the debate, including medical debt, climate change and economic inequality. Notably not mentioned: Attacks he has previously leveled against the former vice president on Social Security and his support for the Iraq war. If Sanders keeps the discussion to clear and current policy differences, that will be welcome news to Democratic operatives who worry that a divisive fight on national television could eventually hurt Biden if he remains on track to become the Democratic nominee. Many top Democrats believe Sanders hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 by dragging their primary battle into the summer. But Biden\u2019s team, after watching Sanders\u2019 speech on Wednesday, is hopeful that won\u2019t be the case four years later. \u201cCalling for a substantive discussion about our housing plans absolutely pales in comparison\u201d to 2016, a Biden adviser said on Wednesday night.",

            "article_content": "A defiant Sen. Bernie Sanders vowed to stay in the presidential race on Wednesday after a series of defeats that have left him trailing rival Joe Biden in the delegate race, pointing to his appeal with younger voters and previewing the lines of argument he\u2019ll use against the former vice president on Sunday at a CNN-Univision debate. \u201cLast night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,\u201d Sanders said, listing his his losses in the Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho primaries, before noting a victory in North Dakota and reminding viewers of his lead in Washington state. Sanders\u2019 decision to continue his campaign despite the growing odds against him is likely to anger Democrats outside progressive circles, who on Tuesday night began to openly clamor for a quick end to the contest. Biden was largely deferential in his speech and appeared to offer Sanders an off-ramp. But the Vermont senator, after a night of deliberations with his innermost circle, opted to fight on \u2013 and make his case at least one more time to Democratic voters. Standing in front of a line of American flags and a deep blue curtain, Sanders acknowledged his delegate math crunch before he dug deeper into the numbers and warned that Biden\u2019s failure so far to win over young voters could be damaging in November and beyond. He did not, however, criticize Biden over his Iraq War vote or record on Social Security. In dropping those lines of attack, Sanders offered some insight into his goals going forward: to push his own agenda and perhaps secure some commitments from Biden, not tear him down. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cToday I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,\u201d Sanders said, before conceding that he was doing just as poorly with older voters. Sanders, in unusually frank and analytical terms, also discussed his failure so far to convince Democrats he would stand the best chance of defeating President Donald Trump in November. \u201cWhile our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability. I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoke to and said, and I quote, \u2018I like what your campaign stands for, I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have heard that statement all over this country. Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.\u201d The key decision point for Sanders appeared to be the opportunity to stand across from Biden on the debate stage, a one-on-one he has longed for since the campaign began more than a year ago. Sanders explained his decision, saying he would use the debate to address those electability concerns and, potentially, the trajectory of the race, by peppering \u201cmy friend Joe Biden\u201d with a series of questions over his commitment to addressing the issues central to Sanders\u2019 agenda. Among them, the Vermont senator said, was a challenge to Biden on Sanders\u2019 signature issue: health care. \u201cJoe, what are you going to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on earth where health care is not a human right?\u201d Sanders said, previewing his line of attack. \u201cAre you really going to veto a \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 bill if it is passed in Congress?\u201d Sanders\u2019 \u201cquestions\u201d also touched on issues around medical debt, climate change and economic inequality. A Sanders aide told CNN late Tuesday night that the Vermont senator planned to stay in the race at least through Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, but as the hours passed and Sanders\u2019 team remained publicly silent, speculation began to swirl that he would drop out of the race on Wednesday afternoon. By fighting on, Sanders will get the face-off with Biden that he has long desired. But it comes now with his campaign on the ropes following Biden\u2019s remarkable revival, which began with a sweeping victory in South Carolina and built over the subsequent 10 days as the moderate party leaders and Democratic voters coalesced behind his campaign. His decision, though, was greeted happily by some leading progressives, who echoed Sanders\u2019 focus on Biden\u2019s struggles with younger voters. \u201cI hear people talk all the time about Biden putting together the Obama coalition. Well, the Obama coalition included people under the age of 30, and Biden is losing them by like 60% some cases,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a progressive group that endorsed Sanders. \u201cA debate between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden really, really matters, especially at a time when that key demographic shouldn\u2019t be dismissed \u2026 Millions of voters that have voted for Bernie Sanders, especially young people fighting for our future. We deserve to hear that contrast and continue the contest.\u201d Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren in 2020 before offering some qualified support to Sanders after she dropped out, said even before the announcement that he and others were hoping to see a debate. \u201cNot because it will likely change the outcome, but because in order to not change the outcome Biden has to withstand one-on-one scrutiny similar to a debate with Trump \u2013 and he would likely need to cement some popular progressive positions that Bernie challenges him on,\u201d Green said. \u201cAll of that makes us more likely to defeat Trump.\u201d But before all that, Sanders will resume semi-normal campaign activities on Wednesday night as he heads to New York to join Jimmy Fallon on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan contributed to this story.",

Bernie Sanders, fresh off a devastating series of losses on Tuesday night, announced Wednesday afternoon that he was staying in the 2020 race (bet you didn\u2019t see that coming!) and looked forward to debating former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday night in Arizona. Sanders justified his decision to stay in the race \u2013 despite trailing Biden by more than 100 delegates \u2013 by noting that exit polling in the states that have voted so far has shown a) support for his liberal agenda (most notably his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan) and b) young voters preferring him to Biden. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cWhat became even more apparent yesterday is that while we are currently losing the delegate count, we are strongly winning in two enormously important areas which will determine the future of our country,\u201d said Sanders in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. And he is right on both fronts. Among voters aged 18 to 44, Sanders beat Biden 62% to 32% in Michigan \u2013 even while losing the state overall by double digits. And again in Michigan, almost 6 in 10 (58%) said they preferred \u201ca government plan for all instead of private insurance.\u201d Those numbers \u2013 on both the age and Medicare for All questions \u2013 have been remarkably consistent across the states that have cast ballots in the Democratic primary to date. But here\u2019s the problem for Sanders. Neither of them necessarily tells the full story of this election. Let\u2019s start with the age question. Yes, it is true that Sanders has consistently beaten Biden among voters 18-44. But Biden has equally thrashed Sanders among voters 45 and older \u2013 and that voting bloc has been much larger than the younger cohort. In Michigan, for example, voters 45+ composed 62% of the electorate. In North Carolina, another swing state in the general election, 64% of the Democratic primary electorate was 45 or older. Ditto Virginia. So sure, Sanders is winning younger voters. But younger voters aren\u2019t turning out in anywhere near the numbers that middle-aged (and older) voters are. Then there is the Medicare for All question. What voters who take exit (or entrance) polls are asked is whether they support \u201ca government plan for all instead of private insurance.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t get into the specifics of how people with private insurance would be required to give up their current insurance in order to become a part of the government system. Or that there would be no private health insurance at all. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t considerable support within the Democratic Party for Medicare for All. There is! But rather it\u2019s to note that simply pointing at this data point in an exit poll might not tell the whole story of how people feel about it. Take a broader step backward. Even if you grant Sanders his two points about where he is winning, this fact remains: The Democratic nominee will be chosen solely by whoever gets the 1,991 delegates to the national convention. Winning certain demographic groups or certain policy fights is, broadly speaking, immaterial to who winds up as the nominee. What Sanders was doing then was cherry-picking data that looked good for him. But it\u2019s not clear those data points show what he thinks they do or whether they matter at all in the hard delegate math that looks increasingly bad for him.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his winning coalition on Tuesday night, delivering another commanding win in the South with black voters and moderates while also winning over groups that went for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, according to preliminary exit polls. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race White college-educated voters left Sanders and threw their support behind Biden. Sanders also lost support with independent voters, another key demographic, who backed the democratic socialist senator by far smaller margins than they did four years ago. The results followed a pattern established on Super Tuesday, as Biden continues to consolidate a Democratic electorate that is supremely focused on one goal: Defeating President Donald Trump in November. Here\u2019s what we saw in exit polls Tuesday night: In both Michigan and Missouri, Biden drew support from groups that Sanders won by significant margins in 2016, especially white voters. In Michigan, preliminary exit polls showed Biden and Sanders about even among college-educated white men, despite Sanders winning that group by nearly a 2-to-1 margin four years ago. Independent voters favored Sanders by 43 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he led Biden only by single digits in 2020. Missouri exit polls showed Biden significantly leading Sanders among men without a college degree, a group that Sanders won in 2016 by 60%, topping Clinton by 21 percentage points. Sanders also lost support among independent voters in Missouri: around half voted for him in 2020, a drop from about 67% in 2016. Black voters in Mississippi delivered yet another commanding win for Biden in the South, as he aimed to build his delegate lead and capitalize on the momentum that started with his February 29 win in South Carolina. Around two-thirds of the Democratic primary electorate in Mississippi was black, and those voters supported Biden by an almost 8-to-1 margin, with almost 9 in 10 saying they voted for Biden vs. only a little over 1 in 10 for Sanders. Seven in 10 black voters in Missouri also cast their ballots for Biden Tuesday. The exit polls showed Democratic voters trust Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis. In Missouri, results show a broad 6 in 10 Democratic primary voters trusted Biden most to handle a major crisis, while about a quarter named Sanders. In Michigan, where the exit poll reflected only those who voted on Election Day, roughly half of Democratic primary voters said they trust Biden most among the Democratic candidates to handle a major crisis. About a third say they trust Sanders most to handle a crisis. The numbers are similar in Washington state, where about half of Democratic primary voters said they trust Biden to handle a crisis. About a quarter chose Sanders and roughly 1 in 5 chose Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race on Thursday. Voters cast their ballots by mail in Washington, and many ballots were mailed before the field of candidates winnowed over the past week. Around 4 in 10 Michigan Democratic voters chose health care as their top issue, according to early exit polls. About a quarter chose income inequality, 1 in 5 named climate change and 1 in 10 chose race relations. Almost 6 in 10 voters in Michigan whose top priority is health care supported Biden for the nomination, while around 4 in 10 went for Sanders. Sanders narrowly beat Biden among voters who prioritized income inequality. Almost 6 in 10 support replacing private health insurance with a single government plan for all. And around half say the nation\u2019s economy needs a complete overhaul, while over 2 in 5 want minor changes and less than 1 in 10 think it works well as is. Supporters of a private insurance plan went for Sanders, around 6 in 10, while around three quarters of voters who opposed it voted for Biden. In Washington, where there has been a concentration of coronavirus cases, more than 8 in 10 Democratic primary voters said they were at least somewhat concerned about the effects of the outbreak, including nearly 4 in 10 who said they were \u201cvery concerned.\u201d The Biden and Sanders campaigns both canceled rallies on Tuesday night. Older voters there were more apt to be concerned than younger ones, with around half of those age 65 and older saying they are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about it, compared with just 1 in 7 of those under age 45. Almost 9 in 10 Democratic voters in Washington said they would vote for the Democrat in November regardless of who the nominee is, according to early exit polls. Around 8 in 10 in Michigan said the same \u2013 including 9 in 10 Biden supporters and 8 in 10 Sanders supporters. About 1 in 5 Sanders voters in Michigan would not commit to voting Democratic in November regardless of who the nominee is. About 6 in 10 Democratic primary voters in Michigan and even more in Washington, 8 in 10, are angry at the Trump administration. Only single digits said they were enthusiastic or satisfied regarding the current administration. Preliminary exit polls in Michigan show around 3 in 5 Democratic voters on Election Day prefer a nominee who can beat Trump over someone who agrees with them on the issues. That number is even higher in Washington state, where almost 7 in 10 said they want someone who can best Trump. For those casting a ballot in Mississippi and Washington, uniting the country was the top quality they were looking for in a nominee. Biden won more than 9 in 10 of those voters in Mississippi and nearly two-thirds in Washington. He also soundly beat Sanders among Mississippi voters for whom bringing needed change and for whom caring about people like them were qualities that mattered, but Sanders bested the former vice president among Washington voters who wanted change. For Michigan voters, having a nominee who could bring needed change was most important, and more than half thought Sanders was the man for the job. Missouri voters also prioritized a candidate who could bring needed change but split fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. In both states, voters looking to unite the country and for a nominee who cares about them selected Biden. Biden won the backing of voters in union households in Michigan and Missouri, handily beating Sanders. About 3 in 10 voters in Michigan and a quarter in Missouri belong to a household with a union member. Both candidates have played to unions during the campaign, with Biden warning that his rival will take away organized labor\u2019s hard-fought health care coverage through \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which would institute a national, government-run insurance program and essentially eliminate private policies. Biden, on the other hand, supports adding a government-run option to the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Sanders countered by attacking Biden for his support for free trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, a sore subject for many Michigan residents who saw their auto industry jobs move to Mexico. While the United Auto Workers union did not endorse a candidate, a former union president announced he is backing Sanders. Biden also captured a majority of votes among non-union households in Michigan and roughly half of those in Missouri. Sanders won less than half in both states. Union support was also an issue last month in Nevada, where leaders of the influential Culinary Union made it clear that they did not support Medicare for All. Still, Sanders earned the biggest share of union votes, though the field was split among more candidates at the time. CNN exit polls were conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool in four states voting on March 10. Results are based on interviews conducted throughout the day with randomly selected Democratic primary voters at voting locations in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. Results in these states are reflective only of those who cast ballots on election day. In Washington, a telephone poll was conducted to interview those who vote by mail. The margin of error for results based on the full sample is plus or minus 4 points in Michigan, Missouri and Washington and plus or minus 5 points in Mississippi.",

            "article_content": "With the 10-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act fast approaching, former President Barack Obama highlighted the landmark health reform law\u2019s benefits in a new video released Tuesday. \u201cWith your help, it\u2019s the closest we\u2019ve ever come to universal coverage in America,\u201d Obama said in the 90-second clip released by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cThere are people alive today because of what you did. There are 135 million Americans whose pre-existing conditions are now protected because of what you did.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s something worth celebrating, but it\u2019s also progress worth protecting.\u201d MUST WATCH: President @BarackObama marks the tenth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act and calls on the American people to protect the progress we\u2019ve made and thanks #ProtectOurCare for leading the fight. Will you join us? https://t.co/8xvD9K5dIn #ACA10 pic.twitter.com/5AC10yEDdL Obama filmed several videos promoting the ACA \u2013 usually with a humorous bent \u2013 while he was in office and then more recently at annual open enrollment time for the Obamacare exchanges. The appearances have been aimed at reminding consumers of the deadline to sign up for coverage at a time when the Trump administration has slashed funding for marketing and outreach. But Tuesday\u2019s video was serious, emphasizing that voters protected Obamacare in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, effectively ending President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers\u2019 quest to repeal the law through congressional action for the time being. \u201cYou helped protect it with your vote in 2018,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut even with a House of Representatives committed to building on the Affordable Care Act, Republicans will keep trying, both in Congress and in the courts, to rip away the care that millions of Americans rely on and to raise costs for millions more.\u201d That threat looms large. Last week, the Supreme Court announced it will hear a case that will likely decide the fate of the ACA sometime next term \u2013 presumably after the presidential election. The lawsuit, brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general, centers on whether the Affordable Care Act can continue to stand even after Congress effectively eliminated the law\u2019s individual mandate requirement that nearly Americans have coverage or pay a penalty. While Obama\u2019s message is geared towards protecting Obamacare from Republicans, it is also being released on the day of another round of primary elections as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders vie for the Democratic presidential nomination. Biden wants to build on the Affordable Care Act by adding a government-run health insurance option to the exchanges. Sanders, on the other hand, advocates establishing a single, government-run health insurance plan, known as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d \u201cSo even as we celebrate, we commit ourselves to protecting the progress we\u2019ve made until we finish the job for good with quality affordable coverage for every single American,\u201d Obama said. The video featuring Obama precedes Protect Our Care\u2019s \u201cmulti-state bus tour in key 2020 battleground states\u201d that begins on Sunday and will include stops in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, according to a press release from the group. The tour is also meant to hold Republican Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who are facing tough reelections this year, \u201caccountable for failing to stop the Trump-Republican war on health care,\u201d the release states.",

            "article_content": "The Working Families Party endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday, less than a week after its first choice, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, dropped out the Democratic presidential race. The announcement comes on the eve of another round of crucial Tuesday primaries, including a do-or-die contest in Michigan, a state that Sanders won in 2016 and Democrats are desperate to reclaim from President Donald Trump this November. WFP leadership decided to back Sanders \u2013 and make the argument to Warren loyalists that they should do the same \u2013 after it became clear that the nominating contest would come down to either him or former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cWe understand that there are people on the fence. We are, just like them, Warren supporters who are disappointed that our candidate left the race, but there\u2019s work that remains to be done and we\u2019re going to be committed to the change that brought us to the Warren campaign,\u201d WFP national director Maurice Mitchell said. \u201cSen. Sanders\u2019 campaign is a natural home for Warren forces that are looking to get the job done.\u201d The WFP, which has expanded in size and influence since the 2016 election, endorsed Warren last September after backing Sanders\u2019 primary bid four years ago. That decision set off an angry backlash among some of the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters, who threatened and harassed the group\u2019s officials on social media. Warren recalled the episode during an interview last week and suggested Sanders had not done enough to curtail similar outbursts. \u201cThe candidates are responsible for their supporters, and all candidates had supporters who got out of line,\u201d Nelini Stamp, WFP\u2019s director of strategy and partnerships, told CNN. The decision to back Sanders, she said, was a pragmatic one: He finished second in their first round of ranked-choice voting last year and largely shares a platform with Warren. Bernie Sanders faces an uphill battle to win over Elizabeth Warren \u201cI actually don\u2019t think those people have power,\u201d Stamp said of the Sanders supporters who attacked her online. \u201cBut the reality is that they\u2019re loud and it hurts. I\u2019m not going to lie (and say that) it doesn\u2019t hurt. But I think that we can create a new model of a center of gravity.\u201d Warren has not publicly indicated whether she plans to endorse Sanders, Biden or remain on the sidelines until the nomination is decided. She joked during an appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this weekend that she might \u201cpull a New York Times and endorse them both,\u201d a nod to the outlet endorsing both her and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has also since dropped out of the race. For now, Warren appears mostly likely to stay out of what could turn into an ugly run-in to this summer\u2019s Democratic convention. \u201cI would love to continue to be in the fight with Sen. Warren. We\u2019ve worked with her for many years and I would love to continue seeing her fight for the issues that are important to her,\u201d Stamp said. \u201cBut she should take her time. She should do what\u2019s right for herself, as well.\u201d The WFP joins Justice Democrats, the organization that recruited New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ahead of her 2018 run, in endorsing Sanders. Justice Democrats made their choice official on Sunday morning after staying neutral over the past 14 months. Both groups are trying to bring Warren\u2019s supporters around to Sanders, but it remains unclear how her base will break on Tuesday and beyond. Warren won the WFP\u2019s endorsement late last summer at what would turn out to be a high point in her campaign. Five days after their endorsement landed, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed the Massachusetts senator leading the Democratic field in Iowa \u2013 ahead of Biden and picking up steam at Sanders\u2019 expense. But Warren\u2019s fortunes began to fade in the fall, when the debate over \u201cMedicare for All\u201d pushed her into a political no-man\u2019s land between the party\u2019s progressive and moderate factions. Biden, Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg attacked her from the right, while some on the left questioned Warren\u2019s plan to effectively break up the legislation into two pieces, a charge that damaged her standing with progressive voters. In addition to the online abuse aimed at its leaders, the WFP, a third party that got its start two decades ago in New York and has helped elect progressive down-ballot candidates around the country, also faced sharp criticism from reputable leftist voices over its decision to back Warren. The socialist magazine Jacobin reacted to news of the party\u2019s choice by declaring, \u201cThe Working Families Party Has Written Itself Out of History\u201d and argued that organization\u2019s \u201copaque presidential endorsement process signaled a rejection of not only Bernie Sanders but the movement emerging around him.\u201d The hard feelings also traced back to 2016, when Sanders, after endorsing Hillary Clinton, urged supporters before the general election to vote for the former secretary of state on the WFP ballot line. The party, he said then, represented \u201cthe closest thing there is to a political party that believes in my vision of democratic socialism.\u201d In a statement last September, when the WFP announced it was supporting Warren this time around, Mitchell praised both of the progressive leaders. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d But after a campaign that tested the decades-long alliance between Warren and Sanders, that \u201cpartnership\u201d appears to be in serious doubt. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, the group most closely aligned with Warren, has stopped short of issuing an outright endorsement. Instead, it sent an email to Michigan Democrats over the weekend urging them to vote for him \u201cstrategically\u201d in order \u201cto stop the premature ending of this primary election.\u201d \u201cElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders share many goals. If you love Bernie Sanders and his agenda, that\u2019s the best reason to vote for him,\u201d the PCCC wrote to supporters. \u201cAnd if you are a die-hard Joe Biden supporter, by all means vote your conscience.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is tying himself to former President Barack Obama in a new TV ad despite years of criticizing him and his administration. While Sanders frequently praised many aspects of Obama-era policies and defended the then-President\u2019s agenda from what he said was an obstructionist Republican Party, a CNN KFile review of Sanders\u2019 comments during Obama\u2019s years in office shows the Vermont senator was also sharply critical of the President. On at least four occasions, Sanders said it would be good for Obama to face a primary challenge while running for reelection in 2012. He challenged Obama from the left on discussions of cutting Social Security and Medicare. And he said Obama hadn\u2019t done enough on regulating Wall Street or improving healthcare. He also said Obama was wrong on trade policies. \u201cI think one of the reasons the President has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him,\u201d said Sanders in a July 2011 radio interview. \u201cAnd I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing.\u201d The Sanders campaign noted he was far from Obama\u2019s only left wing critic, flagging that progressive groups like MoveOn and the Progressive Campaign Change Committee also challenged Obama from the left on issues. Mike Casca, a Sanders campaign spokesman, said the senator was proud to work with President Barack Obama. \u201cBernie is proud of so many of the accomplishments of President Obama and his administration, which is why he fought hard to protect the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear deal from Donald Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d Casca told CNN in an email. Sanders underperformed in a series of contests last week that saw former Vice President Joe Biden surging. After years of criticism, Sanders and his campaign are now trying to signal they are aligned with Obama in an ad unveiled after Super Tuesday that features the former president praising him in 2016 and 2006. The ad, however, lacks context, according to a recent CNN fact check. In the ad, Obama praised Sanders for having \u201cthe virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless,\u201d though a transcript of the comments shows the ad omits Obama\u2019s admission that he didn\u2019t know Sanders as well since he didn\u2019t serve in his administration. Obama also exclaimed, \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d at the end of the ad, suggesting a possible endorsement from Obama. However, the exclamation was said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in an effort to get Sanders\u2019 supporters to vote for Clinton. Obama has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 election. The ad now signals a new direction for the Sanders campaign as it seeks to stop Biden\u2019s momentum from clinching the Democratic nomination. Even when defending Obama during his presidency, Sanders argued he wasn\u2019t a huge supporter of Obama. \u201cI\u2019m not Obama\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d Sanders said on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d in April 2013. \u201cI supported him, I\u2019m an independent, but I\u2019m critical of many aspects.\u201d Sanders, who worked with Obama on a host of issues, maintained that Obama was not a progressive, but instead a centrist in the Democratic Party. He said Obama hadn\u2019t stood up to extremism in the Republican Party. \u201cI think he\u2019s a pretty honest guy and the President as you may recall just a few weeks ago, said that if we were in the 1980s he would have been considered something like a moderate Republican,\u201d Sanders said on WNYC in 2013 after Obama had been elected to a second term. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the Democratic Party. But no, I don\u2019t think he is a progressive.\u201d \u201cI was very disappointed in terms of his unwillingness to be more aggressive in standing up to what has increasingly become a right wing extremist Republican Party,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cAnd he really hasn\u2019t, to my mind, done that effectively.\u201d Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire\u201d in 2013, Sanders\u2019 critiqued Obamacare, saying, though he voted for it, he wouldn\u2019t argue with someone who said it was too complicated. \u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI voted for Obamacare. But to be very honest with you, I\u2019m not going to argue with anybody who says that it is too complicated. I am an advocate of a \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 single payer program. I think Obamacare is a good Republican Romney type program, which has worked in Massachusetts. It\u2019s a moderate program which addresses some needs.\u201d One of Obama\u2019s biggest mistakes as president, Sanders said in September 2011, was abandoning his grassroots supporters and not following through on his campaign promises. \u201cIn terms of Wall Street, in terms of the economy, in terms of taxes, terms of civil liberties, the President has clearly been disappointing to many people and nowhere near as strong as we had hoped that he would be,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI believe he ran one of the greatest campaigns that I\u2019ve ever seen in my lifetime. He inspired people, galvanized people, brought people together,\u201d he added. \u201cBut for whatever reasons, he has not followed through with a lot of the issues that he discussed in his campaign and I think has not stood up to the right wing extremism that is so potent in Washington right now. And the answer was what you\u2019re asking is what do we do? Well, the only thing that I know to do is to rally the American people around the progressive agenda.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comment from the Sanders campaign.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is facing an uphill battle to win Elizabeth Warren\u2019s endorsement, as the Massachusetts senator continues her deliberations just days away from a potentially decisive round of primaries. Warren deflected questions about her plans Thursday, when she dropped out of the race, but her public comments about Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden that night added to concerns among movement progressives that she could either endorse Biden or sit out the contest. After a disappointing Super Tuesday, Sanders is in increasingly desperate need of a lift, as Biden continues to accumulate support not only from moderates, but more liberal lawmakers like Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, who endorsed him on Friday after initially backing Sen. Kamala Harris. A Warren endorsement would not guarantee that her base of support shifts to Sanders, but it could provide a shot of adrenaline to a campaign stuck on the wrong side of Biden\u2019s momentum. The Sanders and Warren campaigns have declined to comment on the substance of two conversations \u2013 one on Wednesday and another on Thursday \u2013 between the senators this week. But Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir acknowledged his team is seeking Warren\u2019s support. \u201cIt could be significant,\u201d Shakir told CNN. \u201cThere were many states where her impact on the race was crucial to the outcome. If she supported our campaign it has the potential to tip the balance in our favor.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Still, he was resigned to the fact that, after a long and occasionally fractious campaign, Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s decades-old alliance was in doubt \u2013 and that the time to repair it was running out. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept the relationship open and cordial from a staff all the way up to the principal level,\u201d Shakir said. \u201cWe respect her role in this process and believe that her vision for the country best aligns with Sen. Sanders, but the decision is up to her.\u201d But a year of occasionally pointed and personally fraught debates between the campaigns and the candidates has thrown the strength of Warren and Sanders\u2019 political bond into doubt. In January, after Sanders denied a report \u2013 and Warren\u2019s confirmation of it \u2013 that he told her, in a private 2018 conversation about the upcoming presidential election, that he didn\u2019t believe a woman could win, the tensions boiled over in public. At the end of a Democratic debate in Iowa, Warren refused to shake Sanders\u2019 hand and, the frustration evident in her voice, accused him of calling her \u201ca liar on national television.\u201d Some Sanders\u2019 supporters online accused Warren of playing to the cameras in order to keep the spotlight on the spat \u2013 a suggestion that still riles former members of Warren\u2019s team. \u201cThe people who think that that was intentional on our part \u2013 there\u2019s no way,\u201d one former Warren aide said. \u201cShe was genuinely offended. Bernie could have de-escalated and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry if she thought that\u2019s what I said. I didn\u2019t.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t even take a half step.\u201d Some of those raw feelings were apparent during Warren\u2019s Thursday night interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow. During their extended conversation, Warren offered little in the way of hope for Sanders\u2019 supporters as she gave her take on both the Vermont senator and Biden. What's next for Elizabeth Warren? Warren noted that she and Biden \u201cwere in the bankruptcy wars against each other,\u201d referencing their famous Capitol Hill clash over a 2005 bill that she vigorously opposed, but then pivoted to talk about her work with him during his time as vice president. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy,\u201d Warren said of Biden. \u201cAnd it comes through in pretty much everything he does,\u201d she added. Asked about some Sanders supporters\u2019 attacks on her earlier this year, Warren broadened the discussion to include similar incidents \u2013 including an eruption targeting the Working Families Party, after it endorsed her last year, and Nevada\u2019s Culinary Union, which was the subject of an angry online backlash after it put out fliers before the caucuses critical of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Though she and Sanders had spoken about the issue, Warren told Maddow, their conversation was \u201cshort.\u201d Pressed on whether he should be accountable for his supporters\u2019 behavior, Warren hesitated. \u201cYou know, I shouldn\u2019t speak for him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something he should speak for himself on.\u201d Sanders has condemned reports of harassment carried out by his backers, saying, \u201cAnybody making personal attacks against anybody else in my name is not part of our movement.\u201d He has also noted that Sanders\u2019 campaign officials have themselves been the subject of online abuse. But the tone on social media remains, in many cases, toxic. Despite their political affinity and, at the time, better personal relationship, Warren did not endorse Sanders in 2016. The Massachusetts senator, who was still in her first term at the time, had been the subject of a draft campaign that she ultimately turned down \u2013 a fateful decision that Sanders said led him to launch his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. Warren did not pick a side during that heated contest, only announcing that she would support Clinton in June 2016, after the contest was effectively over. With Sanders and Biden now in a one-on-one race that could turn nasty, Warren, who had pitched herself at points as a unity candidate over the last few months, might yet have a chance to do some peace-making \u2013 across the Democratic Party, but also among progressives. Why Warren supporters will split between Biden and Sanders If Warren were to endorse the former vice president, it would be a crushing blow to Sanders, but it could potentially guarantee her \u2013 and progressives \u2013 a position of influence in or around a Biden White House. Staying out of the contest for now could also leave the door open for Warren to play a key role in his administration. For leaders on the left, the prospect of Warren either swinging to Biden or remaining on the sidelines as the primary hits another crucial stretch has been a source of growing concern. Warren's decision to end campaign sets off a contest for her endorsement Ana Maria Archila, the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders through its political arm last December but remains close with Warren, contemplated the fallout if Warren chooses not to endorse Sanders. \u201cIt would be a sign of real deterioration, of a real fracturing of the movement. And I hope that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Archila said. \u201cAt the staff and base level, the people who endorsed Bernie and the people who endorsed Warren \u2013 we see each other as very much a part of the same movement and aligned around the same purpose. Shakir said he believed that, in the end, those relationships lead to a political reconciliation. \u201cEven when we had disagreements and when our policy views differed, at the end of the day we always figured that both sides knew that we would eventually have to come together,\u201d he told CNN. But with each passing day, that prospect now seems increasingly unlikely.",

            "article_content": "Chasten Buttigieg was fighting back tears. As Pete Buttigieg\u2019s husband addressed an audience of campaign supporters, family and friends gathered here in South Bend late Monday night, he told those gathered that, when his husband, their mayor, first asked what he thought about a presidential run, he laughed. And then he reflected on their still-young marriage. \u201cPete got me to fall in love with myself again,\u201d Chasten Buttigieg reflected. \u201cAnd I told Pete to run, because I knew there were other kids sitting out there in this country, who needed to believe in themselves too.\u201d \u201cYou changed lives!\u201d a supporter shouted. \u201cYes, we did,\u201d Buttigieg replied, getting choked up. \u201cTogether.\u201d And then, for the first time in American history, a presidential candidate took the stage, kissed his husband and ended his campaign. The moment was a fitting coda to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s historic campaign, one that both tested the nation\u2019s still evolving acceptance of LGBTQ Americans and represented a giant leap forward in the eyes of scores of those inspired by Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy. When he announced his candidacy last year, people who\u2019d heard of the millennial mayor at all struggled to pronounce his name, recognizing him largely from a failed 2017 bid to lead the Democratic National Committee. South Bend, the fourth largest city in Indiana, was better known for the neighboring University of Notre Dame than for presidential politics. But for LGBTQ Americans, who only nationally gained the right to marry in 2015 and still face the threat of workplace discrimination for their sexual orientation or gender identity, Buttigieg was more than a longshot candidate from a mid-level midwestern city \u2013 he was a presidential contender of their very own. From the start, Buttigieg\u2019s sexual orientation and faith set him apart from the standard Democratic presidential hopeful \u2013 and especially his ability to square the two seemingly contradictory aspects of his identity. At a CNN town hall in March 2019, he addressed both, creating a national moment largely credited with catapulting the mayor from obscurity to ubiquity. During the town hall, Buttigieg, an Episcopalian, tore into Vice President Mike Pence for tying his conservative views on same-sex marriage to his faith. \u201cHis interpretation of Scripture is pretty different from mine,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cHis has a lot more to do with sexuality and, I don\u2019t know, a certain view of rectitude. Even if you buy into that, how could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency?\u201d Buttigieg then paused for a moment before going in for the kill. \u201cIs it that he stopped believing in Scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump?\u201d That answer, and the rest of his town hall performance, caught fire, earning him praise from across the political spectrum and netting him $600,000 in donations from 22,200 unique donors, a haul that expedited the campaign\u2019s progress toward qualifying for the debates set for that summer. But Buttigieg\u2019s momentum surprised gay voters the most \u2013 voters like Robert Moore of Dallas, Texas. \u201cRemember, marriage equality came pretty recently, you know, and it\u2019s a big jump from we can get married and be private citizens and be on our own, to being president of the United States,\u201d Moore told CNN in February. \u201cAnd this is somebody that they are wanting to embrace, and not just embrace, but put up to lead them? That\u2019s a whole different game.\u201d Perhaps more significantly, it signaled a new way to counter arguments against LGBTQ equality from the religious right \u2013 with an appeal equally grounded in religion from the left. A month later, Buttigieg would take his argument a step further, lambasting Pence at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch: \u201cIf me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand,\u201d Buttigieg said, to rapturous applause from the predominantly LGBTQ audience. \u201cThat if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me \u2013 your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\u201d The candidate\u2019s move to embrace religion baffled the religious right, who\u2019d never seen a Democratic presidential candidate lay claim to the language of faith in such terms, much less a gay one, and the subject would grow to become central to his stump speech, deployed before audiences with a wide array of religious beliefs or lack thereof. If he faced President Donald Trump in the general election, Buttigieg mused, he\u2019d do so \u201cinsisting that this country belongs to people of every religion and of no religion equally,\u201d reaching out \u201cto fellow believers with the reminder that God does not belong to a political party in the United States of America.\u201d But Buttigieg\u2019s appeal to moderates on religion would prove representative of a larger theme throughout his campaign. In attempting to expand the Democratic Party tent to independents and Republicans fleeing Trump, Buttigieg enraged a vocal, progressive wing of the Democratic base, who accused the mayor of compromising party ideals for votes in purple states. On issues from \u201cMedicare for All\u201d to preserving tax-exempt status for religious institutions opposing gay marriage, Buttigieg\u2019s stances put him at odds with pockets of his own community, not just his primary opponents. \u201cMayor Pete is leaning on the support and actively courting the LGBTQ2IA community, but has shown time and time again that he is out of touch, not fit to be President of the United States, and simply falls short,\u201d a collective of queer individuals identifying themselves as \u201cQueers Against Pete\u201d wrote in a January open letter criticizing Buttigieg\u2019s positions on a number of issues. \u201cSome have touted former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s openly gay identity as proof of progress in our politics. However, being gay is not enough to earn the support of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual (LGBTQ2IA) communities.\u201d In photos: Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg By the time Buttigieg suspended his campaign this month, the letter would garner 4,314 signatures, just one in a series of critiques from LGBTQ voices that posited the first gay candidate for president to win delegates inadequately represented them. Headlines like \u201cWhy Pete Buttigieg is bad for gays\u201d and \u201cHeterosexuality Without Women\u201d became commonplace. Even an essay from The New Republic titled \u201cMy Mayor Pete Problem,\u201d which the publication ultimately removed following widespread outcry, centered on the same idea: While Buttigieg may have been a pioneer in his success as a gay candidate for president, when it came to the question of if he represented the gay community writ large, a corner of the community found him wanting. It\u2019s something they would repeatedly make clear, interrupting private fundraisers and releasing a statement within minutes of reports of the end of his campaign, \u201c#QueersAgainstPete welcomes the news that former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is suspending his campaign.\u201d If such criticisms got to Buttigieg, though, he showed little sign of it. In an interview with radio host Clay Cane in September, he dismissed critiques from LGBTQ media, telling Cane, \u201cIt\u2019s tough for me to know, right, because I just am what I am, and you know, there\u2019s going to be a lot of that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t even read the LGBT media anymore, because it\u2019s all, \u2018he\u2019s too gay,\u2019 \u2018not gay enough,\u2019 \u2018wrong kind of gay,\u2019 like, oh jeez.\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAll I know is life became a lot easier when I just started allowing myself to be myself, and I\u2019ll let other people write up whether I\u2019m \u2018too this\u2019 or \u2018too that.\u2019\u201d The anti-Buttigieg sentiment in the LGBTQ community also rankled Buttigieg\u2019s gay supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re demanding too much,\u201d said Jerry Birdwell, a Texas voter who traveled to New Hampshire to observe the primary process there last month. \u201cI personally think that if they make a comment like that, he\u2019s not gay enough, so to speak \u2013 that\u2019s absurd\u2026we\u2019re looking for a man that\u2019s going to represent the country, and he is the type of person who, his sexuality has nothing to do with his ability to run a campaign and to serve.\u201d While detractors would continue to paint him as too centrist or inadequately queer, by the time the Democratic primary reached November 2019, Buttigieg had begun to talk more about the issue he\u2019d come to see as central to his campaign: The need to restore a sense of belonging. \u201cIf talking about hope and belonging sounds optimistic for a time like this, fine, then call it optimistic, but do not call it na\u00efve, because I believe in these things not based on my age, but based on my experience,\u201d Buttigieg told an audience gathered in Des Moines for Iowa\u2019s premiere Democratic political event of the year. Before thousands of Iowa Democrats, he drew a direct line between the case for a Buttigieg presidency and his own LGBTQ experience. \u201cI have seen what America can do, and so have you. After all, you\u2019re looking at someone who, as a young man growing up, wondered if something deep inside of him meant that he would forever be an outsider, would never wear the uniform, never be accepted, never know love,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd now you are looking at that same young man, a veteran, a mayor, happily married, asking for you to vote for president of the United States.\u201d On the trail, Buttigieg took care to always note that while the LGBTQ community has made strides, there remained a great deal of work left to do. And he didn\u2019t gloss over that truth either, especially in Iowa, where, a week before the caucuses, he confessed that while he was \u201cobviously thrilled by the progress that brought me the right to marry,\u201d the idea that marriage equality \u201cmeant the struggle for equality was, you know, done\u201d is \u201cjust not true.\u201d Former US Rep Barney Frank, the first member of Congress in a same-sex marriage, agrees with Buttigieg\u2019s view, but  thinks history will view Buttigieg\u2019s unsuccessful bid for president as historic in its own right. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important moments in American history, not just of the LGBT issues,\u201d Frank told CNN in an interview after Buttigieg ended his campaign. \u201cIt is a sign that the prejudice against sexual minorities has diminished even more than we had thought. \u2026 It further advances the fight against prejudice, because he was so good at it, being so articulate and doing as well as he did.\u201d What's Pete Buttigieg going to do next? \u201cHe not only benefited from the diminution of prejudice, he furthered it by his own very good performance,\u201d Frank, who\u2019s been on the forefront of LGBTQ equality since the Stonewall riots, continued. If Buttigieg\u2019s run meant America saw more widespread acceptance for the LGBTQ community, it carried even more weight for those Americans who saw themselves in the presidential hopeful. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d have a gay candidate for president in our lifetime, no,\u201d said Paul King, who attended Buttigieg\u2019s rally in Raleigh, North Carolina with his husband, J.D. Brickhouse, just one day before Buttigieg would drop out of the race. \u201cBut I never thought we\u2019d have civil rights in our lifetime either. It means a lot. Nobody who hasn\u2019t experienced growing up gay in America would understand how much that means.\u201d \u201cWhat does it mean? I\u2019m having the chance to vote for a gay man for president,\u201d Brickhouse chimed in bluntly. For Annise Parker of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which seeks to elect LGBTQ candidates up and down the ballot, Buttigieg\u2019s candidacy filled a more urgent need. \u201cI believe that he literally saved lives,\u201d Parker, president and CEO of the group, told CNN Thursday. \u201cWe still have a horrible problem with internalized homophobia and suicide, leading to suicide within our community, and by seeing Pete there doing so well and speaking directly to disenfranchised young people, I know he had an outsized impact for them. I know what all of our candidates and elected officials do for younger LGBT people and how they provide hope, how they provide inspiration. He did that on steroids.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s run also afforded LGBTQ Americans a once unimaginable national visibility. And 9-year-old Zachary Ro of Lone Tree, Colorado, used his one chance to ask Buttigieg a question to enlist the former mayor\u2019s help in coming out to the world. \u201cThank you for being so brave,\u201d Ro wrote in a submitted question before a Denver rally in February. \u201cWould you help me tell the world I\u2019m gay too? I want to be brave like you.\u201d Later at the rally, as Ro approached the stage, the crowd of hundreds whipped themselves into a frenzy of cheers and encouragement, high-fiving the boy and chanting, \u201cLove is love!\u201d \u201cYou will never know who\u2019s taking their lead from you, who\u2019s watching you and deciding that they can be a little braver, because you have been brave,\u201d Buttigieg told the 9-year old, visibly moved. \u201cWhen I was trying to figure out who I was, I was afraid that who I was might mean that I could never make a difference. And what wound up happening instead, is that it\u2019s a huge part of the difference I get to make.\u201d Then, as if to set an intention, the former mayor looked the boy in the eye and shared the lesson he\u2019d learned from over a year of criss-crossing the country as a candidate for president. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know whose life you might be affecting right now, just by standing here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this story.",

Deval Patrick on Friday joined several other former 2020 presidential candidates in endorsing Joe Biden for president. \u201cAt a time when our democracy is at risk, our economy is not working for many Americans, and our role in the world is unsteady, America needs a unifying and experienced leader, who can and wants to make life better for everyone everywhere. Joe Biden is that leader,\u201d Patrick said in a statement provided by the Biden campaign.

He joins former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney in endorsing Biden this week. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke endorsed Biden on Monday, right before the Super Tuesday contests. Biden surged after his blowout win in South Carolina, and the Democratic centrist establishment has consolidated around the former vice president. CNN projected Biden would win 10 out of 14 states on Super Tuesday, including a dramatic upset victory in\u00a0Texas\u00a0and surprise wins in\u00a0Minnesota\u00a0and\u00a0Massachusetts. Patrick said that when he was governor of Massachusetts he worked closely with Biden, who was vice president at the time. \u201cI saw firsthand Joe\u2019s essential role in passing historic health care reform, saving the American auto industry and our country from another depression, leading our troops home from war, and championing historic civil rights and LGBTQ equality,\u201d Patrick said. He praised Biden\u2019s work on a number of other issues, and called the candidate a \u201cgenuinely caring and compassionate person.\u201d Patrick ended his own late-entry presidential bid in February after a disappointing performance in the New Hampshire primary.

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren has another decision to make. The Massachusetts Democrat is out of the presidential race, but her role in shaping its outcome is far from over. With just a few days now until another round of crucial primaries, she has reclaimed the spotlight as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden vie for her support. But as Warren made clear during a news conference outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday, she will not rush into the hopeful arms of either camp. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cI need some space around this, and I want to take a little time to think a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been spending a lot of time right now on the question of suspending and making sure that this works as best we can for our staff, for our team, for our volunteers.\u201d Endorsing Sanders might seem to be the natural choice, given their largely overlapping political messages. But the bruises of the campaign season, which included a very personal confrontation between the candidates in January, have not yet faded and a once-strong relationship appears frayed. Warren\u2019s deliberation could also be impacted by the trajectory of the race, with Biden reclaiming his front-runner status after a romp in South Carolina last Saturday and a series of surprising wins on Super Tuesday. If Warren were to endorse the former vice president, it would be a crushing blow to Sanders, but it could potentially guarantee her \u2013 and progressives \u2013 a position of influence in or around a Biden White House. Elizabeth Warren defines the gender trap Warren and Sanders have spoken twice over the past two days, according to his recent comments \u2013 once on Wednesday and again, he said, on Thursday before she gave her farewell news conference. Warren and Biden had a call on Wednesday. But all parties have been tight-lipped about the contents of those conversations. Sanders\u2019 campaign staff, during what turned out to be the final days of Warren\u2019s campaign, were careful not to be seen pressuring her to drop out or soliciting her support. That posture has been reflected by influential progressive groups that, despite their obvious hope Warren will throw her support to Sanders, have been cautious in publicly lobbying her. \u201cElizabeth Warren is a champion of the progressive movement who has a number of supporters, who voted for Bernie in 2016, who will likely decide today that they\u2019re going to vote for Bernie going forward,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, from the progressive group Justice Democrats. \u201cAnd then she has another part of her base that voted for Hillary in 2016, who are likely still undecided.\u201d An endorsement of Sanders, he said, \u201cwould go a long way\u201d in driving the fence-sitters into the Vermont senator\u2019s camp. There has been a quiet \u2013 by social media standards \u2013 debate on the left for months now, since Warren began to plummet in the polls toward the end of 2019, over whether her presence in the race hurt or helped Sanders, a political ally for decades. The demographic makeup of Warren\u2019s support, which skews toward white, college-educated suburbanites, suggests that Sanders \u2013 who struggles with that cohort \u2013 will not enjoy a ready-made boost following her exit. But there is a countervailing belief that if Warren were to go all-in for Sanders, she could help bridge that gap and deliver new energy to his stagnating movement. That viewpoint \u2013 and desire \u2013 was voiced by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar late on Tuesday night as the force of the Biden surge, powered in part by the coalescing of moderate former candidates around him, became clear. \u201cImagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated,\u201d tweeted Omar, a Sanders supporter and surrogate, \u201cwho would have won? That\u2019s what we should be analyzing. I feel confident a united progressive movement would have allowed for us to #BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost.\u201d The liberal Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last September, is also planning its next move. In a statement Thursday, it praised her campaign and made no mention of Sanders \u2013 or anyone else. \u201cThe contest is poorer for Senator Warren\u2019s exit,\u201d Working Families Party national director Maurice Mitchell said in a statement. \u201cIt has been an honor to be a part of this fight with Elizabeth. Her presidential campaign may be over, but the fight for her vision of big, structural change continues.\u201d Senior Working Families Party officials have remained in regular contact with Warren\u2019s team, but a spokesman for the party declined to characterize the content of those discussions. While the political world keeps its eyes on Warren, Sanders didn\u2019t have to wait long to win the support of activist Ady Barkan, who endorsed Warren in November. Barkan, who has ALS, is a respected progressive grassroots leader. In a tweet, he credited Sanders with doing \u201cmore than anyone else to build the movement for \u2018Medicare for All.\u2019 \u201c \u201cBut, of course, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about us,\u201d Barkan wrote, echoing Sanders\u2019 campaign slogan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren spoke for millions of women on Thursday when asked what role gender played in her presidential campaign. \u201cYou know, that is the trap question for women,\u201d she replied, speaking to cameras outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as she bowed out of the race. \u201cIf you say, \u2018Yeah \u2013 there was sexism in this race,\u2019 everyone says, \u2018Whiner.\u2019 And if you say, \u2018No, there was no sexism,\u2019 about a bazillion women think, \u2018What planet do you live on?\u2019\u201d It was a succinct analysis of this unsettled moment for women in America. And it came on a day when many female voters felt a profound sense of sadness, in part because it will be another four years before a woman has a shot at the White House. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The reality sinking in Thursday was that \u2013 after a record number of women declared their candidacies \u2013 the Democratic Party\u2019s standard bearer will now be one of two white men in their 70s. The eventual Democratic nominee will take on Donald Trump, a President with a history of crude banter and demeaning statements about women who has been accused of a range of criminal sexual behavior, including multiple assaults, and rape. He has denied all of them. The irony of that outcome of male dominance in 2020 carried a sharp sting in this dawning age of female empowerment \u2013 when the #MeToo Movement has reshaped office politics and put Harvey Weinstein behind bars; when women voters sent record-breaking numbers of female lawmakers to Congress, leading to Democrats taking back the House; when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can embody girl power by towering over a table of White House suits pointing an accusatory finger at the President. California Sen. Kamala Harris clearly felt it, telling reporters on Capitol Hill that this election cycle has \u201cpresented very legitimate questions about the challenges of women running for president of the United States.\u201d \u201cLook at what\u2019s happened \u2013 there are no women currently in this race,\u201d the one-time 2020 contender said, omitting Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is still running, but has barely registered in the polls and almost certainly won\u2019t win the nomination. \u201cWe can have a longer discussion about it, but the reality is that there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done to make it very clear that women are exceptionally qualified and capable of being the commander-in-chief of the United States of America.\u201d The fresh debate over the role sexism played in Warren\u2019s exit raged on social media, just as it did when Harris left the race in December, when New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand got out last summer and when Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar departed on Monday. \u201cThis is so heartbreaking, and it feels so damn personal,\u201d writer Jill Filipovic, the author of \u201cThe H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness\u201d said on Twitter. \u201cHow many times, in how many contexts, have we seen a smart, competent, dynamic woman who is so head & shoulders above everyone else in the room get ignored or pushed out? How many times have we wondered - was I that woman?\u201d On the trail, Warren cut a particularly steely and unflappable profile as she sought to inspire legions of little girls and young women to seek the highest office in the land. The Massachusetts senator changed the trajectory of the race with her fierce and unsparing evisceration of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on the debate stage, flattening his candidacy and paving the way for Joe Biden\u2019s resurgence. Her embrace of facts, organization and plans \u2013 at once feminine and groundbreaking \u2013 catapulted her to the top of the polls in the summer and early fall of 2019. And the early hallmark of her presidential campaign was her insistence on dropping to one knee each time she met a little girl to make a pact. \u201cI\u2019m running for president because that\u2019s what girls do,\u201d she would say before making a \u201cpinky promise\u201d with her young follower to remember. But beneath that veneer of optimism about what the next generation should expect, all of the women who ran for president this cycle saw the darker and more complicated side of sexism in America. As a reporter, one rarely encountered men or women who said they wouldn\u2019t vote for a woman or believed that a woman couldn\u2019t handle the job. Instead what we heard, too many times to count, from both women and men \u2013 including those at Warren events \u2013 was the concern that they didn\u2019t think \u201cother people\u201d or \u201cthe country\u201d or \u201cTrump supporters\u201d would vote for a woman. It was a worry that pervaded Warren\u2019s candidacy, eroding confidence in her chances against Trump at a time when each candidate\u2019s odds against the President was the thing that mattered most to the majority of Democratic voters. After leaving the race, Klobuchar told The New York Times she has \u201coften stepped back and wondered, well, is it \u2013 were they looking for a man to run against Donald Trump? Maybe in another election. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Klobuchar said she\u2019s sure a woman will be elected president in her lifetime \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not even a close call,\u201d she added. The debate over all the forces stacked against female candidates came into sharp focus in January, when CNN reported a December 2018 meeting between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Warren. She laid out the reasons why she believed she would be a strong candidate. According to the accounts of four people \u2013 two people Warren spoke with directly after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting \u2013 Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. After that report was published, Warren confirmed the meeting and Sanders denied it. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,\u201d he said. Warren made unforced errors \u2013 namely the bumpy rollout of her plan to enact \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 that hurt her candidacy. But just like Harris and Klobuchar, the undertow of gender was the force she couldn\u2019t control. She and the other female candidates labored to change that perception. \u201cIf you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,\u201d Klobuchar said at the November debate. And at the January one, Warren added up the losing records of the men on stage and compared them to the winning records of the women there. Ultimately, it wasn\u2019t enough. No matter how many times Biden showed the weakness of his candidacy or his inability to excite crowds in Iowa and New Hampshire, some voters reasoned that he\u2019d still be a tougher candidate against Trump because of his maleness. And as much as voters praised the female candidates for their readiness to take on Trump, some would almost protectively confess that they didn\u2019t want to watch Warren or Harris or Klobuchar go through what Hillary Clinton did. 'Hillary' reminds us of all the feminist progress -- as well as the remaining pain They would remember the way Trump loomed threateningly behind Clinton on the debate stage; how he accused Clinton of playing the \u201cwoman card\u201d; or how he trotted out the women who accused Clinton\u2019s husband of infidelity to intimidate her during an event hours before one of the Democratic debates. Trump\u2019s tactics in 2016 were so grating to Democratic voters that they got their own descriptor. During an April 2019 CNN town hall in New Hampshire, Harvard University student Ellie Taylor asked Warren how she\u2019d avoid \u201cgetting Hillary-d\u201d \u2013 which Taylor defined as getting \u201cheld to a higher standard than your opponent for potentially arbitrary or maybe even sexist reasons.\u201d Warren answered the question by recalling that she started her \u201cpinky promise\u201d tradition when she was running for the US Senate, at a time when well-meaning colleagues and wise men had told her a woman couldn\u2019t win that race. (She won.) She\u2019d endure all the gendered observations about what she was wearing, her demeanor, her hair, her voice and \u201cwhether or not I smile enough.\u201d Warren said she started doing the pinky promises because she wanted to \u201cmake something count every single day\u201d as she tried to win the race. No matter how badly the day went, she would go home and count up the tally of pinky promises. \u201cYou stay after it every day, one might say you persist,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The tables can turn so quickly in politics. A party that last week was literally freaking out about Sen. Bernie Sanders potentially locking up the nomination on Super Tuesday has this week coalesced around former Vice President Joe Biden, with voters across the country picking him as the centrist option and rivals rushing to out of the way. What Biden accomplished. He got fourth in Iowa. He got fifth in New Hampshire. He got second in Nevada. Now, 11 days after his campaign appeared to lack a pulse, he\u2019s been reanimated as the delegate leader in the race. Joementum eclipses Bill Clinton\u2019s notorious 1992 Comeback Kid moment. It is the \u201cbiggest, fastest and most unbelievable comeback in modern political history,\u201d as CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson wrote Wednesday. How did Biden do it? What animated this remarkable surge may have more to do with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders than it does with Biden \u2013 although Biden\u2019s unique strength in South Carolina and among black voters started the domino effect, pushing moderate rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar out of the race ahead of the first multi-state primary wave. The driving force on Super Tuesday was a strong desire, particularly among older voters, to beat President Trump. Look at the numbers: Turnout was up. In almost every state where it\u2019s possible to compare primary results with 2016, more voters showed up Tuesday. The exception? Oklahoma, where turnout was down. We still don\u2019t know about California, where mail-in ballots will keep trickling in for days. It was up significantly in some states \u2013 more than 68% in Virginia, 40% in Texas and 37% in Tennessee. It was up less so but still up in states like North Carolina (15%) and Massachusetts (8%). Older people dominated. The exit polls show voting was dominated by older people, as it usually is. Voters over the age of 45 were close to two-thirds of primarygoers everywhere (more than 60% in some places and closer to 70% in others). Older people are more interested in beating Trump. Older voters, according to the exit polls, are more likely to say that beating Trump is more important than choosing a candidate that agrees with them on the issues. So Biden benefited from all those older voters who would prefer to beat Trump and Sanders depended on a smaller pool of younger voters who wanted a candidate who agreed with them. Where Sanders dropped. The senator from Vermont also lost support among independents and white non-college-educated voters vs. his 2016 performance. I wrote more about that here: 2020 Bernie Sanders is losing to 2016 Bernie Sanders. Biden\u2019s lane is clear. Suddenly the left lane is more crowded than the middle. All of the middle-lane Democrats have now dropped out (including, on Wednesday, the billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg), so it is Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on the left and Biden in the middle for now. (CNN\u2019s Lauren Dezenski, Gregory Krieg and MJ Lee report that Warren is assessing her campaign, which is code for figuring out how to get out elegantly and deciding who, if anyone, to endorse.) Turns out you can\u2019t buy votes. Re: Bloomberg, read this from CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten: Bloomberg and Steyer spent three quarters of a billion dollars on the primary. Voters didn\u2019t care. Biden hadn\u2019t even campaigned in a number of the states he won and has not generated nearly the buzz or excitement Sanders has. But consider this: Sanders held a rally in Boston with more than 10,000 people on Saturday. Warren is from there. So is Bloomberg, originally. Biden didn\u2019t hold any events in Massachusetts \u2013 and he won the state. In 2016, we talked about \u201cshy\u201d Trump voters \u2013 people who voted for Trump but wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it publicly. Now we appear to be seeing Biden benefit from a wave of support from people who aren\u2019t showing up at rallies or on Twitter but do show up to vote. History time: President Richard Nixon used the term \u201cgreat silent majority\u201d when he appealed for calm in the face of nationwide protests during Vietnam. At the time his administration was engaged in peace talks in Paris and he was looking to set a vocal minority against what he viewed as the mass of the country. And he used the occasion of the speech to disclose his secret peace dealings directly with Vietnam through the Soviets. And so tonight - to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans - I ask for your support. \u2026 Let us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that. Watch this on C-SPAN from November of 1969. The senator from Vermont has promised over and over again that he\u2019ll get elected with help from young voters, who will benefit from his ambitious plans to uproot the health insurance and tax systems and create a much more generous government. So this was a telling moment at Sanders\u2019 news conference Wednesday in Burlington, Vermont: Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in and the answer is no, we\u2019re making some progress, but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in. I think that will change in the general election but I am honest \u2013 being honest with you. We have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process. It is not easy. He also made clear at that news conference that he\u2019s going to turn on Biden\u2019s very long Washington record. There was actually a very long list of things Sanders mentioned as ripe for scrutiny: So it\u2019s about to get real for Democrats. Biden faced scrutiny early in the campaign. But then the focus turned to Bloomberg and Sanders. The lens is about to swing back around. Sanders said he\u2019s going to be respectful. He likes Biden and he doesn\u2019t want a \u201cTrump-type effort where we\u2019re attacking each other, where it\u2019s personal attacks.\u201d Rather, said Sanders, \u201cJoe has his ideas, his record, his vision for the future. I have mine, and I look forward to a serious debate on the serious issues facing this country. And I would hope that the media will help us do that, allow that kind of debate to take place.\u201d Reminder: The next Democratic debate, hosted by CNN and Univision, is scheduled for March 15 in Arizona. Trump and Republicans, in a wash, rinse, repeat of 2016, have tried to suggest \u2013 echoing some Sanders supporters \u2013 that the process is rigged against Sanders. And Senate Republicans are ramping up their investigations into Joe Biden and Burisma \u2013 the exact topic Rudy Giuliani and other allies were investigating on Trump\u2019s behalf in Ukraine, setting in motion the events that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that Biden and his son Hunter acted corruptly in Ukraine, and Biden has said the actions he took had nothing to do with his son. One more thing that happened Wednesday: Trump tweeted about his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who on Tuesday moved to a runoff in Alabama for the Senate seat he vacated to take the job with Trump \u2013 despite advice from the President\u2019s allies to avoid commenting on the Sessions race, CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reported. \u201cThis is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn\u2019t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to the Mueller investigation into his 2016 campaign. The American system of government has been challenged to deal\u00a0with a singular President and a\u00a0divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House. Stay tuned as we keep\u00a0watch\u00a0over the Trump administration,\u00a0the 2020 presidential campaign and other issues of critical interest.",

            "article_content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the 2020 presidential race Thursday, ending a once front-running bid that never achieved its sky-high potential once voting actually began. \u201cI refuse to let disappointment blind me \u2013 or you \u2013 to what we\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Warren told her campaign staff on a conference call Thursday morning. \u201cWe didn\u2019t reach our goal, but what we have done together \u2013 what you have done \u2013 has made a lasting difference. It\u2019s not the scale of the difference we wanted to make, but it matters. And the changes will have ripples for years to come.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Warren\u2019s decision to leave the race came after a series of disappointing finishes. She placed third in the Iowa caucuses and fourth in the New Hampshire primary. She was fourth again in Nevada and fifth again in South Carolina. Super Tuesday was also a major disappointment; Warren didn\u2019t win a single state and placed third in her home state of Massachusetts. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race After such a series of disappointing showings, the only question after Super Tuesday was when Warren would get out. (The only other question was, would Warren endorse anyone on the way out; she did not.) But with the logistics of when/how Warren will end her campaign now out of the way, a bigger question arises: Why didn\u2019t she do better? After all, as recently as the early fall of 2019, Warren was among the favorites \u2013 if not the favorite \u2013 for the nomination. And yet she won zero states and left the race with just 37 delegates. Answering the \u201cwhat happened\u201d question is never a simple thing. Voters make up their minds for lots of different reasons \u2013 some of which they are willing to articulate and some they simply won\u2019t. But generally speaking, there seem to be three reasons why Warren didn\u2019t get to where she wanted to go. (These are in no particular order.) 1) She peaked too soon: If the Iowa caucuses were October 3, Warren could have won going away. National polling around that time captures Warren\u2019s summer and early fall surge. On October 8, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Warren actually passed former Vice President Joe Biden. But that was the high point for Warren. She never went any higher, watching as her support dropped both nationally and in key early states like Iowa and New Hampshire as the actual votes neared. That decline led to Warren looking like a bad bet or a risky stock in the eyes of lots of voters. And people \u2013 all people \u2013 like to be for a winner, or at least someone who they think has a realistic chance to win. When votes started to be cast, that wasn\u2019t Warren. 2) She tried to be more than just a liberal: In announcing her decision to get out, Warren made clear that she was told at the start of the race that there was an incumbent in the liberal lane (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) and an incumbent in the moderate lane (Biden). And that there were only two lanes to run in. Warren had said she believed that analysis was wrong, but in the end, she said Thursday that she turned out to be wrong. Voters in the two lanes of the Democratic Party have now coalesced around Biden in the center and Sanders on the left. You can track Warren\u2019s slide in polling relatively directly to her decision to kind of, sort of walk away from her previously full-throated support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a program that Sanders has long championed that would eliminate the private health insurance industry entirely in favor of a government-run plan. After struggling for weeks to answer her critics\u2019 questions about whether she fully backed Sanders\u2019 plan and how she would fund it, Warren released her own detailed plan that tried to find a middle ground between Sanders and Biden on the issue. It failed \u2013 angering liberals who thought she was walking away from her principles in hopes of appearing more attractive to general election voters and not satisfying more moderate voters who still thought the plan went too far. 3) Sexism: This is an indisputable fact: We have had 44 presidents and not one of them has been a woman. Coincidence? Probably not. How much did the fact that Warren is a woman and ran on an unapologetically feminist platform for president affect the outcome? It\u2019s almost impossible to know, but it\u2019s equally impossible to think it had no role in how voters perceived her. Asked about the role her gender played in the race on Thursday, Warren responded this way: \u201cThat is the trap question for every woman. If you say yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says, \u2018Whiner.\u2019 And if you say no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, \u2018What planet do you live on?\u2019\u201d She added that she would \u201chave a lot more to say on that subject later on.\u201d Again, how much each of these factors played into Warren\u2019s inability to turn her momentum over the summer into actual votes in Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond is very difficult to say. But there\u2019s little doubt that each of them were part of voters\u2019 calculations as they decided who to be for \u2013 and who not be for \u2013 by the time votes actually happened.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden swept to victories across southern states on Super Tuesday, but Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led in the biggest delegate reserve of the primary season: California. Biden won a majority of black voters in states across the South, like Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, and handily defeated Sanders among older and more moderate voters there. Black voters had propelled Biden to victory in the South Carolina primary on Saturday. But Sanders opened up a wide lead among Latino voters in California, winning a majority in preliminary exit polls compared to only 2 in 10 for Biden. Latinos made up 3 in 10 voters in the state. Sanders also led among white voters in California, who made up a majority of the voters statewide. Biden won black voters, but they made up fewer than 1 in 10 voters in California. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The 415 delegates at stake in California make up more than 10% of all the delegates available nationwide in the entire primary season. Biden\u2019s strength among older voters and more moderate voters showed across the South. He won three-quarters of voters over 65 years old in Virginia and Alabama, and a majority of that age group in North Carolina. In both Virginia and North Carolina, Biden handily won voters whose biggest priority is to unite the Democratic Party, with almost two-thirds of that group supporting him as the nominee in both states. Biden also drew large majorities of those who want a rewind. Around half of voters in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama said they wanted to return to the policies of former President Barack Obama, and Biden won three-quarters of those voters in Virginia and Alabama, as well as nearly six in 10 of them in Tennessee and North Carolina. Still, in California, Sanders won more than 7 in 10 voters under age 30, and he won liberal voters by a nearly 3-to-1 margin over Biden. A majority of California Democratic primary voters called for an overhaul of the economic system in the United States, expressing support for single-payer health care and free college. A majority said they had a favorable view of socialism. Biden, however, continued to show strength among older voters in California, winning voters over 65 by a 2-to-1 margin. Sanders won his home state of Vermont by a broad margin thanks to support among liberals and young voters, winning about seven in 10 of each group. He also won Colorado, earning the support of a majority of very liberal voters. Sanders had also been leading in pre-election polls in the delegate-rich state of California. Here\u2019s what else the exit polls tell us. Three quarters of voters in Texas decided who to support for the Democratic nomination before the last few days. Texas voters who decided who to support in the last few days broke for Biden, with around half of the group supporting him while Sanders drew around a third of those who made up their minds earlier. Around half of Minnesota voters decided who to support in the last few days \u2013 and half of those went for Biden, a sign that he benefited from home Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s decision to drop out of the Democratic on Monday. In Virginia, nearly half of Democratic primary voters said that they made up their minds about whom to support in the last few days before voting. In North Carolina, where about a third of votes were likely cast before Tuesday\u2019s voting, nearly 3 in 10 still said they made up their minds in the last few days. About 4 in 10 in each state said they made up their minds before early voting began in early February. In both states, white voters were more likely to say they made up their minds in the last few days than were black voters, including a majority of white voters in Virginia. Most black voters in both states said they had decided on their choice before February. As in other states, exit polls show black Democratic primary voters in Texas heavily favored Joe Biden, with roughly 6 in 10 supporting the former vice president \u2013 but blacks make up only about a fifth of the Texas electorate. Sanders, on the other hand, drew more than 4 in 10 Hispanics, who account for just under a third of the Texas primary electorate. Voters in the Lone Star State also split by age group, giving Biden a way to make up the difference. He was heavily favored by voters over 45, who made up about two-thirds of the Democratic electorate, while those under 45 went for Sanders. As in early Democratic nominating contests, majorities of Democratic voters in every Super Tuesday state said they would prefer a nominee who can beat Trump over one with whom they agree on the issues. South Carolina has been the lowest state where exit polls have been conducted to prioritize beating Trump over agreeing on the issues, 53% who want a nominee who can beat the President in November. Deep red states still have a majority who prefer someone who can beat Trump, like in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Virginia where around 3 in 5 say so. Colorado and Texas exit polling finds a majority of Democratic voters in both states would rather nominate a candidate who can beat Donald Trump over someone who agrees with them on the issues, around 7 in 10 in Colorado and 6 in 10 in Texas. Health care was the most important issue to Democratic primary voters in Maine and Massachusetts, according to early exit polling from CNN. Almost half of voters in Maine and 2 in 5 in Massachusetts and Virginia said health care was the most important in deciding who to vote for, followed by around a quarter in those three states for climate change. A quarter in Virginia chose income inequality, compared to around 1 in 5 in Maine and Massachusetts. Fewer than 1 in 10 voters chose race relations in all three states. Health care has dominated the Democratic field, with Sen. Bernie Sanders championing \u201cMedicare-for-All,\u201d which would replace private insurance with a government plan, with moderates including Biden favoring the expansion of a public option within the existing private insurance system. Almost three quarters of voters in Maine and around half in Massachusetts and Virginia support replacing private insurance with a single government plan. Black voters made up about a quarter of the electorate in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries in North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. White voters made up about two-thirds in each state, while Latino voters were roughly 5% in each state. Black voters made up more than four in 10 voters in Alabama, and two in 10 in Texas. The Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina, which voted on Saturday and was the first Southern state to cast ballots in the primary, included 55% black voters, according to the CNN exit poll there. Black voters were key to Biden\u2019s success in that state. Inequality, which has been a major issue throughout the campaign, emerged as a major fissure for voters. Almost half of Democratic voters in Virginia think the economic system in the United States needs a complete overhaul, while around the same think it needs minor changes. One in 10 think it works well as is. Voters feel similarly in Colorado, where around half say it needs an overhaul and four in 10 say it needs minor changes. A plurality of voters in Maine said they prioritize nominating a candidate who can bring about needed change, while around 3 in 10 want a candidate who can unite the country, 1 in 6 want someone who cares about people like them, and around 1 in 10 want someone who is a fighter. In Alabama, more want a candidate that can bring about needed change, while another third want someone who can unite the country. Slightly less than 3 in 10 prefer someone who cares about people like them. The share of voters who are angry at the Trump administration ranges from about half in deep red states, but climbs to a big majority in more liberal places. Voters across the US are angry about the President Trump\u2019s administration, almost 8 in 10 who say so in Maine, 3 in 5 in North Carolina, and a little over half in Alabama, according to early exit polling. Around 3 in 10 Democratic voters are dissatisfied in Alabama, a quarter in North Carolina, and around 1 in 7 in Maine. Few, around 1 in 10, are enthusiastic or satisfied in each state. The two Super Tuesday states appear significantly more liberal than South Carolina\u2019s electorate, according to these preliminary results. A majority of voters in each state described themselves as liberal in the early exit poll. In South Carolina, it was 47%. North Carolina\u2019s Democratic voters were a bit more apt than those in Virginia to describe themselves as conservative: Fewer than 1 in 10 said so in Virginia, while roughly 1 in 8 said so in North Carolina. CNN exit polls were conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool in 12 states voting on March 3. Results are based on interviews conducted throughout the day with randomly selected Democratic primary voters at voting locations in Alabama, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. In California and Colorado, telephone polls were conducted to interview those who vote by mail. In North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, exit polls were conducted among randomly selected voters at early voting locations during the early voting period. Error margins vary by state, ranging from plus or minus 7 percentage points to plus or minus 4 percentage points. Results of early exit polls can shift as interviews with those who voted later in the day are incorporated into the results, and these numbers may change.",

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve reached the phase of the Democratic primary where the early states have had their say. (The last one, South Carolina, was on Saturday.) Now comes Super Tuesday, when large numbers of people all around the US will start casting their votes in the Democratic primary. Millions of them have already started voting. Find out when your state votes. The burning question. The question I get most often from friends and family during this period every four years is this: \u201cWho should I vote for?\u201d So sorry! I\u2019ll write here what I tell them: I can\u2019t tell you that. CNN does not endorse candidates. We strive for impartiality. It\u2019s not my role to tell you what to believe, or what to do with your ballot. Here\u2019s what I can do. I can lay out for you what we know about the level of support for each campaign, and the conventional wisdom (or unconventional wisdom) for why they\u2019re still in the race. This year, of course, the action is all on the Democratic side. President Donald Trump has the Republican nomination locked up. Extremely important note before we get started. While CNN and other media outlets may project a popular vote \u201cwinner\u201d for South Carolina and each of the other 13 states voting this Tuesday, the delegates are allotted proportionally to any candidate who gets more than 15% of the vote. That\u2019s the case for every Democratic primary and caucus. What that means: Unlike the general election, nothing in the primary is winner-take-all. So the primaries might not produce a clear nominee. Since candidates can amass delegates even if they don\u2019t win any states outright, the fractured Democratic field might stay that way all the way until the convention in July, when it\u2019s possible that no one candidate will have a majority of the delegates. Read about a brokered convention. Now, time for some questions. Primaries for both parties have gotten more and more open in recent years, but every state has different rules. Here\u2019s a state-by-state guide from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Closed primaries \u2013 In some states, voters must already be registered in order to take part in a primary. States with closed primaries include Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York. In 2016, Trump\u2019s children couldn\u2019t vote for him in the New York primary because they weren\u2019t, at that time, Republicans. So check your voter registration. Partially closed primaries \u2013 As one example, let\u2019s look at California, where things get really confusing. For most offices, California has a nonpartisan top-two primary system (also known as a jungle primary). That\u2019s how you end up with so many Democrat vs. Democrat races in California on Election Day. But for the presidential election, the primary is partially closed. That means that independents \u2013 voters who are called \u201cno party preference\u201d in California \u2013 can vote in the Democratic primary, but they must specifically request a ballot with presidential candidates listed. If you\u2019re a Republican or involved with some other political party, you must change your registration as you vote, and your vote will be counted provisionally (or after your new registration is confirmed). This means we may not know the final results from California until a while after Election Day. But again, every state is different. Open primaries \u2013 In other states \u2013 Virginia and Texas, for instance \u2013 voters can change their party alignments on Election Day and cast ballots in whatever primary they want. Super Tuesday has been happening for days, because of voting by mail \u2013 CNN\u2019s Kelly Mena reports that millions of voters cast their ballots before Tuesday in states like California, Texas, North Carolina and Colorado. An idealist -- Bernie Sanders is running on a clear platform and he has made it plain that he is not interested in compromise. Some people love that about him. But it\u2019s also the thing that maddens so many establishment Democrats about him, because he\u2019s running on a platform that seems impossible to enact. Take health care. His plan is to nationalize the health insurance industry. There\u2019s not even a majority of Democrats in the Senate who support his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal, much less a majority of all senators. A realist \u2013 Democrats might actually be able to get a public health insurance option to compete in the current private insurance system. That\u2019s a half measure that wouldn\u2019t guarantee everyone has health insurance. It\u2019s more than Obamacare accomplished. It\u2019s less than Medicare for All. It\u2019s what Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg, with important variations, support. (So did Amy Klobuchar, who left the race and threw her support behind Biden on Monday.) A woman \u2013 What\u2019s clear is that four years after coming so close to electing a woman president, barring a Warren turnaround it\u2019s not happening this year. Who knows why Sanders has taken off as the progressive in the race and not Elizabeth Warren. But it\u2019s worth noting that she started to flag in polls when she was attacked for supporting his Medicare for All plan. Health care \u2013 There\u2019s a lot of variation among the Democrats on this issue, but all agree the government needs to do more to help Americans pay for health care and prescription drugs. But for some, that looks like nationalizing the health care industry (Sanders and Warren), while others want to provide a public option in the insurance system (Biden and Bloomberg). What\u2019s achievable is up for debate. Warren, for instance, has said there may need to be steps toward a single-payer system. Sanders says his Medicare for All program is a compromise. Climate change \u2013 Every Democrat recognizes climate change is happening and that humans contribute. They\u2019ve got different ways to deal with it \u2013 from a Green New Deal to radically change the US economy to more modest steps. Mike Bloomberg, the most conservative Democrat running, is already spending millions of dollars of his own money on climate change. So is Tom Steyer. Inequality \u2013 Here again, Sanders and Warren fall to the left of the field. They want to address inequality by providing free tuition at public colleges and universities and free child care and by taxing the wealthiest Americans. There are a variety of plans from the others, but almost everyone agrees some of the Trump tax cuts should be rescinded. Guns \u2013 All of the Democrats agree there should be more restrictive gun control laws. Get more information on each candidate and their specific vision at CNN\u2019s Election Center. Neither are all of the Democratic candidates! On the left. Sanders, the front-runner, is still not technically a Democrat, although he\u2019s on his second run for the Democratic nomination. He is an independent in Vermont. Part of the reason he\u2019s not a Democrat is that there is no party registration in Vermont. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people like Sen. Patrick Leahy from proudly proclaiming themselves Democrats. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist. He has recently promised to do war with the Democratic establishment. If that\u2019s your thing, Sanders is an option. On the right. Sanders isn\u2019t the only non-lifelong Democrat running in the race. While Sanders has insistently joined no party, former Mayor Bloomberg has joined all of them. He was elected mayor in New York City as both a Republican and an independent. Now he\u2019s registered as a Democrat and is using his billions not only to run for President, but also to push for gun control legislation and climate change action. Do you support Trump? \u2013 You can and probably should still take part in the primary process, where you can. In some states, including South Carolina, Republicans have canceled their primaries this year. Do you oppose Trump? \u2013 He does face competition in former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, although Weld has not gained much support. Do you want to mess with Democrats? \u2013 In South Carolina, some Republicans have said they\u2019ll try to mess with Democrats by voting for the candidate they think Trump will beat most handily. Trump has encouraged this type of behavior, in South Carolina and New Hampshire. Do you want to mess with Trump? There\u2019s also a school of thought that disaffected Republicans could leave the GOP and become Democrats for this primary. The conservative former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, who is the national poster-person for never-Trump Republicans, has said that he would even support Sanders if Sanders wins the nomination. But you could consider Bloomberg or one of the other moderate Democrats running, if your state allows it. Which candidate is the most electable? Who knows! Let\u2019s consider Sanders. The concern about Sanders is he has an uncompromising commitment to radically change the country. Also, he\u2019s a democratic socialist. It\u2019s true that socialism is unpopular with a large majority of Americans. And yes, Sanders is a proud democratic socialist (which is not a socialist!!! his supporters will tell you). But a person can be elected president who doesn\u2019t share the views of most Americans. Trump did that. Each candidate has an electability argument. Mike Bloomberg is a moderate spending his own billions on expensive ads. He effectively led a major US city and built a massive company. But he\u2019s part of the inequality problem. Joe Biden can bring his Obama White House experience to his own administration. He\u2019s the person if you pine for the Obama era. Amy Klobuchar tried to appeal to moderates in the middle of the country. Pete Buttigieg, who represented generational change, dropped out just before Super Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren put up the most thoughtful and detailed plans and before she was a senator she was a consumer advocate. Bernie Sanders is authentic. He\u2019s been saying the same things about health care for decades. The party has moved toward him, not the other way around. But there\u2019s certainly data behind the notion that the moderate middle of the country decides most elections. Read this piece by CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein. Sanders is the most vulnerable from that perspective. And that\u2019s why so many Democrats are nervous about him. That said, they haven\u2019t coalesced around any more moderate Sanders alternative. I can\u2019t tell you who, if anyone, voters will pick as that Sanders alternative. There may not be one. Trump\u2019s approval is, according to almost every poll, below 50%. It hovers in the low to mid-40s. That means there\u2019s a majority of people out there who are unhappy with him. That makes him seem beatable. But just like it\u2019s delegates (not voters) who select the Democratic nominee, it\u2019s the Electoral College (not voters) that picks the president. So an unpopular president with outsize support in certain areas and a fighting chance in Florida and the Rust Belt can win again. But nobody will know if Trump is beatable until after the polls close in November.",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg ended his campaign for President Sunday night, concluding the White House bid that vaulted the once-unknown mayor from South Bend, Indiana, to a top presidential contender. Buttigieg officially made the announcement during a hastily planned event on Sunday in South Bend, where the former mayor said \u201ctoday is a moment of truth\u2026 the truth is the path has narrowed to a close, for our candidacy, if not for our cause.\u201d \u201cSo we must recognize that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cSo tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.\u201d Buttigieg added: \u201cWe have a responsibility to concede the effect of remaining in this race any further. Our goal has always been to help unify Americans to defeat Donald Trump and to win the era for our values.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s run was historic. He is the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president, and he broke barriers by becoming the first gay candidate to earn primary delegates for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination. After initial success in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign struggled to win over voters of color, a key base to the Democratic Party, which hurt his performance in Nevada and South Carolina, two states where Buttigieg finished significantly behind the race\u2019s frontrunners. Buttigieg was scheduled to fly from Selma, Alabama, to Dallas, Texas, on Sunday, but during the flight he informed reporters that he would be flying back to his hometown of South Bend to make an announcement on the future of his campaign. That announcement, aides said, is that he is ending his run. Buttigieg made the decision on Sunday, aides said, after he struggled to compete in South Carolina\u2019s primary and had little path toward success on Super Tuesday. \u201cHe believes this is the right thing to do right now for our country and the country to heal this divided nation and defeat President Trump,\u201d the aide said. Pete Buttigieg had a plan for February. It didn't work out as he hoped. The aide added: \u201cHe decided that now was the time and, I think that is exactly why he is getting out. He believes this is the right thing to do.\u201d Buttigieg did not endorse one of his former competitors on Sunday night, and instead used the moment to laud all of his competitors for \u201cdemonstrating what public service can be.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden and Buttigieg have yet to connect but the two have traded voicemails today, a Biden aide tells CNN. A separate source familiar with the matter told CNN that there has been staff-level communication between the Buttigieg and Biden campaigns tonight, however. Buttigieg ended his campaign with little-to-no path toward the nomination, a fact he acknowledged on Sunday. \u201cHe studied the math,\u201d a top Democrat familiar with the Buttigieg campaign said. \u201cHe knew there wasn\u2019t a path forward.\u201d Buttigieg signaled throughout the final weeks of his campaign that he was aware the race was coming to a close. As Buttigieg warned supporters against nominating Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his \u201cinflexible, ideological revolution,\u201d his campaign released a memo days later worrying that Sanders could enjoy a \u201cseemingly insurmountable delegate lead\u201d after the Super Tuesday contests. In the end, Buttigieg didn\u2019t make it to Super Tuesday. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, though, impressed a host of Democratic heavyweights, many of whom see the former mayor as a key figure in the future of the party. What comes next for the mayor remains unclear \u2013 some top Democratic officials have speculated about a possible Cabinet position in a Democratic administration or another attempt at becoming the Democratic National Committee chairman, a job he ran for and lost in 2017. That future was front of mind to the supporters in the audience in South Bend who began chanting \u201c2024! 2024! 2024!\u201d after he ended his run. \u201cI know that as this campaign ends, there comes disappointment that we won\u2019t continue,\u201d Buttigieg said, nodding to his future. \u201cBut I hope that everyone who has been part of this in any way knows that he campaign that you have built and the community that you have created is only the beginning of the change that we are going to make together.\u201d The former mayor\u2019s top advisers believed that a win in Iowa would propel Buttigieg to turn in strong performances in New Hampshire and Nevada. That success, they believed, would be followed by a fundraising boost, allowing them to nationalize the campaign by the time Super Tuesday rolled around in early March. That strategy, however, ran into several challenges. The results of the Iowa caucuses were repeatedly delayed due to mistakes by the state party, denying Buttigieg the ability to fully tout that he won more delegates out of the state than any other candidate. And one of Buttigieg\u2019s primary opponents, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, delivered a strong debate performance before the New Hampshire primary and turned in a surprising third place finish in the state, possibly siphoning votes from the former mayor. Adding to Buttigieg\u2019s challenges was the presence of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the hundreds of millions the billionaire was spending. Bloomberg provided voters yet another alternative to consider, thwarting Buttigieg\u2019s attempt to coalesce moderate Democrats. Buttigieg entered the 2020 race as a relative unknown, launching his exploratory committee from a windowless conference room in Washington, DC. \u201cThe case here is simple,\u201d Buttigieg said at the time. \u201cIt is time for a new generation of leadership in our country.\u201d For months, the candidate toiled in obscurity, one of nearly two-dozen Democrats running for the chance to take on President Donald Trump. But Buttigieg got his break when a CNN town hall in Austin, Texas, last March introduced Democratic voters to the young mayor, leading to a steady climb in polls and a significant boost to his fundraising. \u201cIt reminded me of early Obama and the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel phenomenon,\u201d Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, Buttigieg\u2019s first congressional endorser, said at the time. \u201cEveryone I called (to ask for money) said yes.\u201d Buttigieg officially launched his campaign in April with an event that used his hometown \u2013 South Bend \u2013 as a character in his presidential pitch. His campaign picked the hollowed interior of the once bustling Studebaker plant as the site of his launch, a visual symbol of the struggles his city has faced. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way for us to go. Life here is far from perfect. But we\u2019ve changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d Buttigieg said as rain audibly beat down on the steel roof above him and as the lectern in front of him visibly took on water. Buttigieg raised more than $80 million during his 2020 run, including an impressive $25 million haul in the second quarter of 2019 that allowed the former mayor to invest heavily in Iowa, a state where he and his top aides believed his Midwestern roots, veteran status and focus on faith could build a broad coalition of support across the state. But Buttigieg\u2019s fundraising success was not everlasting. The campaign entered February with just $6.6 million in the bank and they struggled to hit their goal of raising $13 million in the weeks leading up to Super Tuesday. Part of the problem was a decline of small dollar donors. The percentage of Buttigieg\u2019s fundraising from small dollar donors \u2013 over time \u2013 has fallen from 65% in early 2019 to just 29% in January, according to his financial filings. Some of Buttigieg\u2019s early momentum was also stalled by persistent questions about his appeal to communities of color, an issue that was highlighted in June, when black South Bend resident Eric Logan was shot and killed by a police officer. The subsequent protests forced Buttigieg off the campaign trail for nearly a week, including skipping a key campaign event in South Carolina. \u201cMaybe the level of attention on this will help us do some good,\u201d a visibly emotional Buttigieg told reporters after a particularly contentious June town hall in South Bend over the police shooting. \u201cBecause everybody has got to be a part of it. There is just no running away from it, not for me.\u201d Although Buttigieg often pushed back against progressive criticism by noting, should he win, he\u2019d be the most progressive president in a generation, he offered voters a more moderate approach than Sanders. This was clearest on health care, where Buttigieg often touted his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan, a more scaled back version that would provide a public option, but allow people to keep their private health insurance if they chose. As the race dragged on, though, Buttigieg\u2019s central argument became that the Democratic Party should look to their past success and nominate a younger candidate from outside Washington, DC. \u201cWhen it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it\u2019s been with a candidate who was new on the national scene, hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time in Washington, and represented a new generation of leadership,\u201d Buttigieg often said. The line morphed into a direct attack on former Vice President Joe Biden, who Buttigieg criticized repeatedly as a backward-looking candidate. He touted what Biden was able to accomplish during the Obama administration, but at a debate in New Hampshire added, \u201cthose achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.\u201d \u201cI hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,\u201d Buttigieg said in Decorah, Iowa, days before the Iowa caucuses. \u201cBut history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments \u2013 and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump.\u201d Buttigieg also ran hard against Sanders at the end of his campaign, raising questions about the self-identified Democratic socialist and the impact that nominating a \u201cdivisive\u201d candidate could do to down ballot races. \u201cIf you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the house blue,\u201d Buttigieg said at the South Carolina debate in February. \u201cForty Democrats\u2026 They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can. I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House.\u201d And he attempted to warn Democrats after Sanders\u2019 victory in New Hampshire that the Vermont senator could be the prohibitive favorite after Super Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wake up as a party,\u201d Buttigieg said during a January debate in Las Vegas. \u201cWe could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage.\u201d It was that intense focus on Sanders that hinted at Buttigieg\u2019s inner thinking: Without taking down the race\u2019s frontrunner, Buttigieg\u2019s run would effectively end once the Vermont senator began to amass enough delegates to make it impossible for others to catch him. Buttigieg made it clear to aides for weeks that he was not willing to run just for the sake of running. A senior Buttigieg aide told CNN in January \u2013 before voting even began in Iowa \u2013 that the mayor was not interested in sticking with a campaign that had no chance of winning. \u201cHe is not in the business of diddling around,\u201d the senior aide said in January. \u201cWe are going big and we have got a lane to win. If that doesn\u2019t work out, there is no point in running.\u201d This story is being updated. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Abby Phillip and Jake Tapper contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Tom Steyer ended his presidential campaign on Saturday night after the billionaire businessman failed to gain traction in a large field of Democratic candidates. Steyer exited the race after he failed to claim victory in South Carolina, a state he invested heavily in, hoping it would turn around his sputtering run. \u201cI said if I didn\u2019t see a path to winning that I\u2019d suspend my campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly, I can\u2019t see a path where I can win the presidency.\u201d The businessman\u2019s decision comes after disappointing showings in the race\u2019s first three contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. In Nevada, Steyer outspent the rest of the Democratic field on advertisements by more than $13 million. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Steyer spent more than $200 million on advertising for his presidential campaign, and contributed about $155 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. But the power of Steyer\u2019s money was partially blunted late in his campaign by the entrance of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent more than $500 million on ads in a few short months, effectively watering down Steyer\u2019s omnipresence. Steyer spent considerable time and money in South Carolina, and there were signs his investment was paying off. The billionaire businessman spent more than $22 million on television and radio ads in the state, hoping that direct and persistent outreach to black voters could cut into former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s strength with the powerful voting bloc. A recent Monmouth University poll found Steyer at 15% in the state, neck-and-neck with the race\u2019s front-runner Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and behind Biden. Steyer said he supports reparations for African Americans, and pledged he would, if elected, establish a commission on race led by African Americans aimed at coming up with solutions. Before officially launching his campaign in July, Steyer operated as a funding force in Democratic politics. He spent millions bankrolling candidates and organizations that promoted liberal causes and the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Steyer starred in self-funded television commercials calling for Congress to remove Trump from office. Those ads were powerful in the early states, where voters who backed Steyer said they liked the fact that he spearheaded the impeachment effort. The longtime Democratic donor, whose net worth reached $1.6 billion this year according to Forbes, said he would make tackling the global climate crisis a top priority of his administration and vowed to combat what he called the \u201cundue influence\u201d of corporate power on the US economy. He called for a $15 minimum wage, congressional term limits and the repeal of Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that eased restrictions on corporate campaign spending. Steyer said he would repeal the Trump tax cuts and install a 1% wealth tax on those whose net worth is above $32 million. Steyer broke with progressive leaders on \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d and said he would prefer to build on the current system, as it exists under the Affordable Care Act, and push for a public option, or a government-backed insurance plan. In the end, though, Steyer\u2019s campaign became a case study of how even hundreds of millions in personal spending cannot directly lead to success in a presidential election. Steyer did get a burst of attention in the final days of his campaign, turning in his most aggressive debate performance on Tuesday. And on the eve of the South Carolina primary, a video of Steyer dancing onstage with rapper Juvenile at an event in South Carolina went viral.

Bloomberg made the comments in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper about why Democratic voters should trust Bloomberg, who only rejoined the party in 2018 after tenures as both a Republican and independent. Bloomberg  misleadingly cited comments he made in support of healthcare reform in March 2009 to show he supported Obamacare, a bill he later harshly criticized. \u201cIf you want to know my Democratic credentials, I spoke for Hillary Clinton at the DNC convention in Philadelphia in 2016,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He says \u2018no,\u2019 but I was there both times for them, thank you very much. I campaigned among the Conference of Mayors for the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.\u201d Bloomberg also tweeted a video of his answer on Wednesday, \u201cif you want my Democratic credentials here they are.\u201d At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN\u2019s home for Facts First. Facts first: Bloomberg supported Obama in 2012, not 2008. At a private event in 2016 he called his 2012 endorsement \u201cbackhanded,\u201d saying he thought Romney could have done a better job as president. During his speech at the Democratic National Committee in 2016, Bloomberg four times said he was there as an independent, and not there to endorse the party\u2019s platform. Bloomberg did make comments in support of healthcare reform in 2009, but he later sharply criticized Obamacare, calling the final  bill \u201ca disgrace.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s campaign claims him being \u201cthere\u201d for Obama was defending Obama once from false claims he was a Muslim, but his comments at his town hall didn\u2019t make this clear. Here are the facts: Bloomberg did support President Barack Obama in 2012, writing an endorsement for him on Bloomberg View\u2019s website in 2012. But in private remarks allegedly from a closed Goldman Sachs event at Yankee Stadium in 2016, Bloomberg downplayed the endorsement calling it \u201cbackhanded.\u201d \u201cThe second Obama election I wrote a very backhanded endorsement of Obama,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cSaying I thought he hadn\u2019t done the right thing, hadn\u2019t done, hadn\u2019t been good at things that I think are important and Romney would be a better person at doing that. But Romney did not stick with the values that he had when he was governor of Massachusetts.\u201d He added he did not support Obama in 2008. \u201cJohn McCain campaigned for me on the streets of Brooklyn back in 2001,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who set it up, but he did. And I wasn\u2019t going to go against him, but I quite honestly, I would\u2019ve never voted for him because of Sarah Palin on the ticket. So I stayed out of that election.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spokesman Stu Loeser, did not dispute that Bloomberg did not support Obama in the 2008 election. Instead, Loeser cited remarks that Bloomberg made in 2008 where he said that rumors Obama was a Muslim were \u201clies.\u201d The comments came at during a fight over delegates between Clinton and Obama. \u201cTo be clear, we are not saying that Mike helped Obama win, but he DID support Senator Obama in Florida when the Clinton campaign was still fighting him,\u201d Loeser emailed CNN. Bloomberg\u2019s past comments on the Affordable Care Act were covered in a KFile article earlier this month. Bloomberg did speak in favor of health care reform in March 2009, as he mentioned at the town hall. But in comments made months after Obamacare was passed in April 2010, Bloomberg said the bill would do \u201cabsolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems\u201d and also called the program \u201ca disgrace.\u201d He added it was \u201canother program that\u2019s going to cost a lot more money.\u201d It was just one of several comments from Bloomberg identified by CNN\u2019s KFile criticizing the landmark Affordable Care Act in the years following its passage, including saying the bill was \u201creally dysfunctional\u201d and did nothing to solve rising health care costs. Bloomberg has now fully embraced the Affordable Care Act, even proposing an additional \u201cMedicare-like public option\u201d that builds on the law. And while Bloomberg did speak at the Democratic National Convention for Clinton, here\u2019s what he said in his opening remarks. \u201cI\u2019m not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why I believe it is my imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. And to ask you to join with me in supporting her this November.\u2019",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders is a 78-year-old man who had a heart attack less than six months ago. He is also on the verge of tightening control of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, likely buoyed by strong showings in delegate-rich states like California and Texas that are set to vote on Tuesday. (Sanders leads in both states, according to polls released by CNN on Friday.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That reality has begun to sink in among the Democratic establishment this week, as it has become much, much clearer in the six days since the Nevada caucuses that this nomination is now the Vermont democratic socialist\u2019s to lose. The scrutiny applied to a front-running candidate covers their policy positions, their personality and preparedness for the nation\u2019s top job, and yes, even their health. Consider what President Donald Trump would do with the issue of Sanders\u2019 health, given a) that Sanders had a well-documented heart attack last fall while campaigning in Nevada and b) the way in which Trump tried to make Hillary Clinton\u2019s health an issue in 2016. Following an apparent episode of light-headedness at a September 11 memorial, Trump would go after Clinton\u2019s health at nearly every campaign rally, \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to fight all of these different things and she can\u2019t make it 15 feet to her car?\u201d he said in October 2016 in Pennsylvania. \u201cGive me a break. give me a break. Give me a break! She\u2019s home resting right now. She\u2019s getting ready for her next speech, which is going to be about two or three minutes.\u201d Clinton later said she\u2019d had pneumonia, an explanation that did nothing to dampen the attacks from Trump and his allies in conservative and fringe media. Politics is often a nasty business: playing to peoples\u2019 fear, doubts and suspicions rather than their better angels. Trump has taken that inherent nastiness in politics and turned it up to 11. There\u2019s seemingly nothing he won\u2019t say or do to win \u2013 up to and including trying to raise questions about his opponent\u2019s fitness for office, using whatever ammunition is available to him. And the fact of the matter is, the Clinton and Sanders health situations are not at all the same. Sanders\u2019 heart attack and age, while delicate to talk about, are a relevant factor in this race. Every year, Gallup asks voters a series of questions about whether they would be willing to vote for someone with certain attributes. This year, less than 7 in 10 (69%) said they would be willing to vote for a candidate over 70. Age and health make a vice presidential running mate choice more important. And if any future health issues arise, the fact of Sanders\u2019 heart attack will absolutely color the way voters look at his fitness for office. Which brings us back to the difficulty of raising this issue \u2013 and worry \u2013 within the context of the Democratic primary fight. You can\u2019t simply come out and say: \u201cWhat happens if Bernie falls ill in the race against Trump? Has anyone really considered that????\u201d That would likely raise calls of fear-mongering with a political intent. But leaving the conversation for Trump to shape does no favors for Sanders\u2019 (and Democrats\u2019) chances in the general election. The closest any of Sanders\u2019 rivals have come to trying to force voters to ask that very question (without actually asking it) is former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, who released detailed information about his heart health on Thursday including his ejection fraction, a number that indicates \u201chow much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction,\u201d according to the American Heart Association. (A normal ejection fraction is between 50% and 70%; Bloomberg\u2019s was between 60% and 65%). Bloomberg underwent a stent placement in 2000. \u201cReleasing this single scientific number about heart health could start to put to rest any concerns about Senator Sanders\u2019 secrecy about his recent heart attack,\u201d Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser said. \u201cMike Bloomberg\u2019s doctor shared Mike\u2019s number. Will Senator Sanders ask his doctor to do the same?\u201d The answer, at least at the moment, appears to be no. The Sanders campaign has said repeatedly that it will not release any more information beyond the medical letters it already has made public. That runs counter to Sanders\u2019 pledge, in the wake of his heart attack, to release his full medical records. \u201cThe people do have a right to know about the health of a senator, somebody who\u2019s running for president of the United States,\u201d Sanders told CNN last fall. \u201cFull disclosure.\u201d During last week\u2019s debate in Las Vegas, the issue of Sanders\u2019 broken pledge came up via a question from moderator Hallie Jackson. Here\u2019s that exchange: Jackson: Let\u2019s talk about transparency here. Because many Democrats, including most of you on stage, have criticized President Trump for his lack of transparency. But Senator Sanders, when you were here in Las Vegas in October, you were hospitalized with a heart attack. Afterwards you pledged to make quote all your medical records public. You\u2019ve released three letters from your doctors, but you now say you won\u2019t release anything more. What happened to your promise of full transparency? Sanders:  I think we did. Let me tell you what happened. First of all, you\u2019re right, and thank you, Las Vegas, for the excellent medical care i got in the hospital two days. And I think the one area maybe that Mayor Bloomberg and I shared, you have two stents as well. Bloomberg: 25 years ago. Sanders: Well, we both have two stents, it\u2019s a procedure that is done about a million times a year. So we released the full report of that heart attack. Second of all, we released the full \u2013 my whole 29 years in the Capitol, the attending physician, all of my history, medical history. And furthermore, we released reports from two leading Vermont cardiologists who described my situation and, by the way, who said Bernie Sanders is more than able to deal with the stress and the vigor of being president of the United States. Hey, follow me around the campaign, three, four, five events a day, see how you\u2019re doing compared to me.\u201d The conversation then turned to former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is by far the youngest candidate in the Democratic race at 38. Buttigieg said he didn\u2019t think Sanders\u2019 response was transparent, and he added: \u201cTransparency matters. Especially living through the Trump era. Now under President Obama the standard was that the president would release full medical records. Do a physical and release the readout. I think that\u2019s the standard that we should hold ourselves to as well. Now President Trump lowered that standard. He said just a letter from a doctor is enough. A lot of folks on this stage are now saying that\u2019s enough. But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results. I think everybody here should be willing to do the same. But I\u2019m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders\u2019 personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan.\u201d Now, remember that Trump himself has broken with past presidential precedent by refusing to release any sort of detailed medical records. A letter released during the 2016 campaign by his personal physician and claiming that the billionaire businessman would be the healthiest person ever to be president if elected has come under scrutiny since the physician has said Trump dictated its content to him. Trump, who has a common form of heart disease and is clinically obese, also made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed hospital in November for what the White House called a \u201cquick exam and labs\u201d as the first stage of his annual physical. But that trip did not follow the protocol of a routine presidential medical exam, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. \u201cFor any man of that age and medical history,\u201d CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote at the time \u201can unexpected visit to the hospital is concerning.\u201d And Buttigieg hasn\u2019t released medical records either, though he said in the debate that he was \u201ccertainly prepared\u201d get a physical and release the results. But Buttigieg\u2019s debate response speaks to how difficult it is to make Sanders\u2019 heart health (and overall health) an issue. Buttigieg, sensing danger, found a way to transition quickly from Sanders\u2019 alleged lack of transparency regarding his health to a lack of transparency on how Sanders would fund \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Which, candidly, lets Sanders off the hook. The question is whether anyone aside from Bloomberg will keep up the drumbeat regarding concerns over Sanders\u2019 health \u2013 in both the short term and the long term. (Because Trump surely will, not to mention his supporters and/or supportive SuperPACs.) It is, without question, a decidedly delicate subject. But also one that could be the difference between beating Trump in the fall or losing to him.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. John Cornyn Wednesday blasted the socialist vision of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and said it\u2019s critical Republicans keep control of the Senate to be a \u201cfirewall\u201d against the Vermont senator\u2019s policies in case he\u2019s elected. \u201cI think in this contentious political environment, the most important message I think for my constituents is we need to make sure we hold the Senate majority so we can be a firewall against bad policies if Bernie Sanders gets elected,\u201d said Cornyn, who is running for a fourth term in Texas. Emerging from a closed retreat on Capitol Hill \u2013 where top campaign aides to President Donald Trump briefed GOP senators on their reelection efforts, and the senators had a detailed discussion about this year\u2019s tight Senate races \u2013 Cornyn described Sanders as a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d whose views may sound good to some on the surface but would actually destroy America. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d be having a referendum on the free enterprise system versus socialism but that appears to be where we are headed,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI just think we need to remind people that we don\u2019t want the United States to look like Venezuela, or any of these other failed experiments and socialism.\u201d Cornyn was asked if Republicans might be helped on Election Day if Sanders were the Democratic nominee. \u201cSocialism is a totalitarian run government where you don\u2019t have individual choices, and that\u2019s to me the opposite of democracy,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cSo I think in some ways he\u2019s kind of like a Trojan horse, and he\u2019s hoping to get elected based on people\u2019s ambiguous understandings of what he stands for. But when you start talking about the \u2018Green New Deal,\u2019 \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 free this, free that, I think people get the idea that he\u2019s just totally out of touch with mainstream Americans.\u201d Sanders could not beat Trump simply by mobilizing turnout. Here's why. Trump campaign officials Brad Parscale and Jared Kushner \u2013 as well as Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 huddled with Senate Republicans Wednesday at their annual retreat, this year held at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm for the Senate GOP. Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming said the campaign aides expressed a high level of confidence that Trump would win again and the GOP would hold the Senate. \u201cThey talked about what they\u2019ve been up to and the traveling around and success of the President\u2019s so many rallies and the number of people that are actually applying to attend for tickets that are sometimes 10 times as many as seats in the arena,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a lot of energy and enthusiasm for the President\u2019s election.\u201d Cornyn acknowledged Republicans face challenges in four states \u2013 enough to tip the balance to Democrats \u2013 but said he thought Republicans might unseat some incumbent Democrats and hold the majority. \u201cI think things are looking up. But obviously each state\u2019s a little different and obviously Colorado and North Carolina and Maine and Arizona are at the top of our list,\u201d Cornyn said, listing states where Republican incumbents are up for reelection. \u201cBut we also see opportunities to pick up seats in Alabama, maybe Michigan and maybe there will be another surprise in there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mike Bloomberg has vowed as a Democratic candidate for president to \u201cstrengthen entitlement programs.\u201d But when he was mayor of New York City, Bloomberg twice compared Social Security to a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and repeatedly said cuts to that program as well as Medicare and Medicaid had to be part of any serious solution to reducing the federal deficit. The comments come from Bloomberg\u2019s weekly appearances as mayor on the radio program \u201cLive from City Hall,\u201d which was reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Bernie Madoff got his idea from there, but if there\u2019s ever a Ponzi scheme, people say Madoff was the biggest? Wrong. Social Security is, far and away,\u201d Bloomberg said in a January 2009 appearance, referencing the imprisoned former investment adviser who committed billions in fraud. Madoff was arrested in December 2008 and later pleaded guilty to running a massive Ponzi scheme, a type of fraud where existing investors are paid with funds from new investors. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cWe are giving monies out with the next guy\u2019s money coming in and at the end of  \u2013 when the music stops \u2013 it\u2019s just not gonna be enough chairs for everybody,\u201d Bloomberg said. Asked about his comments calling Social Security a Ponzi Scheme, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Bloomberg, defended him. \u201cThe Social Security Administration itself gives out detailed actuarial tables on when and how payments will exceed income, and the issue needs attention because we\u2019re running the cushion between them down,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cMike believes that between now and that time, we will need to boost receipts by raising contributions from those who can best afford it, which is what he\u2019ll do as President. Many of Bloomberg\u2019s comments about entitlements were made from 2010 to 2013, when a soaring US debt and deficit had become a prominent and contentious political issue, driven largely by the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement. Bloomberg was elected as a Republican in 2001 and 2005 before leaving the party in 2007 and winning a third term as an independent in 2009. During a 2013 appearance on the show, Bloomberg said he long advocated to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire, but added, \u201cThe other side you would have to do with entitlements and that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t cut entitlements, the rest is a joke,\u201d he said. Cuts to entitlement programs have long been considered controversial and unpopular in US politics, and Bloomberg\u2019s past comments are at odds with the mainstream positions within the Democratic Party. Last month, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for his openness in the past to adopting changes to Social Security that would slow its growth. And Bloomberg\u2019s own campaign has attacked President Donald Trump for suggesting he is open to entitlement cuts. \u201cPresident Trump has suggested that he is open to cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s website says. \u201cAs president, Mike will strengthen entitlement programs and supplement the private retirement savings system to ensure that no American senior has to live in the shadow of financial peril.\u201d In his own plan, Bloomberg says he will \u201cconsider options for preserving and strengthening Social Security\u2019s long-term finances, while maintaining and enhancing benefits for the neediest recipients.\u201d During other radio appearances, Bloomberg called for passing Simpson-Bowles, the deficit cutting plan named after former Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles. The two co-chaired a commission, established by President Barack Obama in 2010, which made a number of recommendations on reducing the deficit. The plan garnered criticism from the left over proposed cuts to entitlement programs and from the right about proposed tax increases. Loeser defended Bloomberg\u2019s support for the Simpson-Bowles plan. \u201cAfter the onset of the financial crisis, when the recovery was uncertain because Washington gridlock offered no assurances of anything close to steady fiscal leadership, President Obama\u2019s team asked Mike Bloomberg to help make the case for independent panel they created to try and fix the problem,\u201d Loeser told CNN in an email. \u201cMike didn\u2019t agree with every part of Simpson-Bowles, but he agreed Washington needed to show it was serious about governing,\u201d he added. \u201cThat said, we agree with the Democrats like Senator Dick Durbin who supported the plan precisely because it did protect disadvantaged Americans. Nobody will never know exactly why (then-Wisconsin Rep.) Paul Ryan, like Senator Sanders, opposed the plan from the committee that Obama created, but when President Obama\u2019s team called, Mike considered no choice but trying to help them and the country.\u201d Durbin, the Illinois senator, and Ryan, who was the top Republican on the House budget committee at the time, were both members of the Simpson-Bowles commission. Durbin voted in favor of the panel\u2019s proposal and Ryan voted against it. The final 11-7 vote on the plan fell short of the supermajority needed to officially approve it, with only five of the panel\u2019s nine Democrats voting in favor of it. Bloomberg often noted correctly that the federal budget was largely allocated to two sources: entitlements and defense spending. Without cutting to those two things, he said, the issue of the deficit would never be solved. \u201cSixty percent of the federal budget is benefits or entitlements and debt service,\u201d Bloomberg said in December 2010. \u201cAnd out of the third that\u2019s left, half of that is the military and everything else is in the balance. And so when people talk about cutting the federal deficit, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Nobody\u2019s willing to cut the things where most of the money goes. And unless you do that, you\u2019ll never solve that problem.\u201d In January 2011, Bloomberg argued we\u2019d have to do something about Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cWhen you listen to them talk at a federal level, \u2018I\u2019m going to cut the deficit.\u2019 You know, every new group that comes through \u2013 keep in mind two-thirds of the federal budget is entitlements and debt service. Debt Service legally, you can\u2019t touch, entitlements means seniors. We\u2019re going to cut back Medicaid and Medicare, we\u2019re going to have to do something, but that\u2019s going to be a very tough lift,\u201d Bloomberg said. In June of that year, Bloomberg said that entitlements, specifically Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, would bankrupt us if left unchecked. \u201cIt\u2019s also interesting, the politics of Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, everybody says cut,\u201d Bloomberg said \u201cAnd they, some of the more conservative fiscally conservative elected officials around the country say, \u2018Cut, cut, cut.\u2019 And then when the public realizes what they\u2019re doing, they just go ballistic. And the conservatives were trying to walk away from that a little bit. It\u2019s a very contentious issue, but there\u2019s no question that Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, if left unchecked, it\u2019s going to bankrupt us.\u201d Bloomberg said the best solution to solve the deficit was for Obama to end the Bush era-tax cuts for all Americans and to put in place the Simpson-Bowles plan of cuts. \u201cA small solution to the problem is not good for this country because it will postpone the day of reckoning. We have to balance our budget. And there\u2019s two simple ways to do it,\u201d Bloomberg said in November 2011. \u201cCongress can do their part,\u201d he added. \u201cThey should just pass this Simpson-Bowles plan of cuts, which was done with an enormous amount of research by a Republican and a Democrat who have great credibility and had wonderful staff. And yes, you probably could make both things better, but these are things where Congress and the president, yes or no, up or down the whole thing or nothing.\u201d \u201cMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the prescription thing,\u201d Bloomberg said in December 2011. \u201cAll of these things are nice things, but none of them are funded in a sustainable way.\u201d",

But a series of narrower fights might have mattered even more, as everyone in the field vies to emerge as the lone challenger to Sanders with time running out: South Carolina\u2019s primary is Saturday and Super Tuesday, when 14 states and American Samoa vote, is three days later. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s approach was clearest: precise, selective swings at Sanders; damn the torpedoes against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Former Vice President Joe Biden and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer fought over their records on race, courting a much narrower audience: the African American voters who will make up more than half the electorate in South Carolina. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Among Biden\u2019s competitors in the moderate lane, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg tried to hammer Sanders all night \u2013 talking over his answers repeatedly in his most aggressive debate performance yet. And Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stayed above the fray, instead offering herself as an above-it-all alternative to the food fight viewers were watching. Here are eight takeaways from the 10th Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night in Charleston: Warren set the tone. Bloomberg followed, then Buttigieg, then Biden. By the end of the first half-hour, everyone onstage had taken a whack at Sanders. Their aim was clear: knock him off his pedestal. Whether they hit the mark is another question. Bloomberg said Sanders was a weak general election candidate, which is why \u201cRussia is trying to get (him) elected.\u201d Warren accused Sanders\u2019 team of \u201ctrashing\u201d her over her plan to pay for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Buttigieg scoffed at Sanders\u2019 calls for political revolution when \u2013 in refusing to blow up the Senate filibuster \u2013  he won\u2019t make \u201ca rule change.\u201d Biden again slammed Sanders over his votes against the Brady Act, which mandated a waiting period on handgun purchases. Sanders was also put on the defensive by the moderators, who questioned his past support for legislation that protects gun manufacturers from lawsuits, his comments \u2013 recently and going back decades \u2013 about Cuba and whether he was sufficiently pro-Israel. In front of an audience that didn\u2019t cheer even for his most reliable applause lines, Sanders stuck to the message that has been core to his campaign. There were missteps, but for rivals desperate to change the trajectory of the race, the knockout blow never came. In Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina, the most important constituency is African-American voters, who make up more than half the electorate and who Biden has called his \u201cfirewall\u201d of support. That reality turned the debate into a brawl between Biden and Steyer, who has made significant inroads with black voters after focusing his campaign on South Carolina more than any other state. Biden lambasted Steyer for investing in private prisons. \u201cThey hogtied young men in prison here in this state. They in fact made sure that in Georgia they did not have health care for the people that were being held,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou wrote the crime bill,\u201d Steyer shot back, referencing the 1994 legislation signed into law by former President Bill Clinton and noting that it had imposed stiff mandatory minimum sentences that had left hundreds of thousands of black and brown people in jail. Steyer then talked about all the efforts he has made to end the private prison system in California and address systemic racism in the criminal justice system. \u201cTommy come lately,\u201d Biden quipped. Warren has been quietly chipping away at Sanders for weeks. On Tuesday night, she showed her hand early on. After talking up the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing and its goals, sprinkling in some praise for Sanders, she began to explain why she was the better bet to turn those ideas into reality. She was most pointed on their shared support for Medicare for All, the bill Sanders famously wrote and Warren, after backing it, first put out a plan to finance, then said she would implement in two separate stages. \u201cBernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t explain how to get there. Doesn\u2019t show how we\u2019re going to get enough allies into it and doesn\u2019t show enough about how we\u2019re going to pay for it,\u201d Warren said. After she \u201cdug in\u201d and offered the pay-for plan, Warren added, \u201cBernie\u2019s team trashed me for it.\u201d Her message was clear: If you like Sanders\u2019 politics and want his platform to become a reality, I\u2019m the one to make it happen \u2013 and unify the party in the process. Other candidates might have failed to nail him down on it. But Sanders showed he hadn\u2019t come up with a stronger explanation for his praise of Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuban regime\u2019s literacy efforts \u2013 something that could become a long-term political headache for the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign. On Tuesday night, Sanders pointed out that former President Barack Obama had made comments similar to his about Cuba. \u201cOccasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world \u2013 in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran, and when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, but you don\u2019t have to trade love letters with them,\u201d Sanders said. That moved him past the moment Tuesday night. But it likely won\u2019t calm the nerves of Democrats \u2013 especially in Florida \u2013 who are worried about how the GOP will weaponize Sanders\u2019 words. Bloomberg\u2019s performance last week in Las Vegas was disastrous \u2013 so the mayor canceled all but one event in between the two debates to prepare for his second appearance on stage. And, while his performance Tuesday was far from perfect, the extra preparation showed. Bloomberg faced harsh attacks from Warren over lewd comments he made to former employees and comments he made about redlining, racist policies that blocked African Americans and Latinos from buying homes for decades. But Bloomberg approached the debate differently and was far more aggressive in pushing back and attempting to move on. He said Warren was \u201cmisinformed\u201d on redlining and presented a litany of housing policies he pushed as mayor. And when Warren attacked him for reportedly telling a female employee who was pregnant to \u201ckill it,\u201d Bloomberg simply said, \u201cI never said that.\u201d Bloomberg got to tout his own policies, and said his approach to trans-fats and sugary beverages in New York wouldn\u2019t translate nationally. He said Chinese president Xi Jinping isn\u2019t a dictator \u2013 a remark that drew an immediate rebuke from Sanders. But Bloomberg was on the verge of making a major gaffe, nearly saying he \u201cbought\u201d House races in 2018 before catching himself and instead saying, \u201cI got them.\u201d Buttigieg made clear on Tuesday that the only way he wins the Democratic nomination is by taking Sanders down. Nearly every moment Buttigieg was able to comment on \u2013 from foreign policy, to health care to his campaign fundraising \u2013 was turned into an attack on the frontrunner. And Buttigieg was far more aggressive than any past debate, regularly jumping in and talking over Sanders when he could. \u201cLook, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cimagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump.\u201d Buttigieg also took Sanders on for criticizing his fundraising, questioned the senator\u2019s ability to \u201cdeliver a revolution\u201d and echoed the fears some Democrats have about the independent by stoking speculation about what his nomination would mean to down ballot races for the House and Senate. \u201cThey are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can,\u201d Buttigieg said of House members who won for the first time in 2018. While Buttigieg delivered a steady performance, his strategy also reflects the fact that, without a significant change in the race, the former mayor\u2019s window to the nomination could be closing. The Klobuchar that delivered a combative, fiery performance at the debate last week in Las Vegas was almost unrecognizable compared to the candidate who criticized the field for discord on Tuesday night. Klobuchar barely leveled any attacks on Tuesday night; instead, she consistently answered some of the more substantive questions and attempting to sound like the voice of reason on an otherwise chaotic stage. It\u2019s a departure for the senator, who was unafraid to mix is up last week, especially with Buttigieg, a candidate she has long had a deep-seated animosity towards. Klobuchar still got a few shots in, like when she hit Sanders over Medicare for All and subtly knocked Buttigieg for mentioning his campaign website on stage. But her debate was more defined by answers on both domestic and foreign policy and the moments where she took issue with the tone and tenor of the contest. \u201cIf we spend the next four months tearing our party apart,\u201d Klobuchar said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\u201d Biden was in the middle of an answer when he abruptly stopped \u2013 and then wondered why he had. \u201cWhy am I stopping? No one else stops,\u201d he said, chalking it up to his \u201cCatholic school training.\u201d CBS moderator Gayle King called him a \u201cgentleman\u201d for following the rules. \u201cGentlemen don\u2019t get very well treated up here,\u201d he groused. Biden was right: Tuesday night\u2019s moderation contributed to the most chaotic atmosphere of any of the 10 Democratic debates to date. CBS anchors at times lost control and let the candidates brawl \u2013 and then selectively attempted to regain it by repeatedly interrupting candidates mid-answer. The questions often seemed to ignore \u2013 or be months behind \u2013 the real points of tension in the Democratic presidential race. And the candidates often ignored the questions, as Biden did when he was asked to name the biggest misconception about him and offer his personal motto, and he answered in part by promising to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court.",

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check coverage of the tenth Democratic presidential debate from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of the state\u2019s primary on Saturday. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the current front-runner after winning the Nevada caucus, faced attacks over his recent defense of some of the actions of Fidel Castro following the 1959 Cuban Revolution. Sanders also had to defend his recently released plan to pay for his legislative proposals such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d free college, and various debt forgiveness ideas. The debate was also a chance for former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg to bounce back from a rough performance in last week\u2019s debate, when he faced criticism over sexist comments he allegedly made in the early 1990s. Former Vice President Joe Biden came into Tuesday\u2019s debate needing a strong performance ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary South Carolina to stay viable. In an early exchange during Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Bloomberg told Sanders that \u201c(Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States, and that\u2019s why Russia is helping you get elected.\u201d Sanders tried to fend off the attacks by condemning Russian meddling in the 2016 election and warning Putin that he wouldn\u2019t be a Russia-friendly president. Facts First: Bloomberg accurately pointed to a US intelligence community belief that Russia is trying to help Sanders\u2019 campaign. Russia also backed Sanders in the 2016 primary, but Sanders has publicly denounced Russian interference in US politics. At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN\u2019s home for Facts First. Sanders acknowledged last week that US intelligence officials had informed his team that Russia was trying to help his campaign. It\u2019s not clear what Russians are doing to help Sanders, and there haven\u2019t yet been any sweeping hack-and-leak operations like the cyberattacks that hit the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign. US intelligence leaders have said that Russia routinely tries to sow discord among the American public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of American democracy. Their past support for Sanders and Trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy. Separately, a senior US intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, told lawmakers earlier this month in a classified briefing that Russia was taking steps to help Trump win reelection. CNN later reported that Pierson appears to have overstated the formal assessments from the US intelligence community, and senior White House officials rebutted her comments. The Russian government, at Putin\u2019s direction, undertook an extensive campaign in 2016 to boost Sanders\u2019 primary campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and to help Trump defeat Clinton in the general election. The Kremlin operation included well-funded troll farms, propaganda on social media, cyberattacks and leaks of private emails. \u2013 Marshall Cohen Addressing his history with the controversial stop and frisk policy, Mike Bloomberg claimed the number of incidents decreased by 95% while he was mayor of New York. Bloomberg said, \u201cWe let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95%. And I\u2019ve apologized and asked for forgiveness. I\u2019ve met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\u201d Facts First: Bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been before, when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk. While there was such a reduction, it happened only during the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, from the first quarter of 2012 to the last quarter of 2013, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years. Looking at his entire mayoralty, from 2002 through 2013, there was a 97% increase, not a decrease. Bloomberg also claimed the 95% was prompted by his realization that the situation was \u201cout of control.\u201d He does not mention that the decline began right around the time a federal judge signaled she would rule against stop and frisk, nor that he continued to be a vocal defender of stop and frisk for years after his professed realization about the harms of the policy. You can read more about Bloomberg\u2019s history with stop and frisk here. \u2013 Tara Subramaniam and Daniel Dale Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg previously supported Republican candidates. \u201cWe\u2019re here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week? It\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be here to raise money for his buddy, Senator Lindsey Graham. Who funded Lindsey Graham\u2019s campaign for reelection last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that\u2019s not the only right-wing senator that mayor Bloomberg has funded.\u201d \u201cIn 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator,\u201d Warren added. \u201cAnd I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point. In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn\u2019t work, but he tried hard.\u201d Facts First: This is true. Bloomberg supported Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s re-election in 2016. He supported Scott Brown in his losing effort against Warren in 2012. In 2014, Bloomberg gave money to a super-PAC supporting Lindsey Graham. Bloomberg spent nearly $12 million in 2016 to support the reelection of Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, an ally of his on the issue of background checks on gun purchases. The New York Times also reported in November he supported Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in 2014. In 2012, Bloomberg supported Brown over Warren, saying on his radio program as mayor he supported Brown because of Brown\u2019s stance against requiring states to recognize concealed carry laws from other states. Tonight, Bloomberg called such attacks a \u201cside show\u201d and not relevant to his record as mayor. \u2013Andrew Kaczynski Former Vice President Joe Biden said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders encouraged a primary challenge to President Barack Obama in 2012. \u201cHe said we should primary Barack Obama,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSomeone should.\u201d Facts First: This is true. Sanders said on a radio show in July 2011 that a primary challenge to Obama would do \u201ca good deal of service\u201d to the country. \u201cSo my suggestion is, I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing,\u201d Sanders said on the Thom Hartmann Show in July 2011. \u201cI think one of the reasons that President Obama has moved as far to the right as he has is he thinks he can go all the way and no one will stand up to him,\u201d Sanders added. On WNYC in March 2011, Sanders said a primary challenge to Obama would \u201cenliven the debate.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the longest-serving Independent. I think if a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues and people have a right to do that.\u201d Sanders went on to endorse Obama in 2012. \u2013Andrew Kaczynski Klobuchar claimed on Tuesday that Sanders\u2019 \u201d \u2018Medicare For All\u2019 plan alone, on page 8, clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years.\u201d Facts First: While Page 8 of Sanders\u2019 bill does not specifically mention the figure cited by Klobuchar, it states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for \u2026 a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act.\u201d And the Klobuchar\u2019s figure is close to the latest number provided by one study. Some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest report from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. There are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care plans and on the Obamacare individual market. All these people would have to change their health care under Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan \u2014 but they would be covered by the federal plan instead. \u2013 Tami Luhby and Caroline Kelly Sanders defended his sweeping plan to overhaul America\u2019s health insurance system, saying \u201cMedicare for All\u201d will reduce the nation\u2019s health care price tag. \u201cWhat every study out there, conservative or progressive says, Medicare For All will save money,\u201d said Sanders, who came under fire for the cost of his proposal, which has been pegged at more than $30 trillion over a decade. Facts First: Although Sanders is correct that several studies have found Medicare for All would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite. A report from the left-leaning Urban Institute Health Policy Center showed that the nation\u2019s overall health care spending would rise by roughly $7 trillion to $59 trillion over a decade if Medicare for All goes into effect. The increase would be $720 billion for 2020 alone if the policy were enacted. That\u2019s because more people would be insured, more benefits would be covered and more medical services would be used since there\u2019d be no cost for care. \u201cYou will in total spend more as a nation on health care from adding all the bells and whistles that are associated with these kinds of proposals,\u201d Linda Blumberg, institute fellow, said when the study was published last October. \u2013 Tami Luhby Klobuchar claimed during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate that a Vanderbilt University study ranked her as the most effective Democrat in the Senate and that two of her competitors for the Democratic nomination, Sens. Warren and Sanders, ranked among the bottom half of the list. Facts First: Klobuchar is right about herself. She did rank among the most effective members of the Senate and first among Democrats, according to that study. She\u2019s also right that Warren ranked among the bottom half of Democrats. Her characterization of Sanders\u2019 ineffectiveness within the Democratic Party, though, requires clarification. Klobuchar said during the debate in South Carolina that \u201caccording to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the US Senate on 15 metrics. Bernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters \u2013 it matters if you can actually get things done.\u201d The Center for Effective Lawmaking at Vanderbilt evaluates the effectiveness of members of Congress and according to their evaluation of the 115th Congress (2017-2019), Klobuchar ranked as the most effective Democrat in the Senate. What Vanderbilt calls the \u201cLegislative Effectiveness Score\u201d is \u201cbased on 15 metrics that take into account the number of bills a legislator sponsors, how far each of those bills advances through the legislative process from introduction to (possibly) becoming law and its relative substantive significance.\u201d The average Legislative Effectiveness Score is 1.0. Klobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking first among the 48 Democrats in the Senate during that time. And Warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd out of 48 Democrats in the Senate. Sanders caucuses with Democrats, but since he is elected as an independent in Congress, he was not ranked among those within the party as Klobuchar suggested. Sanders has a score of .159. Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s rankings are below 1.0, the average among all members of Congress. \u2013 Maegan Vazquez Early in the debate, Sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires. \u201cIn the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth,\u201d Sanders said. Facts First: The think tank that provided the figure says it is wrong, and says it takes responsibility for the error. Sanders was relying on a figure from the Institute for Policy Studies, according to the think tank senior scholar Chuck Collins but the number was inflated. \u201cWe informed Senator Sanders that US billionaires increased their wealth since Trump\u2019s election by $850 billion. Our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent,\u201d Collins told CNN during the debate. \u201cSenator Sanders was accurately using information that we provided, so we at Institute for Policy Studies are responsible for the error,\u201d Collins added. He said that in 2016, there were 541 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. In 2019, he said, there were 607 US billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion. Collins said he informed the Sanders campaign on Tuesday morning that there had been an error, after CNN contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number. It is not clear, though, whether Sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate. There is no doubt that the wealthiest Americans have gotten wealthier under Trump, though others have also gained. According to the Federal Reserve, the combined wealth of the top 1% of American households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion. The combined wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point \u2013 from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion \u2013 and spread out across many more households. \u2013 Daniel Dale Bloomberg on Tuesday took a swing at President Donald Trump when the debate turned to the deadly coronavirus, which is spreading around the world and sparked a massive selloff this week in the stock market. \u201cThe President fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he\u2019s defunded (the) Centers for Disease Control (and Prevention), CDC, so we don\u2019t have the organization we need.\u201d Facts First: Bloomberg\u2019s statement is mostly accurate. The Trump administration eliminated key White House positions that handled global health issues, and, while it didn\u2019t fully \u201cdefund\u201d the CDC, the administration did cut funding to the federal agency. CNN reported last month that the Trump administration\u2019s response to coronavirus was being coordinated by the White House\u2019s National Security Council. But the NSC does not currently have a person dedicated to overseeing global health issues. That position was restructured in 2018, and a current official with a similar purview has less authority than the former official. A Foreign Policy report late last month stated that \u201cthe United States has never been less prepared for a pandemic,\u201d primarily because the Trump White House fired the entire chain-of-command that handled responses to pandemics. The Trump administration did make cuts to the CDC, which specifically hit epidemic prevention activities when they were imposed in 2018. Because of those reductions, the CDC dramatically reduced the number of countries where its staff works to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats. During the debate, Trump tweeted that the \u201cCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus,\u201d and attacked Democrats for criticizing his response to the virus. \u2013 Marshall Cohen Biden said that Sanders voted against the so-called Brady Bill, a key piece of gun control legislation which ultimately passed in 1993 after a long debate that included whether to extend waiting periods for gun purchases. According to Biden, longer waiting periods would have prevented mass shooter Dylann Roof from obtaining the weapon he used to murder nine people at Charleston\u2019s historically black Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. \u201cBernie voted five times against the Brady Bill,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon,\u201d Biden said. Facts First: It\u2019s true that Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times, but it\u2019s unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from purchasing the firearm. Sanders voted against versions of the Brady Bill that included seven- and five-day waiting periods for purchasing firearms. Roof, who was not legally allowed to purchase a firearm due to a pending illegal drug possession case, was able to buy a handgun because the database that was supposed to flag Roof\u2019s pending case, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System managed by the FBI, didn\u2019t include the pending case details. Due to a clerical error, the information was never submitted to that database. Roof\u2019s background check took longer than three days to complete and so the gun shop owner was allowed to sell him the gun after the three days passed.  Because this error wasn\u2019t discovered until after the shooting, when the FBI began investigating Roof, it\u2019s unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented Roof from passing the background check. \u2013 Holmes Lybrand During the debate, Biden and Klobuchar argued over who authored gun control legislation aimed at protecting women. \u201cI am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can\u2019t go out and get an ak-47,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI wrote that law,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cYou didn\u2019t write that bill,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cI did,\u201d Biden reiterated. Facts First: Klobuchar and Biden are talking about two different pieces of legislation. Klobuchar has introduced legislation that would make it legally clear that dating or more casual partners who were convicted of a misdemeanor for domestic violence (as well as convicted stalkers) would not be allowed to own a firearm. As a senator, Biden sponsored the Violence Against Women Act, legislation that aimed, in part, at improving how prosecutors and police worked to combat domestic violence. As a White House memo in 2014 describes, \u201cThe bill established new federal crimes of interstate domestic violence and stalking, doubled penalties for repeat sex offenders, and sparked the passage of laws at the state level to protect victims.\u201d \u2013 Holmes Lybrand In a back-and-forth with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders about gun control, Biden said, \u201c150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability.\u201d He added, \u201cMore than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on. Carnage on our streets.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s number is incorrect. When CNN asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. He\u2019s also wrong about when the vote occurred. It was 2005, not 2007. Fewer than half a million people in the US have died by gun violence since 2005 \u2013 but he\u2019s correct that it\u2019s more than the number of military casualties since the Vietnam conflict. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that 474,993 people died because of a firearm injury between 2005 and 2018, the latest data available. That it includes intentional and unintentional deaths. A spokesperson for the campaign said that Biden meant to say 150,000 \u2013 and was referring to the number of homicides. That number checks out, if you\u2019re counting from 2007 . But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there were 173,325 homicides committed with firearms between 2005 and 2018. Whether you count homicides only, or all deaths, more people have died from gun violence since 2007 than military deaths in US wars since the Vietnam Conflict began in 1964. A Congressional Research Service report said 67,000 military members were killed in wars since then. \u2013 Katie Lobosco On Tuesday night, Sanders had to defend his numerous comments praising elements of the Cuban communist regime, which have recently gained attention following a 60 Minutes interview and a CNN townhall. Sanders said that while he has admired aspects of the Cuban revolution, he has also condemned authoritarianism in the country. \u201cI have opposed authoritarianism all over the world,\u201d Sanders said, likening his comments on Cuba to comments made by then-President Barack Obama. \u201cOf course you have a dictatorship in Cuba,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. What Barack Obama said was they made great progress on education and healthcare. That was Barack Obama.\u201d Biden shot back at Sanders, saying that Obama did not praise the Cuban government. Biden then accused Sanders of not condemning the Cuban government. \u201cThis man said that, in fact, he thought it was \u2013 he did not condemn what they did,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat is untrue, categorically untrue,\u201d Sanders responded. Facts First: Sanders is correct that he has condemned authoritarianism in Cuba, but over nearly four decades, he has also repeatedly praised aspects of Cuban society. President Obama did as well as part of his effort to open relations between the US and the communist island. First, here\u2019s what President Obama said about Cuba in March 2016. \u201cAnd I said this to President (Raul) Castro in Cuba. I said, look, you\u2019ve made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education\u2013 that\u2019s a huge improvement from where it was. Medical care \u2013 the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. That\u2019s a huge achievement. They should be congratulated.\u201d In an interview from the 1980s, Sanders argued that the longevity of the Castro regime was not solely due to its repressive tactics, but a genuine base of support in Cuba. \u201cYou may recall way back in, when was it,1961 they invaded Cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro,\u201d Sanders said, discussing the logic behind the Kennedy administration\u2019s failed Bay of Pigs coup. \u201cThey had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\u201d In 1989, according to the Burlington Free Press, Sanders criticized the \u201cone-party regime\u201d and \u201ccensorship\u201d of the press in the country, but also praised other aspects of the country. \u201cUnder (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, enormous progress has been made in improving the lives of the poor people (and) of the working people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOn the other hand, in terms of democratic rights, there are enormous deficiencies.\u201d As a third-party candidate for Vermont governor in 1976, Sanders scoffed at the idea the type of socialism he supported was similar to authoritarianism in China, Cuba, and Russia. \u201cWe live in Vermont, not in Cuba, China or Russia,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have to do what we can to meet the needs of the people here. Anyone who says I\u2019m following Mao\u2019s method, or Cuba\u2019s or Russia\u2019s is a lunatic.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Kaczynski",

            "article_content": "Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Tuesday said there is a sense of \u201cpanic\u201d in the Democratic Party as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders racks up wins in the Democratic primary. His comments come amid increasing worry surrounding the party\u2019s final endorsement among establishment Democrats, and as Sanders has emerged as the front-runner in the race following his victory in the Nevada caucuses. \u201cI would say panic would be the adjective to describe the mood right now,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. When asked if there should be panic in the party, Emmanuel said, \u201cSure. This is a consequential election and you don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m friendly with Sen. Sanders. I\u2019m not a fan of (his) politics,\u201d the former White House chief of staff to Barack Obama said. \u201cI think it will lead to an electoral defeat when, in fact, the country is looking for an alternative to Donald Trump. They want to vote in a different direction.\u201d Emanuel added that Sanders will need to do more than tout his political record and experience if he wants to increase voter turnout. \u201cI think that the case of the matter is he\u2019ll have a record, he\u2019ll be able to promote it, but don\u2019t kid yourself that Donald Trump and President Putin are going to have a say in what Bernie Sanders\u2019 record looks like by the time he gets there to do that,\u201d Emmanuel said. The fear in the party isn\u2019t just over how Sanders and his far-left platform would fare against Trump in the general election, but about the effect his nomination could have on down-ballot races, particularly for Democrats running in tough elections in swing districts and states. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn told CNN on Sunday that he believes a Sanders win in the Democratic primary could cost the party seats in Congress, echoing concerns over the self-described democratic socialist held by many establishment Democrats. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez said \u201cthere\u2019s no question\u201d Sanders will \u201ccreate a real challenge for down ballot candidates\u201d if he\u2019s the Democratic nominee. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of my home state in New Jersey. We got three new House members. They run in districts that were held by Republicans,\u201d Menendez told CNN. \u201cHow do they triangulate? How do they if someone like Senator Sanders is at the top of the ticket?\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have also ramped up their attacks on the Vermont senator and his policies such as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has warned against nominating Sanders, saying the senator \u201cbelieves in an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats.\u201d Businessman Tom Steyer also criticized Sanders during a CNN town hall on Monday in Charleston, South Carolina. \u201cI don\u2019t think a government takeover of major parts of the American economy is a good idea,\u201d Steyer said of Sanders\u2019 policy proposals. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for working people, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for families.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michael Warren, Jeff Zeleny, Lauren Fox and Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders left Las Vegas on Saturday morning in a light drizzle. By the time he arrived in San Antonio hours later, his path to the Democratic nomination seemed as big and clear as the Texas sky. The Vermont senator\u2019s dominating performance in Nevada solidified his place as the front-runner in an increasingly fractious and frantic primary. His rivals are now running out of time and, with the exception of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the resources required to blunt his momentum. If Sanders continues to gain steam and support, he could \u2013 in as few as 10 days \u2013 amass a practically unbreakable delegate lead on Super Tuesday. Bernie Sanders wins Nevada caucuses, CNN projects In San Antonio on Saturday night, Sanders ignored his Democratic rivals and delivered a general election-style call to action. He also spelled out, for anyone who wasn\u2019t familiar, the pillars of his revolution: To raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour; launch a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d; expand public housing; boost government support for organized labor; offer tuition-free college to students, while canceling their debt, and pay raises for school teachers; take apart \u201cthe prison industrial complex\u201d; legalize marijuana across the nation and deliver \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race While Sanders discussed his vision, the other candidates were arguing \u2013 with increasing urgency \u2013 that his platform would be a loser against President Donald Trump in November. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s speech in Las Vegas focused almost exclusively on making the case against Sanders. \u201cI congratulate Sen. Sanders on a strong showing today, but before we rush to nominate Sen. Sanders, let us take a sober look at what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Buttigieg said, before casting the front-runner as \u201cinflexible\u201d and unelectable, the leader of an \u201cideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.\u201d 6 takeaways from Bernie Sanders' huge win in Nevada Buttigieg, who is running television ads against \u201cMedicare for All\u201d in South Carolina ahead of next week\u2019s primary there, pilloried Sanders\u2019 signature single-payer health insurance legislation, warning again that its passage would draw every American into a public plan, \u201cwhether they want it or not.\u201d At around the same time, former Vice President Joe Biden was talking about Sanders, too. \u201cI ain\u2019t a socialist,\u201d Biden said, before making reference to a recent report, disputed by top Sanders\u2019 aides, that the Vermont senator considered challenging former President Barack Obama in 2012. \u201cAnd by the way, I was proud to have and run with Barack Obama. And I\u2019m proud to still be his friend, and I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 I promise you I wasn\u2019t talking about running a Democratic primary against him in 2012 like some people.\u201d In Seattle, Sen. Elizabeth Warren re-upped her recently minted criticism of Sanders. \u201cI am not in this fight to talk about change,\u201d she said, again questioning why Sanders won\u2019t commit to pushing for an end to the Senate filibuster. \u201cI am in this fight to make change.\u201d Trump's 2020 position is improving Bloomberg hasn\u2019t formally joined the contest yet, having decided to skip the first four states, but the billionaire\u2019s campaign manager said the results in Nevada only \u201creinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead.\u201d Unspoken, in his statement, was Bloomberg\u2019s own role in the splintering. There is only one more debate now before Super Tuesday. The moderate field shows no signs of coalescing behind any one candidate. If anything, the rivalries between candidates like Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, or Biden and Bloomberg, are only escalating. Sanders has taken his share of hits, but his upward trajectory, which began in October, remains largely unchanged. Still, he faces potential stumbling blocks up ahead. His romp in Nevada will bring about another round of increased scrutiny of his record and policy proposals, as well as more pointed attacks on his past personal and political history. California, where Sanders is banking on another big win, is expensive, and its primary system can be complicated, especially for voters who have not registered as Democrats \u2013 a cohort that Sanders relies on. Chris Cillizza's winners and losers from the Nevada caucuses The news that the intelligence community briefed Sanders on the Russian government\u2019s efforts to aid his campaign didn\u2019t hurt Sanders in Nevada, but the long-term implications remain unclear. Sanders\u2019 initial reaction to the report, on the tarmac during a Friday tour of California, was revealing \u2013 his rebuke of Russian President Vladimir Putin painted a stark contrast the current president; but his implication that The Washington Post timed the report to hurt him in Nevada left a sour taste. Saturday, though, was sweet for a campaign that saw its strategy and political message validated by caucusgoers in Nevada, the most diverse state to vote so far, and one with a powerful union presence. The largest one, Nevada\u2019s Culinary Union, did not endorse any of the candidates, but made clear that Sanders, because of Medicare for All, was a non-starter. In his victory speech, Sanders thanked union members \u2013 in a sly but pointed nod to reports that the rank in file came out for him over the objections of their leadership \u2013 for their support in Nevada. That was how he ended a day on the trail that began with a rally in El Paso, Texas, where supporters, many in T\u00edo Bernie t-shirts, were greeted in the lobby of the venue by a four-piece Mariachi band. When they took the stage, the group performed a rendition of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cMy Way.\u201d Sanders, after Nevada, seems to be on his.",

            "article_content": "The Nevada caucuses \u2013 the third vote of the 2020 Democratic nomination fight \u2013 are over. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the big winner, claiming his second straight victory and heading into the South Carolina\u2019s primary next Saturday with a considerable amount of momentum. It was a far tougher night for the like of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota). THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Below, an extended look at the best and worst from the day \u2013 and night \u2013 that was. * Bernie Sanders: Yes, the Vermont democratic socialist was the favorite in Nevada going into the caucuses. But few people projected such a sweeping win \u2013 not only doubling the support of the second-place finisher, but doing so in ways (most notably his huge support among Latinos) that suggest he is on his way to building a national coalition. The dynamic of the race is now very simple: Sanders is the clear front-runner, and everyone else in the field is vying to be the Sanders alternative. * Pete Buttigieg: The most important thing the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor did in Nevada was the speech he gave after it was clear Sanders was going to win. Buttigieg used the national spotlight to make a very savvy play to be the Sanders alternative. He savaged Sanders\u2019 \u201cinflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans\u201d and decried the \u201ctenor of combat, division and polarization\u201d of the Sanders supporters. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a prominent Sanders backer, tweeted \u201cdude, show some humility\u201d to Buttigieg in the wake of the speech. Mission accomplished for Team Buttigieg. * Joe Biden: After finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire, the former vice president badly needed some good news. And Nevada gave him just enough of that to keep him going for another week, through the South Carolina primary. But there\u2019s warning signs everywhere for Biden in the numbers; he got crushed by Sanders among Latinos, won black voters over Sanders by less than double-digits and played to a tie with Sanders among moderate voters. Biden desperately has to win South Carolina, and Sanders\u2019 demonstrated strength across a broad coalition is very problematic there. * Electability: Two thirds of Nevada caucus-goers said they would prefer a candidate who can beat President Donald Trump rather than someone who agrees with them on issues. That\u2019s very similar to the number who opted for electability in Iowa and New Hampshire, and serves as yet another reminder of just how important beating the incumbent is for a broad swath of Democratic voters. Here\u2019s the really interesting thing, though: Among those who said electability was most important, Sanders \u2013 yes, Sanders \u2013 was the leading candidate. * Donald Trump: The rise of Sanders \u2013 and the considerable concern within elements of the Democratic Party about nominating a democratic socialist \u2013 means that this primary season is going to be very long and likely very nasty, as the party dukes it out over what its present and future should look like. All of that is great news for Trump, who continues to consolidate GOP support and whose campaign continues to stockpile cash. Plus, whether or not he is right, Trump quite clearly believes Sanders is his easiest general election opponent \u2013 and right now the Vermont senator is the favorite to be just that. * Elizabeth Warren: The meteoric rise of Sanders is very bad news for Warren. While their coalitions are not exactly the same, both Sanders and Warren have spent the entire campaign trying to be the liberal choice. It now appears as though that debate is settled \u2013 and Warren lost. While Warren had a very strong debate earlier this week  \u2013 and her campaign manager highlighted the fact that she improved her standing considerably between early voting and people who attended the caucus day of \u2013 she still hasn\u2019t had a Top 2 showing. And looking at the calendar in the next few weeks, it\u2019s not immediately obvious to me where she might get that sort of performance. * Amy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator surprised the political world in New Hampshire with a strong close that got her to third place. But the 10 days in between New Hampshire and Nevada clearly sapped Klobuchar of the momentum she had built. Her lackluster showing in Nevada will make it very difficult for Klobuchar to make any noise in South Carolina and that, in turn, will make her chances of winning delegates on Super Tuesday very, very long. It may well be time for Klobuchar to start rethinking whether she wants to remain in the race. * Culinary Union: The most powerful union in the state decided not to endorse a candidate. But a flier it sent to its members attacking Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, which would eliminate private health insurance entirely, became a major issue in the race as supporters of the Vermont senator attacked the union leadership. Sanders\u2019 smashing victory \u2013 and the overwhelming support for the elimination of private health insurance among Nevada voters \u2013  amount to a major rebuke for the Culinary Union.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders solidified his status as the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination with a commanding win Saturday in Nevada. Sanders dominated among Latinos and young voters, entrance polls showed. But he was broadly successful across demographic groups \u2013 reaching parity with his rivals among moderate voters. Still, Sanders is far from clinching the Democratic nomination. A second-place finish in Nevada could prevent Joe Biden\u2019s standing from further weakening next week in South Carolina, where the former vice president is hoping his support among black voters will carry his campaign to victory. And former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s $434 million of television advertisements looms large on Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote on March 3. But Sanders has the largest grassroots army, demonstrated a diverse coalition in Nevada, has more money in his campaign bank account than anyone who isn\u2019t a billionaire and has a head start in California and Texas, two Super Tuesday states. The Vermont senator answered some major questions he faced Saturday. Perhaps most important among them: He won five of the seven casino caucus sites \u2013 revealing that members of the powerful 60,000-member Culinary Union broadly backed him, despite the union leadership opposing Sanders because they favor the special health care plan they\u2019d negotiated over his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal. Here are six takeaways from the Nevada caucuses: Nevada gave Sanders more than a clear victory on Saturday \u2013 it delivered a striking validation of his campaign\u2019s strategy. In a state with a Latino population of about 30% and a strong base of organized labor, no one else in the field came close. The results here suggest that Sanders also is poised for similar successes in Super Tuesday states like California, the primary\u2019s crown jewel, and Texas, another delegate-rich state where the Latino vote could be decisive. Sanders was so confident in a Nevada victory that he left the state to campaign in California on Friday and then spent Saturday hopscotching around Texas, with stops in El Paso and San Antonio. On Sunday, he will hold a rally in Austin. Next up on the primary calendar, though, is South Carolina, another state where Sanders has shown signs of gaining steam in recent polling. A strong finish in the Palmetto State, where Hillary Clinton blew him out in 2016, could begin to clear the field even before the Super Tuesday states weigh in. It\u2019s still a jumble behind the clear Democratic front-runner, with Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg jousting for second place as results continue to come in. In speeches from Las Vegas on Saturday, Biden and Buttigieg previewed new attacks on Sanders. Biden referenced a report that Sanders had considered a primary challenge to former President Barack Obama. \u201cI promise you, I wasn\u2019t talking about running in the Democratic primary against him in 2012,\u201d he said. Buttigieg\u2019s entire speech was a contrast with Sanders. \u201cWe can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base or open the tent to a new, broad, big-hearted American coalition.\u201d But neither speech solved the Sanders opponents\u2019 biggest problem: It remains a large, and largely bunched together, field, with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also siphoning votes away from the moderate candidates and Bloomberg waiting to make his mark on Super Tuesday. Unless those opposed to Sanders coalesce around a clear alternative \u2013 and quickly \u2013 his march to the Democratic nomination could be impossible to stop. Biden claimed Saturday in Las Vegas that he\u2019s \u201calive and we\u2019re coming back and we\u2019re going to win.\u201d But make no mistake: This is not going well for the former vice president. He\u2019s now finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and is hoping for a distant second in Nevada. In three runs for the Democratic presidential nomination over 32 years, Biden still has never won a state. One illustration of how far his fall has been: In nearly every poll of Nevada in 2019 and January 2020, Biden was ahead of Sanders. Unable to consolidate moderate Democratic voters, Biden is likely to struggle with donors, as well, who are split between the former vice president and Buttigieg. He\u2019s also being sidelined by Bloomberg\u2019s presence in the race. Biden on Saturday predicted he will win in South Carolina, where a huge advantage with African-American voters has kept him in the lead in polls. Anything short of a clear victory there would almost certainly be a fatal blow to his campaign. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren might have gotten a big bounce out of eviscerating Bloomberg on the debate stage Wednesday night in Las Vegas. Her campaign says it has raised $14 million in recent days, giving her a renewed ability to compete on Super Tuesday. But that bounce couldn\u2019t help her Saturday in Nevada. About 75,000 early votes \u2013 a vast share of the state\u2019s total \u2013 had already been cast, and the early voting window had closed, before the debate had taken place. Now, the Democratic race moves to South Carolina, where Sanders and Biden have long looked like the strongest contenders, in part because they have stronger support among black voters who make up more than half the Democratic electorate than their rivals. There will be another debate there  \u2013 and therefore another opportunity for Warren to take on Bloomberg as a proxy for President Donald Trump in the fall and boost her fundraising again. But she could be headed into Super Tuesday, the most important day on the Democratic primary calendar, with nothing better than a third-place finish in any of the first four states to vote. Tom Steyer, after two dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, told his supporters that this race would be won or lost in Nevada \u2013 a state where he spent $15 million on television ads, nearly eight times as much as Bernie Sanders and far more than any other contender. \u201cIf we win tomorrow, we win the whole goddamn thing,\u201d he said at his pre-caucus rally Friday night. \u201cIf we win tomorrow, we win everything!\u201d Steyer did not win. He is likely to finish far behind the likes of Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg. The billionaire now turns his campaign to South Carolina, a state where he has already invested over $21 million on ads. But, after his behind-the-pack performance in Nevada, Steyer\u2019s campaign is limping into what could be his final state. Steyer\u2019s performance could also foretell issues for Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who has spent nearly half a billion dollars on television, digital and radio advertising. Unlike Steyer, though, Bloomberg has also spent millions on staff to build a national operation of well over 2,000 people across the country. Why do caucuses exist? Nevada has performed far better than Iowa, where a faulty app, an unprepared state party and confused volunteers plunged the caucuses there into chaos earlier this month. Nevada has not experienced those same issues and CNN was able to project a winner on caucus night. But the process here in Nevada has been anything but smooth. The biggest issue: Results from Nevada\u2019s over 2,000 precincts took hours to come out. Sanders\u2019 advisers fought to keep caucuses as part of the nomination process after the 2016 election, and that strategy has largely paid off for the Vermont senator. But slow results have stifled possible momentum for other candidates who performed well in Iowa and Nevada and allowed candidates like Klobuchar, who performed poorly in Nevada, to claim, \u201cAs usual, I think we have exceeded expectations.\u201d Even more critically, issues around caucuses have called into question the credibility of the nomination process, allowing Republicans to attack Democrats for the caucus mishaps.",

            "article_content": "For Pete Buttigieg, it\u2019s now all about Bernie Sanders. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor used his final speech in Nevada on Saturday to first congratulate the Vermont senator on winning the state\u2019s caucuses before lambasting the message animating Sanders\u2019 campaign, attacking his movement as a \u201cinflexible, ideological revolution\u201d and arguing the \u201ctenor\u201d of his operation is one of \u201ccombat, division, and polarization.\u201d The focus on Sanders reflects an urgency from the Buttigieg campaign now that the Vermont senator has turned in a series of strong showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada and \u2013 in the eyes of his top campaign aides \u2013 could have a \u201cseemingly insurmountable delegate lead\u201d after March 3, when the delegate rich Super Tuesday states will vote. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cI believe the best way to defeat Donald Trump and deliver for the American people is to broaden and galvanize the majority that supports us on the critical issues,\u201d Buttigieg said at his caucus day watch party. \u201cSen. Sanders believes in an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.\u201d Buttigieg then \u2013 in a line-by-line fashion \u2013 contrast his beliefs with Sanders, slamming the race\u2019s frontrunner as someone who believes in \u201ctaking away\u201d people\u2019s health care choices and wants to \u201cgo beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats \u2013 let alone most Americans\u201d don\u2019t want to do. Buttigieg also questioned Sanders\u2019 impact on down ballot races, stating that party needs someone who \u201cactually gives a damn about the effect you\u2019re having from the top of the ticket on those critical frontline House and Senate races that we need to win\u201d and arguing his vision is \u201cdifferent from Sen. Sanders\u2019 willingness to ignore or dismiss, or even attack the very Democrats that we absolutely must send to Capitol Hill.\u201d Buttigieg hits Sanders by name over health care in new South Carolina TV ad \u201cThat is the choice before us,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory. We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base or open the tent to a new and broad and big-hearted American coalition.\u201d The mayor boasted of his own electoral success during his remarks. \u201cOurs is the only campaign that has beaten Sen. Sanders anywhere in the country,\u201d Buttigieg said, citing the Iowa caucuses, where the state party announced that he won two more national delegates that the Vermont senator despite a razor thin margin. The Nevada speech is by far the most direct Buttigieg has ever delivered about Sanders, a candidate who just months ago the former mayor went to lengths to avoid attacking by name. But Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, as Sanders\u2019 momentum has grown, has become more aggressive than anyone in the Democratic field at taking on the race\u2019s frontrunner. The strategy is an acknowledgment that, without a significant change in the nomination fight, Sanders will be far ahead on the path towards winning the nomination \u2013 a point Buttigieg made publicly at the debate on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wake up as a party,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage.\u201d Later in the debate, Buttigieg took on the fact that Sanders identifies as an independent \u2013 not a Democrat \u2013 by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s put forward somebody who\u2019s actually a Democrat.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s campaign invested heavily in Iowa and New Hampshire, banking on momentum out of those two states propelling him to top tier status in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. That strategy has not played out exactly how Buttigieg would have wanted, though. A surprising third place finish by Klobuchar in New Hampshire was viewed as an impediment to Buttigieg\u2019s momentum out of the state. And Bloomberg, with his more than $400 million spent on television ads, has further crowded the group of moderate candidates running to take on Sanders, giving voters that may be pre-disposed to backing Buttigieg yet another option. The mayor now heads into South Carolina, arguably his most trying earlier states due to his struggles winning over African American voters, and the slate of Super Tuesday states, where he has yet to spend any money on television ads. Buttigieg, though, in a sign of his evolving strategy, began airing a new television ad in South Carolina on Friday night that attacks Sen. Bernie Sanders by name over his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan. Buttigieg, asked if he failed to take Sanders seriously soon enough, said earlier on Saturday that he takes \u201ceverybody seriously.\u201d \u201cBut right now,\u201d he said, \u201cI think the race is really coming into focus. That is why these contrasts are very important for folks to think through and understand.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders took his long-running fight with the Democratic Party establishment very public Friday night, hours after news broke that Russia is working to help his 2020 primary bid and hours before the critical Nevada caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for the Republican establishment,\u201d the Vermont senator tweeted on Friday night. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can\u2019t stop us.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Whoa boy! The timing of that tweet seems not to be an accident. The Washington Post reported earlier Friday afternoon that the Sanders campaign had been briefed on attempts by the Russians to help his campaign, although it was not clear how that aid was manifesting itself. Sanders confirmed Friday that he had been informed of the attempted Russian efforts a month ago. \u201cWe were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign, and look, here\u2019s the message to Russia: Stay out of American elections,\u201d Sanders said. He also \u2013 in a prelude of his tweet later Friday night \u2013 seemed to suggest to reporters on the campaign trail that the timing of the Post\u2019s report was suspicious. He noted that the Nevada caucuses were less than a day away, then asked who reported the news. When told it was The Washington Post, Sanders said sarcastically: \u201cGood friends.\u201d (Here\u2019s the video of the exchange.) Later, Sanders communications director Mike Casca seemed to point the finger at the Trump administration. \u201cIf you think this leak wasn\u2019t designed to hurt Bernie, you\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cit\u2019s very clear Trump is nervous about facing him in the general election.\u201d And then, Sanders tweeted \u2013 making very clear that he views himself as at war with the establishments of both parties. As expected, it brought a considerable, and considerably negative, response from the so-called party establishment. \u201cThe Democratic establishment gave us civil rights, voting rights, the assault weapons ban, social security and Medicare,\u201d tweeted longtime party strategist Joe Lockhart. \u201cWhat have you done Senator?\u201d The truth is that for as long as Sanders has been running for president \u2013 including in the 2016 race \u2013 there has been a not-so-secret war between the Democratic establishment and Sanders, his campaign and his supporters. The 2016 primary election only deepened the ill will \u2013 as hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee showed that staffers within the organization had clearly put their thumb on the scale for Hillary Clinton. Sanders eventually endorsed Clinton but the bad feelings obviously never went away. \u201cNobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done,\u201d Clinton said of Sanders in a documentary about the campaign, released this year. \u201cHe was a career politician. It\u2019s all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.\u201d Sanders sought to downplay those Clinton attacks in January. But he clearly continued to internalize his frustrations. And things only got worse during the Iowa caucus fiasco. Not only was the vote counting terribly delayed, but there was also a split between the popular vote, which Sanders won, and the state delegate allocation, which former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg won. It all played into \u2013 in the minds of Sanders and his supporters \u2013 the idea that something was going on. They weren\u2019t \u2013 and aren\u2019t \u2013 entirely sure what that something is or who is behind it, but they are certain it\u2019s there. And it\u2019s because Sanders has created a movement that isn\u2019t dependent on the party \u2013 and, in fact, has been formed in direct opposition to the establishment. To be clear: Sanders isn\u2019t totally wrong! There are lots and lots of longtime Democratic political professionals who believe that nominating a self-proclaimed democratic socialist is a recipe for disaster for their side. And even Sanders\u2019 rivals for the Democratic nomination are seeking to make an issue out of his casual relationship with the party. \u201cLet\u2019s put forth someone who is actually a Democrat,\u201d Buttigieg said in Wednesday night\u2019s debate in Las Vegas. What Sanders\u2019 tweet Friday night will do is simply make the existing dynamic in this race much more obvious: There is Sanders and the battle to be the establishment alternative to Sanders. That\u2019s it. Now Sanders has said it \u2013 and thrown down the gauntlet. Can the establishment fight back and win?",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg will begin airing a new television ad in South Carolina on Friday night that attacks Sen. Bernie Sanders by name over his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care plan. The ad, which will run for a week ahead of the South Carolina primary later this month, is the first time Buttigieg has put money behind a television spot that attacks Sanders directly. It features a narrator arguing that Sanders\u2019 plan would \u201celiminate private insurance\u201d and casts the Vermont independent as a polarizing figure. A Buttigieg campaign aide declined to disclose how much the campaign was spending to air the ad, saying only that it will run the ad statewide. \u201cOn health care, there\u2019s a choice,\u201d the narrator says, before an image of Sanders appears on screen and the narrator runs through Buttigieg\u2019s litany of complaints about Medicare for All. \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All would completely eliminate private insurance, forcing 150 million Americans off their current plans \u2013 including 20 million seniors on Medicare Advantage,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cPete Buttigieg has a better way to lower costs and cover everyone.\u201d As the narrators reads the script, bold text spells out each point on the screen. Health care, a topic that comes up at nearly every town hall candidates host, is widely seen as the most important issue on the minds of voters headed into the presidential election. The major distinction on the issue is between the Sanders-backed Medicare for All plan, a sweeping proposal that would overhaul the health care system in the country and create a single-payer government plan, and the Buttigieg-backed Medicare for All Who Want It plan, a more moderate approach that would not force people into government health coverage but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. Bernie Sanders and Medicare for All are at a crossroads with unions in Nevada The policy has become one of the central distinctions between Sanders, who is widely seen as the Democratic front-runner, and Buttigieg, who turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire but now needs to prove he can win in diverse states like Nevada, where voters will caucus on Saturday. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor has used Medicare for All as a way to attack Sanders as too divisive, a point the narrator makes at the end of the ad. \u201cInstead of polarization,\u201d the narrator says, \u201cProgress.\u201d Sanders has fired back, accusing Buttigieg of standing against Medicare for All because of donations he has received from the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cIn the richest country in the history of the world, it\u2019s long past time to guarantee heath care with no out-of-pocket costs to every, man, woman and child,\u201d Sanders campaign national policy director Josh Orton said Friday night. \u201cPete\u2019s plan may please his billionaire donors, but it would leave the drug companies in charge and keep costs dangerously high and unaffordable. The working people of South Carolina deserve better.\u201d Buttigieg first began hitting Sanders by name in ads about health care in October, when he began running a digital ad that called out both the Vermont senator and Massachusetts\u2019 Sen. Elizabeth Warren over the issue. But Buttigieg\u2019s decision to put the ad on television is an escalation. This story has been updated to include a response from the Sanders campaign.",

            "article_content": "Mike Bloomberg got into the Democratic primary, in large part, to stop Bernie Sanders. He may be doing the exact opposite. Sanders, after strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and with a slew of national polls showing him atop the field, is widely seen as the race\u2019s front-runner. And yet it was Bloomberg who drew the bulk of the attacks when he made his debate debut on Wednesday, allowing Sanders to step off the Las Vegas stage largely unscathed. This dynamic did not go unnoticed by a host of Democratic operatives, many of whom now believe Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is helping \u2013 not hurting \u2013 Sanders\u2019 quest to be the Democratic nominee. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cIt was dumb,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, a longtime Democratic operative who most recently worked at Hillary Clinton\u2019s communication director in 2016. \u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t want Sanders to be the nominee should have spent way more time on Bernie and less on Bloomberg.\u201d Even more impactful is how Bloomberg\u2019s poor performance \u2013 the former New York mayor struggled to defend himself from a host of attacks \u2013 actually helped elevate the other candidates on the stage, especially former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cThe Bloomberg team came into this with intentions to not be a spoiler, but what needed to happen in order for their bid to matter is Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all had to collapse,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cNone of them have collapsed \u2026 and they were all strengthened by his poor performance.\u201d Patti Solis Doyle, a longtime Democratic operative who ran Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, put a finer point on it: \u201cAfter Wednesday night, (Bloomberg) is helping Bernie. The alternative to Bernie has proven that he is not much of an alternative.\u201d She added: \u201cBloomberg was supposed to do three things and he failed at all of them. He was supposed to perform and show he could resonate with voters, that didn\u2019t work. He was supposed to have an answer to his big issues\u2026 which he did not have an answer to. And finally he was supposed to frame the election between him and Sanders and he was not able to do that because he performed so badly.\u201d Bloomberg has for weeks largely operated outside the day-to-day scramble of the Democratic primary by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on ads and campaigning in a host of Super Tuesday states that the other candidates mostly couldn\u2019t visit as they focused on contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. Bloomberg has pumped an unprecedented $464 million of his own fortune so far into White House bid He is staking his campaign on the crucial contests that will happen on March 3, when over 34% of all delegates available in the nomination fight will be up for grabs. But the former New York mayor, because of national polling, qualified for Wednesday\u2019s debate and is now more of a presence in the race, even if he isn\u2019t competing in Nevada or South Carolina. It\u2019s that timing that worries some: Instead of damaging the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign, operatives \u2013 including those working on current campaigns \u2013 now worry that he will divide the anti-Sanders votes on Super Tuesday, dilute the share that the other candidates win and, in so doing, make Sanders\u2019 haul of the over 1,300 delegates available even larger. \u201cHis entrance into the race has prevented the solidification of the field and devalued the early states that actually test candidates,\u201d said a senior Democratic operative affiliated with one of Bloomberg\u2019s rivals. \u201cBloomberg is allowing this to remain fluid while Bernie has solidified with enough for viability everywhere on Super Tuesday.\u201d Galia Slayen, a Bloomberg spokesman, emphasized the campaign\u2019s belief that the former mayor has broader appeal than Sanders. \u201cThe stakes are too high in this election to choose a candidate who appeals to a small base like Senator Sanders,\u201d Slayen said. \u201cAs Mike has said, nominating Sanders will be a fatal error. To beat Trump, we need Democrats, Independents, and Republicans to win. That was the coalition that propelled Democrats to success in the midterms \u2013 and it\u2019s the coalition we will need to win in November.\u201d But the unfolding dynamic has not only been privately and publicly cheered by Sanders\u2019 advisers, but one that they saw as a possibility months ago. Pete D\u2019Alessandro, a top adviser to Sanders in Iowa during both his presidential campaigns, said in January \u2013 before Bloomberg made the debate stage \u2013 that the race featured \u201cmore legitimate, qualified moderates\u201d than many progressives expected and that their continued viability, deep into the primary season, was something Sanders\u2019 team \u201ckind of pray happens.\u201d \u201c(Moderates) had more choices for once and they weren\u2019t able to settle on just one to come out of it,\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said, adding that the ideal scenario for Sanders would be if the majority of the Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar cohort hovered around 15% \u2013 spreading out their support to the point \u201cthere is not going to be enough moderate folks to go around to stop us.\u201d D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s comments were prescient and now Democrats opposed to Sanders worry the scenario he laid out could be playing out in the next three weeks. Sanders is poised to have a strong showing in Nevada, where most of the state\u2019s operatives believe he will finish atop the caucus. But the Vermont senator\u2019s biggest boon could come in early March, when delegate-rich states like California, Texas and Virginia are up for grabs. Sanders even seems to be picking up on this dynamic \u2013 and has relished the fact that a man who represents the physical manifestation of the kind of enemy he has looked to stand up against for decades is now running against him. In an interview with CNN after the debate, Sanders classified Bloomberg as a man who \u201cinitiated these horrific, racist polices in New York City of stop and frisk,\u201d \u201copposed raising the minimum wage\u201d and \u201ccalled for the cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d \u201cIf Mr. Bloomberg thinks that is an agenda that is going to rally the American people,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cI think he is sorely, sorely mistaken.\u201d It\u2019s an argument that is familiar to Sanders. But now, with Bloomberg in the race, the Vermont senator has perhaps his clearest \u2013 and easiest \u2013 contrast yet. Sanders, speaking about his record of standing up to billionaires like Bloomberg, but an even finer point on it: \u201cThat is what I\u2019ve been doing my entire life.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A mysterious PAC that emerged earlier this year in the US Senate race in North Carolina and propped up insurgent Democratic State Sen. Erica Smith in the Democratic primary was backed by a group aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Federal Election Commission filing reveals. The Senate Leadership Fund funneled nearly $3 million into the Faith and Power PAC, according to the FEC filing. They spent more than $2.4 million of it on a well-known media buyer Neylan and Partners, which has been affiliated with Republican campaigns in the past. The ads in support of Smith began appearing in the state in recent weeks ahead of the March 3 primary in North Carolina and touted her support for liberal policies like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s the Democrat for US Senate endorsed by progressives and unions? Erica Smith,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator said. \u201cWho\u2019s got the courage to vote for \u2018Medicare for All\u2019? Erica Smith. The number one supporter of the Green New Deal? Erica Smith again.\u201d Smith, a relatively unknown state senator who has reported just around $200,000 in her own campaign coffers, is running against veteran and former state senator Cal Cunningham who won the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and has been considered as a serious challenger to incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. Cunningham lost a Democratic primary in 2010 against Elaine Marshall. Cunningham\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Rachel Petri tweeted that it was \u201chilarious that Washington GOP is patting itself on the back for its $3 million admission that @SenThomTillis is their weakest incumbent and they don\u2019t want him to run against @CalforNC.\u201d The move is straight from past Senate-cycle playbooks. In 2014 when then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, invested money to elevate Todd Akin in the Republican primary in her state. Akin eventually went on to be the nominee and lost the race against McCaskill after making inartful and inaccurate comments about \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis, up for reelection, runs on opposition to impeachment The Faith and Power PAC had raised eyebrows of Democrats in the state and in Washington who had grown worried about the sheer amount of money that was pouring in from the mystery group. The ads in the state sought to introduce voters to Smith, but the Senate Leadership Fund says it forced Democrats to spend early to defend Cunningham and ensure he won the nomination in a race that hadn\u2019t been competitive up to that point. \u201cWe stole a page out of Chuck Schumer\u2019s playbook, and it\u2019s been more successful than we could have imagined. Democrats are burning cash in a $13 million rescue mission for Cal Cunningham, who has proven to be a lackluster candidate with less money in the bank today than the beginning of the year,\u201d said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. \u201cIf you add in the fact that Cunningham felt pressured to say he would support Bernie Sanders, I\u2019d call this an unqualified success. We got a lot more for our money than when Democrats spent millions in Thom Tillis\u2019 primary six years ago.\u201d North Carolina is crucial for Democrats hoping to retake the Senate in 2020. Democrats need to have a net win of four seats to win back the majority and are investing heavily in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina and Georgia.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The latest in President Donald Trump\u2019s chaos: The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump edged out his acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, because Maguire briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill about Russian meddling in the 2020 election. Reminder: Maguire took over the intelligence post last summer, just as the Ukraine scandal was erupting. At the time Trump called the longtime Navy SEAL an \u201cexcellent\u201d choice. Now he\u2019s been replaced by Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who has no intelligence experience. Also Thursday, Trump\u2019s friend and political adviser Roger Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison. This, after Trump complained about the length of the sentence requested by prosecutors, prompting his attorney general to undercut their recommendation. Trump said after the sentencing that he\u2019s not quite ready to pardon Stone. In their collective effort to neutralize Mike Bloomberg and his capitalist billions, Democratic presidential candidates may be essentially handing their nomination to Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who seems primed to romp in Nevada on Saturday and beyond. Time and voters will tell, obviously, but in the hours after Wednesday\u2019s Democratic debate, the conventional wisdom gelled as it has not before. Here it is, briefly: The democratic socialist senator from Vermont stands the best chance of amassing the delegates to be the Democratic nominee for President. Nevada is Saturday, but Super Tuesday is now. Almost a million absentee ballots have already been returned in California, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. And hundreds of thousands more have voted in Texas. Those two states, the biggest delegate pots of all, will shape the Democratic race. Republicans and Trump are licking their lips. The other conventional wisdom is that the GOP is giddy at the thought of running a national presidential campaign against someone who wants to tear up the US health insurance system, root and branch, and have the government pay for it all. But Sanders\u2019 contention that his grassroots army will catch fire may come to pass. Thought bubble: In a general election campaign, Trump would be defending his record, while Sanders would be pushing for radical change, especially on health care. (Reminder: The status quo means Obamacare, which Trump has repeatedly tried and failed to kill.) Sanders, who backs a government-run Medicare for All program, has said that not even a public option is acceptable. Medicare for All, he said at a CNN town hall, is already compromise enough. And that, more than his support for socialism, is what sets Sanders apart. His candidacy, more than anyone else\u2019s, would allow Trump, who has done so much to disrupt the status quo, to run as the person protecting the status quo. It\u2019s a status quo that allows billionaires to flourish, no doubt. Change can be scary. Maybe it\u2019s time for the country to expand benefits it currently reserves for the old, the disabled and the poor to everyone. But boy, would it be a switch. Climate change is also scary. But people in Pennsylvania like jobs. Another example, just from Wednesday night, is Sanders\u2019 pledge to support a Green New Deal, ban fracking and end US reliance on natural gas. Problem is fracking, despite its troubles, is a boon to the Pennsylvania economy. Now, a fracking ban is not going to pass through Congress without serious changes. But support for one could be a devastating tool in Pennsylvania. Related: Watch this Christiane Amanpour interview with Pennsylvania\u2019s Lt. Gov., John Fetterman, on how it became a 2020 issue. One key difference: We know Trump will bring his organizational chaos. We don\u2019t know what a Sanders administration would be like, but his ability to deliver on his promise is highly in doubt. There is almost no chance Sanders can deliver Medicare for All or a wealth tax without huge Democratic gains in the Senate. CNN senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein wrote in The Atlantic that by piling on Bloomberg, the candidates on stage went after the wrong guy (at least from their own selfish perspectives). \u201cIt took the moderators to remind the candidates of the big picture as Sanders establishes some separation from the field. Chuck Todd asked a question that I believe will become a frequent topic of conversation among Democrats in the weeks ahead: Do you believe the party should nominate the candidate who arrives at the July convention with the most delegates, even if no one has the 1,991 delegates required for a first-ballot victory? All the contenders effectively said no, except for Sanders\u2014who insisted that \u201cthe will of the people should prevail.\u201d With those answers, the candidates chasing Sanders pointedly left themselves room to resist his nomination at the convention if he arrives with a plurality, but not a majority, of the delegates. But by and large, they did surprisingly little to reduce the odds that Sanders will, in fact, arrive in Milwaukee with more delegates than anyone else. Nevada will pit unions vs. Medicare for All. Sanders has long been an advocate for workers, but the most immediate question is whether unions, who fought for benefits in lieu of compensation, will accept his ideas. That\u2019s going to be a huge question in Nevada, write CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby and Greg Krieg. Read more. After the debate Wednesday, I wrote about the moment in which it was pointed out to Sanders that a recent NBC / WSJ poll showed a strong majority of US voters aren\u2019t comfortable with a socialist candidate. That\u2019s a finding borne out in other polling. Sanders deflected, artfully, and glossed over that fact by pointing out that he was leading the Democratic field in that poll (it also showed him with a slim lead over Trump in a hypothetical matchup). He ignored the underlying point in the poll that socialism has issues among the majority of American voters in these polls. Read the whole thing here. And wow, did I get an earful from Sanders supporters, who filled up my Twitter feed and Facebook with Trump-level insults, nitpicking and hate. Their gripes included: Democratic socialism is not socialism. Fine. But the question put to Sanders was about socialism. The question in the polling was about socialism. Sanders did not correct the moderators that he\u2019s a democratic socialist. I mischaracterized Medicare for All. I said it would cancel the US health system and replace it with something government-run. Some tweeters said it was just a change to the way Americans bill health care. Others said that by writing what I did, I was actively trying to keep Americans from hospital care. Whatever you think, Medicare for All outlaws private health insurance. That may be a good idea in a time of skyrocketing premiums. But the way it holds premiums down is by erasing the insurance industry and putting the government in charge of payments and paying doctors. All of the trillions that states, people and their employers pay into the health system each year would be paid instead by the federal government. Of course that will affect the end-user health system. Others called me a shill for Bloomberg, a corporate stooge, stupid, uninformed. There\u2019s good argument that the country needs to be more open to democratic socialism, but it\u2019s also a fact in current polling that it is a divisive idea and it\u2019s a sure thing Trump will use it against Sanders. Reflexive attacks are an ineffective way to change minds. If you\u2019ve seen Barack Obama recently, it\u2019s in the wall-to-wall ads being aired by Michael Bloomberg. The former President has kept his powder extremely dry in this primary, perhaps so he can rally the party around the eventual nominee if things get ugly. But Sanders told CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles today that he is in fairly regular contact with Obama. They\u2019ve spoken \u201ca couple of times in the last month or two.\u201d Sanders called Obama \u201ciconic\u201d and said he is confident that should he win the nomination that Obama will play a crucial role in helping him with the White House. Sanders has previously voiced his policy disagreements with the former President, Nobles writes, but today Sanders spoke warmly about his relationship with Obama, saying that while they aren\u2019t the \u201cbest of friends\u201d that they are \u201cfriends\u201d. Sanders went on to say that he had the \u201cutmost confidence\u201d that Obama will be there to support him if and when he wins the nomination. The American system of government has been challenged to deal with a singular President and a divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Before we get to President Donald Trump and Julian Assange and the ongoing saga of the President\u2019s pardons \u2026 it\u2019s fight night in Las Vegas. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who calls himself a democratic socialist and who demonizes billionaires, is the front-runner in polling. But Michael Bloomberg, a Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat who is spending his own billions to become president, will be on the debate stage for the first time on Wednesday. This is the capitalism vs. socialism standoff that nerds like me have been waiting for. CNN\u2019s MJ Lee documents Bloomberg\u2019s alleged history of inappropriate, sexist comments and how he\u2019s dealt with harassment suits involving his privately held financial data and media company. Add that to questionable comments that have surfaced about so many other things \u2013 redlining, stop-and-frisk, transgender people \u2013 you name it, he\u2019s apparently said it. He clearly hopes that liberal voters will ignore the distasteful things he\u2019s accused of saying because they think his giant pocketbook, which he\u2019s opened for gun control and climate change since leaving office as mayor of New York, can help him defeat Trump. Sanders, meanwhile, has a transparency problem and it\u2019s straight out of Trump\u2019s playbook. He had a heart attack last year and now won\u2019t release health records. And his communications director slung mud about Bloomberg\u2019s health \u2013 she later said she had misspoken \u2013 as she appeared to take umbrage at the very idea that a man in his late 70s should be up-front about his health. You should definitely watch her exchange with John Berman on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d this morning. Also listen to David Chalian talk to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny about what to expect from the debate on the Daily DC podcast. The debate starts at 9 p.m. ET on NBC. CNN\u2019s political and issues teams will be covering it and fact-checking it. The American political system was built on forcing compromise. That has fallen away in the current political climate, but even freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocaso-Cortez of New York \u2013 a favorite target for Republicans \u2013 recently acknowledged that a half-measure public option health plan might be an acceptable compromise because \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d Sanders\u2019 controversial signature proposal, cannot pass in this political environment. But Sanders, at a CNN town hall Tuesday night, said he thinks Medicare for All, which would outlaw private health insurance, IS already enough of a compromise. Full stop. It is a statement of fact that Sanders, in debates and interviews and everywhere else, refuses to acknowledge the political reality that it\u2019s possible not even a majority of Democrats in the Senate would support Medicare for All, much less any Republicans. But he has not yet had to stand up to scrutiny for the fact that the policy proposal he is selling feels, in this political reality, completely unattainable. And it should be clear to every Democrat and voter that he refuses to find middle ground on it. \u201cNever let gaffes (or scandal) be the last thing said about you \u2026 \u201c Azi Paybarah of The New York Times, who covered Bloomberg\u2019s years as New York mayor, talked to CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza about what kind of debater Bloomberg is. This passage stuck out: Paybarah: Tonight will be a stress test for Bloomberg: How many times can he get questioned about his spending, and stop-and-frisk, and red-lining, and the nondisclosure agreements at his company, and extending term limits, and surveilling mosques, before he rolls his eyes, sighs heavily, and blurts out something that becomes his Dean scream? But unlike Howard Dean (and every other candidate not named Tom Steyer), Bloomberg doesn\u2019t need donors to give him money to keep going. And if there\u2019s anything Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Al Sharpton, Eliot Spitzer, Anthony Weiner and a host of other New Yorkers have taught us, it\u2019s to keep going, and never let gaffes (or scandal) be the last thing that is said about you. A last-minute super PAC has formed to give Elizabeth Warren some air support in Nevada. Amy Klobuchar, too. Don\u2019t hate the player, hate the game. Warren is a longtime critic of super PACs and her campaign says her opposition to them has not changed. And the reality is that campaigns cannot (technically, anyway) coordinate with a super PAC. Since they\u2019re legal, supporters will do what they want. And, particularly when it comes to the general election, Warren or Bernie Sanders, if they win the nomination, can talk about how they oppose super PACs all they want. But people who oppose Donald Trump are going to spend their money how they want to. Pentagon official forced out. CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto and Barbara Starr report that Trump wanted John Rood, a Defense Department official who had raised concerns about withholding aid to Ukraine, gone. He wasn\u2019t a public face of the impeachment inquiry, but you can put the departure of Rood, the Pentagon\u2019s top policy official, alongside the ousters of so many other people who had anything to do with raising flags about the behavior for which Trump was impeached. And a reward for a supporter. Sort of. Trump named Richard Grenell, a close supporter and the current ambassador to Germany, to be another acting director of national intelligence. Grenell tweets in the model of his boss, and this marks a swift ascent for a campaign operative to one of the highest posts in government, albeit temporarily. Trump must name a successor to current acting DNI Joseph Maguire by March 11 since he never nominated a permanent replacement for senators to confirm. Trump\u2019s got a demonstrated soft spot for issuing pardons, and he\u2019s also got a history of trying to cover up scrutiny into how Russia tried to help him win in 2016, so who knows how to treat this shocking new allegation by Julian Assange\u2019s lawyer. In a London court, lawyer Edward Fitzgerald claimed that former Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California went to visit Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on the instruction of the \u201cPresident.\u201d According to the statement described by Fitzgerald, Rohrabacher\u2019s mission was to offer Assange a US pardon if he would \u201cplay ball\u201d by saying the Russians had nothing to do with the leak \u2013 an assertion Assange had previously made. White House press decretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Fitzgerald\u2019s claim as \u201ca total lie.\u201d Michael Gerson was a speechwriter for President George W. Bush. He writes in The Washington Post that Republican lawmakers have shown themselves to be cowards. Read it now. The key passage: Accusing the President of authoritarian tactics once seemed exaggerated. Now it is a fair description of the day\u2019s news. A pattern of presidential misbehavior has become a crisis in the rule of law. Those who ignore Trump\u2019s actions may think they are staying in the shadows, but they are actually in the hot spotlight of history. Every Republican who has lectured others on their insufficient respect for the Constitution now has the chance to defend the constitutional order from the despotic populism the founders most feared. But nearly all of them have failed. When the moment of testing came, they were absent without leave. The American system of government has been challenged to deal with a singular President and a divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House. Stay tuned to this newsletter as we keep watch over the Trump administration, the 2020 presidential campaign and other issues of critical interest.",

            "article_content": "Michael Bloomberg\u2019s billions got him onto the debate stage \u2013 but did nothing to spare him from the barrage he faced Wednesday night here in Las Vegas. In the most fiery and contentious Democratic primary debate yet, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led a non-stop barrage against the former New York City mayor who was appearing on stage for the first time. She kicked it off by calling him an \u201carrogant billionaire\u201d who \u201ccalls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians.\u201d Then everyone else jumped in. Mike Bloomberg gets badly roughed up in debate that tests his unconventional campaign Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused Bloomberg of \u201chiding behind his TV ads.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden hammered him for opposing Obamacare. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacked Bloomberg\u2019s support for stop-and-frisk policing in his first answer of the night. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg called him \u201ca billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.\u201d The pile-on against Bloomberg came three days before the Nevada caucuses, as candidates trailing Sanders and with nowhere near Bloomberg\u2019s money are desperate to prove they deserve to remain in the race as it narrows. Here are six takeaways from the ninth Democratic presidential debate: Democratic voters have been laser-focused on electability \u2013 and Bloomberg\u2019s willingness to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising campaign had lent him the perception of it in recent weeks, as he\u2019s jumped into double digits in national polls. That perception might have been shattered Wednesday night. Bloomberg had answers for none of the criticism about his previous support for stop-and-frisk policing, his opposition to Obamacare, offensive remarks about women or why he hasn\u2019t yet released his tax returns. His worst moment came when Warren and Biden challenged him to release women who alleged sexism and misogynistic behavior by Bloomberg and at his company from non-disclosure agreements. Warren said those women were \u201cbeing muzzled\u201d and that \u201cthe drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against\u201d would be a massive liability in a general election. Chris Cillizza's winners and losers from the 9th Democratic debate But Bloomberg didn\u2019t address any of their criticisms, and wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cNone of them accuse me of doing anything other than, maybe they didn\u2019t like a joke I told,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI\u2019m simply not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect they will stay private,\u201d he added. Desperate for a return to the spotlight after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren installed herself as the leading attacker in the debate\u2019s opening minutes. She eviscerated Bloomberg\u2019s deflection on a question about allegations of misogynistic behavior at his company after he highlighted female executives there and at his philanthropy. Elizabeth Warren gives her campaign much-needed boost with fiery debate performance \u201cI hope you heard what his defense was: I\u2019ve been nice to some women,\u201d she said. \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d And while Bloomberg got the worst of it, Warren spent the whole night on offense. In a single, memorable answer, Warren lambasted three of her opponents\u2019 health care plans. She called Buttigieg\u2019s proposal \u201ca slogan that was thought up by his consultants.\u201d Klobuchar\u2019s, she said, was \u201clike a Post-It note.\u201d And she said Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan \u2013 which Warren largely backs \u2013 is hurt because \u201chis campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work.\u201d For the first time in this long primary campaign, Sanders took the debate stage as its national front-runner. But unlike others who have held that unofficial mantle, and carried the target that comes with it, Sanders emerged from the experience mostly unscathed. The Vermont senator faced familiar lines of attack \u2013 that his democratic socialism makes him unelectable and that his Medicare for All plan is unpractical \u2013 but Bloomberg\u2019s presence altered the dynamics of the debate enough that Sanders was able to stick to his message and avoid being dragged into deeper waters by his rivals. Fact-checking the Las Vegas Democratic debate Bloomberg also gave Sanders a fresh target: a real, live billionaire onstage to hammer when he spoke about income inequality. \u201cMike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans,\u201d Sanders said at one point. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s immoral, that should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, when we kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt.\u201d Buttigieg came into the debate focused on denting the front-runner, Sanders, while offering himself as a cogent moderate alternative to Bloomberg. And in moments, he was able to do that \u2013 calling on Sanders to \u201caccept some responsibility\u201d for the virulent comments his supporters have made online and calling the Vermont senator a \u201csocialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil.\u201d But the mayor\u2019s debate performance was also defined by attacks leveled against him from across the stage, primarily by Klobuchar \u2013 who mockingly quipped she wished \u201ceveryone was as perfect as you, Pete.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s strategy of largely avoiding Bloomberg, who drew most of the fire on the debate stage, was clear. But just as apparent was how Buttigieg, despite leading the national delegate count after two states have voted, was searching for a moment that propels him forward as the Democratic race for president goes national. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wake up as a party,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg.\u201d Klobuchar has turned in a series of strong debate performances throughout her presidential run \u2013 usually happy-warrior performances with jokes sprinkled in. But Wednesday\u2019s was singular for another reason: The contempt she showed for Buttigieg and the frustration she has for Warren. Klobuchar, at different points throughout the debate, turned to her left to take on Buttigieg with a fire that she hadn\u2019t previously shown on the debate stage. She accused the former mayor of calling her dumb and suggested that his entire candidacy was based on him memorizing \u201ca bunch of talking points.\u201d And when Warren hit Klobuchar for wanting to work with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Minnesota senator tersely said, \u201cI am willing to work with people and find common ground and that\u2019s what we want in a president, Elizabeth.\u201d There is no love lost between Buttigieg and Klobuchar \u2013 a reality that was clear headed into the debate. And Klobuchar showed she believes Warren\u2019s style of leadership is divisive. But her fiery performance in Las Vegas was a divergence from the approach that had worked so well for her in New Hampshire \u2013 and highlighted how desperately she needs a memorable moment to keep her campaign going as the pace of primaries ramps up. With such a crowded field, there is a real possibility that Democrats will go to their summer convention in Milwaukee with none of the candidates having clinched the nomination. So, what then? For five of the six candidates onstage, the answer was to roll the dice, perhaps allow superdelegates in on a second ballot and, as a couple put it, \u201clet the process play out.\u201d Bloomberg, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all said that a candidate with a plurality of delegates should not automatically be handed the nomination. Sanders, who could very well find himself in that position, was the lone voice of dissent. He said that the campaign with the most delegates, even if it fails to collect an outright majority, should win the nomination. If what many Democrats consider a doomsday scenario occurs, and none of the hopefuls secure enough support to win the nomination on a first ballot, the contest could hinge on the preferences of nearly 800 superdelegates. And that, as anyone who remembers the controversy surrounding their impact in 2016 will recall, could be a recipe for an intra-party meltdown that would make the tough primary of four years ago look like tame.",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren delivered a shot of adrenaline to her wobbling campaign during a ferocious debate performance on Wednesday night in Las Vegas. The Massachusetts senator finished off pace in the first two contests of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, raising doubts over her path to the nomination and questions about her staying power. But with her campaign possibly on the line and, many have suggested, on the ropes, Warren turned in a masterclass that translated into a fundraising haul of more than $1 million over less than two hours, according to a tweet from her chief mobilization officer. That fresh infusion of cash is critical to Warren\u2019s hopes of outrunning her rivals over what her campaign has insisted will be a marathon primary season. She hammered the moderates over their more modest plans, jabbed Sen. Bernie Sanders over his campaign\u2019s tactics and hacked away, throughout the night, at former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Warren has tended to drift in and out of past debates, but the billionaire former mayor\u2019s presence, directly to her right, seemed to invigorate her. She shot out of the gates arguing that Bloomberg\u2019s record made him unelectable and, to Democrats, simply unacceptable. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against, a billionaire who calls women \u2018fat broads\u2019 and \u2018horse-faced lesbians.\u2019 And, no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump,\u201d Warren said in the opening minutes. \u201cI\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d The audience gasped, but Warren was only getting started. \u201cDemocrats are not going to win,\u201d she said, \u201cif we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and \u2018stop and frisk.\u2019\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, waiting on deck, took it from there and, with barely a 15 minutes gone,  Bloomberg, making his debate stage debut, had been struck back on his heels. Later on, when Bloomberg was asked by a moderator about his 2015 comments, in which he talked up \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and said that minority communities were disproportionately targeted because \u201cthat\u2019s where all the crime is,\u201d Warren pounced again, this time targeting the rationale behind his disavowal of the practice. \u201cWhen the mayor says that he apologized, listen very closely to the apology,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe language he used is about stop and frisk. It\u2019s about how it turned out. No, this isn\u2019t about how it turned out. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with.\u201d The crowd in Las Vegas cheered as Warren continued, reminding voters that Bloomberg had defended the policy throughout his three terms as mayor, even amid protests and a court ruling it unconstitutional. \u201cYou need a different apology here, Mr. Mayor,\u201d Warren said. The onslaught continued when Bloomberg, confronted with allegations of misogynistic behavior at his company, sought to pivot away from those damning reports and highlight the number of women he\u2019d promoted both in the private sector and while in public office. Warren, who has already been critical of Bloomberg on this front, was given the first opportunity to respond. \u201cI hope you heard what his defense was \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ve been nice to some women. That just doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d she said, before putting Bloomberg on the spot over reports that dozens of other women had left his company and signed nondisclosure agreements that, to this day and beyond, prevent them from publicly discussing their experiences. Bloomberg said the number of NDAs had been overstated, but didn\u2019t provide a precise number. Three times Warren cut in to ask for a specific figure and three times Bloomberg demurred. He also turned down her suggestion that he release the women from those arrangements. \u201cWe are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements,\u201d Warren said, \u201cand the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against.\u201d Warren\u2019s showing delighted some of her highest profile supporters. Nelini Stamp, the director of strategy and partnerships at the progressive Working Families Party, hailed the performance of a candidate the organization endorsed months ago. Bloomberg says he won't release women from confidentiality agreements when pressed by Warren \u201cTonight we saw Elizabeth Warren doing what she does best: Standing up for working families against a billionaire who believes elections can be bought, and who thinks his abusive behavior towards people of color, Muslims, and women can be laundered with nine-figure ad blitz,\u201d Stamp said in a statement as aides and allies cheered on Twitter and during cable news appearances after the debate. Warren also drew an enthusiastic response from the audience when the debate wended its way to the climate crisis. \u201cI want to make sure that the question of environmental justice gets more than a glancing blow in this debate,\u201d she said, before again being cut off by applause. \u201cBecause for generations now in this country, toxic waste dumps, polluting factories have been located in or near communities of color, over and over and over.\u201d And when health care came up, a topic that has been unkind to Warren in the past, she fired off a tight round of criticism to both her right and left. Plans from Klobuchar and Buttigieg, Warren said, were thin and, even if they were realized, would fall short of her more ambitious goal of passing \u201cMedicare for All\u201d by the end of her first term in office. \u201cMayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care. It\u2019s not a plan. It\u2019s a PowerPoint,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Amy\u2019s plan is even less.  It\u2019s like a Post-It note, \u2018Insert Plan Here.\u201d Warren even slipped in a dig at Sanders, if not over his ambitions, then how he and his allies have made the case for them. \u201cInstead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead, his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work,\u201d she said. Warren summarized her own approach, which she cast as more pragmatic: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get it all the first time,\u201d she said, \u201ctake the win and come back into the fight to ask for more.\u201d Her campaign and its supporters will certainly take Wednesday night\u2019s showing as a sign Warren is ready to do just that.",

            "article_content": "Michael Bloomberg, come on down. The former New York mayor qualified for Wednesday night\u2019s debate on the eve of the critical contest, injecting a combustible new element into an already volatile primary fight. The other five candidates slated to be on stage with Bloomberg just days before the Nevada caucuses have shown an ability \u2013 and even an eagerness \u2013 to go after the new entrant. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued Bloomberg\u2019s money and record won\u2019t help motivate the Democratic base. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has labeled Bloomberg a \u201cbillionaire who thinks that you can just \u2026 buy your way on to television and win that way.\u201d And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, hours after Bloomberg qualified, compared him to President Donald Trump and called him an \u201cegomaniac billionaire.\u201d But Bloomberg is not coming into the debate defenseless. The former mayor has maintained a focus on Sanders in the day leading up to the debate, hoping that an intense back-and-forth between the two will further cement them as the race\u2019s frontrunners. He has questioned Sanders\u2019 commitment to a clean campaign, pointing to the hard attacks the senator\u2019s supporters online level against his opponents. For candidates like Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg\u2019s entry represents the greatest threat to any momentum they still have from Iowa and New Hampshire. The Democratic debate \u2013 beyond Bloomberg \u2013 is at an inflection point for Biden and Warren, both of whom need to demonstrate the ability to do well after poor performances in New Hampshire. Here is what to watch for in Wednesday\u2019s debate ahead of the Nevada caucuses: Bloomberg\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars in television advertisements have led to this moment: Two-plus hours on stage, unscripted and televised, against opponents who have been rearing to attack him for weeks. The former New York City mayor\u2019s presence on stage is the biggest new factor in Democratic debates for months: Other candidates have exited amid weak polling numbers, but he\u2019s entering as a central figure in the Democratic race. By jumping into the race late, skipping the first four states to vote in the Democratic nominating contest and refusing donations, Bloomberg has avoided debates up until now. But his hundreds of millions of dollars in ad spending has him polling in double digits nationally \u2013 which means, under the Democratic National Committee\u2019s recently tweaked qualification thresholds, he\u2019s in. And his rivals are waiting for him. In CNN town halls Tuesday night in Las Vegas, Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all said Bloomberg was attempting to buy the election. Sanders previewed an attack on Bloomberg over stop-and-frisk policing. And Klobuchar said she\u2019s glad to get a shot at debating the former New York City mayor. \u201cI actually thought he should be on the debate stage because I don\u2019t think you should just be able to buy your way to the presidency,\u201d she said. Bloomberg\u2019s first debate appearance comes amid a barrage of damaging headlines, largely focused on his previous comments about and support for policies widely seen as discriminatory \u2013 including stop-and-frisk policing and redlining. He will also likely face questions over allegations that he made crude remarks and fostered a culture of discrimination against women at Bloomberg L.P. during the late 1980s and 1990s. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has signaled an eagerness to take on Sanders, with his campaign increasingly criticizing the tactics of the Vermont senator\u2019s sometimes rabid online following. Previous frontrunners have had a torrid time on debate nights, getting hit from all angles, with their rivals often unfurling new or unexpected lines of attack. Sanders should expect no less on Wednesday, when the moderate contenders are expected to pick relentlessly at \u201cMedicare for All\u201d in a bid to get in good with Nevada\u2019s powerful Culinary Union, which opposes the plan. Bloomberg looks likely to jump on that dogpile, but an even better bet to escalate accusations that Sanders\u2019 surrogates are playing dirty \u2013 and that the Vermont senator either hasn\u2019t done enough to stop them or is in some way tacitly encouraging it. Sanders has, in public, repeatedly said that \u201cthere is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online,\u201d but that is unlikely to quiet the issue. And at a CNN town hall Tuesday night, Sanders put a finer point on it: \u201cI do not believe in online bullying. End of discussion\u201d The question for Sanders, then, is whether he can deliver the message he wants and not get bogged down by the incoming fire. Sanders is a mostly disciplined debater, hard to knock off script, but he will be under the microscope here and even the smallest blunder \u2013 or misfired attack \u2013 could open up a whopping can of new backlash. Still, Bloomberg\u2019s presence could break to Sanders\u2019 benefit. The heavy-spending billionaire is new to the primary debate stage and represents a new foil for the populists, and perhaps some of the moderates who see him encroaching on their support, to feast on. There isn\u2019t much love lost between Buttigieg and Klobuchar. The two moderates have repeatedly used the debate stage to air their grievances with each other, with the Minnesota senator targeting the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor for his youth and experience on the local level as a way to blunt his rise. Klobuchar, unlike other candidates, has perplexed Buttigieg on the debate stage. Where he has effectively counter punted against attacks from Warren, Biden and Sanders, Buttigieg hasn\u2019t been able to hit Klobuchar with the same fire \u2013 and the Minnesota senator is now surging after a strong debate performance and third place finish in New Hampshire. That\u2019s why Klobuchar bungling an interview in Nevada and awkwardly being unable to name the President of Mexico could provide a flash point in Wednesday\u2019s contest. Buttigieg, who was able to name Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, hit Klobuchar for her inability to answer the question on Sunday, telling a crowd of supporters in Las Vegas that the misstep shows \u201cthat there is more to being prepared than how many years you spent in Washington.\u201d Klobuchar, for her part, has looked to cast Buttigieg as a \u201cnewcomer\u201d with no political record. This fight will have a new resonance on Wednesday given the role Bloomberg is expected to play in the debate. The former New York Mayor, by offering a similar set of moderate policy prescriptions as Buttigieg and Klobuchar, is looking to court some of the same voters and conversations with supporters of each campaign here in Nevada highlight how Bloomberg has made inroads with moderate Democrats. And Bloomberg has a $60 billion personal fortune to use to get that message out, something neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar can come close to touching. This is the turning point Biden has been promising. Written off by many (including Bloomberg, whose campaign is arguing it\u2019s a two-man race between the former mayor and Sanders) after a fourth-place finish in Iowa and a fifth-place showing in New Hampshire, Biden is on more comfortable territory in a state with a much larger share of non-white voters. But the former vice president appears to have lost some benefit of the doubt: The powerful Culinary Union praised him, but didn\u2019t endorse him. Former Sen. Harry Reid said he thinks Biden could win, but didn\u2019t caucus for him. His fundraising, which has already lagged some of his rivals, faces the threat of donors frozen by Bloomberg\u2019s billions or eyeing moderate alternatives like Buttigieg or Klobuchar \u2014 right at the moment Biden needs to drastically scale up for Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote on March 3. Now, he\u2019ll try to build momentum on the debate stage \u2013 where he looked feistier than he had before a week ago in New Hampshire. The question is, which of the many threats he faces will Biden target? Will it be Sanders, whose support among Latinos has become a major asset? Or Buttigieg or Klobuchar, who are part of a crowded centrist lane? In recent days, Biden has hinted he\u2019s most eager to take on Bloomberg \u2013 who is using former President Barack Obama\u2019s voice and praise in a national advertising campaign against Obama\u2019s former vice president. In an interview on MSNBC this week, he lambasted Bloomberg over stop-and-frisk policing policies, his failure to endorse then-Sen. Obama in 2008 and his position on Obamacare. \u201cThis is a guy that talked about Obamacare being a disaster and about how he wouldn\u2019t support our administration in 2008, so there\u2019s a lot to discuss with Michael,\u201d Biden said. Warren\u2019s staunchest supporters are upset. After a pair of disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, they feel like the Massachusetts senator has been written off and out of the narrative around a primary still in its earliest stages. But Warren has an opportunity, perhaps a final one, on Wednesday night to change the conversation. And if there\u2019s any doubt it\u2019s still possible at this stage, she only needs to look over at Klobuchar, who used her performance at the Granite State debate as a launching pad for a surprisingly strong finish there a few days later. Warren has cast herself repeatedly as a unity candidate, which will make it a tougher task, but she has shown a willingness in recent days to hit out hard at some of her rivals. On Tuesday, she offered a preview of what might be coming. \u201cMike Bloomberg approved and oversaw a program that surveilled and tracked Muslim communities in mosques, restaurants, and even college campuses \u2013leaving permanent damage. He refuses to apologize for it,\u201d she tweeted. Warren also had some harsh words for Sanders the night before, saying he \u201chas a lot of questions to answer\u201d about the behavior of his supporters online. \u201cI am particularly worried about what happened in the attacks on members of the Culinary Union, particularly on the women in leadership,\u201d Warren told NBC News. \u201cThat is not how we build an inclusive Democratic Party. And it is not how we (beat) Donald Trump. We do not build on a foundation of hate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday granted clemency to 11 individuals, using his presidential pardon power to political advantage in many highly politically sensitive cases. The wave of seven pardons and four commutations, some of which Trump has been considering for years, came amid a post-impeachment flurry of presidential prerogative, from ridding his team of aides he deemed disloyal to flagrantly inserting himself into Justice Department matters. The White House did not provide evidence of a detailed pardon process conducted through the Justice Department, and the President did not explain his decisions at length. But Trump called one of the sentences \u201cridiculous\u201d and said he relied on recommendations from others to make the decisions. \u201cThese are all people that you have to see the recommendations. I rely on recommendations, very importantly,\u201d he told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base before departing for a western swing Tuesday afternoon. The 11 individuals included convicted white-collar criminals and the former Illinois governor accused of attempting to sell a US senate seat. Here are the individuals who received clemency: Trump commuted the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat and former contestant on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d who served eight years of a 14-year sentence for the pay-for-play charges. He was released from prison Tuesday. \u201cHe served eight years in jail, a long time. He seems like a very nice person, don\u2019t know him,\u201d Trump said, calling his sentence \u201cridiculous\u201d and suggesting the television appeals of Blagojevich\u2019s wife Patti helped cement his decision. Aides had worked to convince Trump against reducing Blagojevich\u2019s sentence, believing it would play poorly. And Republican members of Congress lobbied Trump to drop the idea. But inside the White House, Jared Kushner championed efforts to pardon or commute the former governor\u2019s sentence. On Tuesday, Trump linked Blagojevich\u2019s prosecution to a longtime foe, former FBI Director James Comey, a close friend of former US attorney in Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald, who led the prosecution against Blagojevich. \u201cIt was a prosecution by the same people \u2013 Comey, Fitzpatrick \u2013 the same group,\u201d Trump said, misstating the Illinois US attorney\u2019s surname. Trump granted clemency to former San Francisco 49ers team owner Eddie DeBartolo. DeBartolo pleaded guilty in 1998 to failing to report a felony in a bribery case, which led to former Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards getting sent to federal prison. DeBartolo did not serve jail time, but he agreed to pay up to $1 million in fines. He also relinquished ownership of the 49ers to his sister, Denise York. Former 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice told press at the White House Tuesday morning that Trump and a group advocating for DeBartolo discussed what the former 49ers owner had done on and off the field. \u201cI think with Eddie and what he has accomplished, what he has done on the football field, off the football field a lot of charity work so we talked about that,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWe talked about just being great. You know, trying to be the greatest of all time. And you know, I take my hat off for Donald Trump and what he did.\u201d Trump granted a pardon to legendary 1980s junk bond king Michael Milken, who served 22 months of a 10year prison sentence for violating securities laws and has since become a prominent philanthropist. Milken rose to prominence on Wall Street in the 1980s as the head of the high-yield bond department, also known as junk bonds, at the now defunct firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Milken was accused of taking part in an insider trading scheme and eventually pleaded guilty to several counts of securities violations tied to a scandal with former stock trader Ivan Boesky. He also paid a $600 million fine and was banned from the securities industry. Since his release from prison in 1993, Milken, now 73 and a survivor of prostate cancer, has become a major donor to charities funding cancer research. He also started up the Milken Institute, a leading nonprofit and nonpartisan economic research firm that holds a major conference every spring attended by many A-listers in the world of finance. Trump told reporters Milken has \u201cdone an incredible job for the world with all his research on cancer\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s suffered greatly. He paid a big price.\u201d Trump pardoned former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik, who once served three years in federal prison for charges including tax fraud and lying to officials. Kerik was nominated as homeland security secretary by President George W. Bush but withdrew from consideration due to potential tax violations. Kerik, a former business partner of Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, helped with the case of Navy SEAL chief Edward \u201cEddie\u201d Gallagher, who was convicted of bringing discredit to the armed services after posing next to a dead ISIS fighter\u2019s body, which is against regulations. He was then demoted in rank \u2013 a decision Trump reversed in a move that angered military officials. Kerik, who was once the commissioner of the New York City Department of Corrections, was also once a bodyguard and driver for Giuliani in 1993. He later served as a senior vice president at Giuliani Partners until 2004. The President said Kerik is \u201ca man who had many recommendations from a lot of very good people.\u201d According to a White House statement, the pardon was supported by Giuliani, Gallagher, New York Republican Rep. Peter King, presidential confidant and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, as well as Fox News personalities Judge Andrew Napolitano and Geraldo Rivera. The pardon was also supported by Sidney Powell, the attorney for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump issued a pardon to Ariel Friedler, a software entrepreneur who pled guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served two months in prison, according to a White House statement. Friedler, the White House said, \u201cwas forced to sell the company that he had dedicated his life to building\u201d and has \u201cexpressed deep remorse for his actions.\u201d Friedler now works to promote veterans issues and helps former prisoners reenter society, per the White House, which noted his clemency was supported by former New Jersey governor and top Trump ally Chris Christie. Christie told NJ Advance Media that he spoke with Trump about Friedler\u2019s case. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. President, he got treated wrong and you can help right it,\u2019\u201d Christie said. Trump granted clemency to Paul Pogue, owner of a construction company and Republican political donor, who was sentenced to three years of probation for underpaying his taxes by approximately 10% over a three year period. Pogue, according to the White House statement, has made \u201csignificant charitable contributions,\u201d including disaster relief following Hurricane Harvey and other crises, as well as \u201csignificant humanitarian aid to countries around the world.\u201d The White House said Pogue\u2019s clemency was supported by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and former Sen. Rick Santorum, among others. Pogue has donated $85,000 to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee and nearly $150,000 to the Republican National Committee so far this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. Trump pardoned David Safavian, a former Republican lobbyist and lawyer, who served as an official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Safavian was sentenced to one year in prison in 2009 for obstructing an investigation and making false statements in connection to a former lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, during his time at the General Services Administration. Safavian is \u201cuniquely positioned to identify problems with the criminal justice system and work to fix them,\u201d the White House statement said. His legal license was restored in Washington, the White House statement said. The presidential pardon for Safavian was supported by CNN\u2019s Van Jones, a criminal justice reform advocate, as well as American Conservative Union chairman and Trump ally Matt Schlapp, among others. The President pardoned Angela Stanton, an author, television personality, and motivational speaker, for her involvement in a stolen vehicle ring in 2007, for which she served six months of home confinement. Since then, Stanton has worked hard to help improve reentry outcomes, the White House statement said. According to her website, her memoir details a \u201chustler\u2019s life of crime\u201d alongside Real Housewives of Atlanta\u2019s Phaedra Parks. Trump commuted the sentence of Tynice Nichole Hall, after she served almost 14 years for drug-related charges. Hall was convicted on charges to distribute, possess, and manufacture crack cocaine, as well as possession of firearms, per the Justice Department. Since she was incarcerated in 2006, Hall took numerous job training programs and has continued to work toward her college degree, the White House statement said. Her clemency was supported by former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker and Alice Johnson, whose sentence Trump commuted in 2018 at the behest of Kim Kardashian West. Trump commuted the sentence of Crystal Munoz, who served 12 years in prison for marijuana-related charges. In 2008, Munoz was found guilty and sentenced to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, according to court records. She has spent much of her time in prison committed to her rehabilitation. Munoz mentored others and volunteered to help with a hospice program, according to the White House statement. Munoz previously applied for clemency during the Obama administration. The President commuted the 35-year prison sentence of Judith Negron for her role in a $205 million Medicare fraud scheme. Negron, a minority-owner of a mental health care company in Miami, Florida, was found guilty in 2011 on multiple counts of health care fraud and money laundering. She served eight years of her 35-year sentence. Johnson was also among those advocating for Negron\u2019s commutation. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Kaitlan Collins, Maegan Vazquez, Paul La Monica, and Stephen Collinson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jorge Trejo-Ibarra lit up when Bernie Sanders talked about health care at a Las Vegas rally over the weekend. The 17-year-old son of Mexican immigrants, who was diagnosed with stage four Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma in 2018, is voting for the Vermont senator largely because of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Trejo-Ibarra, after going into remission, decided to get more politically involved and will serve as a precinct captain for Sanders in Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses. It fills a dual purpose for him: He wants to fight for people who can\u2019t afford insurance, which covered his own cancer treatments. And he wants to help those who can\u2019t speak English participate in the upcoming caucuses. Sanders is counting on young Latino voters like Trejo-Ibarra, who can participate in the caucuses because he\u2019ll turn 18 before Election Day, to carry him to victory in Nevada. Nevada will be the first real test of whether Sanders has been able to expand his appeal in the diverse universe of Democratic voters, particularly within the Latino community, where the Sanders campaign made a huge push to connect with voters more than eight months ago. \u201cWe believe health care is a human right for all people,\u201d Sanders said at a Saturday rally. \u201cWe are going to take on the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies and we are going to pass a Medicare for All single-payer program.\u201d Sanders will have to contend with the powerful Culinary Union, which fought for and negotiated excellent health benefits, because of its opposition to Medicare for All. The organization says it represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers in Nevada and provides health insurance coverage for more than 130,000 people. It is unclear how much the union\u2019s opposition to Medicare for All will hurt Sanders, as the union decided to not endorse any 2020 candidate before the caucuses. And Sanders\u2019 presidential rivals are looking to halt the senator\u2019s momentum following his win in New Hampshire and strong showing in Iowa. Businessman Tom Steyer has invested heavily in the state, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are also running ads in Spanish as they look to court Latino voters. But in interviews with more than two dozen Latino voters in Spanish and English over the last few days in predominantly Latino areas of Las Vegas, Sanders\u2019 came up most often, with younger Latino voters describing a particularly passionate desire to elect Sanders. Voters of all ages said they liked Sanders\u2019 plans on health care, education, the environment and tuition-free college. \u201cAs of today, it\u2019s very predictable that Bernie is going to come in first. I would say that it\u2019s unsure who is going to come in second,\u201d Andres Ramirez, a Democratic strategist in Las Vegas, said in an interview with CNN on Friday. At the same time that Sanders was rallying voters and leading a march to an early voting location, former Vice President Joe Biden took the microphone at a middle school gymnasium just a 10-minute drive away. Attendance at his Latino-focused phone-banking event was sparse, filled in part with footsoldiers from California who had come to the state to help canvass for him. But among them was Rafael Garcia, who made up his mind to vote for Biden that day. \u201cThis man has done so much for this country,\u201d Garcia said. The 59-year-old boxing trainer said he wasn\u2019t worried about Biden\u2019s losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, where the former vice president placed fourth and fifth respectively. \u201cIt could have been the weather out there, or that new people wanted to be heard,\u201d Garcia said, noting that voters have many choices this cycle. \u201cThere were women running. A war hero in Pete (Buttigieg). I love Bernie (Sanders). But I\u2019d like to see everybody come out for Joe (Biden).\u201d There, Biden reminded the crowd, \u201c99% of the Latino vote hasn\u2019t spoken yet.\u201d Biden led the Vermont Senator in two January polls from Suffolk University and Fox News, with Sanders coming in second. But polling has been consistently off the mark in Nevada, not only because it\u2019s difficult to predict who will participate in a caucus, but because many casino workers work unusual hours and the state has a constantly changing population with movement in and out of the state. Age composition of Saturday\u2019s turnout will also be a factor. Sanders has a huge edge among younger voters, while Biden does better among older ones. The Sanders\u2019 team hopes to see a robust turnout among young voters. The fact that 56% of early voters this weekend were first time caucusgoers was a good sign for the Vermont senator. Sanders had the edge among Latinos nationally in a Pew Research Center poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters last month: 30% favored the Vermont Senator, 22% supported Biden, 11% backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. All of the other candidates were in low single digits. The caucuses will be a test of the Sanders\u2019 campaign\u2019s heavy investments in Latino outreach. Gleaning their data from voter files, Sanders\u2019 team estimates more than 101,000 Nevada Latinos have registered to vote since the last caucuses. That number is huge considering only 84,000 Democrats caucused in Nevada in 2016. More than 26,000 Nevadans participated in the first two days of early voting over the weekend, according to the party, which estimated that 56 percent were first time caucusgoers. In 2016, the campaign recognized Sanders\u2019 popularity among Latinos, senior Sanders adviser Chuck Rocha said, \u201cbut we learned it too late to capitalize on it, because we were building the airplane and flying it at the same time.\u201d This time, it started investing resources eight months ago, hiring from within the community through what Rocha describes as a multi-layered communications operation. \u201cIf you can think of any way possible for a Latino of any age to consume information to learn about the election, we were talking to them on that platform,\u201d Rocha said in an interview with CNN. Beyond television, that included mailers, newspapers, Instagram, Facebook, Spanish-language radio, panel trucks, texts, phone and ads on music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. \u201cIt helped us reconnect with a young group of Latinos who\u2019ve been following Bernie since the last election. It helped us to start building a relationship with an older demographic of Latinos, who always vote, but may not have known or trusted Bernie in the beginning\u2014but their children did,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cSo we had eight months to talk to them about Bernie when nobody else was talking to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also helped us start reaching out to a new group of Latinos, which is the largest group who are newly registered, who nobody is talking to.\u201d The Sanders campaign says it now has more than 250 staff members on the ground in Nevada. It opened the first of their 11 Nevada offices in the predominantly Latino area of East Las Vegas last July. In December, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez co-hosted the first Spanish-language town hall for Sanders and the campaign has led caucus trainings in Spanish, as well as in languages such as Tagalog, Mandarin and Vietnamese. Sanders isn\u2019t alone in investing in Nevada. Buttigieg recently doubled his staff on the ground and Steyer ramped up his operation late last year, putting together a team of Latino senior aides to lead his operation. Steyer, who has spent $14.7 million on ads in Nevada to Sanders\u2019 $1.9 million, also came up frequently in interviews with Latino voters, with a majority of people saying they had seen or heard an ad from the campaign. Sanders, Steyer, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are all running ads in Spanish in Nevada. Buttigieg, who speaks Spanish, narrates his own ad in Spanish. And Steyer was the first to go negative in Nevada, targeting Sanders on his support for Medicare for All. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason people are nervous about Bernie Sanders scrapping Obamacare,\u201d the narrator says in Steyer\u2019s ad. \u201cUnions don\u2019t like it \u2026 And Bernie can\u2019t or won\u2019t give us a price tag.\u201d Armando Arciga, a 51-year-old construction worker in Las Vegas, said outside of a Cardenas supermarket that he is voting for Steyer because the climate crisis is the number one issue Arciga cares about. Nick Maldonado, 37, is the CEO of the Latino franchise Toro Taxes, and told CNN at an event hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens that his company endorsed Steyer. \u201cI appreciate the fact that (Steyer\u2019s) a businessman, but still a Democrat, and still focused on local issues,\u201d Maldonado said. He touted Steyer\u2019s Latino-run staff in Nevada, and said Steyer\u2019s campaign reached out and asked for an endorsement. Buttigieg, who is looking to build on his strong performance in Iowa and New Hampshire, now has more than 100 staff members on the ground in Nevada and more than 40% of them speak Spanish, according to the campaign. The former mayor was quick to criticize Klobuchar Sunday after both she and Steyer were unable to name the president of Mexico, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, during interviews with Telemundo in Nevada last week. During a town hall Sunday in Las Vegas, Buttigieg was asked what it says about Washington experience that \u201ca sitting US Senator could not name Mexico\u2019s president?\u201d \u201cGuess what? It says is that there is more to being prepared than how many years you spent in Washington,\u201d said Buttigieg, who had answered the question correctly in his own interview with Telemundo. Buttigieg\u2019s operation began pushing out Spanish-language digital ads in December, as well as Spanish-language radio ads, which were also narrated by the former mayor. It opened it\u2019s East Las Vegas office in mid-September, conducting caucus trainings in Spanish, and providing Spanish-language canvassing tools to their volunteers\u2014including their \u201crelational organizing\u201d tool that allows a volunteer to contact their own contacts on behalf of Buttigieg. Still, several Nevada political strategists noted in interviews that Sanders\u2019 volunteer footprint in Nevada was unmatched, while Biden\u2019s organizing infrastructure has been lighter than expected. Despite Sanders\u2019 apparent edge, it remains unclear whether the friction over his health care plan with the Culinary Union will benefit more moderate candidates like Buttigieg, Biden and Klobuchar. \u201cBernie has tremendous volunteer investments in Nevada,\u201d said Kristian Ramos, a political consultant who works with Latino groups like Mi Familia Vota, which is focused on expanding the voting population in Nevada. But he noted that Latino voters over 45 have tended to dominate the caucuses in the past, so the age of voters who turn out will be a major determining factor. \u201cThe question becomes \u2018Can Pete Buttigieg take all this momentum and turn it into something real in Nevada,\u201d Ramos said, \u201cand is that enough to overcome Bernie\u2019s youth volunteer army?\u201d While Sanders is counting on younger voters, he has appealed to Latino voters of all ages. William Chavez, 62, said he is voting for Sanders and cited the senator\u2019s support of the Green New Deal, tuition-free colleges, and Medicare for All as reasons why he supports him. \u201c(Sanders) is at that age, he could have just retired and relaxed and enjoy life, but no, he\u2019s fighting for the people. And he\u2019s trying to unite us, not divide us,\u201d Chavez, a retired casino worker who lives in Las Vegas, told CNN at a Sanders rally. \u201cHe\u2019s a go-getter,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cHe had a heart attack, right? I\u2019ve had two. Nothing stops me. Nothing stops him.\u201d Rosie Beltren, a 65-year-old housekeeper who works on the Las Vegas strip and supports Sanders because she believes he will raise the minimum wage and help the many immigrants working in Nevada who don\u2019t have a pathway to citizenship. \u201cMost important for me: health care. A lot of people need it,\u201d Beltren said while talking with a friend who was selling tamales in the parking lot of a Cardenas supermarket last week. \u201cLast week I bought one medicine, only one. $248,\u201d said Beltran, who needed three medications to treat her cancer. \u201cI need more than one, but I didn\u2019t have the money.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people who need their papers for work \u2013 they are good people, they work so hard, but they can\u2019t get papers,\u201d Beltren said. Sanders has also drawn the support of Keila Eustaquio, a 24-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient who plans to volunteer for his campaign even though she cannot legally vote for him. \u201cA lot of people I know are rooting for Bernie; we were rooting for him last time \u2026 He just has a lot of plans to do a lot of good things for our community\u2014as far as giving everyone citizenship, healthcare,\u201d said Eustaquio, who was born in Mexico and runs her own business in Las Vegas. She cited Biden as her second choice because \u201cI feel safe with him.\u201d Eustaquio, after a shopping trip at the Cardenas Market with friends last week, acknowledged that some of Sanders\u2019 plans are unlikely to pass through Congress, a fact that she knows will be used against him if he faces a General Election matchup with Trump. \u201cTrump has realistic goals and Sanders doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what (Sanders) wants to do is life-changing for all of the people.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Chuck Rocha\u2019s name.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night broke from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in a recent interview suggested that passing a watered down version of \u201cMedicare for All\u201d in a deeply divided Congress would still represent a major achievement for the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing. Asked about her comments by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper during a town hall in Las Vegas, Sanders gently disputed Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s framing of the situation, and argued that his legislation\u2019s four-year transition \u201cis, in a sense, already a compromise.\u201d \u201cI love Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has done more in her first year in Congress to transform politics, to get young people involved, than any freshman member of Congress that I can remember,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut my view is that Medicare for All, the bill that we wrote, is in a sense already a compromise. It is a four-year transition period.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with HuffPost last week, acknowledged that the ambitious plan to wipe out the private insurance industry and replace it with a universal, government-run program would face a rocky road in Congress. \u201cA president can\u2019t wave a magic wand and pass any legislation they want,\u201d she said, before considering the alternative. \u201cThe worst-case scenario? We compromise deeply and we end up getting a public option,\u201d she said of what could unfold during a Sanders presidency. \u201cIs that a nightmare? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez was lauded by some more moderate Democratic pundits, who took her remarks to mean she was more willing to cut a deal on the issue than previously indicated. Others suggested she and other leftists had been hypocrites for slighting presidential primary candidates advocating a more piecemeal approach. Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, latched on to the comment and suggested that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed a two-part transition to Medicare for All, deserved an apology. Ocasio-Cortez responded, in a tweet, saying that she was addressing the question \u201cas a member of Congress\u201d and not \u201con behalf\u201d of the Sanders campaign. \u201cIronically, the context of this quote (to HuffPost) is me pointing out how the failure of ACA negotiations resulted in killing the public option 10 years ago,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important case study to examine, regardless of where one ultimately lands on the issue.\u201d Sanders, despite his refusal to concede any ground on Medicare for All now, backed the Affordable Care Act when it was making its way through the Senate back in 2009 and 2010. He also traveled the country with progressive activists to rally support for the law when Republicans tried to eliminate it in 2017.",

            "article_content": "On Friday morning, President Donald Trump sent Bernie Sanders a love letter \u2013 of sorts. \u201cIt is happening again to Crazy Bernie, just like last time, only far more obvious,\u201d Trump tweeted to his 70+ million followers. \u201cThey are taking the Democrat Nomination away from him, and there\u2019s very little he can do. A Rigged System!\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Trump offered no evidence for his claim that Sanders was somehow being victimized by the Democratic Party establishment. But, Friday\u2019s tweet is in keeping with Trump\u2019s long-held public position that Sanders, an avowed democratic socialist in the midst of his second run for president since 2016, is being purposely discriminated against by the powers-that-be within the Democratic Party. It is true that \u2013 thanks to leaked emails published on WikiLeaks following a Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 election, several DNC staffers were plotting to weaken Sanders in hopes of helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination. Those disclosures led to a house cleaning within the DNC \u2013 and a healthy amount of skepticism toward the party apparatus from the Bernie people. And Trump was right there to stoke the fires of resentment and paranoia. \u201cBernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats \u2013 both with delegates & otherwise,\u201d Trump tweeted in May 2016. \u201cHe should show them, & run as an Independent.\u201d Trump has kept that drumbeat going for years. And now he has taken to suggesting Sanders is being robbed again although, unlike 2016, there is no evidence that Democratic Party officials are doing anything untoward to hurt the Vermont senator or help his rivals. So, why? Why does Trump, who can say an unkind word about almost anyone, seem to regularly step into the fray to advocate for Sanders? Well, a few options: 1) It\u2019s a political strategy: Trump and his close associates believe Sanders, a democratic socialist who has pushed for massive increases in federal spending on everything from the environment to health care, is the easiest of the Democrats for the incumbent to beat. So, why not try to help Sanders win the nomination by stoking outrage amongst his supporters over the idea that there is some grand effort within the party structure to keep their guy from winning? Makes sense, right? After all, that\u2019s clearly what Trump was trying to do with that 2016 tweet; he could have just as easily tweeted: \u201cHey Bernie, run as an independent so you split the vote three ways and make it easier for me to win!\u201d 2) Trump just loves a good conspiracy theory: Trump\u2019s political career was launched by promoting a debunked conspiracy theory \u2013 that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And, throughout both his candidacy and his presidency, he has regularly embraced conspiracy theories about illegal voting, spying and lots and lots of other things. He\u2019s someone who likes to play the victim, likes to believe that any struggles he has aren\u2019t a result of his own shortcomings but rather because, well, everyone is against him. The idea that Sanders is the victim of such a broad-scale conspiracy then appeals directly to Trump\u2019s most basic instincts. If you believe that the world \u2013 and especially the political world \u2013 are governed by conspiracies, what\u2019s one more to throw on the pile? Trump makes 86 false claims over two weeks, including whoppers about Bloomberg, Pelosi and Social Security 3) Kindred spirits: It\u2019s uniquely possible that Trump sees some of himself in Sanders \u2013 a total political outsider who has long been mocked and dismissed by the so-called elites within the party. Sanders\u2019 ability to bend the party to his will over these past four years (\u201cMedicare for All,\u201d etc.) is also similar to Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP in 2016. Trump truly does hate people who think they are better than him. And he loves to prove them wrong. Which you can see him believing Sanders is doing, too. What\u2019s the real reason for Trump\u2019s regular attempts to draw attention to alleged conspiracies being conducted to hurt Sanders? It\u2019s probably pure political calculation \u2013 mostly because that\u2019s what Trump has always specialized in. He does what\u2019s good for him first, second and third. And it\u2019s easy to see why Trump believes Bernie is the most beatable of the Democratic field. Of course, there\u2019s a bit of be-careful-what-you-wish-for here \u2013 and no one should know that better than Trump himself who was widely written off as totally beatable by Democrats in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail Saturday attacked former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, saying \u201call his money\u201d will not be enough to produce the voter turnout needed to defeat President Donald Trump. \u201cThe simple truth is that Mayor Bloomberg with all his money will not create the kind of excitement and energy we need to have, the voter turnout we must have to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders said Saturday during a dinner in Clark County, Nevada. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Sanders has previously criticized Bloomberg\u2019s wealth, but on Saturday, the Vermont senator launched a series of critiques on Bloomberg\u2019s policy positions \u2013 from stop and frisk policing to redlining to Bloomberg\u2019s record on taxing the wealthy, social security and raising the minimum wage. \u201cLet me also say a word to you about the current campaign and to say that regardless of how much money a multi-billionaire candidate is willing to spend on his election we will not create the energy and excitement we need to defeat Donald Trump if that candidate pursued advocated for, and enacted racist policies, like stop and frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear,\u201d Sanders said. Bloomberg is spending his way to the top He continued: \u201cWe will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who, in 2015 stated, and I quote, \u2018I for example am not in favor, have never been in favor, of raising the minimum wage.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who opposed modest proposals during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency to raise taxes on the wealthy, while advocating for cuts for Medicare and social security.\u201d \u201cWe will not defeat Donald Trump with a candidate who instead of holding the crooks on Wall Street accountable, blamed the end of racist policies, such as redlining, for the financial crisis.\u201d The comments from Sanders, who topped the Democratic primary race in a recent national poll, come roughly a week out from the Nevada caucuses, Democrats\u2019 third nominating contest. Bloomberg, who had so far intentionally kept the party\u2019s contest at arm\u2019s length, is now rising in the polls. The former mayor has spent millions on ads in Super Tuesday primary states, but has not yet appeared on the Democratic debate stage or on a primary ballot. Responding to Sanders\u2019 comments, Bloomberg\u2019s national traveling press secretary, Galia Slayen, focused entirely on what Sanders said about Bloomberg opposing Obama\u2019s efforts to raise taxes on the rich. She did not respond to the other issues Sanders raised. \u201cAs mayor, Mike raised taxes on the wealthy and supported an increase in the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. As president, Mike will raise rates on high-income earners, tax capital income more equitably, close loopholes, and bolster enforcement. He will get it done because he\u2019s done it before,\u201d Slayen said. Bloomberg's attempt to get black voters to forgive and forget just got a lot harder CNN has reached out to the Bloomberg campaign for additional comment. Bloomberg said at the height of the housing crisis in 2008 that getting rid of \u201credlining,\u201d the biased housing practice that stopped banks from providing mortgages in low-income, largely minority neighborhoods, was to blame for the collapse. His campaign said Thursday that the comments, which were made at a Georgetown University forum in 2008, were meant to make the point that \u201csomething bad - the financial crisis - followed something good, which is the fight against redlining.\u201d And Bloomberg is again defending himself over the controversial stop and frisk policing policy after an audio clip of a 2015 speech came to light last week in which the former mayor argued one way to reduce violence was to throw minority kids \u201cup against the walls and frisk them.\u201d Bloomberg has been repeatedly criticized over the controversial police practice of temporarily detaining, questioning and searching residents who were overwhelmingly black or Latino. Since launching his campaign, he has issued repeated apologies for the policy, most recently Saturday night during a campaign stop in Richmond, Virginia. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, Sanders is leading the Democratic primary with 25%, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden at 17%. Bloomberg is at 15%, up considerably from 9% before the Iowa caucuses and 3% when he first entered the race in November. This story has been updated with additional developments Sunday.

            "article_content": "It\u2019s easy to forget how crazy this is. Every week of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has felt like its own self-contained saga, but even by those dramatic standards, it\u2019s almost incomprehensible that the President\u2019s impeachment acquittal was only nine days ago. The acquittal was built into one of the busiest weeks of the year, on the heels of the botched Iowa caucuses and what could be Trump\u2019s final State of the Union address, so perhaps the vote whereby Republicans in the Senate saved their President did not imprint in the way it should. Or maybe it\u2019s just that the Trump administration has generated so much drama in the intervening week-and-change that it\u2019s hard to remember back that far. We are all living Memento. Here just a sampling what you probably already forgot about this week: February 5: Trump is acquitted. Romney shocks with vote to convict. Other Republicans say Trump has learned his lesson. February 6: Trump claims \u201ctotal acquittal\u201d at a wild and rambling news conference in the White House, lashes out at Romney, pushes conspiracy theories. February 7: The administration cleans house at the National Security Council, firing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his brother and escorting them from the White House. Also fired: US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland even though a handful of Republican senators tried to dissuade him. It\u2019s clear Trump is seeking retribution for impeachment. Democrats spar at a contentious New Hampshire debate. Amy Klobuchar gains some momentum, further splintering the moderate wing. February 8: On Twitter, Trump defends firing Vindman. February 9: CNN reports there will be a further staff purge and permanent cuts at the National Security Council. February 10: Trump proposes a budget that assumes unrealistic growth, ignores deficit warnings and recommends cuts to government services like Medicaid and Medicare. At a rally in New Hampshire, he encourages Republicans to meddle in the Democratic primary despite the state\u2019s rules. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s candidacy starts to get backlash. February 11: Trump tweets that Roger Stone should get a lighter sentence and shortly thereafter, the DOJ makes a similar recommendation \u2013 overruling its prosecutors, who quit the case. A former US attorney\u2019s nomination is put on hold and it all leads to questions about Trump\u2019s influence over the justice system. Bernie Sanders wins the New Hampshire primary, but with only a quarter of the vote. February 12: Criticism of Trump\u2019s influence over the DOJ continues. He claims no pressure on the DOJ despite his tweets. February 13: Attorney General Bill Barr lashes out at his boss for tweeting about criminal cases, but defends a lighter sentence for Stone. February 14: It is reported that Barr ordered review of other cases involving Trump allies, like Michael Flynn, raising new questions about the attorney general less than a day after he sought to exert independence. The DC US Attorneys\u2019 office drops an investigation Trump had pushed into Andrew McCabe, a former FBI official. Stone requests a new trial. And, finally, speaking of things forgotten: Michael Avenatti, remember him? Stormy Daniels\u2019 former lawyer has been found guilty of extorting Nike. Now catch your breath. Next week will bring new Trump drama. The day after Barr went on TV to demand that his boss stop tweeting because it was interfering with the attorney general\u2019s job, the New York Times and CNN reported that Barr ordered a review of other high-profile cases, including that of Michael Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and then cooperated with Robert Mueller. Begging the question: What exactly is the job Barr thinks the tweets are keeping him from doing? Read more: CNN\u2019s report on the Flynn review ordered by Barr On Wednesday, CNN reported that Barr had also been pressing for a sentence for Flynn that would spare him from prison. On the other hand, the US attorney in DC informed lawyers for Andrew McCabe, the former FBI official targeted by Trump (and now a CNN contributor), that it would not face charges related to a criminal investigation. McCabe expressed his relief on CNN and was asked by Brianna Keilar about the timing of the news, right after the controversy over Trump interfering in the Stone sentencing. \u201cThe timing this week coming on the tails of all the controversy over the Roger Stone sentencing is curious,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a decision that I and my attorneys feel confident they could have come to a long, long time ago. But nevertheless they did the right thing today by acknowledging that there was no place to take this and that no criminal charges should ever be brought on it.\u201d Read this: Chris Cillizza argues that Trump\u2019s \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theory is taking a big hit with this news. I went to CNN\u2019s campaign finance expert, Fredreka Schouten, to ask about money in politics this year now that Michael Bloomberg is honing in on spending $400 million before he even appears on a primary ballot. On the other side, Trump and the Republican National Committee are going to be hosting a fundraiser near Mar-a-Lago with a per-couple entry fee of $580,600. Bloomberg is spending his billions. Trump's hosting a pricey 2020 fundraiser. But is it legal? The full Q&A is here. And here\u2019s a snapshot: Me: How much can he spend? Is there anything in US law that addresses self-financing? Fredreka: As much as he wants. Federal candidates don\u2019t face any restrictions on how much of their own money they can spend to win \u2013 or lose \u2013 an election. Back in 2002, Congress attempted to level the playing field between self-funded congressional candidates and their rivals this way: Once a self-funded candidate\u2019s spending crossed a set threshold ($350,000 for House candidates, for instance), contribution limits for all the other rivals in the race would be relaxed. But, in 2008, the US Supreme Court tossed that that provision as unconstitutional. And the court has said rich candidates have a First Amendment right to \u201cunfettered speech.\u201d And so it goes. The American system of government has been challenged to deal with a singular President and a divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House. Stay tuned to this newsletter as we keep watch over the Trump administration, the 2020 presidential campaign and other issues of critical interest.",

            "article_content": "A panel of federal appellate court judges on Friday struck down the Trump administration\u2019s approval of work requirements in Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income Americans, in another legal defeat for the President. The unanimous decision, written by Judge David Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, upheld a district court ruling that found the administration failed to analyze whether such programs would \u201cpromote the primary objective of Medicaid \u2013 to furnish medical assistance.\u201d The ruling puts another roadblock in President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to inject conservative ideals into the Medicaid program, which provides coverage to nearly one in five Americans. In another controversial move last month, the administration announced it would allow states to apply for so-called block grants to cover certain low-income adults, particularly those who gained benefits under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion provision. That effort is also expected to be challenged in court since consumer advocates say it will lead to people losing benefits and coverage. The Trump administration, in a historic step, began granting state requests to mandate that certain Medicaid beneficiaries work in order to receive benefits in 2018. Ten states received waivers, though three were set aside by the same district court judge. Work requirements are currently only in effect in Michigan since several other states pulled back on their efforts after the legal rulings. Another 10 state requests are awaiting federal approval. Friday\u2019s ruling applies specifically to Arkansas, where more than 18,000 people lost coverage in 2018 before the court stepped in. The district court had also voided Kentucky\u2019s approval, which blocked work requirements from being implemented there. However, Kentucky terminated its waiver request after a Democratic governor won election last November and dismissed its appeal. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which grants the requests, \u201cis reviewing and evaluating the opinion and determining next steps,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cCMS remains steadfast in our commitment to considering proposals that would allow states to leverage innovative ideas.\u201d The administration contends that requiring people to work, volunteer or participate in job training will better their health and is therefore in keeping with Medicaid\u2019s mission. The appellate court ruling, however, said that \u201cthe primary objective of Medicaid is to provide access to medical care.\u201d The Medicaid statue makes no mention of alternative objectives, such as \u201cimproving health outcomes,\u201d as the administration cited in its approvals. \u201cThe text of the statute includes one primary purpose, which is providing health care coverage without any restriction geared to healthy outcomes, financial independence or transition to commercial coverage,\u201d Sentelle wrote. The lawsuit was brought by the National Health Law Program, along with Legal Aid of Arkansas, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Jenner & Block. \u201cThis is a victory for thousands of Americans who can now continue to have access to health coverage and health care,\u201d said Ian Heath Gershengorn, a Jenner & Block partner and National Health Law Program board member who argued the case.",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg is ramping up his Super Tuesday operation, aides tell CNN, committing to add more than five dozen staffers to the delegate-rich states that will vote in early March. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign will begin to have people on the ground in each Super Tuesday state by Monday, aides said, where the campaign hopes the official staff will tap into a vast network of volunteers that they have helped organize in all 165 congressional districts in Super Tuesday states. The increased investment comes as Buttigieg\u2019s operation, after notching strong finishes in both Iowa and New Hampshire, turns to Nevada, South Carolina and beyond. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Buttigieg has long argued that performing well in the contests for the two predominantly white early states will help him win over notably pragmatic voters of color despite his months long struggle. \u201cThere is an interest in who can win,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN in January about how his finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire would impact Nevada and South Carolina. \u201cAnd making sure that there\u2019s a demonstration of being able to compete, to defeat this president, we need to demonstrate that. Buttigieg now gets a change to test that theory. The increased investment comes days after the Buttigieg campaign announced a six-figure digital ad buy in Minnesota, Michigan, Maine, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia \u2013 all Super Tuesday states \u2013 and will be followed over the next two weeks with trips to California, Utah, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. After contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, the race for the Democratic nomination will nationalize in the coming weeks, with a compressed calendar forcing candidates like Buttigieg having to balance their time and attention on stand-alone contests like Nevada and South Carolina and delegate heavy days like Super Tuesday. Buttigieg, fueled by an early injection of money, began investing in Nevada early and the campaign announced Wednesday that they were doubling their 50-person staff to 100 people in the run up to the Nevada caucuses on February 22. They also increased their ad buy in the state in the wake of New Hampshire\u2019s primary and have begun airing an ad contrasting his more moderate health care position with the more sweeping Medicare for All plan by telling voters Buttigieg believes \u201cthe choice should be yours.\u201d In South Carolina, the campaign has 50 staff members of the ground and expects a host of organizers from Iowa to arrive in the state this weekend to begin the sprint to the state\u2019s primary on February 29. The state, where over 60% of the Democratic electorate is expected to be black, will be a test for Buttigieg, but the campaign\u2019s senior aides believe the mayor\u2019s ability to show he can win help voters give him a chance. Buttigieg has struggled mightily to win the support of Latino and black voters, two groups of voters that will play a central role to the Democratic nomination in the coming contests. The issue is an existential one for Buttigieg \u2013 and something that weighs on even the white supporters who backed the young mayor. Buttigieg was asked about his lack of black support multiple times by white questioners in the close of his Iowa campaign, and some Buttigieg supporters have said they feel his lack of diverse support cuts into his electability argument. \u201cI think leap in Iowa that a lot of people took in supporting him was really important,\u201d said Buttigieg senior adviser Michael Halle, \u201cand that was a threshold component in being able to win support in subsequent states.\u201d Central to the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s plans beyond those two states is a network of motivated, campaign-support volunteer groups, some of which meet every week, have regular contact with the campaign and send out newsletters to thousands of people every week in the Super Tuesday states. While some of these groups began organizing shortly after Buttigieg launched his exploratory committee in January 2019, the campaign first began to reach out to them in May and formalized a larger five-person team to work with all the groups in July. \u201cTo compete in all the states on Super Tuesday, you need a massive network of grassroots volunteers,\u201d said Samantha Steelman, the organizing director for all Super Tuesday contests. \u201cFor months, we have had a team that has been building that organization by harnessing the energy and grassroots momentum behind Pete and turning it into real organizing work.\u201d Steelman said that professional staff deployed to these early states will provide more resources to these groups, as well as continue to train and guide what they believe is a network of over 25,000 volunteers in Super Tuesday states. Collin McGann, a 35-year-old South Bend transplant in Colorado, began organizing the Colorado For Pete group in early 2019. He first realized there was interest in the former mayor when 90 people showed up to a watch party he held for Buttigieg\u2019s official announcement. Since then McGann has organized a host of events in the state, including marching in Pride parades, the famous Tour de Fat bike parade in Fort Collins and a table at the Colorado State Fair in Pueblo. In total, more than 2,000 volunteers have signed up for a range of grassroots events. The goal of Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is to amplify this work with funding and more organization. \u201cA lot of the volunteers and future volunteers like to hear that staff is on the ground,\u201d McGann said. \u201cWe are voting here in a few weeks, so it just helps with momentum.\u201d Melani Schwartz, 28-year-old elementary school music teacher from the suburbs of Minneapolis, began working with the \u201cMinnesota for Pete\u201d group around his official launch in April. The group, since then, has begun to host events every week \u2013 which they call Pete Ups \u2013 and publishes a weekly newsletter about what Buttigieg is doing and how they can help. Schwartz, who volunteered and was a delegate for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, got married to her wife in December, and said she \u201cwedding planning while also Pete planning took a lot of my time.\u201d \u201cBut it is worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really hard to take any steps back because right now this is where my passion is.\u201d The campaign believes it is groups like those run by McGann and Schwartz that could make the difference when the nomination fight nationalizes and campaigns are unable to spend months building operations like they did in Iowa and New Hampshire. Halle, Buttigieg\u2019s senior adviser, said that one of the former mayor\u2019s greatest assets in 2019 \u2013 before he was able to raise millions \u2013 was the people were \u201creally excited about Pete and gave their time to work for him.\u201d And with the Super Tuesday race being \u2013 more than anything \u2013 a race for delegates that will be awarded by congressional districts, Halle believes having activated locals on the ground could be their greatest advantage. \u201cI trust someone who is from Salt Lake City,\u201d Halle said, \u201cto organize in Salt Lake City better than some new grad from wherever that has a beanie and Birkenstocks.\u201d",

            "article_content": "While the political world has already moved on from New Hampshire \u2013 here we come, Nevada! \u2013 there\u2019s a ton of data from the first-in-the-nation primary which can give us some insight into what Democratic voters want and who they think best represents their interests. I went through the exit polling out of New Hampshire (you can check it out yourself right here) and plucked out some of the key numbers that tell us something about where the 2020 race is and where it\u2019s headed. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 1) Sanders continues his dominance with young voters: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won 51%(!) of the vote among voters 18-29. That\u2019s an absolutely stunning number when you consider there were 10 other serious and credible candidates on the ballot in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Sanders also won the next youngest age cohort (30-44), but with a less overwhelming 36%. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was the choice of those aged 45-64, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the favorite among the 65+ crowd. The biggest voting bloc by age? Those between 45 and 64, who comprised almost 4 in 10 New Hampshire primary voters. 2) A less liberal electorate: Roughly 6 in 10 voters on Tuesday said they were either \u201cvery\u201d (21%) or \u201csomewhat\u201d (40%) liberal. That\u2019s down from the 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, when almost 7 in 10 described themselves as \u201cvery\u201d (26%) or \u201csomewhat\u201d (42%) liberal. Those identifying as \u201cmoderate\u201d also jumped from 27% in 2016 to 36% on Tuesday. That more moderate electorate likely explains why we had two centrists in Buttigieg and Klobuchar in second and third with a combined total of more than 44% of the overall vote. 3) Health care remains dominant issue: Asked to choose between four issues, almost 4 in 10 voters on Tuesday said health care was the most important one facing the country. That\u2019s an echo of the Iowa caucus electorate, and speaks to the centrality of the health care fight both in the Democratic primary and in the general election against Trump. Health care policy is a fundamental difference between the two Democratic front-runners \u2013 with Sanders pushing a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan that would totally eliminate the private health insurance industry and Buttigieg backing a less ambitious plan that would work to improve on the Affordable Care Act. 4) Electability, electability, electability: More than 6 in 10 New Hampshire primary voters said they prioritize a candidate who can beat Trump while just 1 in 3 would prefer someone who agrees with them on most issues. Not surprisingly, Sanders was the clear favorite of those who cared more about issue agreement while Buttigieg was a slightly more narrow favorite among the electability crowd. What\u2019s become clear through the first two states is that Democratic voters care more about beating Trump than any specific policy position. What\u2019s far less clear is which candidate they believe is the most electable against the incumbent. 5) Sanders\u2019 ideas are mainstream Democratic ideas now: While the electorate on Tuesday identified as less liberal than four years ago, it was also clear in the data that some of the policies touted by Sanders that were once dismissed a radical are now favored by a majority of the party. Fully 60% said they backed a government-run health care system in place of a private marketplace (that\u2019s essentially \u201cMedicare for All\u201d) while almost 7 in 10 (68%) expressed support for free tuition at public colleges and universities. It\u2019s a measure of how far Sanders has moved the party to the left over these past four years that policies that brought a snicker to many establishment Democrats in 2016 are now the mainstream views of the rank-and-file. 6) Democrats are mad as hell: Asked what their prevailing emotion is toward the Trump administration, almost 8 in 10 voters said \u201cangry.\u201d Second place? \u201cDissatisfied\u201d at just 15%. Sanders won \u201cangry\u201d voters with 29%, followed by Buttigieg and Klobuchar at 23% and 22%, respectively. In 2016, just 12% of New Hampshire voters described themselves as \u201cangry\u201d at the federal government. (The 2016 exit poll didn\u2019t ask about whether people were angry about outgoing President Barack Obama.) 7) Age is just a number: Good news for 78-year-old Sanders and 38-year-old Buttigieg: More than 3 in 4 voters said that a candidate\u2019s age was either a minor factor (30%) or \u201cnot a factor at all\u201d (48%) in deciding their vote. If elected, Sanders would be the oldest president ever elected to a first term. Buttigieg, if elected, would be the youngest president ever. 8) A late-deciding crowd: Half \u2013 HALF \u2013 of voters on Tuesday said they made their minds up on a candidate in the last few days.  That\u2019s stunning number \u2013 especially when you consider just 25% said they made their minds up at that last minute four years ago. Among that large group of late deciders, Buttigieg (29%) was the favorite pick, followed by Klobuchar (24%). 9) Debates matter: Half \u2013 HALF \u2013  of voters said that last Friday\u2019s debate were either an important factor or the most important factor in deciding who to vote for on Tuesday. Klobuchar, who shined in that debate, won among both sets of voters. Mark your calendars for February 19 in Las Vegas and February 25 in Charleston. Both of those debates could well be critical moments in determining who over- and under-performs in the votes that follow hard on them.",

            "article_content": "Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who in November made a late entrance into the Democratic 2020 race, ended his campaign on Wednesday, according to a statement provided to CNN. \u201cI believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being able to deliver better outcomes,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cBut the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign\u2019s back to go on to the next round of voting. So I have decided to suspend the campaign, effective immediately.\u201d He added: \u201cI am not suspending my commitment to help \u2013 there is still work to be done. We are facing the most consequential election of our lifetime. Our democracy itself, let alone our civic commitments to equality, opportunity and fair play, are at risk. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The announcement comes after Patrick, by getting less than 1,300 votes, turned in a disappointing performance on Tuesday night in New Hampshire, his neighboring state. A disheartened Patrick told supporters on Tuesday night that he and his wife needed to \u201cgo home and rest and reflect on this outcome and make some decisions tomorrow morning about what the future of this campaign can and should be.\u201d \u201cNo matter whether it is a candidate for president, or as a public citizen. I\u2019m going to stay involved,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cNo matter what decision we make tomorrow morning about the practical ability of this campaign to continue. I\u2019m going to stay involved, and so must you.\u201d That conversation led Patrick to decide to end his campaign. He will email his supporters later on Wednesday to explain his decision. Patrick had skipped the Iowa caucuses and pinned his hopes on stronger-than-expected performances in New Hampshire and South Carolina as the Democratic field winnowed. His hope: Regional connections in New England, and his appeal as the last African American candidate in southern states where black voters make up the majority of the Democratic electorate, would lead voters to give him a late look. But, in the end, he was merely a blip in New Hampshire, overshadowed by the top-tier candidates. Patrick\u2019s campaign underscored the difficulty of jumping into a presidential race months after other campaigns had begun raising money, hiring staffers, recruiting volunteers and developing policy platforms. He\u2019d hired some staffers, including campaign manager Abe Rakov, who had just departed former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign after O\u2019Rourke withdrew from the race. And he raised $2.2 million in the first six weeks of his campaign. But Patrick\u2019s late entrance came around the same time former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg had decided to enter the race and pour hundreds of millions of his own wealth into advertisements. Unlike Bloomberg, the former Massachusetts governor \u2013 who was backed by a super PAC that pumped nearly $2 million into ads in New Hampshire \u2013 never gained significant traction in the polls. In November, a week after entering the race he\u2019d attempted to campaign in the Atlanta as the Democratic field descended on the city for a debate for which Patrick had not qualified. But he had to cancel an event at Morehouse College after just two people showed up. A CNN reporter\u2019s photo of the room filled with empty chairs went viral. Patrick campaigned as a moderate, calling for a public option to be added to Obamacare rather than supporting \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a government-run single-payer health program. We face \u201cthe usual hurdle, which is trying to persuade people that nobody else gets to make this decision for them,\u201d Patrick said in an interview with CNN in January. \u201cThis race is wide open and the other candidates who have spent months and months and years and years, millions of dollars, making themselves famous but not locking down the race.\u201d Patrick, who is close to former President Barack Obama, left the job he took in 2015 at Bain Capital, the Boston-based investment firm that was the targets of Democrats in 2012 because Mitt Romney was one of its founders. He told CNN as he entered the race of his work at Bain, \u201cI\u2019m a capitalist. I\u2019m not a market fundamentalist. I don\u2019t think private markets in the private sector solves every problem that needs to be solved in our society right on time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "So much for \u201cIowa nice.\u201d The contentious contours of the Democratic presidential primary came into full view in New Hampshire over the weekend, as months of cordial campaigning in Iowa quickly escalated into a raucous sprint to Tuesday\u2019s primary. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both drawing the largest crowds in the Granite State after a near-tie in the Iowa caucuses, began treating each other as primary rivals for the Democratic nomination. Former Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, unleashed the harshest attack advertisement of the primary to date, targeting Buttigieg as he struggles to regain his footing and prevent his support among moderate Democrats from evaporating amid a worse-than-expected finish in Iowa and a new threat for that centrist lane from Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose events mostly outdrew Biden\u2019s over the weekend. And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has fallen behind Sanders among the party\u2019s most progressive voters and Buttigieg among college-educated liberals, sought to avoid an embarrassing finish in her neighboring state. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Across New Hampshire, undecided voters this weekend were still using the results from Iowa \u2013 as well as the Friday night\u2019s combative debate in New Hampshire \u2013 to decide where to throw their support on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been leaning toward Biden. But I haven\u2019t really been impressed with Joe in the debates, so I want to see him in person,\u201d said Valerie Brown, a 64-year-old retired health care consultant from Derry, New Hampshire, who is considering Biden and Buttigieg. \u201cSometimes he can get caught up in his own language and he can kind of lose his train of thought. And just, not the energy. He just seems a little \u2013 he seems a little old.\u201d Brown was expressing an opinion held by a number of voters CNN spoke to over the weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to basically be Obama 2.0. I want him to think for himself,\u201d said Seth Mandell, a 57-year-old from Nashua who was deciding between Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar. \u201cTimes are changing. \u2026 I want Biden to be able to say, OK, that was then, this is now, this is what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d The former vice president\u2019s tumble had reshaped the race, but the highest-stakes battle was between the two men who a CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire found leading ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary. Sanders, the favorite in New Hampshire, and Buttigieg, whose momentum from Iowa has helped him compete in the state with the neighboring senator, spent the weekend sparring from afar through a series of television appearances, rallies and town halls. Sanders seized on Buttigieg\u2019s acceptance of money from wealthy donors, using it to separate himself from his competitors and argue that his campaign, fueled by online contributions, is \u201crewriting the rules of campaign finance.\u201d \u201cOf course, it matters,\u201d Sanders said of Buttigieg donations at an event in Plymouth. \u201cDo you think that the person you\u2019re giving money to is going to stand up to the corporate elite and fight for a government that represents all of us? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Buttigieg, over the course of the weekend, responded to Sanders by arguing that Democrats can\u2019t afford to distance themselves from all wealthy people who want to oust President Donald Trump. \u201cBernie\u2019s pretty rich and I\u2019d happily accept a contribution from him,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is about making sure we bring everybody into the fight at a moment when we\u2019re going to be going up against Donald Trump.\u201d Buttigieg chose to go after Sanders in a different way: His ubiquitous calls for a revolution. \u201cI respect Sen. Sanders,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cbut when I hear this message go out that you\u2019re either for revolution, or you\u2019ve got to be for the status quo, that\u2019s a vision of the country that doesn\u2019t have room for most of us.\u201d The discord between Buttigieg and Sanders trickled down to their supporters on Saturday night, when both sides heckled and jeered their competitors at a major New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner on Saturday. When Buttigieg slammed the idea during his speech that \u201ceither for a revolution or the status quo,\u201d many in the Sanders section booed, while a few began chanting \u201cWall Street Pete.\u201d The Buttigieg supporters got back at Sanders later in the event. After Sanders mentioned winning the \u201cpopular vote\u201d in Iowa, the former mayor\u2019s supporters reminded the Vermont senator of their delegate lead by chanting \u201cButtigieg, Buttigieg.\u201d Buttigieg was the center of attacks from Biden this weekend, too, highlighting how both Sanders, the race\u2019s top progressive, and the former vice president view stopping the rise of the former South Bend Mayor central to their success. Biden, hours after the Friday debate, released arguably the toughest attack ad of the presidential cycle with a digital spot that mocked the former mayor\u2019s experience in South Bend by comparing it to a host of Obama administration accomplishments. Biden followed up the attack in a press conference on Saturday by scornfully responding to a comparison between Buttigieg and Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s not Barack Obama,\u201d Biden quipped. That press conference \u2013 rare for Biden, who has largely avoided taking questions from the reporters who cover his campaign in recent weeks \u2013 was a vent session of sorts. And since then, he has dialed back his attacks on Buttigieg and Sanders, whose \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan he calls politically unrealistic. Instead, at a 90-minute town hall Sunday in Hudson, Biden made a moral case for his candidacy, pointing to his role in enacting the Violence Against Women Act and blaming the GOP-led Senate for its failure to reauthorize it \u2013 in part over the Democratic-led House\u2019s insistence on closing a gun control loophole in the law. \u201cTrump is owned by the NRA. They will not let it pass. It\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d Biden yelled. Gone were Biden\u2019s attacks on Buttigieg\u2019s experience. Asked in Hudson who he\u2019d pick for vice president, Biden said he wanted someone whose ideology aligned with his and said that ruled out anyone who backed \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 which would include Sanders and Warren. In a nod to Buttigieg, he said he\u2019s looking for someone simpatico with his political beliefs, \u201cstarting with Indiana and starting with other places.\u201d Biden stands by his assertion that Buttigieg does not have sufficient experience to be president, a senior adviser said Monday, despite the former vice president not repeating the claim on the campaign trail Sunday. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking if he\u2019s backing away from that argument, he is not,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, told reporters at a Bloomberg News breakfast in Manchester. The digital ad was intended to make the contrast between the two candidates clear to New Hampshire voters, Bedingfield said. This moment requires \u201csomebody who has been battle-tested and who has been on the front lines of making real change,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course he\u2019s comfortable with it,\u201d Bedingfield said when pressed by reporters about the ad\u2019s mocking tone about Buttigieg\u2019s work on lighting projects and sidewalk expansions in South Bend. Asked why Biden didn\u2019t launch the ad \u2013 or the argument questioning Buttigieg\u2019s experience \u2013 in Iowa, Bedingfield pointed to the disappointing results from the caucuses. \u201cThere is a sense that as we come into voting here in New Hampshire, that we need to clarify and bring into clear focus the fundamental questions,\u201d Bedingfield said. \u201cWho is the candidate who has the experience, who\u2019s been there, who\u2019s ready to meet this incredibly difficult moment?\u201d Most New Hampshire voters CNN spoke with this weekend had not seen the Biden attack ad. But those who had heard about it \u2013 including Steve Schmidt, a 64-year-old from Salem \u2013 said it did not sit well with them. Schmidt, who is leaning towards Buttigieg but likes Biden, told CNN that his wife first saw the ad and was not impressed. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing that,\u2019\u201d Schmidt recalled his wife saying, adding that she \u2013 more than he \u2013 was thinking about backing Biden but now feels like she can\u2019t. Buttigieg declined to go after Biden by name at events in New Hampshire. But did react during a round of Sunday shows by subtly calling the former vice president out of touch and agreeing that he is no Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s right, I\u2019m not. And neither is he,\u201d Buttigieg told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t 2008, it\u2019s 2020 and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.\u201d And Buttigieg looked to turn his time as mayor \u2013 and the somewhat derisive tone Biden\u2019s ad directed at local experience \u2013 against the former vice president. \u201cSo glad to have the support of a fellow mayor at a time like this,\u201d Buttigieg said in Nashua on Sunday after he was introduced by the city\u2019s mayor. \u201cRemember, mayors have to get things done,\u201d Buttigieg added, noting that \u201ccity government shutting down because the two parties couldn\u2019t agree.\u201d While Buttigieg, Biden and Sanders held rallies, Warren focused no canvassing events and small meet-and-greets. It was an effort to get around a problem that confounds presidential campaigns at this time in the election cycle: political tourism. Residents of neighboring states, especially Massachusetts, attend campaign rallies to get a glimpse of the candidates. But for presidential hopefuls, they\u2019re not helpful, because they can\u2019t vote in Tuesday\u2019s primary. Warren told reporters in Concord she\u2019s \u201cout there fighting for every vote.\u201d Warren said she doesn\u2019t want to attack her opponents because \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to bring our party together in order to beat Donald Trump. And the way we do this is not by launching a bunch of attacks on each other and trying to tear each other down.\u201d Klobuchar, meanwhile, was trying to build on momentum from her competitive fifth-place finish in Iowa and rave reviews of her debate performance Friday night. She announced in Nashua she\u2019d raised $3 million in the two days after the debate. \u201cI think you know in your heart I can do this,\u201d she started off. \u201cYou will see that I am someone that\u2019s tough enough to take this guy on and I am someone that has the ideas and the experience to put them into action.\u201d Then, in a not-so-subtle shot in Iowa, Klobuchar added: \u201cAll I need is your vote, so I\u2019m asking you for that today. This is it. New Hampshire has a huge role. You\u2019re the first primary, you are going to be able to count the votes.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Before the State of the Union speech she would later rip up on camera, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a news conference to rip President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201call-out assault on health care.\u201d Afterward, reactions of key voter groups to Trump\u2019s televised prime-time address helped explain that pre-emptive strike. Democratic research found the speech\u2019s passage on health care the single most politically valuable element. Stan Greenberg, the veteran Democratic pollster who helped Bill Clinton win the White House in 1992, gauged reaction to the speech online on behalf of the liberal Voter Participation Center and the American Federation of Teachers, two constituencies crucial to November\u2019s election. Across a range of issues and personal characteristics, Trump improved his standing on health care more than anything else. Polls typically show presidents get only a modest, short-term boost in public esteem from the annual ritual of speaking from the House to a vast television audience. Greenberg hopes the shifts he measured prove similarly ephemeral. Trump's theatrical State of the Union prompts partisan outrage But in a reelection fight that promises to be close, Trump\u2019s speech signaled how and where his campaign will seek marginal advantages. It contained passages tailored for target voters including white women, African Americans, Hispanics and millennials. Before the speech, the collection of those voters Greenberg questioned rated Trump negatively on \u201cmaking health care more affordable\u201d by a 2-to-1 margin. Then they heard the President\u2019s attempt to diminish his vulnerability. \u201cBefore I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years,\u201d Trump said in his speech. \u201cI moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive, and better.\u201d At least for a moment, the message worked. After the speech, target voters split closely on Trump\u2019s handling of health care affordability. The magnitude of that reversal exceeded those on other objects of Trump\u2019s boasts. But Greenberg measured headway on multiple issues. \u201cWe will always protect your Medicare, and we will always protect your Social Security,\u201d Trump pledged. Those assertions turned a lopsidedly negative assessment into an even split on his handling of those retiree benefit programs. \u201cWe are restoring America\u2019s manufacturing might,\u201d the President said, proclaiming a \u201cblue-collar boom.\u201d On that issue, a modest deficit before the speech turned into a solid edge afterward. Trump vowed his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada will \u201cmassively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers and factory workers\u201d while producing \u201ca much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity.\u201d That, too, boosted the target voters\u2019 pre-speech evaluations. Those dividends moved voters\u2019 overall approval of Trump and, to varying degrees, their willingness to back his reelection. Among African Americans, approval quadrupled, though their willingness to vote for Trump didn\u2019t budge. Among white millennials, approval and voting support rose sharply. Trump reaped narrower gains among Hispanics and blue-collar white women. Even slight improvements for Trump could tip the balance in Midwest battlegrounds such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Sunbelt targets, such as Florida and Arizona. But Greenberg said his findings suggest rebuttals from Democratic congressional candidates and the party\u2019s eventual nominee can head off GOP gains. Much of the President\u2019s rhetoric ranged from misleading to simply false. The economy\u2019s manufacturing sector, for example, has fallen into recession. The new trade deal with Canada and Mexico made only modest revisions to its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has aimed to repeal Obamacare protections that keep health coverage affordable for those with pre-existing conditions. He has already proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare. In an interview last month, the President said he was open to more cuts in a second term. Trump\u2019s stance on health care helped propel the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018 midterm elections. By seeking short-term advantage through dubious State of the Union claims, the President could shift debate onto favorable Democratic ground and enlarge his vulnerability later. \u201cHe moved the needle on health care artificially,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cThat creates opportunity for Democrats.\u201d In any case, Trump\u2019s strategy will only reward him if he has the discipline to sustain it over the nine months until Election Day. A single speech \u2013 even a State of the Union with emotional reality show flourishes \u2013 quickly fades from memory. \u201cHe\u2019ll get the usual uptick,\u201d observed Mike Murphy, an ad-maker and strategist  for part Republican presidential campaigns. \u201cGone in a month.\u201d",

Neylan and Partners did not immediately respond to a phone call for comment.

            "article_content": "Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, focused on health care and American workers when she delivered the party\u2019s response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address Tuesday, putting a spotlight on the bread-and-butter issues that Democrats hope will resonate with the American public in the wake of impeachment. \u201cDemocrats are trying to make your health care better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away,\u201d Whitmer said in her speech. She spoke about health care in personal terms, describing how she had fought against an insurance company after her mother was \u201cwrongly denied her coverage for chemotherapy.\u201d Whitmer also made an economic appeal, saying, \u201cAmerican workers are hurting. \u2026 Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed.\u201d White House officials had said Trump would stress a strong US economy in his remarks Tuesday night. Taking on the President directly, Whitmer said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the President says about the stock market. What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don\u2019t have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans, or prescription drugs.\u201d READ: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's Democratic response to Trump's State of the Union address The rebuttal put a spotlight on Whitmer, whom the Democratic Party chose to elevate by giving the speech, as well as Michigan itself, a state that Democrats lost to Trump in the 2016 election and that had previously been part of the Democratic Party\u2019s so-called \u201cblue wall.\u201d Michigan will be fought over as a battleground state in the 2020 election. Whitmer was elected governor in 2018 after campaigning on a promise to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d and her speech served as a way for Democrats to refocus the national political conversation on issues and policies they want to prioritize following the State of the Union and gave the party a chance to draw contrasts with the President. \u201cAll across the country, Democratic leaders are rebuilding bridges, fixing roads, expanding broadband and cleaning up drinking water,\u201d Whitmer said in her speech, before taking a swipe at the President by saying, \u201cBullying people on Twitter doesn\u2019t fix bridges \u2013 it burns them. Our energy should be used to solve problems.\u201d Whitmer also addressed the Senate impeachment trial, which is on track to culminate in a final vote on Wednesday. \u201cAs we witness the impeachment process in Washington there are some things each of us, no matter our party, should demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth matters. Facts matter. And no one should be above the law. It\u2019s not what those senators say tomorrow, it\u2019s what they do that matters.\u201d \u201cRemember: Listen to what people say, but watch what they do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for action.\u201d The Michigan governor gave her speech from East Lansing High School in East Lansing, Michigan. Whitmer wasn\u2019t the only Democrat to deliver a response to the President\u2019s address. Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas was tapped to deliver the Spanish-language response at a family health center in El Paso, Texas. Escobar similarly kept the focus on health care and the economy. According to a transcript of her speech as prepared for delivery and translated into English, Escobar said, \u201cRepublicans across the nation are actively fighting to dismantle benefits that save lives, working in the courts to eliminate every last protection of the Affordable Care Act, including protections for the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats are fighting back.\u201d And she said, \u201cDemocrats also know that too many families are struggling to get by in our economy. President Trump\u2019s economic policies have created inequality that is creating two Americas: one where the wealthiest 1% benefit and one that leaves too many farmers, businesses, and working families behind.\u201d Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley also gave a rebuttal of her own on behalf of the progressive Working Families Party. Pressley, who has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary, told CNN last week that she considered her speech \u201ca love letter to the activists and the foot soldiers who have made (progressive) victories possible and who will continue to make victories possible.\u201d Pressley made the case for progressive touchstone policies like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal, while also directly addressing the President. \u201cTonight I want to remind Donald J. Trump that I see right through him,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cThe American people see right through him. Tonight we reject short sighted policies that work for the wealthy and powerful few but leave the worker and the immigrant behind.\u201d Pressley acknowledged the impeachment trial, but argued that the President presents a threat to the fabric of the country that goes beyond the alleged high crimes and misdemeanors at the center of those proceedings. \u201cSince he was sworn into office more than three years ago, Donald Trump and his administration have attacked our communities with racist, xenophobic, hateful rhetoric, and even more bigoted, destructive policy,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cFor Donald J. Trump, the cruelty is the point.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, will be delivering a State of the Union rebuttal of his own from Manchester, New Hampshire, ahead of next week\u2019s primary in the state.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has insisted for months he\u2019s the only sure-fire winner in a head-to-head match-up with President Donald Trump in the Democratic Party\u2019s primary field. He\u2019d \u201cbeat him like a drum,\u201d Biden often says. But the former vice president limped to New Hampshire on Tuesday on course to lose in the first contest of the 2020 primary. Biden was in fourth place in the Iowa caucuses with 62% of precincts counted \u2013 lagging well behind the two leaders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and third-place Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The results that have been tallied so far are worse than Biden \u2013 who had told reporters the Friday before the caucuses that \u201cthere\u2019s a big difference between second and fourth\u201d \u2013 had hoped. And popular vote numbers indicating Biden fell behind the 15% viability threshold to win delegates in some precincts were a clear indictment of his campaign\u2019s weak organizing effort in the state. The former vice president must now answer new doubts about his core argument: If a candidate who has framed his campaign around the notion that he\u2019s more electable than his rivals loses the first election of the nominating process,where does that leave him? Biden\u2019s campaign is bracing for a protracted battle, hoping his support from black and Latino voters will provide the former vice president a boost. His support from non-white voters is his campaign\u2019s most important asset, and one aides have said for months could allow Biden to weather losses in one or two early-voting states with overwhelmingly white electorates. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race In a call with donors Tuesday led by campaign manager Greg Schultz and top adviser Steve Ricchetti, the Biden aides said he is \u201cwell-positioned to win\u201d the third and fourth contests in Nevada and South Carolina, a source familiar with the call said. His aides in Philadelphia are also readying a Super Tuesday plan focused on building a delegate advantage in congressional districts with large non-white populations. Initial results from Iowa caucuses show Buttigieg has narrow lead Meanwhile, Biden is starting his week-long sprint through New Hampshire, where the most recent poll before the Iowa results, from the Boston Globe and Suffolk University, showed him at second place with 18% support behind Sanders\u2019 24%. In his first campaign stop Tuesday, Biden sounded relieved to have moved past Iowa. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to be in New Hampshire,\u201d Biden said as he began his speech in a Girls Inc. gym in Nashua. \u201cYou have no idea how happy we were to be headed to New Hampshire and Nashua.\u201d He also showed a new willingness to attack Sanders by name and at length, adding to his stump speech a much lengthier critique of the Vermont senator\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan. It was the beginning of Biden\u2019s bid to turn the page on a disappointing showing in Iowa. The 77-year-old third-time presidential contender took a sluggish, front-runner\u2019s approach there. He held no more than two or three events per day, and the crowds at those events \u2013 consistently dwarfed when his leading rivals campaigned in the same cities and towns \u2013 were a sign of trouble: Democratic voters there lacked enthusiasm for the former vice president. The political punditocracy typically downplays crowd size as a measurement of candidate support. After all, in 2016, Sanders drew 26,000 people to a rally in New York, and then was walloped by 16 percentage points by Hillary Clinton in the state\u2019s primary. But crowd size can have strategic importance: Candidate appearances are a major way campaigns attract precinct captains and door-knocking and phone-banking volunteers. And it remains one gauge of enthusiasm for a candidate \u2013 and in town after town across Iowa, Biden was routinely outdrawn by every other major rival. His campaign insisted it was no problem. Biden\u2019s supporters are older and less likely to sit through candidate appearances, aides said. \u201cThere are multiple types of passion, and you all just cover one type,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a former Obama agriculture secretary who campaigned with Biden in the closing days, told a reporter after a recent Biden event. \u201cAnd I get ticked off when they do this. I am incredibly passionate about Joe Biden, but I\u2019m not hootin\u2019, hollerin\u2019 guy. I\u2019m just not. I never have been, never will be. But don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not as passionate as any one of those folks that\u2019s going to those Buttigieg events or Warren events. And that\u2019s true of a lot of these folks who are here today.\u201d \u201cYou cannot read Iowans. They\u2019re guarded,\u201d he said. \u201cSo don\u2019t assume because people aren\u2019t hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 that there\u2019s not passion, there\u2019s not energy. There\u2019s commitment. These people will show up. \u2026 Some of these folks that are hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 probably haven\u2019t made a single phone call and probably haven\u2019t knocked on a single door.\u201d While Biden\u2019s rivals were willing to draw contrasts with each other, Biden typically ignored his foes \u2013 and questions about other Democratic candidates from reporters who followed his final eight-day, 21-stop bus tour through Iowa. Biden burns through cash ahead of early 2020 contests Only in the race\u2019s final days did he begin offering sharper distinctions, foreshadowing how he could soon confront Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg more aggressively. \u201cHow can we beat Trump if we\u2019re not perceived as being totally authentic with the American people about what we\u2019re gonna do and how we\u2019re gonna do it?\u201d Biden said Saturday in Cedar Rapids. \u201cWhat it\u2019s gonna cost and who\u2019s gonna pay?\u201d At Biden\u2019s election night party, attendees were frustrated. Biden had not met the viability threshold in a Johnston precinct where Melanie Weatherall, a 50-year-old former nurse, said she caucused. She said she was \u201cvery discouraged, because people aren\u2019t waking up \u2013 they don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cI keep talking to people until I\u2019m blue in the face, because none of them can beat Trump or Republicans,\u201d Weatherall said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to be stuck with Donald Trump another four years.\u201d Then there\u2019s money: Biden already lagged well behind his rivals in fundraising. His $22.7 million fourth-quarter haul was behind Sanders\u2019 $34.5 million, just behind Buttigieg\u2019s $24.7 million and slightly ahead of Warren\u2019s $21.2 million. His $8.9 million cash on hand trailed all his major rivals \u2013 and was half of Sanders\u2019 $18.2 million. Looming large is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has already spent $200 million on his own campaign and signaled he\u2019s willing to spend much more \u2013 particularly if Biden appears weak as the race reaches Super Tuesday in four weeks. Also present is another billionaire, Tom Steyer, who has climbed into the double digits in recent South Carolina polls and made inroads with black voters. Biden entered Monday night with one significant advantage over the rest of the field: He has by far the most support among black voters. A late January Quinnipiac poll found Biden with 49% support among African-Americans nationally, with Sanders second at a distant 17%. His campaign has long relied on the prospect of a massive win in the February 29 primary in South Carolina, where a majority of the Democratic electorate is black, to propel him forward into Super Tuesday three days later. Fourteen states vote that day, including California and Texas with large non-white populations and a spate of heavily African-American southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee. \u201cSouth Carolina can and should be a place of rehab and relaunch for him,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina. He said he thinks Biden\u2019s support among black voters will withstand Iowa\u2019s results. Bloomberg builds his Super Tuesday juggernaut while 2020 Democrats swarm Iowa Biden\u2019s aides acknowledged that, as in every nominating contest, momentum from the first four contests \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 will be crucial on Super Tuesday. The results in the first four states are especially important, one senior aide said, to four Super Tuesday states with substantial early-voting or voting by mail: California, Texas, North Carolina and Colorado. However, the aide said of the first four states: \u201cWe are one of the few candidates who has a really viable pathway that doesn\u2019t involve emerging from all of these contests as a winner.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has hired state directors or senior advisers in half of the states that vote on Super Tuesday, and plans to lean hard on the political networks of his 300 endorsers the 14 states that vote along with Democrats Abroad and American Samoa on March 3, two senior aides said. The former vice president\u2019s campaign is preparing for a drawn-out delegate battle, and aides say as they\u2019re planning for Super Tuesday, their focus is on congressional districts \u2013 rather than statewide wins. Biden faces a difficult organizational challenge: Sanders, who has a large volunteer army, is already advertising in California and Texas. Warren dispatched aides early to Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg\u2019s billions of dollars are already swamping the airwaves in those states. \u201cWe are not really playing 14 statewide races plus two other contests,\u201d one senior aide said. \u201cWe are playing in a number of congressional districts \u2013 or Texas Senate districts \u2013 and thinking through our capacity and where we put resources from a congressional district level.\u201d In a multi-candidate race, Biden\u2019s campaign thinks it can build an advantage in places where some contenders are short of the 15% mark required to be awarded delegates. That, the aides said, means majority-minority districts and diverse districts across the South. It also means an emphasis on places like Tennessee and North Carolina, where Democratic voters tend to be more moderate. Aids pointed to the Birmingham-based Alabama 7th District as an example: It\u2019s a majority-minority district where Biden has endorsements from the local member of Congress and the Birmingham mayor, and where Hillary Clinton netted all nine delegates in the 2016 primary. Biden\u2019s campaign has hired state directors or senior advisers in seven of the Super Tuesday states: California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Colorado and Minnesota. Aids would not say how many total staffers are on the ground in Super Tuesday states.",

            "article_content": "Health care emerged as the most important issue for choosing a nominee among Iowa Democratic caucusgoers, according to the entrance polls conducted Monday before the caucuses began. Two in five chose health care, and about 1 in 5 said climate change, while fewer chose foreign policy or income inequality. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The party has been bitterly divided over health care throughout the primary campaign. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have called for replacing private insurance with \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d while candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have called for a public option while maintaining existing private insurance systems. Almost 3 in 5 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers support replacing private insurance with a government plan. Almost 2 in 5 oppose that. Caucusgoers for whom health care is the top issue in choosing a nominee were split between Sanders and Buttigieg, with around a quarter supporting each. Almost 2 in 5 support Warren while 1 in 6 support Biden and the same for Klobuchar. Among caucusgoers who oppose replacing private insurance with a government plan, 3 in 10 supported Biden, and another 3 in 10 went for Buttigieg. About 1 in 6 in this group supported Klobuchar. The early entrance polls showed Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren leading with Iowa caucusgoers. Biden led the field among caucusgoers whose top issue for choosing a candidate is foreign policy, with nearly half of that group backing his campaign. Two in five in this group backed Buttigieg. Electability mattered to caucusgoers. About 3 in 5 Iowa caucusgoers say they would prefer a nominee who can beat President Donald Trump over a candidate who agrees with them on the issues. Among those, a quarter are supporting Biden and a quarter are supporting Buttigieg. Klobuchar, Warren and Sanders each drew support from about 1 in 6 of this group. Almost 9 in 10 Biden backers say they prefer a candidate who can beat Trump over one who agrees with them on the issues. The only candidate in the top five whose supporters prioritize agreement on the issues over beating Trump are those backing Sanders. Fewer than 2 in 5 Iowa caucusgoers had never attended a caucus before, down from 44% in the 2016 caucuses and 57% in the 2008 caucuses. More than 6 in 10 had caucused before. Almost half of Iowa caucusgoers under 30 years old supported Sanders, significantly higher than any other candidate among young voters, according to preliminary entrance polls. Young caucusgoers made up a similar share of the Iowan electorate on Monday as they did in 2008, the highest mark in entrance polling stretching back to 2000. Fewer than 1 in 5 back Buttigieg and 1 in 10 support Warren. Almost 3 in 10 Democratic Iowa caucusgoers are over 65 years old, roughly even with 2016. A third of them support Biden, 1 in 5 back Buttigieg and 1 in 5 support Klobuchar. Caucusgoers who described themselves as \u201cvery liberal\u201d went overwhelmingly for Sanders and Warren. More than 2 in 5 support Sanders; more than a quarter support Warren. Fewer, around 1 in 10, support Buttigieg. Among moderate Democratic caucusgoers, a quarter each supported Biden and Buttigieg. Almost 2 in 10 support Klobuchar. Overall, about a quarter of caucusgoers are very liberal, 2 in 5 identified as somewhat liberal and a third as moderate. More than a third of Democratic caucusgoers decided who to support in the last few days or today, roughly double the 16% who made up the minds in the same timeframe in 2016. Almost 2 in 3 Sanders supporters made up their minds last year. Half of Klobuchar\u2019s supporters made up their minds in the last few days. More than 4 in 10 decided who to support before January. The Democratic entrance poll estimates how much support a presidential candidate has at the start of the caucus process and will more closely reflect the first round of voting. It does not reflect the final caucus result, which is used to calculate the state delegate equivalents that a candidate is expected to win. The top finisher in the Iowa Democratic caucuses has gone on to win the nomination in 7 of 9 contested races since 1976. Entrance polls were conducted among Iowa caucusgoers as they entered precincts Monday night. Edison Research conducts the poll for the National Exit Pool, a consortium of news organizations. This story has been updated with the latest entrance poll data.",

            "article_content": "After more than a year of existential fighting within the Democratic Party over its direction, debates over which candidate is best suited to defeat President Donald Trump and a constant, ambient anxiety over the prospect of a nasty primary that could damage the eventual nominee, the Iowa caucuses are finally in sight \u2013 and the leading contenders are still playing nice. Mostly. There have been a series of scattered scuffles, like the ongoing clash between Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Biden over the former vice president\u2019s record on Social Security. But none have broken out into the brand of open political warfare that characterized the party\u2019s last two open primaries. In interviews with veterans of the 2008 and 2016 campaigns, current and former Iowa Democratic Party officials, and aides to the current contestants, there is a common thread: Worries over sparking a backlash among primary voters have created a braking system that has largely subdued the kinds of personal, protracted and heated exchanges that characterized those past campaigns. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The deep field, with at least four nationally viable candidates on the ballot in Iowa, has dampened any enthusiasm among the candidates to launch attacks that might be perceived as openly \u201cnegative.\u201d Campaigns that previously risked those kinds of splashes \u2013 most notably those of former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, both of whom launched memorable debate night broadsides against Biden \u2013 were eventually punished by Democrats in the polls. Both Harris and Castro have since ended their campaigns. In the run-up to the caucuses, a broad consensus has emerged among the leading contenders: You might be able to land a blow against a rival, but it\u2019s just as likely to boomerang and damage your own bid. Meanwhile, the size of the field means that any potential pile-up will clear the road for someone else to zoom on through. The specter of a second Trump administration, and concerns that any Democrat might be perceived as abetting it, even inadvertently, also looms forebodingly over the process. \u201cVoters are looking for people to be constructive. That doesn\u2019t mean that there is not a contrast. That doesn\u2019t mean that you are not going negative, but it does mean that you\u2019re not going negative in ways that might ultimately translate into a significant liability for the general election nominee,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of Indivisible, a nationwide grassroots progressive group that has not yet made an endorsement. For all their meaningful differences, there is a unifying fear among the Democratic candidates that is, at once, both selfish and selfless. None want to see their faces \u2013 or their words \u2013 weaponized by Trump in a campaign ad this summer or fall. Within the campaign\u2019s two ideological factions, there is a similar concern. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have, for all but a few days during the back-and-forth over whether Sanders told her, in 2018, that he didn\u2019t believe a woman could win the election, observed a \u201cnonaggression pact\u201d designed to keep the progressive wing at peace with itself. There seems to be a similar, if less obsessively analyzed, kind of de facto agreement among the campaign\u2019s leading moderates \u2013 Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. To the extent any bad blood has risen, it has mostly flown across those ideological lines. Sanders and his campaign have repeatedly questioned Biden\u2019s record on Social Security, and to a lesser extent, his vote to authorize the Iraq War. Biden hit back, accusing Sanders of pushing a dishonest narrative. But both candidates have taken steps \u2013 especially when pressed by reporters on the trail \u2013 to tamp down the appearance of a deeper personal rift. The feeling among some in the Sanders camp is that, while direct attacks on rival campaigns can often be self-defeating, the strength of the senator\u2019s base gives him more leeway to throw elbows at opponents. \u201cOne of the advantages that Bernie has is that he has an symmetrical advantage to go negative because his base is so loyal that I don\u2019t think people will peel off it,\u201d a Sanders aide told CNN, while also noting that it didn\u2019t make political sense, for now, to press it. Still, Sanders moved quickly last week to put a pin in a more pointed and politically explosive charge from one of his surrogate supporters, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor and former Democratic candidate in New York. After her publication of an op-ed that accused Biden of a \u201cbig corruption problem\u201d \u2013 a piece that was subsequently boosted by the senator\u2019s campaign \u2013 Sanders took the unusual step of publicly apologizing to Biden, who promptly accepted. A brief exchange of digital ads over Social Security followed a day later, but the conflict has been mostly stop-and-start. It is a debate Sanders and his team clearly want on the table, but not enough, at this point, to frame in more damning terms. Buttigieg, who has run one of the feistier campaigns, targeted Warren last fall over \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d questioning her plan to pay for the national health insurance program that has become a catchall cudgel for the moderates. He also ran a TV ad in Iowa critical of Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s tuition-free public college plans. But even then, Buttigieg didn\u2019t mention either progressive by name, instead saying in the spot that \u201csome voices\u201d were pumping a program that might turn off a large swath of the electorate. More recently, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has launched a number of fundraising emails to supporters arguing that Sanders would be a liability in November. \u201cBernie Sanders is raising tons of money, he\u2019s surging in the polls, and he has dark money groups attacking his competitors,\u201d a recent email said. \u201cIf things stay steady until the Iowa Caucuses in just nine days, Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d it continues, \u201cwe need a candidate who can beat Donald Trump in November \u2013 and Pete is the candidate who is best positioned to do that.\u201d Faced with questions from CNN and several reporters on Monday about the substance of the emails, Buttigieg refused to dig in or amplify them, and scrupulously avoided discussing Sanders by name. \u201cI think it\u2019s imperative that we beat Trump. I believe I\u2019m the best candidate to do it,\u201d Buttigieg said when asked if he thought Sanders could not win. \u201cI would be a nominee if we can hold this President to account for the way he\u2019s turned his back on workers, on farmers, on service members, and won\u2019t be afraid to go forward and do that.\u201d When the candidates do go after each other, it is often executed with such subtlety that many observers could be forgiven for missing the connection. Klobuchar delivered that kind of vague attack on Tuesday, when, in an interview with CNN, she observed that impeachment is \u201cnot a game\u201d because she is \u201cactually in the arena.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t, like, turn off the TV or change the channel to watch cartoons,\u201d Klobuchar said in Council Bluffs. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d The line mirrored something Buttigieg had said earlier in the day, when he told an audience in Indianola, \u201cI live and breathe politics, and I\u2019m exhausted watching the coverage of what is happening in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d He added that he thinks it\u2019s all \u201cby design to make us want to switch it off \u2013 just watch cartoons or something and get a break.\u201d If the 2020 contest has fallen somewhere short of the platonic ideal of an entirely \u201cpositive\u201d campaign, veterans of the primaries that pitted Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama in 2008, and Clinton against Sanders four years ago, are quick to note how much closer it\u2019s come. Democratic voters and party leaders \u201care looking at 2016 through a microscope and not wanting to make the same mistakes, therefore we have a much more timid primary season,\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager and a CNN commentator. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case in 2008. We had some experienced campaigners. We had a Clinton in the race, which, back in \u201908, the Clinton machine was identified with war room-style tactics, and we used them. And our opponents weren\u2019t shy about right back at you.\u201d Solis Doyle and others also pointed to Trump as the individual who, when all else fails, functions as the ultimate peacekeeper. \u201cThere is a fatigue that surrounds us all, Democrats and Republicans. And if you are going to run against Trump, part of your message is, \u2018I am not going to do that. I am normal. If I am president, you don\u2019t have to check your phone in the morning to see what I did overnight,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThere is this level of calm and comfort that voters are looking for, and they don\u2019t want the frenzy and aggressiveness that we all sort of live with day in and day out.\u201d The hesitance among the candidates to be perceived as an attack dog, or as endangering the broader effort to defeat Trump, has been most sharply reflected on the airwaves. According to  Kantar/CMAG, which tracks and characterizes the candidates\u2019 TV commercial messaging, the overwhelming majority of ads run in Iowa \u2013 more than 122,000 \u2013 from January 5, 2019, through January 24, 2020, have been \u201cpositive\u201d in tone. Over that period, the group counted only 11 ads it described as \u201cnegative.\u201d A little more than 1,000 others fell under the \u201ccontrast\u201d heading, which includes more tepid spots that might only graze a competitor. Matt Paul, who ran Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign in Iowa, chalked up the campaigns\u2019 caution to the size of the field and the sensitive nature of the state\u2019s Democratic electorate. \u201cThere is always a danger in Iowa if you go too negative, too fast, and certainly if it is perceived as personal, it can quickly backfire,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut it is puzzling to me that they have waited so long to find the contrast. Even in the debates, there have been dust-ups, but not to the level of intensity that you would expect.\u201d Going back to 2008, he noted, the \u201csmaller field\u201d meant that even relatively minor bouts were \u201cmagnified\u201d because Obama and Clinton were, even before the caucuses, the clear standouts. \u201cI think with a larger field, people are waiting for the race to shape up,\u201d he said. One reason operatives believe that 2008 and, to some extent, 2016 were meaner than this contest is that the candidates were running for an open White House. Bad memories of the 2016 primary and its fallout have also shaped the discourse over the past year. Sanders, despite being the most aggressive campaigner, often couches his criticism of Biden with the caveat that the former vice president \u201cis a friend of mine,\u201d and has repeatedly sought to put voters at ease \u2013 and calm their post-2016 anxieties \u2013 by reminding them of his promise to back the eventual nominee, no matter how the contest plays out. When Trump tried to stir the pot on January 17 by accusing the Democratic Party of \u201crigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time,\u201d the Sanders campaign knocked down the claim in a statement that evening. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about who is rigging what: it is Donald Trump\u2019s action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cHis transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.\u201d It was a telling note of caution from a campaign, and candidate, that has rarely been shy about criticizing the Democratic establishment. And for good reason. Scott Brennan, the Iowa Democratic Party chair during the 2008 caucuses, was instantly unsettled by the mention of 2016 \u2013 and warned that voters in the state felt the same way. \u201cMaybe I have tried to forget about it (the heated nature of that primary) and you have dredged up some old wounds,\u201d Brennan told CNN. \u201cI think a lot of what is driving this is 2016 here was so testy and the animosity remained well after the caucus. So now Iowans have kind of spoken and said, \u2018We hated that, so don\u2019t do it again.\u2019 \u201c CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Nine days from the Iowa caucuses, Democratic presidential candidates are fighting bad winter weather and the headwinds of an impeachment trial that\u2019s dominating national headlines and latching the senators in the race to Washington instead of the campaign trail. Iowa Democratic voters, meanwhile, are still trying to make up their minds. Iowa has remained a four-candidate top tier featuring former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is still seeking to climb into that top tier. National and early state polls show Sanders at his strongest position of the race just days before voting begins \u2013 a reality that this week was met with a sharper-than-usual rebuke from Biden and new criticism from his 2016 foe Hillary Clinton. Four in 10 likely Iowa caucusgoers say there is at least a moderate chance they\u2019ll change their minds about who they support between now and February 3, a recent Monmouth University poll found. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve got three top runners,\u201d said Ginger Thompson, a retired county worker in Osage who said she\u2019s considering Biden, Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. \u201cI just want somebody that definitely has compassion, and doesn\u2019t split our country apart like it is now.\u201d Here are eight stories you might have missed in recent days: It was the debate that Sanders hungered for, but \u2013 until this past week \u2013 was unsure of how to escalate. The Sanders team and its surrogates have been talking about Biden\u2019s past comments on Social Security, in which he has expressed a willingness to entertain cuts to the program in the interest of striking bipartisan deals for some time. Biden, though, seemed content to ignore it all before switching gears last weekend to denounce a misleadingly edited video of a 2018 speech that was being circulated by some members of Sanders\u2019 staff. With Biden rising to the bait, Sanders \u2013 who distanced himself from the video clip in question \u2013 responded by taking more direct aim at Biden\u2019s old statements. \u201cI think anyone who looks at the vice president\u2019s record understands that time after time after time, Joe has talked about the need to cut Social Security,\u201d Sanders told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s in the congressional record. He has said that many, many times. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s disputable.\u201d The back-and-forth took an unexpected turn on Monday night, when Sanders apologized to Biden over the content of an op-ed, written by a supporter and boosted by the campaign (which has since deleted their promotion of it from a campaign website), accusing the former vice president of having a \u201ccorruption problem.\u201d Biden accepted and it seemed like the candidates might be trying to deescalate. But one day later, Biden launched a digital ad accusing \u201cBernie\u2019s campaign\u201d of \u201cnot telling the truth\u201d about his record on Social Security. Within a few hours, Sanders tweeted out a video of his own, this one featuring audio of Biden talking on the Senate floor about freezing federal spending, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cNobody likes him.\u201d Hillary Clinton unleashed on her 2016 primary rival once more this week. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the release of a new documentary about her life, Clinton went after Sanders again \u2013 this time in sharply personal terms. \u201cHe was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It\u2019s all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it,\u201d Clinton says in the film. Asked about the line by THR, she stood by it. Clinton also refused, in an interview published early Tuesday morning, to say that she would support Sanders if he won the nomination this year. Later in the day, though, she sought to tamp down the swirling uproar in a tweet, assuring Democrats that she \u201cwill do whatever I can to support our nominee.\u201d Sanders turned the other cheek throughout the day, first saying in a statement, \u201cMy focus today is on a monumental moment in American history: the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Together, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history.\u201d Perhaps as notably, his campaign and top surrogates also held back, effectively putting a pin in what had the potential to be a major, pre-Iowa controversy. The senators still running for president have put on a brave face as the impeachment trial consumes Washington and, almost uniformly, have talked about how they are fulfilling their constitutional obligations by sitting through hours of impeachment hearings instead of rallying supporters in Iowa. But underneath those solemn duties is concern: It\u2019s unknown whether the impeachment trial is better for people like Buttigieg, Biden and Yang who now have Iowa all to themselves, or for senators like Warren, Sanders, Klobuchar and Michael Bennet, all of whom have become regulars on cable television as the trial plays out. And this close to Iowa, that unknown is worrying. Sanders has talked about how the impeachment process is somber and serious, but his campaign blasted an email on Thursday telling supporters that the Vermont senator is \u201cstuck\u201d in DC \u2013 and hoped to raise money off the predicament. Warren and Klobuchar have become regulars on cable television. Warren told MSNBC on Wednesday she was \u201cpinned down here in Washington\u201d but that the campaign was activating supporters and surrogates who want to \u201ccarry forward\u201d her campaign because they believe she is \u201cstill in the fight.\u201d Klobuchar has also hosted a tele-townhall for 12,000 people, according to her campaign. For Bennet, whose campaign has struggle to gain any traction, impeachment has stopped him from his regular trips to New Hampshire, the second state in the nominating process. But it has also let him set himself apart: He pledged to stop fundraising during the impeachment proceedings, something the other candidates have not done. Buttigieg, at the same time, is running against everything that is going on in Washington. The former mayor has kept up a blistering pace through Iowa in January, headlining 25 events alone. And at almost every town hall and rally, Buttigieg has made the case that his experience outside of Washington is more important in this current environment than years of federal government experience. Buttigieg has even taken it a step further, suggesting at an event on Thursday in Washington, DC \u2013 just miles from the impeachment  \u2013 that it is time \u201cto bring to the highest office in the land that perspective that only my fellow mayors can,\u201d a perspective that Buttigieg said was animated by \u201cwhat to do when it\u2019s time for a decision and there is no one else to call and you are not in the comfort of a committee room, or a TV panel, but on the ground.\u201d All of this is part of Buttigieg\u2019s strategy to break through the constant impeachment coverage in Washington and deliver a message in Iowa and elsewhere that creates contrast between himself and the partisan fighting. Buttigieg defended these comments in an interview with CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s questioning whether folks who work in Washington are important. I think the question is one of a perspective,\u201d Buttigieg said in the interview. \u201cThe reality is, if your main criteria here is about time spent in Washington, and years of Washington experience, you\u2019ve got your choice and it\u2019s not going to be me. I\u2019m here to make the case for a different kind of perspective coming to Washington.\u201d Warren is managing expectations ahead of the Iowa caucuses. In a memo released on Friday, Warren\u2019s campaign played down the importance of the early primary states and highlighted the number of delegates in play on Super Tuesday and in the weeks and months after. \u201cWe expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,\u201d Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote, suggesting the primary could stretch well into the spring. The memo includes graphics breaking up the primary into four stages and notes that first four states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 only make up 3.9% of the full delegate count. Warren remains in the top tier of candidates in Iowa, but her numbers, in the early states and nationally, have mostly stalled since her summer surge. Perhaps more troubling for the Warren campaign is a new poll, released on Thursday by Boston-based WBUR, which showed Sanders, at 29%, leading in New Hampshire with more than double her 13%. Both Sanders and Warren represent neighboring states and would take defeat there harder than Biden or Buttigieg. Bernie Sanders is facing a backlash from some Democrats after his campaign trumpeted an endorsement from comedian Joe Rogan, a popular podcast and YouTube talk show host with a history of making racist, homophobic and transphobic comments. \u201cI think I'll probably vote for Bernie... He\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life. He\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d -Joe Rogan pic.twitter.com/fuQP0KwGGI Rogan, a libertarian-leaning broadcaster with a public persona in the mold of Howard Stern, is a divisive figure who has said the N-word on his show and in 2013 questioned \u2013 using offensive language \u2013 whether a transgender MMA fighter should be able to compete against other women. In a statement Friday afternoon, Human Rights Commission President Alphonso David praised Sanders for running a campaign that has been \u201cunabashedly supportive of the rights of LGBTQ people,\u201d but called on the Vermont senator to consider rejecting the endorsement in light of Rogan\u2019s \u201cvicious rhetoric.\u201d The decision to highlight Rogan\u2019s support has divided opinion among Democrats and activists, particularly online, where it has sparked a heated debate over whether Sanders should have aligned himself with Rogan in any form or context. Looming over all of the Democrats fighting for primacy in Iowa and New Hampshire is Michael Bloomberg, who is avoiding the first four contests and spending hundreds of millions to position himself ahead of Super Tuesday in early March. The former New York mayor has spent an astonishing $235 million on television, radio and digital advertising, nearly $100 million more than Tom Steyer, a fellow billionaire running for the Democratic nomination, and nearly nine times as much as Buttigieg. That number will be dwarfed by how much his campaign \u2013 in total \u2013 has spent, a figure that won\u2019t come out until later this month when his first report is filed to the Federal Election Commission. Bloomberg ads have become omnipresent \u2013 so much so that they have gotten under President Donald Trump\u2019s skin. His theory is this: In a race where Democrats want to beat Trump more than anything, they will give him a look if he performs well in early March and proves that he can take on Trump. It\u2019s a big bet, but Bloomberg \u2013 who is worth over $50 billion, according to numerous estimates \u2013 has the money. Billionaire investor Tom Steyer\u2019s attempts to greet Bernie Sanders \u2013 only to be brushed off by the Vermont senator \u2013 have become a meme in recent days. It started at last week\u2019s Democratic debate in Iowa, when Steyer walked into the middle of a tense exchange between Warren and Sanders. \u201cI just want to say hi, Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, good. OK,\u201d Sanders responded as he turned to walk off stage. Then, at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in South Carolina on Monday, Sanders appeared to brush Steyer off again. Bernie Sanders truly is America. pic.twitter.com/0rkKpagRAo Still, Steyer continues trying: After Clinton criticized Sanders, Steyer came to his defense. \u201cAt the risk of getting in the middle of it \u2014 I like @BernieSanders,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNow let\u2019s move on, America.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Democrats are banking on a health care focused message to protect the majority they won in 2018, while the third presidential impeachment in US history consumes the Senate. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Monday its first major ad of the election year, spending at least $1 million dollars to blame Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans in Congress for blocking House legislation to lower prescription drug costs. The 30-second spot will run on cable markets in major cities from California to Texas to Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Washington Republicans get away with padding the pockets of drug manufacturers and special interests that financed their campaigns while everyday Americans\u2019 prescription drug costs skyrocket,\u201d said DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos, an Illinois congresswoman. The ad is the most significant sign yet that House Democrats are seeking to elevate McConnell, who is less popular than President Donald Trump, as the face of the Republican Party in 2020, similar to how Republicans prominently featured House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in attack ads on their way to capturing the House in 2010. It\u2019s also one of the largest TV advertising investments so far by either the DCCC or its GOP counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee. The combined groups spent only about $4 million on TV in 2019, mostly focused on a North Carolina special election. The DCCC has a big cash advantage over its Republican rival, having on hand $18 million more than the NRCC by the end of November 2019. But one Republican Super PAC \u2014 the Congressional Leadership Fund \u2014 announced on Monday that it has $28 million in cash on hand. CLF President Dan Conston told CNN the Democrats ad was \u201cnothing more than smoke and mirrors to distract from the reality that Democrats have nothing to show for their time in the majority but a hyper-partisan attempt to impeach President Trump.\u201d \u201cAs impeachment continues to cloud out everything else in Washington, Democrats are desperate to turn the page and turn around their chances for 2020,\u201d he added. Last month, the House passed a drug price bill backed by Pelosi, but it\u2019s not expected to make it through the Senate. The bill would empower the Health and Human Services secretary to negotiate annually for the best prices on up to 250 medications and require drug companies to pay a rebate to the government if the prices of certain drugs increased faster than inflation. McConnell has said it is derived from the Democrats\u2019 \u201csame old one-size fits all, government-controlled philosophy\u201d that inhibits \u201cchoice,\u201d \u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d NRCC spokesman Chris Pack told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s alarming to see Democrats so proudly peddling a big government drug bill that stifles the research and creation of new drugs to combat life threatening illnesses.\u201d Drug makers hiked prices on hundreds of medications for 2020, but it\u2019s unclear what the Senate will do to lower drug costs. Sens. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Finance Committee, and Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, updated their drug price bill last month, but it still faces a tough road in the chamber. That bill would require drug makers to pay Medicare if they increase prices faster than inflation on certain medications, a provision that has rankled many Senate Republicans.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump signaled this week that he\u2019s open to cutting federal entitlements to reduce the federal deficit, despite previously campaigning on protecting Medicare and Social Security. Asked by CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether entitlements would ever be on his plate, Trump responded, \u201cAt some point they will be.\u201d \u201cWe have tremendous growth. We\u2019re going to have tremendous growth. This next year I \u2013 it\u2019ll be toward the end of the year. The growth is going to be incredible. And at the right time, we will take a look at that,\u201d he added. Asked by CNBC whether he was willing \u201cto do some of the things that you said you wouldn\u2019t do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare,\u201d Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going look.\u201d \u201cI mean we\u2019ve never had growth like this. We never had a consumer that was taking in, through \u2013 different means, over $10,000 a family,\u201d he said. During the 2016 campaign, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t have to touch Social Security because his plan to boost economic growth to at least 4% would take care of the entitlement\u2019s long-term problems. Sanders attacks Biden's record on social security as primary race heats up ahead of Iowa Social Security is one of the most popular government programs across party lines, along with Medicare. The issue is sure to be a top political issue in the 2020 general election campaign \u2013 and it\u2019s even emerging as a heated talking point in the Democratic primary. Most recently, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has pushed for a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d program and said he wants to expand Social Security benefits, has targeted former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s record. In the 1980s and 1990s, many high-ranking Democrats, including Biden, sought to signal their seriousness about reducing the federal deficit by expressing a willingness to negotiate with the GOP over plans to slow Social Security\u2019s growth or raise the retirement age. The President did not offer further details during the interview about what he\u2019s considering cutting. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that entitlement cuts are not something he would entertain. \u201cThe President said in an interview yesterday at Davos that he will take a look at cutting Social Security and other entitlements after the 2020 election and that it is, actually, he said, the easiest of all things,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe President promised that unlike other Republicans, he wouldn\u2019t touch Social Security and Medicare. He\u2019s already broken that promise and gone after Medicare. Now, it looks like Social Security is in the President\u2019s crosshairs as well.\u201d Speaking to press amid the Senate impeachment trial, Schumer added: \u201c(E)ven as this important trial continues, Americans should hear that the President is casually talking about cutting their Social Security at a Swiss ski resort with the global financial elite.\u201d When Trump announced his run for president in 2015, he promised to \u201c(s)ave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it.\u201d And on Thursday, following Democratic responses to his comments at Davos, Trump reiterated his claim that he would \u201csave\u201d Social Security. \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy your Social Security. I have totally left it alone, as promised, and will save it!\u201d Trump tweeted. As recently as November, the President asserted at a campaign rally that Democratic policies were putting health care entitlements at risk, promising that Republicans would \u201csafeguard\u201d Medicare. Trump has prioritized major increases to defense spending and implemented tax cuts over reducing the federal deficit, which has ballooned to record highs under the current administration. And while Trump has talked about preserving entitlements and safety net programs, his previous budget proposals have signaled that the Trump administration has been open to cuts. The administration\u2019s fiscal 2020 budget proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security, student lending and nutritional assistance for low-income families \u2013 a pitch that was unpopular with Democratic lawmakers. The proposal aimed to reduce spending on Medicare by $845 billion over 10 years. CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, Sarah Westwood, Pamela Brown and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is unlikely to consider the fate of the Affordable Care Act before the 2020 presidential election after denying a request Tuesday from supporters of the law to fast-track consideration of the case. The ruling sets aside the potential for another major shift in the political landscape prior to the election on an issue that has dominated American politics for the last decade. President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to repeal Obamacare was central to Democrats sweeping into power in the House in the 2018 midterms \u2013 a victory that came eight years after Republicans had gained the House majority on their opposition to Obama\u2019s signature health care law. But in the decade since the Affordable Care Act became law, elements of it \u2013 such as requirements that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 have become popular, turning health care politics in Democrats\u2019 favor. It\u2019s already sure to be a focal point of the 2020 election. The law\u2019s future is at the center of the Democratic presidential primary, with more moderate candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying they want to expand on Obamacare by allowing Americans to buy into a Medicare-style public insurance option. More progressive candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren say they favor scrapping private insurance altogether for a government-run single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system. The justices were asked to quickly rule on the appeal of a ruling from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals that held Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate was unconstitutional, but had sent the case down to a Texas federal court to decide the fate of other provisions of the sprawling law. Lawyers for the Democratic-led House of Representatives, as well as California and other Democratic-led states, seeking to keep the law intact, told the justices they needed to step in immediately given potential for the \u201cprofound destabilization of the health care system,\u201d as California\u2019s brief put it. Following that move, the Trump administration said in a filing that it didn\u2019t want the justices to act quickly on the case since the key issue \u2013 how much of the law should remain in effect \u2013 is still being litigated. The administration is siding with Texas and several GOP-led states in arguing the law should be struck down. \u201cBy refusing to expedite the ACA case, the justices are basically saying that they\u2019d rather not decide this case until they absolutely have to \u2013 which, depending on how the November elections go, may be never,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cThey may still choose to hear the current appeal, or wait for the case to go back to the district court before taking it up, but either way, the earliest we\u2019d get a decision from the court about the fate of Obamacare would be the middle of 2021. Thus, in a term that is already full of high-profile cases with major potential political ramifications, the court decided to sit this one out, at least for now.\u201d In 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts cast the key vote in the landmark 5-4 decision on the act, holding that the individual mandate was valid under Congress\u2019 taxing power. But in 2017, the Republican-led Congress cut the tax penalty for those who lacked insurance to zero as part of the year-end tax overhaul. Texas and other Republican-led states sued arguing that since the mandate was no longer tied to a specific tax penalty, it had lost its legal underpinning. They also argued that because the individual mandate was intertwined with a multitude of other provisions, the entire law should fall, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions. In the circuit court\u2019s decision last month, the court punted on whether the rest of the massive law \u2013 even provisions unrelated to the mandate \u2013 could remain on the books. Over 98 pages, the 2-1 appeals court asked a district court to review that issue, infuriating supporters of the law. In an effort to get the justices to review the lower court\u2019s decision, Donald Verrilli, a lawyer for the Democratic-led House, said in a filing earlier this month that the law is a \u201cfixture of the American health-care system\u201d and urged the justices in legal briefs to review the \u201cremarkable\u201d lower court decision that \u201cthreatens profound destabilization of the health care system.\u201d \u201cThe present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the ACA to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people\u2019s elected representatives,\u201d the filing stated. They noted that the law has become embedded in American society with popular provisions, including one that says that the more than 100 million individuals with pre-existing conditions including cancer, diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, could not be denied coverage. This story has been updated with additional details of the case.",

            "article_content": "Democratic voters have wrestled all year with whether they want to watch another female nominee face President Donald Trump in November. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, The New York Times\u2019 editorial board wants to force a reckoning \u2013 by endorsing Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The newspaper\u2019s decision to endorse two women this week may not play a role in who ultimately wins the Democratic nomination. Still, it was historic and may be a potential turning point at a time when the politics of gender have engulfed the 2020 campaign. The Times argued that Warren would be less divisive \u2013 and therefore more effective \u2013 than fellow progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has relished his refusal to compromise. And they made the case that Klobuchar, who is ideologically similar to former Vice President Joe Biden, \u201chas emerged as the standard-bearer for the Democratic center.\u201d The newspaper signed off its endorsement with words that might have seemed unthinkable a generation ago: \u201cMay the best woman win.\u201d But beneath the veneer of ascendant female power, the question of how deep sexism runs in America has been the long-running undercurrent of the 2020 race. The irony is palpable. Democrats are coming to grips with that question at a time when their party has lurched in its most liberal direction ever, and at a time when the #MeToo movement has empowered women like never before. Yet many Democratic voters still worry about whether America is ready for a female president. For the past year, voters have raised the subject uncomfortably in interviews with CNN when talking about Warren, Klobuchar and California\u2019s Sen. Kamala Harris (who dropped out late last year). Though many Americans are exhausted by Trump\u2019s misogyny and bullying, some Democrats openly worry whether \u201cTrump voters\u201d would support a female nominee to replace him. They wonder aloud whether a woman would withstand Trump\u2019s withering criticism as well as a man. They want to avoid a repeat of the kinds of moments that seemed to define 2016: when Trump stalked behind Hillary Clinton on the debate stage or his portrayal of her as a shrill schoolmarm, which somehow cut to the core of her electability. \u201cIn the minds of some people, including mostly men, but also some women, they look at the fact that Hillary lost and they think, \u2018Oh, a woman can\u2019t win against Trump,\u2019 \u201d former Clinton adviser Brian Fallon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct. But in general, people always overlearn the lesson of the last election, or they always fight the last war. So it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we nominated a woman in 2016, we lost; so we shouldn\u2019t do that again.\u2019 \u201c \u201cJust because something happened doesn\u2019t mean it was the cause of what happened,\u201d said Fallon, who\u2019s the executive director of Demand Justice. He pointed instead to three factors: Trump\u2019s over-performance with rural, non-college-educated whites in 2016; the drop-off among Democratic base voters, compared with the 2012 Obama campaign; and the fact that the Clinton campaign did not draw out as many college-educated female swing voters as expected. Fallon noted that the electoral equation changed in 2018, when college-educated women came out in droves to vote for Democrats. \u201cThere\u2019s an easily identifiable theory of how a woman candidate this time could experience a different outcome than Hillary did,\u201d he said. Gender moved to the forefront of the 2020 campaign last week, when Warren and Sanders openly argued about whether he had told her during a private dinner in 2018, as first reported by CNN, that he did not believe a woman could win. The quarrel launched a national conversation about latent sexism. But in their own ways, Klobuchar and Warren have been trying to deal with their invisible hurdle for many months. From the beginning of the race, the senators from Massachusetts and Minnesota, along with Harris, have tried to project toughness, steely determination, a willingness to fight and a thirst for confrontation. Warren showed those traits in the last debate: with her zinger reminding the audience that the men on the stage had collectively lost 10 elections (while only the women had won every single one), and afterward, when she walked up to Sanders when the debate was over and confronted him. \u201cI think you called me a liar on national TV,\u201d Warren could be heard saying to Sanders in their tense exchange after the CNN/Des Moines Register debate. She was ready to have that fight, cameras still rolling but without the audio, in front of all the Americans who were watching. It was Sanders who turned away. \u201cLet\u2019s not do it now,\u201d he said. Klobuchar, too, has tackled latent sexism since announcing her candidacy, more directly than any of her rivals. \u201cIf you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day,\u201d Klobuchar said in one memorable line at the fifth debate in November. At that same debate, Klobuchar caught heat by bluntly telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that no woman running for the Democratic nomination would have made it to the debate stage if they had the same amount of experience as 37-year-old then-Mayor Pete Buttigieg. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard\u201d and must work harder than men, she said at the debate. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact.\u201d Along the way, the male candidates have been forced into their own reckonings. In November, Biden was accused of sexism after implicitly suggesting in a Medium post that Warren\u2019s rhetoric on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d reflected \u201can angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics.\u201d Warren seized on the world \u201cangry\u201d in a fundraising email to her supporters: \u201cI am angry and I own it,\u201d the subject line said. \u201cOver and over, we are told women are not allowed to be angry,\u201d Warren wrote in that email. \u201cIt makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d Biden said his characterization of her rhetoric had nothing to do with gender: \u201cThe strong women in my life are angry \u2013 they get angry about things,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it.\u201d On the campaign trail in New Hampshire this weekend, Sanders acknowledged that voter anxiety about electing a woman exists, but he added: \u201cThe world has changed.\u201d \u201cTo those people who think that a woman cannot be elected, you\u2019re dead wrong. If you think a gay American cannot be elected, you are dead wrong. If you think an African American cannot be elected, you are dead wrong,\u201d Sanders said in Concord. \u201cI think the American people have moved very significantly in trying to look at candidates based on what they stand for, not on their gender, not on their sexuality, not on their race.\u201d He noted that some voters hold his age against him, just as some hold Buttigieg\u2019s youth against him, when weighing the candidates. \u201cIf you are looking at Buttigieg, he is a young guy. People will say, well, he\u2019s too young to be president,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou look at Elizabeth Warren, she\u2019s a woman. Yeah, so everybody, you know, brings some negatives if you like. I would just hope very much that the American people look at the totality of a candidate, not at their gender, not at their sexuality, not at their age, but at everything.\u201d It remains unclear whether voters will view Warren\u2019s sex as \u201ca negative.\u201d But with voting beginning in two weeks, America will soon find out.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg on Wednesday warned against \u201cgoing to the extreme\u201d on important election issues a day after he was assailed by his liberal competitors at the CNN/Des Moines Register Democratic debate for being too moderate. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the case that I would caution against going to the extreme when we can solve big problems like delivering health care to every American without alienating half the country. But I also believe we can be very bold at a time like this,\u201d Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cThe point that I\u2019m making to voters, to the American people, is that I\u2019m prepared to be the boldest president we\u2019ve had in a half century when it comes to big reforms, big game-changing improvements and advancements in our access to health care, education and more,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s a way to do it. That we can actually unite Americans around rather than chasing for the most extreme idea.\u201d Buttigieg\u2019s comments reflect some of the most significant fault lines among the party\u2019s top tier candidates. The former mayor has presented a more centrist alternative to the progressive views of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have excited liberal voters but, according to moderates like Buttigieg, risk alienating the rest of the country in a general election. 6 takeaways from the Democratic debate in Iowa On Tuesday night, six candidates participated in the last debate before next month\u2019s Iowa caucuses, where voters will cast the first votes of this election cycle. Buttigieg, who has cast his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan as a viable alternative to Warren and Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, faced an attack during the debate from the Massachusetts senator, who said the \u201cproblem\u201d with plans like Buttigieg\u2019s is that while they are an improvement on the staus quo, they are only a \u201csmall improvement.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just not true that the plan I\u2019m proposing is small,\u201d Buttigieg shot back. \u201cWe have to move past the Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan consists of how many Americans it can alienate.\u201d In his CNN interview, the former mayor underscored his moderate approach to his health care proposal, which would not force all Americans onto government health coverage \u2013 like Warren\u2019s \u2013 but would offer a public option for people who choose to enroll. \u201cOn something like health care, I think it\u2019s just more reasonable to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t force Americans off their plans if they don\u2019t want to give those plans up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again, this would also be the biggest, boldest thing we\u2019ve done to American health care in a half century.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner, Dan Merica and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check coverage of the last Democratic presidential debate before the voting begins with the Iowa caucuses on February 3. We will post fact checks as we complete them. The debate was hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. It included six candidates who met the party\u2019s qualification criteria, the smallest number to date. The candidates were former Vice President Joe Biden; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and businessman Tom Steyer. Sanders repeated a previous claim about the amount of money the US spends on health care. \u201cWe are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane,\u201d Sanders said. Facts First: This is an exaggeration. The US does not spend twice as much per capita as \u201cany\u201d other country on health care, though it does spend more than twice the average for the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a group of 36 countries with large market economies. Switzerland, at $7,317 per capita, and Norway, at $6,187 per capita, were well above half the US level, $10,586 per capita, in 2018, the last year for which international data is available. Germany ($5,986), Sweden ($5,447), Austria ($5,395) and Denmark ($5,299) were also above half though more narrowly. The OECD average for 2018 was $3,992 per capita, so Sanders would be correct if he had said the US spends more than twice the average for wealthy countries. But he has been using his incorrect wording since at least 2009, when fact-checkers at PolitiFact first noted that it wasn\u2019t true. You can read a longer version of this fact check here. It is possible that the health spending numbers were different in 2019 than they were in 2018 and in years prior, but that data is not yet available. - Daniel Dale In defending her plan to build on the Affordable Care Act instead of pushing for the more sweeping Medicare for All plans proposed by her rivals, Klobuchar pointed out that more people support Obamacare than approve of President Donald Trump. \u201cI would also note practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the United States,\u201d the Minnesota Democrat said at CNN\u2019s debate on Tuesday night. Facts First: While no poll directly compares the two, it\u2019s true that Obamacare is better liked. Polls done in November show Obamacare with a 10-point advantage over Trump. Subsequent polls also show former President Barack Obama\u2019s health reform law being more popular than the current president. A November poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has tracked public opinion on the Affordable Care Act since it was passed in 2010, found that 52% of American adults had a favorable opinion of the law. By contrast, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in November found that 42% approve of Trump\u2019s job as president. That figure stayed essentially the same in a December CNN poll, which found Trump\u2019s favorability rating was 43%, but it was within the margin of error. - Tami Luhby Sanders said America\u2019s childcare system \u201cis an embarrassment, it is unaffordable,\u201d claiming that childcare workers take home lower paychecks than people working at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cChildcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald\u2019s workers,\u201d Sanders said. Facts First: While some childcare workers undoubtedly make less than some McDonald\u2019s workers, US government data from 2018 shows that childcare workers took home a higher mean hourly salary than fast food workers. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says the average wage for fast food and counter workers was $22,260 in May 2018. That\u2019s a mean hourly salary of $10.70. US childcare workers make on average $24,610 a year, the 2018 BLS data showed, more than the fast food workers. That corresponds to mean hourly wages of $11.83. A proxy statement from McDonald\u2019s, a worldwide company, filed in 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shows that the company\u2019s median employee made $7,017 in 2017. What this number doesn\u2019t say is that McDonald\u2019s median employee is a part-time restaurant crew member in Poland, according to the proxy statement. - Anneken Tappe Biden claimed President Donald Trump \u201cweakened\u201d sanctions against Pyongyang in his pursuit of meetings with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. \u201cThe President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him,\u201d Biden said. Facts First: Trump has not weakened the sanctions his administration has placed on North Korea to date, and has in fact ratcheted them up from the Obama administration. Although Trump did once spark mass confusion among his aides when he tweeted he was ordering the removal of sanctions on Pyongyang that had not yet been imposed or even announced. Biden\u2019s claim that Trump offered Kim Jong Un the \u201clegitimacy\u201d North Korea has long craved echoes a widespread criticism of the President\u2019s approach to dealing with the Hermit Kingdom. In March of last year, Trump tweeted that he had \u201cordered the withdrawal\u201d of \u201cadditional large scale sanctions\u201d he claimed the Treasury Department had announced earlier that day. But his announcement sent White House officials scrambling. Many aides quickly concluded that the President was referring to sanctions targeting two Chinese shipping companies that have allegedly helped North Korea skirt sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Those new actions were fulfilled under existing sanctions authority. But two sources familiar with Trump\u2019s tweet said it was in fact not about those sanctions, but instead about additional large-scale sanctions targeting North Korea that had been in the works. During an Oval Office meeting a month later with his South Korean counterpart, Trump claimed he believed sanctions are at a \u201cfair level\u201d and acknowledged the dust-up, saying he \u201chad the option of significantly increasing them\u201d but decided he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was necessary.\u201d The Trump administration ratcheted up sanctions even as the President has met with Kim Jong Un three times without preconditions. In the past, the Trump administration has offered to provide relief from these sanctions only if Pyongyang completely denuclearizes, an outcome that has looked increasingly unlikely as Kim Jong Un has in recent days threatened to restart nuclear testing. So although some lawmakers have criticized Trump\u2019s decision to embrace diplomacy with the brutal North Korean leader while extracting no concessions, loosening sanctions has not been part of this administration\u2019s policy toward Pyongyang. - Sarah Westwood and Zachary Cohen During an exchange about electability and whether a woman can win the presidency, Warren compared the political careers of the men on the debate stage with the women. \u201cCan a woman beat Donald Trump?\u201d Warren said. \u201cLook at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women. Amy and me.\u201d Facts First: Warren has the facts right. She and Klobuchar are undefeated, and their male opponents have lost a total of 10 elections during their political careers. But Warren\u2019s talking point ignores the fact that Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg have also prevailed in more than two dozen elections since 1970. It\u2019s true that Warren and Klobuchar have won all their races. The statistics are more impressive for Klobuchar \u2013 she\u2019s been in politics since 1998, while Warren has only competed in two races since 2012. During the 1970s and 1980s, Sanders waged several third-party and independent campaigns for governor and for US Senate. He also lost the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton in 2016. But in addition to these losses, Sanders has won more than a dozen political campaigns, including successful campaign for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and representing the state in the US House and Senate. Biden waged two unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008. But he also had a successful career in the Senate \u2013 winning elections 7 times starting in 1972 \u2013 and two victorious national campaigns alongside Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Some of these campaigns were waged before Buttigieg was born. During his political career, he won two campaigns for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and lost a statewide race for treasurer of Indiana in 2010. The only other man on the race, Steyer, has never been a candidate for public office. The bottom line is that Warren\u2019s talking point was accurate. But the men on the stage actually won more elections than they\u2019ve lost over the years, undercutting Warren\u2019s electability argument. And some of their losses at the polls were decades ago, so it\u2019s not clear how relevant they are to the 2020 race. Later in the debate, Sanders followed up another comment from Warren, where she said she was the only candidate who defeated a Republican incumbent in the past three decades. Sanders touted his 1990 campaign for US House, exactly 30 years ago, when he unseated Republican Rep. Peter Smith. - Marshall Cohen Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg asserted during the debate on Tuesday that the Trump administration admitted that the Iran nuclear deal was working before pulling out of it. Buttigieg said, \u201cBy gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran, by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.\u201d Facts First: This is basically true. By repeatedly recertifying the nuclear deal and waiving sanctions against Tehran as a result, the Trump administration effectively acknowledged that Iran was abiding by the terms of the deal even as the President publicly criticized it. The terms of the nuclear deal required the US president to reauthorize it every 120 days to keep sanctions from kicking in. Trump didn\u2019t leave the deal until May 2018 and reauthorized it a handful of times after taking office. CNN previously reported that the President promised to kill the deal on the campaign trail but was persuaded by cabinet members and allies several times to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee in April 2018 that the verification provisions in the pact were \u201cpretty robust\u201d though he did not publicly back the deal. Despite his criticism of the deal, neither Trump nor his aides had been able to say that Iran was violating the terms of the agreement. - Caroline Kelly and Zachary Cohen Sanders repeated his claim that NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China have cost the US \u201csome 4 million jobs.\u201d \u201cI am sick and tired,\u201d said Sanders as he drew a contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden, pointing to large multinational corporations that he says have reaped the benefits. Facts First: This is likely an overestimate of the impact trade agreements can have on the country\u2019s employment. It\u2019s difficult to measure the overall economic impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement since trade and investment trends can be affected by a number of factors, including economic growth, inflation and even a weakening dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most estimates find that NAFTA had little if any impact on national employment levels, though the effect was uneven across regions and industries. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that between 1993 and 2013, the US trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 billion to $177.2 billion and displaced 851,700 US jobs. By contrast, the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 likely had a much larger impact because of sudden competition from cheaper imports. But even the high end of job loss estimates from EPI found that the change in trade status for China caused a loss of 3.4 million jobs between 2001 and 2017. Another estimate, from a 2016 study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that normalizing trade relations with China cost the US between 2 million and 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011. - Donna Borak Biden repeated his false claim that he opposed the war in Iraq from the moment the war began. Biden said he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in casting a 2002 vote, as a senator from Delaware, to give President George W. Bush the authority  to go to war in Iraq. But he said he cast the vote because the Bush administration had said \u201cthey were just going to get inspectors\u201d into Iraq to check for weapons of mass destruction \u2013 and that, once Bush actually went to war, he became immediately opposed: \u201cFrom that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\u201d Facts First: As fact checkers have repeatedly noted, Biden did not oppose the war in Iraq from the point it started in March 2003. He did begin calling his 2002 vote a \u201cmistake\u201d in 2005, two years into the war, but he was a vocal public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004. And he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into Iraq. CNN\u2019s Facts First team has debunked various versions of Biden\u2019s claim that he opposed the war from the moment it started. Read longer articles on that here, here and here. Here are a few representative Biden quotes. In a February 2003 speech in Delaware, he said, \u201cLet everyone here be absolutely clear: I supported the resolution to go to war. I am NOT opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. I am NOT opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that.\u201d It\u2019s true that Biden criticized Bush\u2019s approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, warned in the lead-up to the war that Bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and he criticized Bush\u2019s handling of the war from its first weeks on. But Biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism. In a July 2003 speech at the Brookings Institution, Biden said: \u201cNine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force and I would vote that way again today. It was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today.\u201d During the debate on Tuesday, Biden also offered a confusing timeline of his positions on the war, saying, \u201cI said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn\u2019t get inspectors into Iraq to stop \u2013 what thought to be \u2013 the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake. And I acknowledged that.\u201d When Biden said \u201c13 years ago,\u201d he appeared to be referring to how, in 2006 and 2007, he was calling his 2002 vote a mistake. The vote itself was more than 17 years ago. - Daniel Dale and Nate McDermott Biden said that President Donald Trump \u201cflat-out lied\u201d when he claimed the US killed Iran\u2019s top military general because he was targeting four US embassies. \u201cQuite frankly, I think he\u2019s flat-out lied about saying that the reason he went after \u2013 the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed,\u201d Biden said. Facts First: Trump has yet to provide evidence backing up his claim that Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani was actively planning new attacks against four US embassies and top administration officials have struggled to defend the President\u2019s comments. But there is no way to know if Trump \u201cflat-out lied\u201d without seeing the underlying intelligence, which remains classified. Trump claimed at an Ohio rally last week that Soleimani \u201cwas actively planning new attacks.\u201d He later told Fox News, \u201cI believe it probably would\u2019ve been four embassies,\u201d naming Baghdad as one. Senior administration officials have repeatedly pointed to danger facing US embassies in the Middle East. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this past weekend he \u201cdidn\u2019t see\u201d a specific threat against four embassies in the intelligence. \u201cWhat the President said with regard to the four embassies is what I believe as well. He said that he believed that they probably, that they could have been targeting the embassies in the region,\u201d Esper added. Similarly, Trump\u2019s national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said in an interview on Sunday with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that it was unclear whether embassies or US military bases would be targeted, but insisted Trump\u2019s claim about four embassies being threatened was \u201cconsistent with the intelligence.\u201d Citing two State Department officials, CNN reported on Monday that State Department officials involved in US embassy security were not made aware of imminent threats to four specific US embassies and didn\u2019t issue warnings about specific dangers to any US embassy before the administration targeted Soleimani. The State Department sent a global warning to all US embassies before the strike occurred, a senior State Department official said and the department spokesperson confirmed, but it was not directed at specific embassies and did not warn of an imminent attack. - Zachary Cohen This is a breaking story and will be updated.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren made a forceful case in Tuesday night\u2019s debate that a woman can win the White House, tackling the unpopular question that has loomed over the presidential race since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton since 2016 \u2013 buttressing her argument by pointing to the electoral losses of the men standing alongside her on stage. \u201cCan a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCollectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women: Amy and me,\u201d she said, referring to the only other woman who qualified for the debate stage: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Warren appears to snub Sanders' handshake after Iowa debate \u201cSo true,\u201d Klobuchar interjected. \u201cSo true.\u201d In interviews over the past year, many Democratic voters have voiced anxiety about the prospect of watching Trump take on another female candidate after they witnessed the misogyny and degrading rhetoric that consumed the 2016 campaign. Warren had a clear opening to address that invisible barrier for female candidates Tuesday night after CNN reported this week that four sources said her longtime ally, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, told her in a private 2018 meeting that a woman couldn\u2019t win the presidency during a discussion about the 2020 election. RELATED: Democratic debate speaking time: By the numbers Though Sanders has insisted he never made that comment, Warren sought to brush their differing recollections aside during the debate \u2013 \u201cBernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie,\u201d she said \u2013 and focused on the hesitation within the broader electorate that she must dispel in order to win the nomination. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have out-performed men candidates in competitive races,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIn 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.\u201d \u201cLook, don\u2019t deny that the question is there,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cBack in the 1960s, people asked, \u2018Could a Catholic win?\u2019 Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. Both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 got behind their candidate and we changed America. That\u2019s who we are.\u201d Sanders emphatically denied that he made the comment in their private 2018 meeting and a chilly confrontation between the two rivals on stage after the debate \u2013 in which Warren pulled her hand back as Sanders extended his \u2013 suggested their disagreement over the content of their conversation will continue. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnybody knows me knows that it\u2019s incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States. \u2026 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the United States?\u201d In a later exchange, Sanders also inexplicably quibbled with Warren\u2019s assertion that she was the only person on the stage who had beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years. \u201cJust to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress,\u201d Sanders said to Warren. \u201cWhen?\u201d Warren replied. \u201c1990, that\u2019s how I won \u2013 beat a Republican congressman,\u201d Sanders said. Warren briefly looked up as though she was doing the math from 1990 to 2020 in her head, and responded: \u201c30 years. \u2026 I said I was the only one who\u2019s beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.\u201d \u201cWell, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact,\u201d Sanders said, seeming to miss her point. While both the Sanders and Warren campaigns had signaled that they were looking to move past their disagreement, their exchange on gender in politics unquestionably overshadowed the sparring on other issues at the CNN/Des Moines Register debate at Drake University. Sanders, Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are tightly clustered at the top of the Democratic field in recent polling. In interviews, Iowa voters have expressed a profound sense of indecision \u2013 driven largely by the size of the field and what they perceive as the complexity of defeating Trump in November. All of the candidates tried to focus on their closing arguments to voters in the last televised debate before the Iowa caucuses, while doing their best to explain how they would overcome the biggest challenges facing their campaigns. Buttigieg insisted that he would be able to build up his scant support among black voters. Sanders argued that his unpopular embrace of socialism would not be off-putting to a broader electorate. Despite his millions of dollars of spending on television ads, businessman Tom Steyer said it would not be his wealth that was important to voters, but rather his ability to take on Trump on the issue that matters most to them: the economy. The six candidates also engaged in vigorous ideological debates over foreign policy, trade, health care and whether free college should be extended to all Americans. The debate started with the candidates tangling over who was best positioned to keep the country safe as they face voters who are increasingly anxious about another conflict in the Middle East after Trump ordered the targeted killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. As expected, Sanders faulted Biden for voting in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq while he was a senator for Delaware. Sanders noted that he and Biden listened to the same intelligence from former President George W. Bush and his aides claiming that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but they voted differently on the Iraq War Resolution. \u201cThe war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cJoe and I listened to what (former Vice President) Dick Cheney and George Bush and (Secretary of Defense Donald) Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn\u2019t believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.\u201d Biden argued that he made a mistake in voting for the Iraq War Resolution \u2013 something he acknowledged as early as 2005\u2013 but he emphasized that President Barack Obama tasked him with developing plans to withdraw the US from that conflict when he became vice president. \u201cI said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn\u2019t get inspectors into Iraq to stop what was thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake,\u201d Biden said Tuesday night. But once Obama was elected, he said, \u201che turned to me and asked me to end that war.\u201d The Iraq War has created a bind for the former vice president because, at a time of heightened tensions with Iran, he has argued that his decades of foreign policy experience in the Senate and as vice president have made him the most prepared candidate to handle crises abroad. But his rivals, including Sanders and Buttigieg have used the vote to question Biden\u2019s judgment. As a veteran in the US Navy Reserve who served one tour in Afghanistan in 2014, Buttigieg has called Biden\u2019s vote authorizing military force in Iraq \u201cthe worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime.\u201d On Tuesday night, Buttigieg highlighted his military experience but did not directly attack Biden on that point, instead pivoting to a critique of Trump. \u201cThe very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along \u2013 although we know that\u2019s not true \u2013 now has more troops going to the Middle East,\u201d Buttigieg said. He recalled how one of his fellow lieutenants gathered the strength to leave his one-and-a-half-year-old son, who had no idea that his father was leaving for war. \u201cThat is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm\u2019s way,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander-in-chief.\u201d CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Warren how she would deal with the fact that a third of her supporters say her ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength, according to a new CNN/Des Moines Register poll. She noted her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee and her visits to troops around the world. \u201cI fight for our troops, to make sure they get their pay and the housing and medical benefits that they\u2019ve been promised, that they don\u2019t get cheated by giant financial institutions,\u201d she said, noting that she has three brothers who served in the military. The candidates engaged in a now familiar debate over the varying costs of their health care programs, particularly the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan embraced by Sanders and Warren. Klobuchar, who supports building on the Affordable Care Act, called Medicare for All a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Sanders insisted his campaign proposals would not bankrupt the country even though it would double federal spending over the next decade and insisted that his transition fund would ease the pain of likely job losses in towns like Des Moines where the insurance is central to the economy. Warren challenged Buttigieg on his plans to make Medicare for All one among many options. \u201cThe numbers that the mayor is offering don\u2019t add up,\u201d she said. Buttigieg, in response, rejected the notion that his plan was too small. \u201cWe have to move past Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury,\u201d he said. Buttigieg and Klobuchar also raised their objections to Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 respective plans providing free college for everyone. Klobuchar argued that the money would be better directed to job training for the professions that will face shortages in the future, like home health care, nursing assistants and electricians. \u201cWe have to target the tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think subsidizing children of millionaires to pay zero in tuition of public college is the best use of the scarce taxpayer dollars.\u201d Businessman Tom Steyer was asked \u2013 as a billionaire \u2013 whether he would have supported free college for his children. \u201cNo,\u201d Steyer answered simply, noting that he has supported a wealth tax for more than a year. \u201cI was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust, and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end.\u201d This story has been updated with the events of Tuesday\u2019s debate.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has long sought, unsuccessfully, to kill the Affordable Care Act, which established an unprecedented level of protection for those with pre-existing conditions. But on Monday, he claimed credit for being \u201cthe person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare\u201d in a tweet blasting an ad by former New York City Mayor and 2020 Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg that attacks the President\u2019s record on health care. The ad is one of three Bloomberg health care spots running in at least 26 states, according to the campaign. Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual  Mandate..... Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act \u2013 including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law \u2013 without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits. The Affordable Care Act barred insurers in the individual market from denying people policies or charging them higher premiums because of their health histories. Also, carriers had to provide comprehensive coverage \u2013 offering 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. About 54 million people had a pre-existing condition in 2018 that would have led them to be denied coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan research group. As many as 135 million people \u2013 or about half of non-elderly Americans \u2013 could have faced discrimination in the individual market before the law was passed, according to the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning advocacy organization, which based its figure on a Department of Health & Human Services report released in the waning days of the Obama administration. Trump has worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. He championed congressional Republicans\u2019 bills that year that would have weakened the law\u2019s protections \u2013 which are among its most popular provisions and helped Democrats retake the House of Representatives in 2018. And his Justice Department is siding with a coalition of Republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act. An appellate panel last month upheld a lower court ruling that found Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall. Bloomberg, who called Trump\u2019s prior assertions to protect those with pre-existing conditions a \u201cbroken promise\u201d in the ad, responded on Twitter that the President should ask the Justice Department to drop the lawsuit. The law remains in effect while the case works its way through the court system. The administration last week told the Supreme Court in a filing that there\u2019s no rush for them to review the appellate court\u2019s ruling \u2013 which Obamacare\u2019s defenders, a coalition of Democratic states and the House of Representatives, are pushing justices to do. They argue that the lower court opinion poses a \u201csevere, immediate and ongoing threat\u201d to the nation\u2019s health care markets. The President has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. Last April, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election. Meanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for Americans to buy alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans. The law\u2019s defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the Obamacare exchanges. His administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their Obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. Few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far. The White House defended Trump\u2019s actions, saying in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable by opening affordable options for those who were priced out of the market by Obamacare, combating the opioid epidemic, protecting and improving Medicare, enacting Right-to-Try, advancing kidney health, approving more generic drugs than ever before, committing to end HIV/AIDs within 10 years, and much more. While the media refuses to cover the ineffective provisions of Obamacare that have made health care too expensive for too many, the radical left is doing Americans with pre-existing conditions a disservice by making them a political pawn in their agenda to expand the scope of government.\u201d Daniel Dale contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The stakes were high when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren met at Warren\u2019s apartment in Washington, DC, one evening in December 2018. The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, \u201cI thought a woman could win; he disagreed.\u201d That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn\u2019t win,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren\u2019t in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020?  Of course!  After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.\u201d Warren\u2019s communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. Warren: I'm disappointed Sanders is sending volunteers 'out to trash me' These previously unreported details from the two senators\u2019 private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party\u2019s nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party\u2019s historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying  that \u201cone of the struggles that you\u2019re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn\u2019t mean a whole hell of a lot whether he\u2019s black or white or Latino,\u201d he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR. Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to \u201csmile more\u201d and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\u201d Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: \u201cI am angry and I own it.\u201d Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Elizabeth Warren is now the lone female candidate at the top of the 2020 field, and she wants you to know it Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had \u201clived enough of my life with men, and it\u2019s mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet.\u201d Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren\u2019s rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted \u201cunfair\u201d sexist attacks in the last election, and added: \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen with me.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard,\u201d  the Minnesota Democrat said. \u201cOtherwise we could play a game called \u2018Name Your Favorite Woman President,\u2019 which we can\u2019t do because it has all been men.\u201d The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other\u2019s support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d student loan debt cancelation and the \u201cwealth tax.\u201d Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. \u201cPeople have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,\u201d Nina Turner, Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. \u201cHe\u2019s the original.\u201d Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign\u2019s talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren\u2019s supporters are \u201chighly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what\u201d and that \u201cshe\u2019s bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.\u201d Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was \u201cdisappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me.\u201d \u201cBernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we\u2019re trying to build.\u201d Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has \u201chundreds of employees\u201d and that \u201cpeople sometimes say things that they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,\u201d Sanders said. UPDATE: This story has been updated with Warren\u2019s statement after publication backing up sources\u2019 accounts.",

Kate Bennett is a White House correspondent for CNN. The views expressed here are their own. View more opinion on CNN. Lady Bird Johnson moved into a White House in mourning after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1963. Black cloth hung over chandeliers, windows and doorways, and Kennedy staffers sobbed in the mansion\u2019s hallways. This was obviously not how Lady Bird wanted to become first lady. Yet over the five years of her husband Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s presidency, she would defy all expectations. As first lady, Lady Bird helped create Head Start for preschool-aged children from low-income families, and she famously \u201cbeautified\u201d America\u2019s roadways as the guiding force behind 1965\u2019s Highway Beautification Act. But it was her determination to always speak up for what was right, even if it put her own life at risk, that has made her one of the most effective first ladies in American history. Lady Bird was born Claudia Alta Taylor in 1912. She grew up wealthy in a small East Texas town in a country mansion that was built by slaves. From the moment she met and married Lyndon Baines Johnson, a young congressional aide, in 1934, it was clear which roles each would play in their political partnership. She was steady where he was unpredictable, and she was as steadfast in the face of his turbulent moods as she was in her own convictions. When Lady Bird traveled through the South, she would refuse to stay in hotels that wouldn\u2019t accept the family\u2019s African American cook because of the color of her skin. And when LBJ ran for president in 1964, facing deep resentment from Southern Democrats for enacting that year\u2019s Civil Rights Act, Lady Bird traveled nearly 2,000 miles across eight states urging Southerners to accept the end of Jim Crow. Lady Bird was one of the major reasons for her husband\u2019s victory that year, and she understood the complexities of her role. She said that a first lady needs to be a \u201cshowman and a salesman; a clotheshorse and a publicity sounding board with a good heart and a real interest in the folks\u201d from all over the country, rich and poor. Lady Bird was that, and so much more. Below, join us for a \u201cFirst Ladies\u201d viewing party as we break down seven of our favorite moments and key takeaways from this episode. Kate Andersen Brower: I love that we see both of the Johnson daughters in this episode. I\u2019ve interviewed them and so enjoyed talking to them. They were young women when their father became president \u2013 Lynda was 19, and Luci was 16 \u2013 so they can shed light on his presidency in a very real way. Kate Bennett: And they probably know everything! Lady Bird is again one of those first ladies who really had a lot on her plate during her tenure; the country was going through massive change. Brower: Absolutely. LBJ would never have been president without her grit, determination and emotional support. Can you imagine what she went through being thrust into the role of first lady because of a national tragedy? Lady Bird was in the Dallas motorcade with the Kennedys; she saw the assassination unfold and realized the impossible position her family was suddenly pushed into. And to think of Jackie Kennedy seeming so small and alone on that plane from Texas back to Washington. In her diary, Lady Bird wrote, \u201cIf Lyndon could pull all the stars out of the skies and make a necklace for Jackie Kennedy, he would do it.\u201d Bennett: The shock of it all! So interesting to think about how this administration came about in the midst of nationwide grief. Brower: Lady Bird\u2019s social secretary, Bess Abell, passed away recently but I got to know her years ago and she was a truly incredible woman. She told me what it was like to come into the White House in mourning: It was a moment they had always dreamed of, but it had this nightmarish quality to it. Bennett: On top of that, they were both mocked for being Texan. That\u2019s awful. Brower: Kennedy aides called them \u201cUncle corn pone and his little mutton chop\u201d when Johnson was VP. Of course, many of them left after Kennedy\u2019s assassination, but Lady Bird didn\u2019t give up. She knew how important their support was. She asked the Johnsons\u2019 family cook, Zephyr Wright, to bake dozens of loaves of bread, and Lady Bird marched up and down the halls of the White House pushing a grocery cart full of warm, homemade bread wrapped in aluminum foil, each loaf tied with a tidy ribbon. She went into every single office and thanked aides for supporting the President and Mrs. Kennedy and asked that they continue their support for her husband. She was so politically intelligent. Bennett: \u201cPeople were looking at the living and wishing for the dead.\u201d Wow. What a quote to describe what their transition was like. Brower: That was Lady Bird\u2019s quote. I\u2019m telling you, her diary is incredible \u2013 anyone who wants more should read \u201cA White House Diary.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating book. She vividly describes each day, and she is a descriptive and thoughtful writer. She could have had a second career as a novelist! \u202a\u202dBennett:\u202c\u202c Lady Bird\u2019s description of being first lady: \u201cBalm, sustainer and sometime critic for my husband.\u201d\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c Brower: Ha! I love that she gave LBJ \u201ccritiques,\u201d like if she thought he did \u201ctoo much looking down\u201d during a speech or sounded breathless. And she would give him literal letter grades. Bennett\u202c\u202c: Hahaha! She GRADED HIM. Brower: She gave one speech \u201ca good B+.\u201d Now, that\u2019s a team. \u202a\u202dBennett\u202c\u202c:\u202c\u202c So many times it\u2019s the FLOTUS who can be that honest. \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c Brower: Exactly. Joseph Califano, a close Johnson adviser, said it well: \u201cShe was more important to what he did in the White House than any staffer.\u201d Bennett: And yet he was mean to her! I had no idea he would embarrass her in public. Whoa. Brower: It was pretty awful; she put up with too much, in my opinion. As her daughter Lynda says, \u201cShe didn\u2019t need him as much as he needed her.\u201d\u202a\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c Bennett: Yeah. These letters they exchanged before they married are fascinating. You could see signs of his mental health unfolding; one week he was up, the next he\u2019d be down. Brower: Exactly; LBJ was essentially a manic depressive. Lady Bird had to convince him to go to the 1964 DNC because he was so insecure about his ability to lead and unite a nation in turmoil \u2013 especially when there were Democrat options like Bobby Kennedy. That feud, by the way, is fascinating; Bobby Kennedy hated LBJ. Bennett: So his nomination is on the line, and LBJ wouldn\u2019t even get out of bed? Brower: Yes! Wonder if that\u2019s happening now in the White House after President Trump\u2019s defeat. Bennett: Seriously. Brower: Lady Bird\u2019s letter to LBJ encouraging him to go to the convention is epic. She told him, \u201cI know you are as brave as any of the 35\u201d \u2013 referring to the presidents before him \u2013 and that if he didn\u2019t attend, she could see \u201cnothing but a lonely wasteland\u201d for his future. Bennett\u202c\u202c: So many of these FLOTUS\u2019s are the true backbone of these self-doubting men! Brower: She did so much ego massaging. It must have been exhausting. Bennett\u202c\u202c: I feel like it was equal parts love and ego-stroking. But whatever, it worked! Brower: I know we say you can never see inside a marriage, but this episode is as close as you can get. Bennett\u202c\u202c: It\u2019s hard to overstate how necessary Lady Bird was to everything Johnson accomplished as president; during his 1964 campaign, she traveled to the states his advisers thought he\u2019d lose. Their daughter Luci says Lady Bird \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear to give the South away without a try.\u201d Brower: The \u201cLady Bird Special\u201d is unprecedented. She traveled 1,628 miles across eight Southern states on a whistle-stop train tour, becoming the first first lady to go on the campaign trail without the president. All this work and travel was crucial to the campaign. Johnson was in trouble in the South because he had pushed Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which overturned the \u201cJim Crow\u201d segregation laws. Some Southerners felt that their way of life was being threatened. But Lady Bird had seen the impact of segregation up close. When LBJ was a Congressman, she would drive from Texas to Washington, DC, with the family\u2019s cook, Zephyr Wright, who was African American. After a long day of driving, Lady Bird refused to stay at any hotel that wouldn\u2019t also admit Wright because of her skin color. Both women were instrumental in making LBJ see the human toll of these racist policies, and when Johnson ran for president Lady Bird went on her \u201cLady Bird Special\u201d tour. She made 47 speeches to half a million people, urging them to accept desegregation or watch their economy crumble, while also calling out the ugliness of segregation. Bennett: Lynda recalls how dangerous it was; there were death threats from the Ku Klux Klan and threats to blow up the train. Brower: She refused to call off the trip even when Secret Service agents told her that it would be necessary to sweep the railroad tracks for bombs. An extra engine traveled fifteen minutes ahead of her train for this very reason. Bennett: And she\u2019s so calm facing these crowds. Look at her go! Brower: People shouted, \u201cBlack Bird go home!\u201d But after the heckling was done she said: \u201cMy friends, in this country we are entitled to many viewpoints. You are entitled to yours. But right now, I\u2019m entitled to mine.\u201d God she\u2019s amazing! She was one of the major reasons for Johnson\u2019s victory in 1964. Bennett: Oh my. I didn\u2019t know about the Walter Jenkins story. Brower: The way Lady Bird defended him is incredible. Jenkins was one of Johnson\u2019s top advisers and close friends. But when he was arrested on what was then called a homosexual morals charge in a YMCA men\u2019s room a few blocks from the White House, LBJ wanted to cut him loose. Lady Bird refused. She was disappointed that he wouldn\u2019t stand by his friend; she even tried to convince him by pointing to the election. \u201cIf we don\u2019t express some support to him,\u201d she said in a phone call, \u201cI think that we will lose the entire love and devotion of all the people who have been with us.\u201d Bennett\u202c\u202c: She said, \u201cMy love, I pray for you along with Walter.\u201d She was determined! Brower: She\u2019s basically saying, \u201cI\u2019m doing what I want.\u201d And then she put out her own statement of support for Jenkins. Bennett\u202c\u202c: It\u2019s so compelling because she comes off as this Southern throwback in a way, but she was really incredibly strong and opinionated. I have to say I wasn\u2019t as aware as I perhaps should be about her. Brower: Exactly! I think she\u2019s too often overlooked because of Jackie. She was LBJ\u2019s moral compass. Bennett\u202c\u202c: And LBJ passed so many bills. Brower: The Civil Rights Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. Lady Bird worked on Head Start giving children born into low-income families preschool education. Amazing energy and determination. And empathy. Bennett\u202c\u202c: For LBJ to have his two sons-in-law go to Vietnam makes navigating that crisis as president even more complicated. Brower: Can you imagine? And they could hear the chants in Lafayette Square: \u201cHey, hey LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?\u201d Bennett\u202c\u202c: Such a heavy, heavy weight. Unimaginable. Brower: When Eartha Kitt was invited to the White House, she confronted Lady Bird about the war: \u201cYou send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. \u2026 They don\u2019t want to go to school because they\u2019re going to be snatched off from their mothers to be shot in Vietnam.\u201d Bennett\u202c\u202c: Eartha Kitt was one of a kind. Brower: I think it was tremendous that there was that kind of interaction. Today the White House is so closed off to people. Especially to critics. And I think that\u2019s true for Republicans and Democrats. Bennett: Exactly. His own daughter expressed to his face what so many military wives likely wanted to as their husbands went off to Vietnam; Lynda said, \u201cIf he gets killed, I will never forgive you.\u201d Brower: Now we\u2019re talking about beautification. Lady Bird was ahead of her time on the environment too! She thought that natural beauty could help calm tensions arising from Vietnam and she took on the powerful billboard industry that she thought was spoiling America\u2019s highways. When the act looked like it wasn\u2019t going to pass, LBJ told his staff, \u201cYou know I love that woman and she wants that Highway Beautification Act, by God we\u2019re going to get it for her.\u201d Bennett: Look at her go with the highway beautification act! Brower: LBJ was her biggest supporter with that effort; it was a true political partnership. Brower: LBJ always said the men in his family died young; I think that was part of his decision not to run again. I also wonder how much of his decision was because of Vietnam. But no one knew that LBJ wasn\u2019t going to run again in 1968. Not even his own advisers. Bennett\u202c\u202c: Wow! Really? Brower: There was a surprising amount of humility here, that he wouldn\u2019t seek the nomination. You would think, given his enormous ego, that he would not be able to bring himself to walk away. Bennett: He really felt the duality of trying to campaign while the country is living the nightmare; it\u2019s a real moment of self-awareness. Brower: Exactly; so much had happened in 1968. Lady Bird\u2019s diary entry on the murders of MLK and Bobby Kennedy is incredibly moving. I\u2019m so grateful she kept a diary. \u201cI have loved almost every day of these five years.\u201d What a woman. Bennett\u202c\u202c:\u202c\u202c I\u2019ve learned so much \u2013 you are so informative! It sounds cheesy but it\u2019s true, which is a wonderful thing. Brower: I loved it, but I\u2019m biased since I worked on the series! I\u2019ve had so much fun doing these with you. Bennett: Me too!",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Watch the full conversation with SE Cupp and John Avlon on \u201cWhat Comes Next?\u201d here. John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN. This week, we ask the question: What comes next for America and disinformation? The past four years have seen an alarming erosion in the public trust in news, coupled with a spread of conspiracy theories, junk science and outright falsehoods by none other than the President of the United States. With a new president elected, how does Joe Biden help steer the country back toward facts, science and truth? SE Cupp talks to CNN Senior Political Analyst John Avlon about all this and more in our CNN Digital video discussion, but first Avlon tackles the future of fact checking in a CNN Opinion op-ed. Fact checking has been a growth industry in the Trump era. The sheer velocity of Donald Trump\u2019s false and misleading statements \u2013 along with the proliferation of disinformation on social media \u2013 have demanded significant fact-checking to defend liberal democracy. The market responded to the demand: According to the Duke Reporter\u2019s Lab, global fact checking organizations grew from 145 in 2016 to 304 by mid-2020. But will the need for fact checking lose its urgency when Trump leaves the White House? A conspiracy theory almost ruined my family's life. This could prevent it from happening to you Let\u2019s start by recognizing reality. Fact checking Democrats this election cycle has offered a far less target rich environment. This is not because either party has a monopoly on virtue or vice, but because Democrats\u2019 falsehoods during their presidential debates have been comparatively pedestrian \u2013 likely to focus on competing claims about calculating the 10-year cost of Medicare for All, or who wrote-what-gun control bill, or how many manufacturing jobs have been lost, or when a candidate really started supporting a raise in the minimum wage. Make no mistake: It\u2019s essential to clarify policy disagreements and insist on fact-based debates. But it\u2019s not exactly got the moral urgency of fact checking the President\u2019s retweet of baseless Osama Bin Laden conspiracy theories, or blaming rising Covid-19 infection rates on more testing, or demanding the investigation of political opponents, or saying that Joe Biden is \u201cagainst God\u201d \u2013 all in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign. But even if President-elect Biden is not going to be found the \u201csingle largest driver\u201d of coronavirus misinformation in the world, as a Cornell University study declared Trump, the need for fact checking is not going away. That\u2019s because the disinformation ecosystem is still proliferating via social media and the hyper-partisan fragmentation of society. Trump is a symptom rather than its root cause. There is every reason to hope that the presence of a president who does not lie all the time will not exacerbate our divides on a daily basis. But it would be dangerously na\u00efve to believe that the underlying infrastructure of hate news and fake news will be solved with a new president. Clapper: America is a 'ripe target' for disinformation \u201cIf we do not have the capacity to distinguish what\u2019s true from what\u2019s false, then by definition the marketplace of ideas doesn\u2019t work,\u201d former President Barack Obama recently told The Atlantic. \u201cAnd by definition our democracy doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Democracy depends upon reasoning together. And that\u2019s what is being threatened. The old KGB hand, now Russian President Vladimir Putin understood that social media presented an unprecedented opportunity to proliferate disinformation, while most Americans were still waxing poetic about its potential to bring people together. In fairness, it can do both \u2013 but without established guardrails and updated standards, we\u2019ve learned the hard way that lies spread faster on social media than the truth. The prominence of the toxic nonsense QAnon conspiracy theory in Republican circles, and exit polls showing that 51% of Americans think the efforts to contain the coronavirus are going well (when cases are spiking and our country has almost 20% of the world\u2019s deaths) indicate just how much the rot has set in. Reforms are necessary. As I\u2019ve written before on CNN Opinion, \u201cSocial media and tech platforms have a responsibility not to run knowingly false advertisements or promote intentionally false stories. They must disclose who is paying for digital political ads and crack down on the spread of disinformation. The Honest Ads Act would require the same disclosures that are required on television and radio right now. This is a no brainer. The profit motive from hate news and fake news might be reduced by moving digital advertising toward attention metrics to measure and monetize reader engagement and loyalty, incentivizing quality over clickbait. But perhaps the single biggest reform would come from social media companies requiring that accounts verify they are real people, rather than bots that bully people and manipulate public opinion.\u201d The single most important quality a president must have But these reforms will not be speedy, and they are not sufficient. The core responsibility of journalism is to tell the truth \u2013 especially at a time when our civil discourse is polluted by lies. We need to call balls and strikes and help people make sense of all the chaos that surrounds them. And, of course, every administration needs to be held to account by the press, even if not every president calls journalists \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d That\u2019s why we need to not just fact check, but add perspective \u2013 the very thing we have least of in our politics today \u2013 offered up with a bit of history and humor, as I try to do with my daily Reality Checks on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Some of these efforts will be evergreen \u2013 searchable for people looking to separate fact from fiction or simply to get up to speed on a given topic. Others will surf off the day\u2019s news-cycle. But, in the larger sense, we need to fight and win the war on disinformation, especially at a time when ethno-nationalist autocracies around the world are cracking down on freedom of the press to solidify their hold on power.  It would be a huge mistake to assume that simply because the velocity of lies from the White House is likely to decrease dramatically that the need for fact checks has expired. Instead, it has only transformed to a broader arena than a presidential beat. It\u2019s the part of news that people need most now, the tip of the spear that fights for the idea that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. This is necessary for a substantive, civil and fact-based debate, which is a precondition for a functioning, self-governing society. And that\u2019s why fact checking will remain a core responsibility for journalists in the future.",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion asked contributors for their takes on how Donald Trump and Joe Biden did in the final presidential debate. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. On the key issue of Covid, President Trump didn\u2019t do himself any favors during Thursday\u2019s debate. Trump\u2019s record speaks for itself: More than 220,000 Americans are dead from Covid and more than 8 million are infected with the coronavirus, while tens of millions of Americans have lost their livelihoods during the crisis. Americans now face a true winter of discontent with the \u201ctwindemic\u201d of Covid roaring back and the onset of flu season. During the debate Trump reached into his usual bag of tricks about the virus: He claimed his actions saved more than two million lives from the \u201cChina virus\u201d and that a vaccine will be forthcoming \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d Of course, that figure of more than two million deaths referred to a projection on mortality that would result from inaction\u2014something no functional government would have allowed in the face of an onrushing pandemic. And, yes, the virus did originate in China, but it also came into the US from Europe and then it spread like wildfire inside the United States, all while the President mocked mask-wearing, which is the most effective tool against the virus. During the debate Trump did not lay out any kind of real plan to mitigate the worst public health crisis in the United States in a century. If he had done so, he might have won over some undecided voters, but he seems incapable of doing so. Peter Bergen is CNN\u2019s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is senior editor of the\u00a0Coronavirus Daily Brief\u00a0and author of the new book\u00a0\u201dTrump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\u201d Main takeaways tonight: Republicans are reassured by President Trump\u2019s performance, by far his best night of the campaign. Vice President Joe Biden belittled and attacked the left flank of his party on health care when, after Trump said that Biden\u2019s embrace of the public option would destroy Medicare, Biden responded \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s running against somebody else. He\u2019s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people I because I disagree with them\u201d\u2014meaning Biden\u2019s primary opponents from Democrats\u2019  progressive wing, which isn\u2019t all that thrilled with him in the first place. And Trump finally\u2014finally\u2014had a conversation on issues and policy choices, which he clearly won. On energy issues, health care, the economy, criminal justice reform and more, Trump rang the bells that conservatives have been waiting for. It was astonishing to see a completely different Trump on the stage, patiently waiting for Biden to finish answers and teeing up his own policy ideas and attacks. In the first debate, Trump never let Biden speak. And tonight, whether due to self-control or the muted mics, Trump let Biden unspool and then turned almost every exchange into a winning policy argument. When he was pounding the drum for reopening schools, for instance, I can imagine a great many moms and dads out there were pumping their fists right along with the President. It is what Trump always needed: A choice on issues instead of a referendum on himself.  Unfortunately for Trump, this winning debate comes awfully late. Will it make a difference? Millions have voted already, and most everyone else has made up their minds. But I suspect senior citizens who usually vote Republican would\u2019ve appreciated Trump\u2019s performance, college educated men in the suburbs will think Trump won, and I doubt many progressives were inspired by Biden\u2019s boasting of own healthcare plan. I wonder what might\u2019ve been had Trump turned in this performance in the first debate instead of the last. A \u201cNever Trump\u201d friend of mine texted me: \u201cI hate him, but he was the clear winner.\u201d Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The mute button worked \u2013 and Americans won. The final presidential debate Thursday night in Nashville, Tennessee, was a refreshing respite from the childlike shouting match that we witnessed the last time President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden squared off. NBC anchor and moderator Kristen Welker delivered sharp questions for both candidates and forced Trump to actually debate the issues. With soaring unemployment rates and a raging pandemic that\u2019s killed nearly 220,000 people and no quick vaccine around the corner\u2014if you listen to the scientists\u2014there was a sense both candidates realized that time for fun and games was up, mostly. Trump couldn\u2019t resist some bad habits. It was devastating to hear the President\u2019s callous reply after Welker informed him that 16,000 Americans had died since the last presidential debate, and another 40,000 people were in hospitals across the nation as the debate aired. \u201cWe have a vaccine that\u2019s coming. It\u2019s ready. It\u2019s going to be announced within weeks,\u201d, Trump boasted. Talking about his own recent bout with Covid-19, he added, \u201cI was in the hospital. I had it \u2026 I got better very fast or I wouldn\u2019t be here tonight. And now they say I\u2019m immune.\u201d As someone who has lost loved ones to the virus, the president\u2019s words felt disrespectful. Imagine how many of those 220,000 lives may have been saved if those Americans had \u201cTrump-care:\u201d completely free, top quality medical care, helicopter ambulances to the hospital, the best team of medical doctors around the clock, and a private wing at the hospital. Trump lost me right there and I\u2019m betting millions of other Americans, too. I give the night to Biden with Kristen Welker coming in a close second.

She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia\u2019s 900AM WURD. Despite his chronic case of malignant narcissism, President Donald Trump demonstrated occasional flashes of dignified \u201cpresidential\u201d behavior last night. Trump, however, struggled to hold the reasonable tone like a patient gasping for air in an ICU.  His opponents may observe that the ability to lie in a dignified manner does not really confer presidential dignity. Throughout the evening the Trumpian narcissism leaked through in claims like his belief that he is the best president for African Americans since Abraham Lincoln. His passive response to Covid-19 was graphically demonstrated when the wives joined their husbands for a photo op at debate\u2019s end. Biden immediately put his mask back on as his already masked wife, Jill Biden, approached. An also masked First Lady Melania Trump then joined her defiantly unmasked husband for a photo which neatly summed up the differences between the candidates on the surging pandemic. In what was one of the best candidate debates in recent political history, Biden demonstrated the confidence and experience to rescue the nation from the trauma of Trump. The President\u2019s attempt to paint Biden as a wild-eyed, corrupt socialist had fallen flat and the debate may well be remembered as the event which propelled Biden to the presidency. Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and counsel to the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. Tonight Joe Biden reminded America what compassion and decency looks like. While President Donald Trump attempted to smear Biden\u2019s family and raise conspiracy theories about his finances, Biden continually turned the questions on the issues away from his family and toward American families. Voters don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s son, or Wall Street fundraisers, or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They care about keeping their families alive and safe from Covid and staying employed. Biden won the night for staying focused on the issues that matter most. To me, the most affecting moment of the night was when Biden emotionally responded to Trump\u2019s horrific child-separation policy at our borders, a policy that has literally lost the parents of hundreds of detained children, with officials unable now to reunite families. His horror is our horror, and I\u2019d bet that for suburban women, that really resonated. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d To accept what President Donald Trump said at Thursday night\u2019s debate would require what the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge once called a \u201cwilling suspension of disbelief.\u201d Trump revised history to create an entirely fictional universe of misinformation on a number of issues, but nowhere was this more insidious than on the subject of race. \u201cNobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump,\u201d he claimed, with the exception of maybe Abraham Lincoln. Of course, he entirely ignored Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. \u201cI am the least racist person in this room,\u201d Trump also said. Never mind the Black journalist, Kristen Welker, who moderated the debate. Trump has a decades-long history of racism, including the full-page ad he took out against the Central Park Five, five innocent Black boys falsely accused of assault and rape, and I wish Joe Biden would have spent more time reciting all of these instances (not just the Central Park one). In contrast, Biden served his country under the first Black president at the same time Trump was leading a racist campaign challenging Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate (a false claim Trump would only stand down from years later). Some low-information voters may not know Trump\u2019s history, and he purposefully tried to muddy the waters. But with over 45 million votes already cast in the 2020 election, the pool of persuadable voters is shrinking. That means Biden won the debate. Keith Boykin is a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton and a CNN political commentator. Trump played this debate just like he did the ones in 2016, going on the attack and tossing red meat to his base. The problem is that this time around, he\u2019s been President for four years and has no defense for his performance on the coronavirus crisis and the post-pandemic economy. For some reason, Trump thinks it\u2019s comforting to tell people who have lost loved ones to the virus and are keeping their children at home that getting the Covid-19 is no a big deal. The US is not being congratulated by foreign leaders because of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, as Trump claimed. In fact, we are being banned from traveling to other countries . Trump claims a vaccine is coming by the end of the year, the same way he claims he has a health care plan, the same way he claims he will release his tax returns \u2013 which gives us zero confidence that any of these claims of a cure are more than a pipe dream. Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s going away\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re learning to live with it\u201d, while Biden spoke the truth \u2013\u201cPeople are learning to die with it.\u201d The President was equally clueless about how the current economy feels to most Americans. Nearly 13 million people are unemployed, so talking about 401K\u2019s doing well isn\u2019t helpful to people who aren\u2019t able to pay rent \u2013 let alone put away money for retirement. As Biden said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t live by the stock market.\u201d The stock market doing well indicates a win for shareholders and companies, not for individuals trying to land their next gig. In the face of the crisis facing American families right now, Trump didn\u2019t offer a plan or even words of comfort. Instead, he offered\u2026 a joke? It\u2019s unclear why he decided to say he was kidding about injecting bleach during a segment about saving lives, but he was very serious when he derided Biden for talking about families around the kitchen table. After this debate, Biden is the candidate viewers can believe actually understands the importance of family moments like dinnertime and can be a President who will take care of all of us like he would his own.

The final presidential debate, like most finales in the past, probably did little to change the dynamics of the campaign \u2013 but did solidify existing support for each of the candidates. President Donald Trump\u2019s fans can obviously take encouragement: he was significantly better than in the first debate mash-up. For the first half hour, especially, he was on reasonably good behavior, and Joe Biden seemed flat in contrast. Biden picked up more steam as the night went on, but as he shrugged off Trump\u2019s attacks, he left an overall impression that he really didn\u2019t want a fight. His supporters will say that was smart \u2013 he is ahead and didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. Trump\u2019s supporters will insist that was a sign of weakness. Alternatively, Biden\u2019s team could take heart tonight because Trump eventually slipped backward into his more pugilistic, bullying mode that is a turn-off for most of the country. His attacks on the finances of the Biden family were particularly offensive; notably, most mainstream media outlets don\u2019t think the story is worthy of coverage. It was also true, as CNN\u2019s key fact checker Daniel Dale argued, that Trump may have been better behaved but he lied a lot more. That the CNN instant poll found Biden won by a 53-39% margin seemed right on the mark. Bottom line: Biden and Trump are coming down the homestretch, with Biden still two lengths ahead. Trump supporters can legitimately take heart after this final debate, but Biden remains a strong and steady favorite.

Tonight, we saw the return of Trump the challenger. The President was able to remind Americans that former Vice President Joe Biden can be seen almost as a virtual \u201cincumbent,\u201d as opposed to Trump, who was elected as a DC outsider. Trump and Biden provided answers on foreign policy, Covid-19 policies, and immigration. But the big takeaway was the difference in the economy: Trump talked about growing the economy during Covid while Biden wouldn\u2019t rule out shutting it down when cases flare.  He described regulating it and taking measures that The Heritage Foundation has found would drive up prices, like stringent regulations on conventional fuels and restrictions on their development. Biden didn\u2019t provide persuasive answers when asked repeatedly why he didn\u2019t take action on his lofty goals throughout his nearly half a century in office. And when asked why he didn\u2019t enact criminal justice reform during that time, he paused before blaming Republicans: \u201cWe had a Republican Congress. That\u2019s your answer.\u201d President Trump was on message, composed and clear. This matters to swing voters who are looking at style just as much as substance. Swing voters are likely to approve of his message on opening society, on the economy and criminal justice. Overall, Trump gave a convincing performance and stood by his record. Even after four years in Washington, he was able to remind voters he is the disrupter draining the swamp and fixing the failings of the Obama-Biden administration.

Former Vice President Joe Biden was the winner of Thursday\u2019s debate because he stayed focused on what matters to the American people, and he did not allow himself to be thrown off track by President Donald Trump\u2019s accusations and interruptions. Biden gave thoughtful responses to questions about race, climate change and leadership. But he was no pushover either. In response to Trump\u2019s incessant questions about his family\u2019s alleged corruption, Biden stated, \u201cRelease your tax returns or stop talking about corruption.\u201d In contrast, Trump failed his two most important tasks tonight: He did not offer an affirmative vision for his second term, and he could not articulate a coherent response to the coronavirus pandemic. He wasted time with wild assertions, such as his having done more for African Americans than any other president since Abraham Lincoln, and his claim that he was the least racist person in the debate hall. No wonder polls show Trump lagging in national and battleground states \u2013 his narcissist act is getting old.  This was Trump\u2019s last big chance to make his case with voters, and he did not close the deal. After two debates with no mention of immigration, credit goes to moderator Kirsten Welker for bringing up the 545 migrant children whose parents cannot be located after they were separated under the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy. Trump said the kids \u201care so well taken care of\u201d and that they are \u201cin facilities that are so clean.\u201d  This is not true. There have been numerous reports, including from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s own Inspector General, about the dangerous conditions in immigration detention. Despite prodding from Welker, Trump never explained how he would reunite these children with their families. At a time where the election and Covid-19 are dominating the headlines, this was an important reminder that the heartbreaking consequences of the zero tolerance policy still continue. Raul A.

For the first time in this election, voters on Thursday night were able to hear their presidential candidates answer questions about how they would lead the country through the pandemic and reform healthcare to increase access and affordability. And one thing became remarkably clear: neither of these guys were able to articulate any plan to move the country forward. But let\u2019s be honest with ourselves. This election has never been about the issues. Rather, it\u2019s been about the candidates themselves. In a normal election year, this kind of flailing debate might depress turnout. But so far, we\u2019ve seen unprecedented enthusiasm from voters. Echelon Insights estimates that over 157 million Americans may vote this time around\u201420 million more than 2016. Already more than 40 million voters have cast their ballots by mail or in-person, which represents almost 30% of the ballots cast in the 2016 election. Furthermore, seven million first time voters have cast a ballot\u20132.5 times more than at this same point in 2016. And, three out of four voters say they are \u201cmore enthusiastic than usual\u201d about voting this year\u2013a shocking 20% increase when compared to the previous election. This means voters believe this election matters and that\u2013for better or worse\u2013a Biden presidency will be fundamentally different than a Trump second term. But this debate did very little to elucidate what those differences will actually mean come January 20, 2021. Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst.

Coming into the final debate, President Donald Trump needed to do something to change the downward trajectory of his campaign. He didn\u2019t. We saw the same dishonest, conspiracy peddling, racially insensitive, intransigent Trump, just slightly less obnoxious than his prior debate performances. Trump doesn\u2019t deserve a gold star for being more well-behaved than an unruly child this time around. That shouldn\u2019t be the standard for a president of the United States. As Covid-19 rages on with no end in sight and more Americans are sick and dying, Trump\u2019s answers on how to address the ongoing pandemic were still incredibly cavalier and tone deaf. Continuing to blame China for his failed Covid-19 response is not a winning message. This election is a clear referendum on Trump, and Vice President Joe Biden knows it. He smartly seized the opportunity to remind the American people that Trump\u2019s ineptitude is to blame for the crises the country now faces. Biden didn\u2019t allow Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated attacks against him and his family to rattle him and effectively landed counterpunches of his own, on Trump\u2019s lack of transparency about his taxes, foreign dealings, immigration cruelties and absence of a health care plan. In his closing argument, Biden eloquently summed up the choice facing the American people when he said, character, decency, honor and respect were on the ballot. On November 3rd, we\u2019ll find out if those things do in fact, still matter. For the sake of our democracy, I hope they do. Tara Setmayer is a former GOP communications director, host of the \u201cHonestly Speaking with Tara\u201d podcast and a CNN political contributor. She is a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project. I tweeted before tonight\u2019s debate that the odds of a more moderate reasonable Donald Trump showing up was about as favorable as the chance of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. I was wrong. A much more controlled Trump did in fact show up. And indeed, tonight we actually did have something that resembled a real debate. Biden won, in part, paradoxically, because in the absence of the yelling and interrupting during the first debate \u2013 mostly on Trump\u2019s part \u2013 we could actually listen to Trump\u2019s arguments and hear how untethered they were from reality.  In contrast, on most issues, Biden simply made a lot more sense winning rounds on points, character and compassion. Far from running out the clock, Biden was focused, strong, risk ready \u2013 hammering and targeting Trump for his racism, abdication of leadership on Covid-19, immigrant children being separated from their parents and lack of a health care policy. Trump\u2019s talking points were old and stale, targeting his base and not expanding it to reach out to independents who at this late stage might still be undecided. Biden on several critical issues, especially race and Covid-19, squared himself to the camera and talked directly to the American public with empathy and compassion. Trump never did, partly because he lacks the capacity to do so. Trump went to the gutter quickly \u2013 launching charges based on unsubstantiated emails that Biden and family were enriching themselves from foreign countries and donors. Biden countered by hammering Trump on tax returns and his reported China bank account; but stayed out of the sewer by not making an issue of Trump\u2019s family. After four years, Donald Trump demonstrated he could control his temper. Joe Biden demonstrated  he could be President. Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of \u201cThe End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\u201d Miller was a State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. President Donald Trump controlled himself, and still he showed us who he is. Sure, he didn\u2019t scream over everyone and interrupt constantly, as he did at the last debate. So, he cleared the lowest bar imaginable after having set the lowest expectations possible. But if he had been any other politician, we would be astonished at the unfathomable number of lies he told, the indefensible actions he defended and the preposterous statements he made. From his first words about the pandemic, when he misleadingly tried to suggest he saved more than 2 million lives from coronavirus, Trump started lying to the American people. According to CNN\u2019s fact checker Daniel Dale, he lied even more this time than at the first debate, an almost impossible feat. Trump\u2019s strategy consisted of misrepresenting his own record and lying about Biden\u2019s plans, falsely claiming that his Democratic opponent would ban fracking and socialize health care, and then slandering Biden and his family. If we weren\u2019t used to this, we could hardly believe it. Biden had a strong performance on many issues, from health care to immigration. Trump again said he\u2019d have a great plan on health care, as he has been saying since 2015. Biden gave convincing details about his \u201cBidencare\u201d proposal. But Biden was at his best when he was visibly incensed, infuriated, as were probably most Americans, hearing Trump defend his policy of taking children away from their parents at the border, a moral stain on America that will never completely wash away. Trump\u2019s callous response, \u201cthey\u2019re so well take care of.\u201d Biden needed to avoid making any mistakes. Trump needed to turn the race around. Biden did what he needed to. Trump did not. Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. Follow her on Twitter @fridaghitis. If, as I suspect, Joe Biden\u2019s strategy was to frame the race as (in his words) \u201cScranton versus Park Avenue,\u201d he succeeded. Biden remained focused on the middle class and had his best moment when he invoked middle class families sitting around the kitchen table, worried about how they can pay for a new set of tires and still afford the tuition at community college.  The former Vice President spoke with compassion and conviction. Then it was President Donald Trump\u2019s turn.  Instead of feeling the pain of the middle class, the trust fund brat sneered at Biden for caring about them. The man is a political sociopath. Trump showed no empathy for the more than 220,000 Americans dead from Covid-19. No empathy for immigrant children who were ripped from their parents and now cannot be reunited. No empathy for African American parents who have the talk with their teenage children because of disproportionate police brutality. He used every answer to brag about himself, not to feel your pain. Trump is too deep into the right-wing media bubble, spewing absurd and untrue attacks about Biden and his family. Unless you\u2019re someone who checks far-right media outlets every five minutes, he seemed disconnected from reality. In 11 days, reality is going to assert itself powerfully. There are a lot more people in towns like Scranton than on Park Avenue.

He is the author of the new book, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.\u201d President Donald Trump did his best, and it was not good enough. It was the same message delivered at a significantly lower volume. But there was no plan for the next four years and no apology for his failures \u2013 just a lot of attacks on his opponent, Joe Biden. The problem is that Trump is standing on the graves of almost a quarter of a million Americans who have died of Covid-19 under his watch with seemingly no regrets looking backward, and no concrete health care plan for moving forward. No president who is proud of his last four years of leadership would bring up Hunter Biden and allegations of wrongdoing. He would use his debate time to talk about his own accomplishments. But instead, this President, who has presided over a failed pandemic response, wasted time at the debate attacking Biden \u2013 a man few people think is corrupt and even fewer think is actually a bad person \u2013 and his family. Worse, Trump showed a shocking lack of humility talking about the hundreds of children whose parents his administration cannot locate. There was no empathy. No apology. Any human being would say, \u201cI cannot sleep at night thinking about those kids.\u201d Instead, he lied and said the children are being treated well in detention centers that have come under increasing scrutiny for their deplorable conditions. It was horrific, and it will hurt him. Van Jones, a CNN host, is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. President Donald Trump is a weak incumbent. Former Vice President Joe Biden is a strong opponent. After Thursday night\u2019s debate, that is the bottom line. Trump\u2019s goal in the debate was to undermine Biden\u2019s popularity and high approval ratings reflected in the latest polls. That\u2019s what he did to Hillary Clinton. So far, it has been more difficult with the former Vice President. It\u2019s not clear that Trump made any progress on this front even when bringing up Hunter Biden. On the other hand, Biden held firm and was able to offer a relatively strong performance. Though it wasn\u2019t a dramatic \u201cwin,\u201d and Trump was more restrained than in the first debate, tonight was probably enough to keep the horse race status quo\u2014which automatically helps Biden. In the end, however, the debates won\u2019t be nearly as important as voter turnout, disenfranchisement, intimidation and processing absentee ballots. These were the issues at the heart of the election before this debate and all of this remains the same after the debate. This is why Democrats are still very nervous despite Biden\u2019s double-digits lead in the polls. They simply don\u2019t know how this will play out when it comes to actual voting. Those are rational fears. Once Americans turn off their television sets and shut down their smartphones, the ground game and the struggle to protect the decisions of voters will determine which way this election goes.

In a year where everything is surreal and abnormal, it\u2019s refreshing to get back to a real and normal presidential debate. With more discipline and less interruptions, the winner of the faceoff in Nashville was without a doubt: the voters. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden made calculations on how to frame their closing arguments; one around accomplishments and the other about character. Trump successfully made the case that Biden has a long record of accomplishing very little. Arguing that Biden is \u201call talk and no action, just like a politician.\u201d Trump went on to say that the inaction of the Obama-Biden administration is what led him to run for president. As is often the case, Biden had some of his strongest moments when he made a direct appeal to the camera \u2013 to the American people.  He said, \u201cthe character of the country is at stake.\u201d Aside from a few quick glances at his watch as if he had somewhere else to be, Biden connected with viewers. He showed empathy and compassion. Biden did well in responding to Trump\u2019s allegations about Hunter Biden\u2019s business ventures and whether or not he profited off of them.  The former Vice President vehemently denied the allegations and pivoted to President Trump\u2019s failure to release his tax returns. More than 40 million people have already cast their ballots and there are no signs of the enthusiasm slowing down. The question for the remaining voters is not as much about \u201care you better off today than you were four years ago,\u201d it\u2019s who will make you better four years from now?

Did you know carbon emissions can stick around in the atmosphere and oceans for 1,000 years? The pollution we\u2019re putting into the atmosphere today matters for that long. I kept thinking about that as I listened to President Donald Trump make every attempt on Thursday to distract voters from the core truth of this race: Biden may not be a rock-star environmentalist, but he takes the climate crisis seriously and has an actual plan to reduce US fossil fuel pollution. Trump, meanwhile, used media catnip \u2013 small windows! bird-killing windmills! planting trees!  \u2013 in an attempt to distract voters from the fact that his policies are a disaster for the Earth and its future. That\u2019s a long-established tactic of the fossil fuel industry. Distract, obfuscate, confuse. Don\u2019t let it work on you. Trump supports fossil fuels. He denies the essential and well-established realities of climate science. His record on the environment is abhorrent. He can talk about beautiful water and sparkly air all he damn well pleases. It doesn\u2019t change things. This election will matter to your great-great-great-great grandchildren because it is an election about the climate emergency.

President Donald Trump closed well in 2016, and Thursday\u2019s debate may herald the start of a strong closing push for him in this year\u2019s campaign. The President was, for the most part, much more disciplined and on-message than he has been at any point in the last few weeks \u2013 and certainly much more so than in the first debate. In a \u201cchange\u201d election, like 2020 is shaping up to be, Trump managed to embrace the mantle of the disrupter again, even though he\u2019s the incumbent president. His indictment of Biden as a politician who\u2019s been in office for 47 years but accomplished little during that time continued to be his most effective sustained line of attack. Also impactful was Trump\u2019s effort to paint Biden as an extreme liberal on climate and energy issues. The exchange the two had on fracking and, separately, on how each would deal with the future of fossil fuel use, reflect where the modern Democratic Party may be out of touch with many voters in parts of the country where the extraction economy remains significant. More than a policy debate, these exchanges could have electoral consequences in crucial battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Trump did what he needed to do tonight. It wasn\u2019t a perfect debate, but he landed enough punches to give himself some momentum going into the final sprint to Election Day. Lanhee J.

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. As the smoke clears after the first debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the showdown between their running mates is heating up. Vice presidential debates are very much the undercard, but it\u2019s impossible to overplay the significance of Wednesday night\u2019s face-off between Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Never before has there been a scenario when either presidential candidate could potentially be unable to fulfill a full term \u2014 both major candidates are in their 70s. This vice presidential debate will be a job interview unlike any other. There are always three main goals of any vice presidential debate: do no harm, reinforce the top of the ticket, and pass the commander in chief test. My advice is for the candidates is to keep these objectives top of mind as they take center stage. Do no harm is pretty simple: don\u2019t say anything dumb and don\u2019t be insulting. Just look at the most recent presidential debate \u2014 the constant interrupting and name-calling was off-putting for many voters, and proved disastrous for Trump as polls showed Biden\u2019s lead widening following the debate. The Republican political consultant Frank Luntz said a panel of independent voters found that the two candidates were too bitter, and that the evening didn\u2019t provide what they wanted. Keep in mind that Trump and Biden are not simply trying to appeal to their own base \u2014 they\u2019re trying to appeal to undecided voters, who make up just 3% of likely voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll from September. Therefore, Harris and Pence need to come across as likeable. Likeability matters in debates. I believe Pence has the upper hand in this regard. He\u2019s not a barn burner, but he is solid, calm and reassuring. Harris can be prone to overdoing it. Who can forget when she went after Biden on his record on civil rights during the Democratic primary debate in June 2019? While she is known, and often celebrated for her sharp questions and confrontational style, she needs to tone down the grandstanding in this debate. Kamala Harris faces unique challenges in the VP debate Both candidates need to reinforce the man at the top of the ticket for their party, remind voters what they are running on and outline their vision for the future of America. Pence needs to make this a choice election of Trump vs. Biden, as opposed to a referendum on the President. This election needs to be about a choice between limited government, fiscal responsibility and law and order, over bloated government and big spending. In light of President Trump\u2019s recent Covid-19 diagnosis and checking into Walter Reed Medical Center, Pence should pivot away from any questions of the president\u2019s handling or mishandling of the pandemic. Pence can focus on the fact that President Trump declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in January and later  suspended travel into the US to stop the spread. The President also signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act into law in March. Pence needs to make that point, and pivot \u2014 fast. The most important aspect of vice presidential debates is about answering the question: Are you capable of stepping into the role of President of the United States if the need should arise? It\u2019s not necessarily about identifying the qualifications for being vice president, it\u2019s about having the quality, skills, and temperament to be commander in chief. With both presidential candidates in their 70s \u2014 Trump is 74 and Biden is 77 \u2014 this consideration is warranted. Both Pence and Harris need to make the case that their experience and judgment makes them capable of stepping up to the plate. I believe they both have the necessary experience, but voters need to consider the liberal policies of Harris, including her support of the Green New Deal in the Senate (she now supports Biden\u2019s climate plan) and universal health care that includes private insurers). GovTrack, a nonpartisan organization that tracks bills in Congress, named her \u201cthe most liberal compared to all Senators.\u201d Her progressive policies \u2014 particularly when she was in the Senate and supported Medicare for All and the Green New Deal \u2014 failed to win over donors in the Democratic primary, and she dropped out before the Iowa caucuses citing a lack of funds. Though Harris has since moderated her views on health care and the environment, Biden won the Democratic primary, and if something were to happen to him, paving the way for Harris to step up, she  might not reflect voters\u2019 decision to choose a true centrist over a progressive. Voters need to remember Harris\u2019s Senate agenda does not always match that of mainstream America.  Ultimately, success in the vice presidential debate is based on competency, likeability and connecting on the issues important to voters. Years of political experience brought these two candidates to center stage, and they have 90 minutes to make their case to the American people. It\u2019s imperative both candidates know their goal; without it, it\u2019s impossible to score.",

Pandemics don\u2019t care about partisan politics. So when Robert Redfield \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a lifelong conservative \u2014 testified to Congress Wednesday that a Covid-19 vaccine wouldn\u2019t be ready before the election and probably would not be available to the general public until next summer, he was speaking as a scientist. But the truth is never what this President is looking for \u2014 and so a few hours later, he contradicted Redfield, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just incorrect information. And I called him, and he didn\u2019t tell me that, and I think he got the message maybe confused,\u201d adding, \u201cNo, we\u2019re ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced, and it could be announced in October.\u201d The exchange essentially demonstrated Joe Biden\u2019s point from his speech Wednesday on Covid-19 strategy: \u201cI trust vaccines, I trust scientists, but I don\u2019t trust Donald Trump.\u201d This administration has been doing this propagandistic bait and switch while presiding over the world\u2019s worst response to the Covid-19 pandemic: The United States has 4% of the global population but 20% of the coronavirus deaths. But hey, Jared Kushner assures us we are living in a success story. Against this dystopian backdrop, Trump and his administration just can\u2019t stop talking about his nonexistent health care plan. It\u2019s going to be great \u2014 \u201ceverybody\u2019s going to be taken care of\u201d\u2026 there will be insurance for everybody \u2026 no one will lose coverage \u2026 \u201cthere will be no cuts\u201d to Medicaid \u2026 and \u201cno one will be worse off financially.\u201d Those are just some of the repeated promises President Trump and his administration have made about his phantom plan. And like some two-bit con man, he keeps saying it is just about to be unveiled, just a few weeks around the corner \u2026 just you wait. Well, we have waited. For almost four years. College leaders deserve a flunking grade for their reopening We\u2019ve all seen the Trump administration take obsessive steps to kill the Affordable Care Act \u2014 all while Obamacare has gotten more and more popular with the American people. While they spout baseless happy talk about protecting preexisting conditions without a plan to do so, the Trump administration is taking its quest to kill Obamacare to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case one week after Election Day. You see they wanted to make sure the Supreme Court hearing was after votes were cast because they know openly arguing to gut the coverage of preexisting conditions might hurt them politically, given that 43% of US households report having at least one member with a preexisting condition, according to Gallup. But after the votes are cast, your personal health care concerns are completely expendable on their altar of ideology. Look at a family photo to see who might be affected \u2014 it might even be you. Maybe that\u2019s why Trump has ramped up his baseless, health care hype in recent months, feeling the heat of the election. In July, he told Chris Wallace, \u201cwe\u2019re signing a health care plan within two weeks.\u201d Big news, right? Two weeks later, there was no plan. He tried the same schtick this week in an ABC, a painful, semi-coherent ramble about the plan just around the corner. Let\u2019s be honest, because the President apparently cannot. There is no Trump health care plan. And even if they try to desperately patch something together before the election, something both the President and his chief of staff Mark Meadows alluded to this week (\u201cIt\u2019s more of an executive action with a legislative component that is more visionary,\u201d Meadows said), it will have all the weight of a campaign bumper sticker. Several of Trump\u2019s top health care officials testified to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday that they were unaware of any plan. Ex-task force member: Trump only cares about reelection For 10 years, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, conservatives have been claiming to support \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d It\u2019s catchy and alliterative and total nonsense. Because they still haven\u2019t put forward a plan. That\u2019s because their last comprehensive plan \u2014 proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation and backed by GOP senators as an alternative to a Clinton administration initiative \u2014 was implemented in Massachusetts by then-Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and then became the basis for, you guessed it, Obamacare. The individual mandate that Trump hated so much that he gutted it, was originally presented as a mechanism to encourage individual responsibility \u2014 a conservative value before this President came along. The Affordable Care Act was never socialist or a government takeover of health care \u2014 but those facts still haven\u2019t stopped the constant sloganeering that has made it part of a hyperpartisan belief system impervious to facts. It has, however, made it impossible to get conservative consensus on what a comprehensive Republican health care plan would look like \u2014 especially with Trump\u2019s pie-in-the-sky rhetoric on what his imaginary plan would achieve.  So don\u2019t believe the desperate hype about Biden buying into Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan \u2014 it was one of their core policy disagreements during the Democratic primary campaign. Biden wants a public option \u2014 not Medicare for All. There are plenty of other ways to improve the current system \u2014 including some that Republicans might like, such as medical malpractice reform. But they haven\u2019t been proposing any of it in any comprehensive fashion. Now with a presidential election less than 50 days away, Republicans are getting scared that voters might notice that their phantom \u201cplan\u201d is all repeal and no replace \u2014 in the middle of a pandemic with massive economic uncertainty \u2014 while people with preexisting conditions could find costs skyrocket while their lives hang in the balance. With the President is at war with science and death tolls rise, here\u2019s the hard truth: The much-hyped Trump health care plan is just another one of his lies.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. The upcoming presidential debates promise to be a watershed moment in this election. Democratic challenger Joe Biden has been preparing to debate sitting Republican President Donald Trump. By contrast, according to NBC News, the President has reportedly eschewed formal preparation, arguing that debate \u201cisn\u2019t something you have to practice.\u201d That may be so. But since presidential candidates began appearing on televised debates in 1960, incumbents who don\u2019t properly prepare have a decidedly mixed record in the November elections. At the same time, presidential challengers who come out swinging need to be sure they don\u2019t miss their mark \u2013 or else face political implosion. Conventional wisdom is that prior preparation prevents poor performance. Yet the history of presidential debates reminds us that other factors, such as a winning personality and the ability to think on your feet, matter equally, if not more. With the whole world watching, presidential debates are equal parts landing jabs and taking punishment, as much as sticking to the script and exploiting opportunities to score points. No magic formula exists to predict their outcome, but one thing seems clear in retrospect: just one dramatic exchange can change public perception of the debates, and by extension, the result of the presidential election. Looking back on the history of presidential debates, these four contests may give us a preview of what\u2019s to come: The election of 1976 brought the return of the presidential debate, since both Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon had previously refused them. Gerald Ford was eager to secure a term as president in his own right (following Nixon\u2019s resignation post-Watergate), and his team of advisers spent weeks preparing their candidate, including by running him through an exhaustive \u201cmurder board.\u201d By contrast, an overly confident Carter bombed his first answer on how he would end the ongoing economic recession, when he failed to provide a clear plan of action. The focus of the second debate turned to foreign policy, an area where Ford was expected to shine. Thirty minutes into the evening, however, Max Frankel of the New York Times asked Ford about the Soviet influence in Eastern Europe (an area Churchill described in 1946 as being behind an \u201ciron curtain\u201d). Incredibly, Ford answered: \u201cthere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.\u201d All that preparation for nothing. When given a chance to clarify, Ford refused. Carter seized the opportunity to underline Ford\u2019s error: \u201cI would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don\u2019t live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union.\u201d Advantage Carter. Following the second debate, Carter enjoyed a 4-point bump in the polls. Even as the race narrowed, Ford could not bring home electoral victory that November. In 1984, the Democrats turned to a beloved former vice president to take on an entrenched Republican incumbent. Sound familiar? Back then, it was Walter Mondale challenging Ronald Reagan, and like Biden, Mondale needed to formulate an effective strategy to debate his charismatic opponent. It would not be an easy task. During the 1980 presidential debates, Reagan had effectively negated Carter\u2019s attack on Reagan\u2019s previous opposition to Medicare with a one-liner that resonates across American history: \u201cThere you go again.\u201d With the roles now reversed, Mondale came out strong in the first debate, firing against Reagan\u2019s record as president. \u201cYou can\u2019t wish it away,\u201d Mondale charged, in reference to the country\u2019s large deficit. Caught flat-footed, even Reagan admitted that he had \u201cflopped.\u201d But in the second debate, Reagan rebounded and delivered yet another of the most memorable lines in American political history. When asked about age as factor in the election (he was 73), Reagan replied: \u201cI am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d The audience erupted into laughter, and even Mondale, in his mid-50s at the time, couldn\u2019t help himself from doing the same. Mondale simply could not make his criticisms of Reagan stick during the debates. Reagan, already comfortably ahead in the polls, cruised to a landslide in November. With three major candidates, the 1992 election attracted widespread popular interest. Both Bill Clinton, the charismatic Democratic governor of Arkansas, and independent candidate Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire, looked to unseat Republican incumbent George H.W. Bush. The first debate went predictably enough, with the three candidates cordially answering questions from the moderators. But, in the second debate, with its new \u201ctown hall\u201d format, Bush self-destructed on stage. As audience members asked questions, the President appeared to look at his watch at several points, giving the air of being bored or perhaps uninterested (Bush later said that he was thinking, \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap.\u201d) When asked a question about the national debt, Bush waffled. By contrast, Clinton hit a home run, replying compassionately in what has been described as an \u201cI feel your pain\u201d moment. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been governor of a small state for 12 years,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s affected me \u2026 When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it. When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.\u201d With his emotional style, Clinton had won the battle for the public\u2019s heart. In comparison, Bush\u2019s poor performance in the debates foreshadowed his loss at the polls. The election of 2012 demonstrated the continued vulnerability of a sitting president to a challenger\u2019s attack. Building up to the debates, Republican challenger Mitt Romney scored points on President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d line in connection to small business owners. National polls showed the race to be nearly tied leading into the fall. During the first debate, Obama appeared underprepared and overconfident, even contemptuous, and pundits awarded the contest to Romney. But at the second debate, Romney fell victim to unforced errors of his own. Speaking about the terrorist attack on the US mission in Benghazi, Romney went on a veritable tirade that spiraled into near incomprehension. Obama coolly remarked: \u201cPlease proceed, governor.\u201d Later in the debate, Romney again goofed when he declared that his staff had brought him \u201cbinders full of women\u201d to work for him as governor of Massachusetts.  On election night, Obama\u2019s reelection rankled incredulous conservatives (George W. Bush\u2019s former campaign adviser Karl Rove\u2019s Fox News meltdown is legendary), but they should not have been surprised. Romney\u2019s lackluster performance at the presidential debates pointed to the November outcome. Presidential debates are won and lost on a mixture of preparation, personality and performance. While preparation can help a lot and personality can save the day, a candidate\u2019s performance ultimately matters most. May the best debater win.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Americans get it. The 2020 election is shaping up to be the most consequential in decades. In a Pew Research poll released this week, 83% of registered voters said it matters a great deal whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden is the victor in the November election. Contrast that to 2000, when only 50% said the choice of George W. Bush or Al Gore would really matter. All signs were pointing to enormous interest in the campaign as Democrats prepared this week to stage their most unusual convention in memory, a four-night virtual gathering featuring speeches by Joe Biden, his VP pick Kamala Harris, Barack and Michelle Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton. Democrats seem energized by the choice of Harris and by Biden\u2019s edge in the polls. But they are also nervous about whether they can prevail in an election held in the middle of a pandemic and with an incumbent trying to undermine mail-in voting. Pew also found that nearly half of voters polled think casting their ballot this year will be difficult. President Trump, whose ally and major GOP donor Louis DeJoy has been installed as Postmaster General, has opposed new funding for the Postal Service. \u201cOn Thursday, Trump effectively admitted that he was doing his best to fix the election by keeping the Postal Service from sourcing the funds it needs to facilitate the scale of mail-in ballots likely needed for this election,\u201d wrote David Andelman. DeJoy has suggested that the service may no longer expedite election mail, which typically goes at a bulk rate of 20 cents. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to utterly frustrate DeJoy\u2019s suggestion,\u201d Andelman pointed out. \u201cEvery voter should put a 55-cent stamp on his or her return envelope, no matter if it is already pre-printed with bulk postage by their election board.\u201d Geraldine Lampert argued that another way to get creative about the voting challenge is to draw private carriers such as FedEx and UPS into the process. \u201cOver the past few months,\u201d wrote CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, \u201cTrump has made his stance clear, launching increasingly frantic \u2013 and wildly inaccurate, almost hallucinogenic \u2013 pre-emptive attacks on mail-in voting.\u201d But since elections are controlled by the states, Trump can only indirectly affect them, Honig noted. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee have gone to court in an effort to get states to limit access to voting by mail. The two parties are \u201cbraced for war,\u201d hiring \u201cteams of election law specialists\u201d and setting aside \u201ctens of millions of dollars to finance legal battles unfolding around the country.\u201d Joe Biden kept it a secret till the last minute but his choice of a running mate turned out to be the candidate most people considered the favorite: Sen. Kamala Harris. What was a surprise, Frida Ghitis observed, was that the Trump campaign seemed unprepared for the news. It threw \u201cTrump visibly off balance, and sent his campaign flailing just as badly. Even his chorus of cheerleaders at Fox News is having trouble deciding what to make of Harris \u2013 further evidence of what a smart decision Biden made.\u201d Trump supporters couldn\u2019t seem to decide whether to label Harris, the former California Attorney General, as too tough on crime or, in the words of Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, as having a \u201cradical extremist record.\u201d Democrats rallied around the choice. \u201cThe days of the Democratic establishment taking African Americans for granted are over,\u201d wrote Van Jones. Biden\u2019s selection \u201cmeans that he will have some tough-minded tenderness to complement his tender-hearted toughness for the next four years. More importantly, it means that Black voters are finally being treated the way a core constituency of a political party should be treated.\u201d Jen Psaki noted that \u201cHarris is not only a historic pick, as the first Black and Asian American woman to be on a national ticket for either party, but she is young, tough as nails (just ask Attorney General Bill Barr, or Biden for that matter) and prepared to do the job on day one.\u201d As historic as her selection was, Harris was also the safe choice, wrote David Axelrod: \u201cPeople familiar with research the campaign undertook to inform its decision told me voters viewed her as among the most qualified to be president on Day One \u2013 a key positive, given Biden\u2019s status as potentially the oldest politician to ever serve as president.\u201d  Errol Louis wrote, \u201cShe is fearsome in debate and comfortable on television, two skills that will come in handy in a race that will largely be fought on small screens rather than at huge outdoor rallies.\u201d For those aiming to defeat Trump, wrote SE Cupp, \u201cHarris is the only viable running mate to help take Biden across the finish line. Nearly every other candidate had major baggage or alienating qualities.\u201d Biden and Harris have something to prove, wrote Jeff Yang. \u201cThe symbolism of this ticket is undeniable,\u201d he said. \u201cVoters, especially progressive voters, will now be looking for the substance behind it \u2014 how the ticket intends to address a pandemic that, as Harris noted, is killing an American every 80 seconds; how it will reform health care; how it will protect women\u2019s right to choose, root out systemic racism, protect voting rights and reaffirm this nation\u2019s commitment to immigrants.\u201d On the right, commentator Scott Jennings pointed out that Harris\u2019 own campaign for president was \u201ca short ride\u2026several primary rivals like Bernie Sanders outlasted her because their authenticity was perceived to be far greater. But winning the vote of one person \u2013 Joe Biden, in this case \u2013 was easier than winning the millions of votes necessary to be the nominee herself.\u201d Harris was born in Oakland, California, and is fully qualified to run for vice president. But that didn\u2019t stop some Republicans from questioning her citizenship, much as Trump had perpetuated the \u201cbirther\u201d lie that former President Barack Obama also wasn\u2019t qualified. \u201cFor the first Black President, and now for the first Black nominee for vice president, the signal is clear: they\u2019re not \u2018one of us,\u2019\u201d wrote Douglas Heye, a Republican strategist. His advice to his fellow GOP members: \u201cStay far away from the \u2018birther,\u2019 9/11 truther and other conspiracy nonsense \u2013 except to condemn it. It hasn\u2019t helped the party in recent years \u2013 and it won\u2019t now.\u201d Meanwhile a Republican supporter of the fringe QAnon conspiracy theory won her primary runoff in Georgia\u2019s 14th congressional district, and more than a dozen like-minded candidates are running for Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the inmates are now running the asylum,\u201d wrote SE Cupp. \u201cTrump effectively turned the GOP into a padded-cell madhouse where up could be down, left could be right and blue could be green\u2026if he decided so.\u201d Reed Galen, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, wrote, \u201cThe Trump-Fox News-OANN-Bannon-Limbaugh-QAnon circle of death is designed to do nothing less than confuse, dispirit and depress individual American voters. Given Donald Trump\u2019s broad incapacity, his campaign can only win a low turnout, narrowly-decided election.\u201d With Congress deadlocked on the terms of a new Covid-19 economic relief package, President Trump issued four executive actions a week ago, including one that could defer payment of payroll taxes for some employees. Paul Begala called it \u201ca declaration of war on Social Security and Medicare\u201d and urged Democrats to campaign on it. \u201cThe payroll tax funds those two vital and beloved programs. When you suspend collection of the revenue that funds those two programs, you endanger their viability.\u201d In the Washington Post, Marc Thiessen hailed Trump\u2019s actions as a \u201cbig political win\u201d and said Democrats\u2019 failure to compromise on the aid package paved the way. \u201cBecause Trump acted unilaterally, Democrats get no credit for extending the relief. Their refusal to compromise means they got none of their priorities approved,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTheir only recourse now is to sue Trump to stop him from providing the American people with tax relief, student-loan deferments and enhanced unemployment benefits.\u201d Ahead of Monday\u2019s start of the Democratic convention, our political commentary editor Yaffa Fredrick asked 10 leading figures for their view of the party\u2019s future. Andrew Yang recalled campaigning for president in small towns across the country. When he was asked which party, he\u2019d say, \u201cDemocrat\u201d and \u201cFar too often, that person \u2013 a waitress, a trucker or a retail clerk \u2013 would respond in disgust\u2026They believe that we are the party of the urban enclaves and the educated elite. They think that we would rather lecture or patronize them than actually spend the time helping to solve their problems.\u201d There lies an opportunity, he said, for new solutions such as a universal basic income. Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, wrote that \u201cpeople want the Democratic Party to go bigger \u2013 and to offer a bold vision that matches this historic moment. To win not just this year, but in the decades to come, the Democratic Party must be the party of fundamental change, not incremental change.\u201d Keith Boykin, a former aide in the Bill Clinton White House, wrote, \u201cIn the old days, Democrats were ashamed to be called \u2018liberal.\u2019 These days, 76% of Democrats say they\u2019d vote for a socialist for President. And even after weeks of civil unrest that would have spooked fearful Democrats in years past, 86% support the protests against police violence. The wind is at our back. As America becomes more diverse and open-minded, Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, and Republicans have had to resort to voter suppression attempts and gerrymandering to stay in power.\u201d (You can also read the views of Jess McIntosh, Jennifer Granholm, Abdul El-Sayed, Van Jones, Paul Begala, Jen Psaki and Mitch Landrieu.) CNN Opinion\u2019s special Democratic convention coverage continues all week. Health experts have repeatedly stressed: More testing for Covid-19 is key to safely reopening the economy.  \u201cThis is how other countries reined in their outbreaks \u2013 testing, plus doggedly tracing and isolating people who are infected,\u201d wrote infectious disease expert Kent Sepkowitz. But in the US, President Trump gave \u201cdangerous and deluded advice\u201d to \u201cslow the testing down, please.\u201d And now, in a nation with about a quarter of the world\u2019s recorded cases of the disease, testing declined for several weeks. \u201cHere we are with a lethal pandemic and, right before our very eyes, there has been a deliberate decrease in our attempt to measure and control the outbreak\u2026 \u201cIt is difficult to believe a plan so overt, so completely shameless as creating a false improvement by trying less hard to find cases, is occurring. This however is what seems to be happening.\u201d In March, 25-year-old Annika Olson wrote an open letter at CNN Opinion pleading with her generation to protect each other and their families by social distancing. It didn\u2019t persuade enough people, she noted in a new op-ed. \u201cAs I am writing this, there are throngs of people at my apartment building\u2019s pool \u2013 no masks and no physical distancing\u2026. Young people between 20 and 40 are a significant portion of the growing number of cases, and many more may be contagious even if they don\u2019t show any symptoms.\u201d Peer pressure and a feeling of invincibility are factors in the failure to follow public health advice. Yet it\u2019s not hopeless and we should keep trying to spread the message, but in different ways, Olson concludes. A Georgia high school student, Hannah Watters, has been getting threats since she posted photos on Twitter that showed students flouting social distancing guidelines at her school. \u201cThe hostile reaction Watters has received\u2026is emblematic of the destructive polarization and lack of empathy which appears to have been sewn into the Trump administration\u2019s attitudes towards the pandemic from the beginning,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas. On the first day of school in Cherokee County, Georgia, teacher Tracy Strange wasn\u2019t in her classroom teaching high school students the basics of anatomy, Thomas Lake wrote. \u201cShe never left the house. Instead she drank her coffee alone and worried about the other teachers. And she cried.\u201d Strange, who has a heart ailment and a lung condition, had to retire at the age of 53 for fear of contracting Covid-19 or bringing it home to her in-laws, who are in their 70s and have underlying health conditions. They were decorated by European governments for their service, but the American suffrage advocates who volunteered to provide overseas medical care in World War I are largely unheralded in their own country. Kate Clarke Lemay tells their story, noting that women fighting for the right to vote \u201cseized on the war as an opportunity to bolster their cause, and in 1918, organized the Women\u2019s Oversea Hospitals Unit to serve in France. They were responding to the powerful antisuffragist argument that declared that women should not have the right to vote because they could not prove themselves as full citizens \u2013 by fighting for their country.\u201d With the ratification of the 19th Amendment 100 years ago this month, these women and many other suffrage activists realized their goal.

She and her husband had promised their kids pets, and he\u2019s allergic to dogs, cats and rabbits. There are limits to the positive benefits any pets can provide in this time of physical distancing, remote schooling and working from home. \u201cIt\u2019s a world of desperate and stressed out parents, of children losing social, emotional and physical ground,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cKids are often lonely and isolated and tweaked out and afraid.\u201d But she was able to report: \u201cEvery day the kids would go and sit by the box, which later became a small indoor coop, to watch something grow.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Republicans should be terrified. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection prospects look increasingly grim, with polls showing that his ticket is vulnerable in states like North Carolina, Ohio and Texas. According to one recent Fox News poll, Joe Biden has a two-point lead over Trump in Georgia\u2014where a Democratic presidential candidate has not won since 1992. A number of young and diverse voters are already moving to solidly conservative states and it\u2019s conceivable that an urban exodus that results from the pandemic could accelerate these trends. More importantly, President Trump and the blistering, smashmouth partisanship that constantly flows from the White House have forced Americans to confront the GOP\u2019s ugly transformation since the 1980s. Trump\u2019s botched response to the pandemic and his attempts to pander to extremists through backlash politics have forced a difficult conversation about the future of the Republican Party. The potential costs of another four years under Trump have become clear, and it seems voters are leaning blue. Trump has failed to contain the spread of Covid-19, and the US faces a deadly, tumultuous and dysfunctional future as other countries are reopening. We haven\u2019t seen a landslide victory since Republican Ronald Reagan defeated Democrat Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election. That was an important victory because it cemented the political standing of the conservative movement that Reagan brought into the halls of power and solidified the coalition of neoconservatives, the religious right and business and Wall Street conservatives that Reagan had stitched together in his 1980 election. In the 1964 election, Democrat Lyndon Johnson decimated Republican Senator Barry Goldwater and set right-wing conservatism back many years, offering a mandate to the Great Society, a set of domestic policies aimed at ending poverty, reducing crime, providing health care insurance, improving education and more. After that, Republicans ran away from the Goldwater brand and entered into deals with Democrats on policies like Medicare. Election victories of this scale and scope are harder to come by these days. The impact of a highly polarized electorate means that there are very few swing voters anymore. Most states are solidly blue or red, leaving elections to be won or lost in a handful of swing states, with slight margins decided by a small number of voters. Anonymous security forcing citizens into cars is mark of dictatorship That will most likely be the case in 2020. If Democrats mount a significant victory, Republicans could face the potential loss of both the White House and the Senate majority, as well as stinging defeats at the state and local level. This kind of election outcome would be particularly devastating for the GOP, given the fact that, as many commentators have pointed out, the Republican base has been shrinking for some time. Republicans have depended on institutions such as the Electoral College and voting restrictions to prop up their diminishing numbers. A landside election is one of the few cataclysmic events that could actually challenge our current political landscape. It would leave Republicans, a party influenced by intense partisanship, to finally do some serious soul-searching and put forth constructive policies and a new political strategy in order to win again. It would force a reckoning within the party, which has stood loyally by President Trump throughout his term, as he says the quiet parts out loud. A huge defeat could give younger voices in the GOP \u2014rather than the Tucker Carlson types who take a deeper dive into Trumpian Republicanism\u2014the political space to push their leadership to finally move in different directions. The odds of a huge defeat, of course, are slim. Polarization is a powerful thing and despite all the sturm and drang from the Trump White House, most voters might just end up coming home. It\u2019s important to remember that President Trump has yet to unload his full arsenal\u2014from the inevitable smear campaigns to the possible investigations the Justice Department could launch to undermine Biden.  There are still four months until election day, but if these current poll numbers hold, Biden might end up accomplishing something truly historic. If he and the Democrats inflict the kind of damage on the GOP that members can\u2019t simply forget, he might end up ushering in a \u201cnew normal\u201d that Washington has not seen in a long time by pressuring the Republican Party to think long and hard about the principles of governance and institution-building once again.",

The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. The pre-pandemic days of the presidential primary campaign, when up to 20 Democrats gathered on stages to discuss the minutiae of their healthcare, gun regulation or higher education proposals, already feel like something from a different era. Those TV debates appeared very urgent at the time, but no longer seem particularly relevant to the problems facing the country. Voters who mostly struggled to figure out the differences between issues like whether Medicare for All was better than Medicare for those who wanted it were told by pundits and the media alike that they should select their party\u2019s nominee based on their substantive plans and policies. Candidates heard from those same sources that they needed to talk about issues. This view is not simply wrong because the current pandemic changed everything. It has always been wrong and mischaracterizes the nature of the presidency, and of American politics more deeply. The Covid-19 crisis has reminded us that fixating on policy proposals and minor differences on issues during the primaries does us a disservice when it comes to choosing a nominee. The nation is now headed into an election without voters having had a proper chance to assess what matters most in a candidate: leadership style and crisis management. For example, the extent of Joe Biden\u2019s ability to delegate and to surround himself with experienced experts in a crisis is much more important than the specific details of a sweeping health care proposal that almost certainly would never become law anyway. It is only now when Biden has sewn up the Democratic nomination that we are learning the answers to some of these questions. While the former vice president has kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, Ron Klain, who very ably led the fight against Ebola, has emerged as Biden\u2019s point person on Covid-19. This is a reassuring sign that Biden would take a rational and sober approach to managing the pandemic. On the other hand, progressive Democrats are not encouraged by indications that Biden would have people like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers direct the post-shutdown economic recovery. Many on the left view Summers as an advocate of the wealthy who has contributed to the dramatic rise in income inequality in recent years. Less is known about Biden\u2019s leadership style, other than he has a strong ability to empathize and is loyal to his employees. Although he has been a powerful politician since the Nixon administration, we\u2019ve not seen much of his management technique because he has never run anything bigger than the vice president\u2019s office. And while vice presidents like Biden are important presidential advisers, they do not have administrative responsibilities. A primary system that gave us more insight into Biden\u2019s management style might, for example, have given us some perspective on how to assess his response to former aide Tara Reade\u2019s allegations that he sexually assaulted her in a Senate hallway in 1993. Biden categorically denied Reade\u2019s charges on May 1 \u2013 weeks after Reade first made them in a podcast \u2013 and only after his supporters had spoken out on his behalf. The coronavirus pandemic is sui generis in modern American history, but almost all presidents confront crises that few, if any, candidates were thinking about when they won their party\u2019s nomination or when they took office. Just as Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been taken over by the current pandemic, former President Barack Obama\u2019s first term was evaluated largely on his response to the economic downturn that occurred long after he had secured the Democratic nomination. Obama\u2019s predecessor, former President George W. Bush, promised a humbler foreign policy, suggesting less engagement with the rest of the world, but was forced to scrap that idea following the September 11th attacks on the US during his first year in office. His father, former President George H. W. Bush, spent most of his attention as president on the end of the Cold War and Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, neither of which was an issue when the elder Bush was elected in 1988. Attempting to choose nominees based on policy specifics may make us feel like serious people, but it has little to do with the realities of governance or even the job of being president. In general, the specifics of each Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s plan are much less important than the views of the majority party in Congress. This is how American politics has worked for a long time and talk of a political revolution, having a plan for everything or proclaiming generational change was never going to change that. Despite this, there were important differences between the candidates in the Democratic primary that were obscured by what were, in many cases, minor policy disagreements. Most candidates would, if elected, have had to pass policies within the same relatively narrow bandwidth. Thus it\u2019s positive approaches like Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s ability to inspire and to reach out to people with different views, Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 gift for speaking simple truths in simple language, Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s skills at processing information and crafting detailed plans, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s perspective as an extremely smart representative of a younger generation, Biden\u2019s calming and steady presence \u2013 or negatives like  Sanders\u2019 inflexibility or Biden\u2019s overconfidence in his ability to reach agreements with Republicans \u2013 that define presidencies and determine how crises are handled. During the primary those differences of style and approach were too frequently treated as peripheral. Too much of the primary season was spent on parsing policy instead of exploring the bigger picture leadership questions that really matter. This is a problem today not because the current crisis was unimaginable a year ago, but because a presidency without a major unexpected crisis is what is genuinely unimaginable.",

He is supporting Bernie Sanders for president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. The main lesson of the Democratic primaries is the growing generational divide in US politics, one that reflects the deep and disruptive shifts taking place in the US economy. Former Vice President Joe Biden has captured the votes of older Democrats; Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders the votes of younger Democrats. Both Sanders and Biden outpace Trump in head-to-head polls, and in a recent poll, Biden leads Trump among voters of all ages, with the margin narrowing significantly among older voters. It is vital to understand the generational divide both to address America\u2019s glaring crises and to peer ahead to the future of American politics. According to the exit polls from Michigan yesterday, Sanders trounced Biden among voters 18-29 by the lopsided margin 76-19, while Biden trounced Sanders among voters over 65 by the margin 71-20. Sanders captured the 30-44 year-olds by a smaller margin, 52-42, while Biden won the 45-64 year-olds by 62-26. With the voters 45 and older accounting for 62 percent of the turnout, Biden took Michigan overall, by the margin 53-36. These extraordinary voting differences by age reflect ongoing disruptive changes in the American economy; the share of secure, well-paid jobs in the workforce is shrinking as a result of the digital revolution. A century ago, machines displaced agricultural workers. In recent decades, increasingly capable robots have replaced assembly-line workers. Today, the e-commerce wave is displacing shopworkers, while automated data systems are replacing clerical and administrative work. Transport and warehousing employment will be the next to go. National income is shifting away from wages to capital, and notably to capital income that accrues to higher education, intellectual property and digital platforms. This is a key reason why stock markets have soared while wages have stagnated during the past generation, and why stable work has been replaced by gig work. Capital owners have added to the ever-increasing inequality by using their political clout to amplify their market-based successes with political prizes as well: tax cuts on corporate and personal income, and the ready access to tax havens providing safety from stringent enforcement. Biden victories leave Sanders speechless From the perspective of a young person, especially the roughly three out of every five young people who do not earn a bachelor\u2019s degree, and the roughly 70% of graduates who will earn a Bachelor\u2019s degree together with debt, today\u2019s economy is deeply threatening. Jobs are precarious; paychecks are low and stagnant; and healthcare coverage is either crushingly expensive or simply unaffordable. And workers know that today\u2019s low unemployment is cyclical and therefore evanescent, vulnerable to the coronavirus epidemic, trade wars, budget deficits, climate shocks, or a number of other factors that can easily turn the economy into recession. Young people know that when the downturn arrives, there will be little social protection. Moreover, they have little \u2013 if any \u2013 financial savings, and many have few prospects to buy a home. The formerly soaring stock market is something between an irrelevance and a provocation. Add to this the realistic fears of massive climate change combined with crippling public debts and higher future taxes to service them. It adds up to a perfect storm. The situation for most older people is also very difficult, and while they often support Sanders in spirit, their voting behavior is different. Young voters want change \u2013 massive change \u2013 to put the economy and environment on the right course for future decades. Older voters are more likely to hunker down, hoping that the changes ahead can be delayed long enough so that they can keep their jobs, their healthcare coverage, and get through retirement years intact. Biden still has a lot of problems as a candidate More younger voters want Medicare for All, while older voters already have Medicare. Younger voters are seeking new kinds of job security; older voters care more about Social Security. Younger voters want a safe environment in the future, while older voters are often more worried about their electricity bills today. Even when older voters are just scraping by with meager incomes and small savings, they are attuned to their 401(k) balances and the stock market. In spirit, they too would like to take on Big Healthcare, Big Oil, and the bloated military; in practice they vote for limited change. Bernie Sanders\u2019 revolution has fallen short of its electoral aspirations not because of Sanders\u2019 concepts \u2013 some of which is supported by voters in both parties \u2013 but because Sanders has faced the generational divide in voting behavior. Of the many Democratic candidates, he alone has honestly focused on the deep economic changes we need in this country. However, he did not convince enough older voters to buy in to those deep changes with their votes.  Of course, demography is not destiny: Bernie too has many older supporters, this author being among them. Notably, in the exit poll of Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary voters, only 7 percent of voters said the US economic system works well enough as is.  Yet 48 percent said the US economy needs \u201cminor changes,\u201d while 43 percent believe in the need for a \u201ccomplete overhaul.\u201d  Biden trounced Sanders among the first group, by 60 to 29 percent, while Sanders prevailed among the second group, 55 to 42 percent. Younger people much more strongly support the need for reform of the economic system.  Trump\u2019s base is especially resistant to change. That is its defining nature. In the 2020 election, Trump will be defending the status quo, not the vote for change. My bet is that either Biden or Sanders will handily beat Trump, with Biden as the candidate for modest change, or Sanders as the braver and I believe more accurate candidate of the deep policy changes that we require.",

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. It seems Michael Bloomberg entered the presidential race for at least two reasons: he wants to be president and he understands the importance of denying President Trump a second term. His late entrance into the race, however, means every decision he makes is exponentially more consequential as the clock counts down to November 3. His strategy so far has been to spend \u2013 and spend some more \u2013 blanketing the media landscape with  the message that he\u2019s the best candidate to take on Trump. In any political campaign, candidates need to know what they stand for, and who \u2013 or what \u2013 they\u2019re up against. At this stage in the game for Bloomberg, that enemy is not Trump. It\u2019s Sen. Bernie Sanders and the election calendar. If Bloomberg wants to make it past the Democratic National Convention in July, his strategy needs to change \u2013quickly. His first objective is to nab the nomination, and to do that, he needs to direct his resources to take down Sanders before he even has a chance at Trump. As it stands, Sanders has a chance to run the table as the rest of the field fights each other for the honor of coming in second.  Sanders has emerged as the Democratic front-runner, and his support stands at 25% among Democrats and independents who lean Democratic, according to the most recent Quinnipiac poll. But that\u2019s not enough to win the general election. I don\u2019t believe the country is prepared to support a Democratic socialist, and I agree with the theory that Sanders would lose in a matchup against Trump. In a general election battle between two divisive figures who both preach the politics of grievance, I believe Trump will win the battle to the bottom and remain the last man standing. The path to the White House leads through here Given that the primary calendar dictates that 60% of delegates will be determined by St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the primary race could be effectively over in less than a month. Of all the other Democratic candidates, Bloomberg may be the only one who can stop the Sanders freight train and still have a shot at winning the White House. But let\u2019s not forget \u2013 Bloomberg is already skipping the first four voting states in favor of concentrating on Super Tuesday. With his disastrous performance in the Las Vegas debate, it appears he won\u2019t be building any organic momentum in this race. He has to buy it. If Bloomberg has any chance of winning the nomination, he has to redirect his resources during the primary and run ads against Sanders \u2013 not Trump. Bloomberg needs to use the next $400 million in ad spending to attack Sanders on his potential weaknesses in a general election and highlight how far left his campaign is. Hitting him on his past record on guns is a must. Bloomberg also needs to drive home the fact that very little of what Sanders has proposed has any chance of being implemented without serious challenges and major compromises, as even, for example, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez admitted on Medicare for All. Sanders\u2019 praise of Soviet-backed regimes is ripe for political attack ads \u2013 and if Bloomberg doesn\u2019t take advantage of this, Trump certainly will in the fall. Finally, Sanders\u2019 legislative record of achievements is lacking, and the difficulty he faces in garnering support among both Democratic or Republican lawmakers can be highlighted. Reagan vs. Carter holds a crucial lesson for 2020 Dems Bloomberg has a narrow window of time to shift his strategy. As Tim Miller, who served as Jeb Bush\u2019s communications director in 2016 wrote in The Bulwark, a big lesson from 2016 is \u201cattack the freaking front-runner for God\u2019s sake \u2026 If Mike\u2019s goal is to actually beat Bernie \u2013 and not just finish Super Tuesday with a gentleman\u2019s 18 percent and embark on a long, losing slog in the hopes something crazy happens \u2013 then his paid media needs to shift to targeting Bernie immediately. Let me emphasize this: Immediately, today, five minutes ago, the fork NOW.\u201d Taking on the front-runner is risky business. By launching an all-out attack, Bloomberg is likely to hurt Sanders. But this plan could also backfire. It may be that Bloomberg succeeds in derailing Sanders \u2013 and damages his own campaign in the process, clearing the way for Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren or Amy Klobuchar if they manage to stay above the fray. But what\u2019s the alternative for Bloomberg? Continuing to focus only on Trump does nothing to stop the Sanders campaign, nor does it do anything to sort out the rest of the field until after Super Tuesday. By then, it\u2019ll be too late. If Bloomberg entered the race to become President and to stop Trump, he has no choice now but to try to stop Sanders.  Doing so without taking himself down is the strategic test for Mike Bloomberg. Either way, he has to face it now instead of waiting until Super Tuesday. Winning the White House ultimately means beating Donald Trump. But to get to Trump, and to deny him a second term, Bloomberg will have to defeat Sanders first, even if that might mean ruining his own chances at the nomination.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Daniel Guild is lawyer, project manager and Democratic activist in New Hampshire. He writes for Bleeding Heartland, a progressive political blog. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The first canvasser, for Elizabeth Warren, knocked on my door last June. It was far earlier than in prior years, but like other New Hampshire voters I have been answering the door (or not, depending on my mood), throwing candidate mailers away (Tom Steyer sends at least one a week) and having my Pandora playlist interrupted by Pete Buttigieg for months. But many of my fellow citizens \u2013 myself included \u2013 are having trouble choosing a Democratic presidential candidate. According to a CNN/UNH poll, as many as 69% of voters have said they might still change their minds before primary day. This suggests that we may see a significant swing in candidate fortunes as the campaign in New Hampshire unfolds over the next several days. Here\u2019s a look at some of the key factors that could shape the result: Iowa results have always mattered in New Hampshire, though some in New Hampshire might not admit it. It\u2019s worth remembering 1984 Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart\u2019s surprising second place finish in Iowa allowed him to overcome a 25-point deficit and beat Walter Mondale by 12 points in New Hampshire in 1984. Or how John Kerry\u2019s come-from-behind win in Iowa propelled him to victory in New Hampshire in 2004. In defense of Iowa Iowa\u2019s real power is in the focus it gives to the winners. In conversation with Dante Scala, a professor at the University of New Hampshire who has also studied Iowa and New Hampshire, we both agreed that Iowa may create a two-candidate race in New Hampshire between former Mayor Peter Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 or a three-way race between Buttigieg, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In either scenario, former Vice President Joe Biden would not be included \u2013 and the risk that he descends into irrelevancy is quite real unless he can pull off strong victories in Nevada and South Carolina. But will Iowa matter in New Hampshire this time given how long it has taken to get a complete set of results? Since polling post-caucus is limited, it makes sense to ask what the state of the race was before Iowa. New Hampshire voters want to ensure President Donald Trump does not win reelection. Most Democrats, in fact, say that beating Trump is more important than any other issue, though they differ in how best to accomplish this. The Iowa Caucuses were a disaster -- and here's why it shouldn't worry Americans Moreover, different candidates appeal to the different reasons Democratic voters want to stop Trump. Buttigieg appeals to those appalled by the President\u2019s ignorance (the Kansas City Chiefs play in Missouri, Mr. President). Former Vice President Joe Biden appeals to those scared of the chaos Trump creates \u2013 and hopeful he can reunify the country once again. And Sanders and Warren supporters view Trump as a tool for the rich and think winning requires a bolder politics. There is little doubt Sanders is ahead \u2013 and Iowa will likely only help him. Many campaigns noticed that some of Sanders\u2019 2016 supporters began to move back to him in December and early January. Some of this may be connected to the Warren polling decline that began in the fall, possibly a result of the concern for her Medicare for All plan. Still, it is clear from the most recent CNN/UNH poll that Warren and Sanders are fighting for the same voters. That poll found 45% of Warren current supporters identified Sanders as their second choice, and 46% of Sanders supporters said their second choice was Warren. To understand Sanders\u2019 strength, you must understand that the Democratic Party is really two parties: one for young people and another for the old. Yes, age, along with race, defines differences within the Democratic Party \u2013 as much as ideology does. And this is not new. In 2008, Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton with those under 30 by a margin of 51-28, and Sanders beat Clinton in 2016 among those same voters by a margin of 83-16 here. In the most recent UNH/CNN poll, Sanders received 47% support from those under 35, and only 11% from those over 65. Conversely, Biden received 28% from those over 65, and a mere 7% of the vote from those under 35. So, can anyone beat Sanders? The answer is surely yes. But it will very much depend on whether a two- or three-way race develops. What of Biden? From the beginning I have not sensed excitement for him (this was also true in Iowa). Talk to his supporters, and they will tell you he can beat Trump, but how can you be the most electable candidate when you appear to be finishing fourth in Iowa? His supporters are older and certainly more moderate, but he is struggling for a message that would make people enthusiastic about him. Joe Biden: On to New Hampshire and beyond The first time I took Buttigieg seriously was in last March when a city councilor in Concord told me how impressed the councilors were with him. Though he is the youngest candidate, he does well with older voters.  A common reaction from his supporters is that \u201cHe is just so smart.\u201d In Iowa, we learned that some Biden and Klobuchar supporters moved to Buttigieg when their candidate was not viable. That may be an indication that Buttigieg can emerge as the moderate consensus candidate. In the many candidate events I have attended, one question has been asked over and over: \u201cHow can you bring us together?\u201d In the last days of Iowa, Warren suggested an answer: herself. In some ways, Warren is the most likely candidate to beat Sanders. She is from a neighboring state, her organization is equal to Sanders and she is perhaps the only candidate who can appeal to both wings of the party, though her support tends to be better educated and more female than Sanders. The next big event in New Hampshire is the debate. And in the Granite State, debates can make or break a campaign. In 1980, Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan came in second to George H.W. Bush in Iowa, and was still trailing Bush the night of the New Hampshire debate. Up until that point, Reagan\u2019s performance had been so lackluster many sensed his time had passed him by. But before the debate began, a debate Reagan was notably paying for because the FEC had ruled the Nashua Telegraph could not sponsor the debate and comply with election regulations, there was a dispute whether he could bring other candidates on stage. When the debate moderator tried to stop Reagan from including them, Reagan shouted \u201cI am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\u201d  That single moment, which aired repeatedly on national television, seemed to put an end to all of the doubts that Reagan\u2019s Iowa defeat had created. In contrast, Bush\u2019s subsequent silence made him look weak and indecisive. Politico noted Reagan would later say, \u201cI may have won the debate, the primary \u2013 and the nomination \u2013 right there.\u201d New Hampshire is the end of the road for many candidates, and the debate may be their last chance.  As each of those candidates step onto the stage, they will be looking for their own \u201cI am paying for this microphone\u201d moment.",

Donald Trump loves attacking Democrats as \u201cfar-left radical socialists.\u201d So why does Team Trump spend so much time pumping up Bernie Sanders? Spoiler alert: It\u2019s a trap. But let\u2019s look at the evidence. For weeks, President Trump has been rushing to Bernie\u2019s defense and accusing Democrats of rigging the primaries against him. He accused Democrats of timing his impeachment trial to hurt Bernie Sanders\u2019 chances, an allegation dutifully echoed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Don Jr. The President was at it again on the eve of the Iowa caucus, tweeting that the Democratic National Committee was trying to \u201crig the election against Sanders,\u201d even as he called Bernie Sanders a \u201ccommunist\u201d in a pre-Super Bowl safe-space interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. It\u2019s been a repeated riff for months. Conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt on \u201cMeet The Press\u201d announced that he was voting for Bernie in Virginia\u2019s open primary \u2013 because he wanted a clear contrast between an authentic socialist and Donald Trump. This isn\u2019t subtle. Team Trump wants to run against Bernie Sanders. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask them. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to promote the rise,\u201d an unnamed Trump adviser told Jonathan Swann from Axios. \u201cThe campaign has been pumping up the national messaging behind Bernie, pushing out fundraising emails. When you attack his policies, it gets the media to talk about him.\u201d Out from behind the veil, GOP consultant Ed Rollins tweeted out an anti-Warren ad, saying: \u201cOur SuperBowl is facing Bernie Sanders in the general. What\u2019s the best way to ensure @realdonaldtrump faces Crazy Bernie? Making sure Dem primary voters really get to know Elizabeth \u2018Pocahontas\u2019 Warren.\u201d Why is Bernie Sanders surging? So why does the Trump team want to pump up Bernie Sanders\u2019 chances? Hint: It\u2019s not because they share some of the same protectionist impulses on trade or isolationist impulses on foreign policies, as Trump has argued in the past.  And it\u2019s not because Trump and Sanders were the two candidates being pushed by Russian trolls and bots in the 2016 election. It\u2019s because Donald Trump does best running against a self-described socialist, beating a socialist by an average of six points, despite currently losing to the named top-tier Democratic candidates in head-to-head match-ups. The candidate who has consistently done best against Trump head to head \u2013 including in crucial swing states \u2013 is Joe Biden. That\u2019s why Republican senators are trying to double down on Donald Trump\u2019s lie that Joe Biden\u2019s public intervention against a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor was itself corrupt. The President has just been impeached for withholding military aid until Ukraine announced an investigation into his most formidable political rival. This was designed to take Joe Biden off the field, but it backfired. That hasn\u2019t stopped Republican Sen. Rick Scott from running an ad called \u201cBiden Got Away With It,\u201d or Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa saying on the eve of the Iowa caucus that Joe Biden could be immediately impeached if he wins. These are fact-free scare tactics because Republicans don\u2019t want Trump to run against Biden. To defeat Trump, Sanders and Warren supporters must stay united But what about Bernie? Let\u2019s give the man some credit. There\u2019s no question he has an intense and enthusiastic following. He is an authentic ideologue \u2013 an avowed Democratic Socialist who has the courage of his convictions for decades and succeeded in changing the terms of the debate within the Democratic Party. If he wins Iowa, polls show that he could win New Hampshire \u2013 which he won in 2016 \u2013 and have a strong shot at the next caucuses in Nevada. But don\u2019t forget that less than a quarter of Democrats call themselves \u201cvery liberal\u201d \u2013 and in general, Democratic voters are older, more moderate and more blue collar than you might think if you gauge opinion only on Twitter, as Harry Enten has persuasively argued. Sanders\u2019 support for ending private health insurance in favor of Medicare for all isn\u2019t popular \u2013 while the public option backed by Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar is even supported by 41% of Republicans. And the very label \u201csocialist\u201d \u2013 along with Sanders\u2019 record of defending the Castro regime in Cuba and the Chavez-Maduro regime in Venezuela \u2013 could seriously damage outreach to Hispanic voters in Florida and elsewhere.  The Trump team has made it very clear that its campaign will be based on negative partisanship \u2013 demonizing Democrats as radical socialists to distract from the President\u2019s broad unpopularity. The bottom line is that they can do that with impunity against an avowed Democratic Socialist such as Bernie Sanders. That\u2019s why they\u2019re pumping up his candidacy, trolling concern about a \u201crigged system\u201d while also calling him \u201ccrazy\u201d and a \u201ccommunist.\u201d We\u2019ll find out in Iowa and over the next few days whether Democrats avoid the trap that\u2019s being set for them or whether they\u2019ll leap right into it, enjoying the exhilaration of ideological purity before they collide into the reality of a general election.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates for president took part in their party\u2019s seventh debate on Tuesday night in Des Moines and CNN commentators weighed in. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors Senator Elizabeth Warren had a very good debate. It seems that the challenges she has faced in the past few weeks, such as her slide in the polls and frustration with her shifting positions on Medicare for All, strengthened her resolve and sharpened her focus. Although she will certainly come under some fire for walking away even further from Medicare for All, Warren delivered a series of sharp answers about US policy overseas, trade, health care, child care and corruption. When asked about the comment that Sanders allegedly made to her about a woman not being able to win the presidency, she didn\u2019t take the bait, avoiding an explosive fight and instead turning the conversation back to the big picture: how to win back the White House. Warren pivoted to make a vital argument about the centrality of the women\u2019s vote to victory in 2020, reminding the audience that \u201cThe only people on stage who have won every single election they\u2019ve been in are the women.\u201d It was reminiscent of 1984 when President Ronald Reagan was asked about his age during a televised debate with the younger Walter Mondale. Without missing a beat, Reagan, who some thought was too old to be president, promised that he wouldn\u2019t use Mondale\u2019s youth and inexperience against him.  It\u2019s unclear what a strong debate performance can accomplish at this point. It might be that concerns about electability are so strong that they will give Biden the victory, or that Sanders\u2019 grassroots support is so strong that Warren can\u2019t undercut his strength. But given the fluidity that seems to exist in the electorate, it might be possible that this debate becomes a step in revitalizing the coalition that started to come together in the summer, allowing Warren to position herself as the most unifying candidate in the Democratic pack.

Tonight\u2019s debate did not shake up the race. The 60% of undecided caucus voters in Iowa will likely leave this debate still undecided.  Biden had a steady performance with particularly strong answers on foreign policy and a demonstration of the ability to not only fight Trump but also heal the country. But Biden\u2019s performance was not a home run, as many of his answers were just lackluster. The same goes for Pete Buttigieg. While Mayor Pete was solid, he never achieved that memorable debate moment. Warren and Sanders went at it on the \u201ccan a woman win?\u201d he said/she said. Senator Warren had a great moment which will be played over and over, explaining it was only the women on stage who had never lost a race. In the end, however, both Sanders and Warren were vociferous in their certainty that indeed a woman can win the Presidency. It was Amy Klobuchar who had the best night, with consistently strong answers on every topic and a convincing argument that she can beat Trump in a general election, but her performance is likely not enough to get her from 6% to a win, place or show in Iowa. Bottom line, the dynamic of the caucus remains unchanged. Patti Solis Doyle, a CNN commentator, was an assistant to the President and senior adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, was chief of staff on Clinton\u2019s 2000 and 2006 Senate campaigns, and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign manager in 2007 and early 2008. She is president of Solis Strategies, a Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in serving nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and corporations. Follow her @pattisolisdoyle. Right out of the gate, the debate was primed for conflict. CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer prodded Senator Bernie Sanders to confront Vice President Joe Biden on his support for the Iraq War. But Sanders didn\u2019t dive in fully. As one of just a handful of open contrasts amidst a relatively friendly primary, a successful Sanders attack \u2013 and Biden flub \u2014 conceivably could have shifted the dynamic in the final weeks before Iowa. But for some reason Sanders demurred, instead focusing on his own dovish stances. Blitzer tried to draw focus back to Biden\u2019s support for the conflict in Iraq, but the frontrunner wasn\u2019t trapped. Biden pointed to his long-ago apology for that 2002 vote which, if we\u2019re honest, seems like ancient history in the Trump era. He was smart to pivot to what\u2019s still fresh to most Democrats: the Obama era. Biden drew voters\u2019 attention to his leadership on the Iraq troop drawdown and opposing an Afghanistan surge. The answer fed a sentiment felt by a full half of Democrats according to a late November CNN poll: that they trust Biden to best handle foreign policy. No doubt, that\u2019s an extension of his tenure as vice president. He wants voters to do a bit of trust transference \u2013 remember the sane Obama years? I\u2019ll take us back there. As tensions with Iran flare and foreign policy positions are more important than they\u2019ve been all primary, Biden\u2019s answer worked. He won on foreign affairs, and avoided falling into a trap that could have threatened his still-strong frontrunner status. Ian Sams is the former press secretary to Senator Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. There were beautiful moments in Tuesday\u2019s first Democratic debate of 2020. Bernie Sanders shined a light on America\u2019s moral failures. Joe Biden talked about restoring the soul of the nation. Pete Buttigieg told powerful stories about troops deploying for combat. And Amy Klobuchar put a human face on job losses from decades of failed, top-down economic policy. And of course, Elizabeth Warren knocked it out of the park. She combined clear explanation of her plans with a powerful defense of people who are suffering in Trump\u2019s America. And in her exchange with Bernie Sanders, she drew massive applause by pointing out just how formidable female candidates have been in recent elections. All that said, Tuesday night left me disappointed and dispirited. That has a lot to do with who was there, and who was not. First, this was the first debate since Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Kamala Harris ended their campaigns. The debate was poorer without their voices, and without Andrew Yang, who failed to qualify, in the mix. There are now more billionaires than black people in the Democratic primary. There are more plutocrats than people of color. The most diverse field ever has been winnowed down \u2013 and not in the way any of us hoped. Second, as both a Democrat and a progressive, I was saddened to see the friction between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. When those two are at each other\u2019s throats, it does not benefit Biden or Buttigieg. It helps Big Pharma, Big Banks, Big Oil \u2013 and every other powerful interest that leaves too many Americans feeling real pain every day. America and policies of trickle-down economics have left a generation of voters with too much debt, too many jails and too few options. The Sanders / Warren agenda is music to the ears of this rising generation. Anything that divides two candidates who represent the future of America is a distraction we cannot afford. Van Jones is the host of the \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d and a CNN political commentator. He is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance. During Tuesday\u2019s presidential primary debate, Democrats continued their embrace of policies that would make our country poorer, less free, less safe and less fair. Sanders attacked the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated by President Donald Trump, yet omitted that USMCA is expected to increase annual US agricultural and food exports by $2.2 billion, according to the US International Trade Commission. He also touted his \u201cfree college\u201d for all proposal, ignoring as USA Today reports, that \u201cPeople with higher debts often have higher earnings, especially people who went to graduate school such as lawyers or doctors. They\u2019re more able to pay off their loans \u2013 and loan forgiveness would make them very wealthy very quickly.\u201d Pete Buttigieg\u2019s disdain for President Trump\u2019s leadership in stepping away from the flawed Iranian nuclear deal naively dismissed that the deal lifted sanctions, enabling the bankrolling of terrorist operations for Iranian-backed proxies in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and throughout the region. Even as former Vice President Joe Biden tried to denigrate President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, he neglected to mention that President Obama\u2019s national security adviser Gen. James Jones said the Trump administration was \u201cabsolutely correct\u201d to kill top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and that \u201chistory will say that this was the right thing to do.\u201d All of the Democrats onstage, with the exception of Sen. Amy Klobuchar, endorsed a ban on fracking, but none of the candidates acknowledged that the resulting shale boom from fracking has helped make the US less dependent on Middle East oil, thus protecting our gas prices from the whims OPEC nations, especially Iran. This gas price stability also helps the poor and middle classes, who spend a higher share of their budgets than the rich on transportation. There may have been fewer candidates onstage during tonight\u2019s debate, but their policies provided no greater clarity about what would actually work to protect our freedoms, grow our economy and strengthen America\u2019s forgotten men and women.

In post-debate analysis of Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, a number of commentators expressed surprise and even a bit of disappointment that the candidates were relatively chummy.  After all, this was their last debate before the Iowa caucuses \u2013 their final opportunity to attack each other and perhaps shake up the race.  Why didn\u2019t they?  Was that a mistake? The expectation for hostility among the candidates is understandable, given the degree of vitriol coursing through our politics these days. But from my perspective, their civility was not only welcome but smart.  With a smaller number on stage, we had a chance to see more of the character and temperament of each candidate.  My sense was that the extra time and exposure made most of them seem more likable and attractive. That is more important than it may seem: in voting for president, people tend to ask themselves whether they want to have Candidate X or Candidate Y in their living rooms for the next four years.  Democrats who have become discouraged about the quality of their candidates should feel a little happier after last night. For weeks, Democrats have been asking, of course, \u201cwho is the best candidate to beat Trump?\u201d  Watching the crosstalk among the candidates last night, it also became clear that Dems would be well advised to ask a related question: \u201cWho is the best candidate to beat Trump in televised debates?\u201d Debating skills are not always among the criteria that parties have applied in choosing a nominee.  But given the aggressive, brutal style of the man who will be waiting in the ring, the Dems ought to be thinking hard about them now. For my money, their most attractive debaters \u2013 those who would likely stand up well against Trump \u2013 are among those thought less likely to win the nomination: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg.   Klobuchar is the most improved on stage, as she has relaxed and shown a little moxie. Buttigieg is the most intellectually interesting and articulate. Among the other candidates, Elizabeth Warren has the strongest grasp of public policy. After some off nights, she was in good form again last night and she graciously decided not to lash out against Bernie Sanders on gender. Stay tuned! David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and the former director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. Judging by their compelling critiques of a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and corporate interests and the strength of their respective cases for how to bring transformative change for the better, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both won Tuesday\u2019s debate. The other four Democratic candidates sharing the Drake University debate stage also put in admirable performances. Tom Steyer may have most exceeded expectations, because as a wealthy businessman with no political experience, he had the most to prove.  He called income inequality unsupportable, championed health care as a right for every American and criticized a system where neighborhood property taxes determine which school has the most resources. Democratic debate:  What commentators are saying on Twitter It\u2019s unlikely that Joe Biden, who most needed to win over voters to re-cement his first place standing in Iowa, accomplished that goal. It\u2019s not that he made any major gaffes but he lacked any major breakout moments. He seemed vulnerable when asked about his family\u2019s role in a Ukrainian business deal involving his son \u2013 which President Donald Trump allegedly tried to get Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate in exchange for the release of funds to Ukraine. Biden also couldn\u2019t effectively defend his vote for the Iraq War, other than to argue that President Barack Obama picked him as his running mate anyway. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar put in solid performances, but both were more effective at articulating the case against Trump than in sealing the deal for themselves. Buttigieg once again showed himself to be a dynamic speaker with a keen intellect and a compelling story. Klobuchar is a shrewd, smart and likable politician. But both were arguing for incremental rather than structural changes, at a time when many Democrats are fed up with the status quo. Their cases seemed to be no match for what Klobuchar dismissed as other candidates\u2019  \u201cgrand ideological (schemes) that will never see the light of day.\u201d Or maybe they will see the light of day. Rekha Basu has worked as a reporter, editorial writer and columnist at newspapers in New York, Florida and Iowa. Her commentaries appear twice weekly on the opinion pages of The Des Moines Register (USA Today Network) and are distributed weekly by Tribune Content Agency. The four Democrats locked in the closest ever Iowa caucus race appeared determined not to repeat the mistakes front-runners made here 16 years ago. Back then, negative campaigning between Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt aided the rapid ascent of John Kerry and John Edwards in the final weeks before the 2004 caucuses. In contrast, a multilateral non-aggression pact was evident in Des Moines on Tuesday night. Candidates mostly stuck to their own positive messages. For Bernie Sanders: Think big, not small, and take on the 1 percent\u2019s greed. For Elizabeth Warren: Root out corruption and build a movement for real change. For Pete Buttigieg: It\u2019s time to turn the page. For Joe Biden: I can lead this country at home and abroad. Warren was particularly skillful at pivoting to the points she wanted to drive home. Biden avoided the gaffes and non-sequiturs that have marred past debates. Sanders and Warren seemed eager to defuse tensions over a year-old conversation that came to light recently. The occasional mild rebuke, such as Buttigieg suggesting we shouldn\u2019t measure the \u201cboldness\u201d of a health care plan by how many Americans it will alienate, sparked no drama or instant memes. I doubt any Iowan leaning toward one of the top four candidates heard anything to make them question that choice. For that reason, it was a tough debate for the two contenders trailing the pack. They stated their cases effectively too: for Amy Klobuchar, I can win big and govern without extremes, and for Tom Steyer, I can beat Donald Trump on the economy. But they don\u2019t control their destiny. They can\u2019t break out unless Iowa Democrats see a need to abandon the candidates vying for the lead.

I just don\u2019t get the strategy here. The biggest bombshell of the week was Elizabeth Warren claiming Bernie Sanders told her that a woman can\u2019t be elected president, a stunning attack for one of the three leading candidates to make on another. Sanders gamely denied it, and then just stood there as the moderator appeared to ignore his denial. Then he failed to challenge Warren straight up by demanding she admit she was lying! This is perhaps the most direct character attack of the primary (well beyond the tame wine-cave drama) and Sanders just basically stood there and took it, which must have been demoralizing for his supporters. Warren has made up other things in the campaign and yet Sanders just didn\u2019t challenge her veracity on this one at all. Stunning. And then there\u2019s the overall lack of any meaningful challenge to Joe Biden, the national front runner. Sanders challenged him a little bit on foreign policy to open the debate but that too was fairly tame. The rest of the night people just left him alone, which is nuts when you consider that for any of the rest of these candidates to win they have to defeat Biden! So, my takeaway is  \u2013 why do the Democrats just stand there and let things happen to themselves. Biden is ahead nationally, and nobody did anything to stop him. Warren is effectively calling Sanders a backwoods misogynist and he slinked off into a corner. How do these folks hope to get the nomination or win the White House in such a pitiful crouch?

The dystopian show \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d depicts two parallel universes: one in which the Germans and Japanese won World War II, and one where the Allies did.  The main characters bounce between these two polar opposite realities.  The effect can be dizzying, and yet also clarifying. Tonight\u2019s Democratic debate showed leadership as opposite from Donald Trump as those two fictionalized worlds.  Where Trump is corrupt, the Democrats spoke of reform.  Where Trump is self-centered, Democrats dared to care for kids and the poor and the working class.  Where Trump is a bully, Democrats were empathetic.  Where Trump is a serial liar, the Democrats stuck to the facts. I think Democrats, especially in Iowa, will love it.  Iowans, God love \u2018em, hate negative campaigning.  That\u2019s why negative ads in the 2020 Democratic Caucus campaign are about as common as synchronized swimmers in a Sioux County cornfield.  Perhaps that\u2019s why, in the all-important first half-hour of the CNN/Des Moines Register debate the candidates beat their swords into ploughshares. The days before the debate featured supporters of Bernie Sanders attacking Elizabeth Warren, with Warren countering that Sanders made a sexist statement in a private meeting over a year ago.  But when the red light came on in Des Moines, they were both on their best behavior. It helped that moderator Wolf Blitzer opened the debate on the biggest question of all: \u201cWhy are you best prepared \u2014 the best prepared person on this stage to be commander in chief?\u201d Joe Biden owned his disastrous 2002 vote for the Bush war in Iraq.   Bernie Sanders chided him for it, but didn\u2019t draw blood, allowing Biden to deftly shift attention to his partnership with President Barack Obama.   Pete Buttigieg noted that some of the enlisted troops he served with in Afghanistan are so young they cannot remember when the war began. Elizabeth Warren gave half of a great answer, excoriating generals who say \u201cwe\u2019ve turned the corner so many times that we\u2019re going in circles.\u201d But she also weirdly shoehorned in an attack on \u201cgiant financial institutions.\u201d   Amy Klobuchar was the only one who truly took the fight to Trump, demonstrating impressive expertise on military affairs, and heart-rending empathy on trade. Tom Steyer came to life when he spoke about climate change.  The question was about trade, but unlike Warren, who seemed to be reaching to include Wall Street in her national security answer, Steyer seamlessly and personally made an appeal to put climate at the heart of any future trade deal. Yes, there were not a lot of punches thrown.  But the dustbin of the 2020 campaign is filled with politicians who used their debate moments to attack.  From Kirsten Gillibrand attacking Joe Biden for an op-ed he published decades ago to Kamala Harris hammering Biden on busing, to Julian Castro cheaply (and dishonestly) accusing Biden of not remembering what he\u2019d said two minutes before.  All three dropped out before the first vote has even been cast. Perhaps Elizabeth Warren pulled back from her attack on Sanders because when she attacked Buttigieg in the last debate she gained nothing; in fact she stalled.  In fact, Joe Biden had perhaps his best moment when, after noting that Donald Trump is viciously attacking \u201cmy surviving son,\u201d he said it was his job to not only fight but also heal.\u201d Beautiful. The race is extremely fluid.  All four of the top candidates: Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg, have at one point led in the Iowa polls.  I did not see anyone break out in the debate.  The candidates will have to win the old-fashioned way: door to door, farm to farm, town hall to town hall.  That is a far better strategy than seeking a knockout in a debate. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. Fewer than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Elizabeth Warren is currently sitting in 4th place if you average the last three polls out of Iowa. In a state where the old political adage is that there are only three tickets out of Iowa, fourth place is not where any candidate wants to be. Tonight\u2019s debate was one of the last opportunities Warren had to make her case to Iowa voters. So the question isn\u2019t whether she had a good night. She unquestionably did. The question is whether she had the type of great performance that moves Iowans to change their votes from Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders or Pete Buttigieg. In the last few days, the Warren campaign found itself in a back and forth with the Bernie team over his volunteer phone call talking points and what he allegedly said at a meeting over a year ago. It guaranteed her a question at the debate on whether a woman could be elected president. As expected, she was well prepared and gave a smart answer that promoted her candidacy without attacking Sanders. But did anyone change their vote from Sanders to Warren as a result? Unlikely. And if not, it was a missed opportunity for her to make the case that Bernie Sanders is the wrong candidate from the progressive wing to expand the Democratic Party\u2019s double-digit lead with female voters. And there may not be many more opportunities coming her way before February 3rd. Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst. She has worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and is an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School. Now that the field of presidential candidates is shrinking, the dynamics of the race are coming into clearer focus. And one thing was clear from debate in Des Moines: diversity matters. With Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Kamala Harris out of the race \u2013 and Andrew Yang off the debate stage \u2013 there was little to no substantive discussion on issues like immigration, voting rights, the Trump administration\u2019s neglect of Puerto Rico and criminal justice reform.  Instead, we had perfunctory mentions of \u201cblack and brown people\u201d throughout the evening. This is a problem when 40% of Democratic voters are people of color.  These constituencies will be vital to whomever becomes the nominee, and the candidates should not have depended on the moderators to bring such topics up; they should have been proactive in doing so themselves. One revealing moment came when Pete Buttigieg was questioned about his lack of support among African American voters. \u201cThe black voters who know me best are supporting me,\u201d he said. He went on to mention that he is supported by black elected leaders in Iowa.  His answer came off as a nice way of saying, in effect, that he has black friends.  It was inadequate and somewhat tone-deaf. Buttigieg also name-checked justice in policing, which might not have been the smartest move given that he has faced controversy for his handling of a police shooting that inflamed racial tensions in his hometown of South Bend, Indiana.  By now, Buttigieg should have developed a more nuanced answer to explain his lack of minority support. That said, overall, virtually all of the candidates (including Buttigieg) acquitted themselves well during the debate. If no one had a breakout moment, no one had an embarrassing moment either. However, Tom Steyer stood out on the stage for the wrong reasons. Addressing the camera directly was a mistake, as it made it seem as if he were ignoring the moderators, audience, and fellow candidates.  Though he repeatedly touted his business experience, he did not make a strong case for himself as a presidential candidate. A billionaire talking about income inequality is a hard sell, and Steyer certainly did not close the deal. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors.

Amy Klobuchar made the most authentic appeal to the Hawkeye State. She spoke of names, places and faces that are impacted by current policies and how she plans to course correct if elected president. Iowa is an agriculture state that relies on sales of soybeans, pork and corn. These people are keenly aware of the benefits to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal. Bernie Sanders was not wise to criticize the deal; other candidates acknowledged the USMCA has brought about about improvements. Former President Vice President did his best to rise above the field and take it directly to President Trump. Biden made his closing call to caucus, claiming \u201cAmerica\u2019s character is on the ballot.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren danced around a question about reporting that Bernie Sanders allegedly told her last year that a woman could not be elected president. If nothing else, her response did get Sanders off message for a while. But despite the focus on Iowa, for the first time in the 2020 primary, foreign policy took center stage. Each candidate criticized President Donald Trump for not having authorization to attack Iran and outlined their general plans for withdrawing troops from Iran.  Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg touted his military experience, compared to President Trumps draft  deferments, to make the case he is prepared to take on the president on the issue. Mark my words: Iowa voters were taking close notes of the candidates on the debate stage. Now they will check the Des Moines Register for the next chance to press the flesh in person. They will window shop until the doors close on caucus night. Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator, resident fellow at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy Institute of Politics and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. Foreign policy had been, so far, almost absent from the Democratic debates, but the targeted killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani, ordered by President Donald, put foreign policy firmly in play on the Des Moines debate stage Tuesday. And there was a fair amount of consensus among the candidates that now is the time to end America\u2019s longest war in Afghanistan. Sen. Bernie Sanders said that Americans are sick of \u201cendless wars.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren observed that she sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and that American generals had repeatedly come before the committee to assert that the United States had turned a corner in Afghanistan. Warren wryly observed that in Afghanistan, we have \u201cturned a corner so often we are turning in circles.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden was the only candidate on the debate stage who has been in a position of power to weigh in on the Afghan War issue\u2014he was an important voice in President Barack Obama\u2019s war cabinet early in Obama\u2019s first term in 2009. At that time, Obama was considering whether to \u201csurge\u201d tens of thousands more US troops into Afghanistan. A decade ago, Biden advocated not for a surge of conventional military troops but rather for a relatively limited American presence in Afghanistan focused on counter-terrorism missions led by US Special Forces. Biden lost that debate, and in the end,  Obama opted for a surge of conventional forces. On Tuesday night, Biden offered a more nuanced take than the other candidates on the stage, arguing that \u201cwe can\u2019t just walk way completely\u201d from Afghanistan and that there is a big difference between having \u201ccombat troops\u201d in a country such as Afghanistan and maintaining a residual force of US Special Forces to advise and assist local forces. When it came to the Afghan War, Biden offered a more nuanced position\u2013 indeed, a more presidential position\u2013 than the other Democratic candidates.  He made the case that just pulling the plug on Afghanistan would not be smart and that there is a big difference between an \u201cendless war\u201d and maintaining a persistent presence in a country like Afghanistan to prevent the country being taken over by the Taliban, which would benefit jihadist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS. With this argument, Biden established himself as more credible as a potential commander in chief than his rivals on Tuesday\u2019s debate stage.

His new book is \u201cTrump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\u201d Capping off the best performance of the evening, Elizabeth Warren got the most of Bernie Sanders in a much-awaited exchange over comments he allegedly made to her once doubting whether a woman could be elected president. But this might not move the needle much: Sanders is not actually the frontrunner, Warren is going to need his supporters down the road, and negative campaigning could always backfire. But that issue doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 nor do the candidates\u2019 views on anything else, if Americans aren\u2019t allowed to vote. Our beautiful democracy only works when all eligible voters can fully participate. But even in 2020 the country continues to be plagued by sustained attacks on Americans\u2019 right to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of citizenship. Even still, in Tuesday\u2019s debate, there wasn\u2019t a single question asked about the candidates\u2019 views on how to combat voter suppression. Some quick history \u2013 in 2013, the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder made it infinitely easier for states and localities to revert to the discriminatory policies that have haunted the United States for all of its history. For instance, in just 2016,14 states put in place new, restrictive voting laws for the first time. And according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, 1,688 polling places have been closed in formerly covered states since the Shelby County decision.  The candidates need to be talking about this. We all remember reading in high school history about the literacy tests and poll taxes that prevented blacks from voting in the Jim Crow South. The tactics have only gotten more sophisticated.This has not been an accident. Voter suppression works, and it is most successful at hampering the votes of vulnerable groups in society, namely people of color, the elderly, students, and the disabled. To be clear, this issue is not about what\u2019s best for Democrats or Republicans. It is about which mortal sins we will continue to allow to fester in our country. The very integrity of the election depends on it. It\u2019s time to hear what the candidates plan on doing. Elliot Williams (@elliotcwilliams) is a CNN legal analyst. A principal at The Raben Group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm, he was formerly a deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and an assistant director at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the Obama administration. Two important things happened in this debate, and both work in favor of Sen. Amy Klobuchar. The first was a much-needed discussion about women in the 2020 election; the second was a winning performance for moderates over progressives, accentuated by the rift between progressive Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. It was that scuffle between Warren and Sanders, who had entered the election with something of a non-aggression pact, that opened the door to a salutary airing of the subject of \u201celectability,\u201d a sexist prejudice disguised as strategy. When confronted with the claim that Sanders told Warren that a women could not win, Sanders denied it, arguing that he has always believed in women. But Warren rejected Sanders\u2019 denial, and grasped the electability matter with both hands, demanding to talk about the elephant in the Democratic primary living room, the claim that a woman can\u2019t win in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s time to attack it head-on,\u201d she said, brandishing a memorable and devastatingly effective fact. \u201cLook at the men on this stage: Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are women.\u201d That helps Warren against the men, but it does nothing to help her against Klobuchar, who underscored the impressive fact that, \u201cI have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of districts,\u201d in urban, suburban and rural areas. That argument also undercuts former Vice President Joe Biden, who is marketing himself as the most capable among the candidates to win with Republicans and independents disenchanted with Trump. Booker exit spotlights a white debate stage Biden was an evanescent presence on the stage. He has come a long way from his early performances. He was solid, showed confidence and made some good points. Most of all, he made no big mistakes. But no one would accuse him of giving a rousing performance. As the candidate leading in the national polls, Biden didn\u2019t need to win. He only needed to hold his own, to keep from losing ground, and he did that. The moderates: Biden, Klobuchar and Pete Buttiegieg \u2013 always polished and impressive \u2013 came across as much more reasonable, knowledgeable and able to make things happen in Washington and on the global stage. Their responses on foreign policy \u2013 Iran, troop deployments, North Korea \u2013 and trade sounded like the kind that win elections. Moderates beat progressives. Women made gains. In that Venn diagram, only one of the candidates stands at the intersection of both categories. That is Amy Klobuchar. Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. Follow her on Twitter @fridaghitis. Senator Amy Klobuchar won the debate, if we define winning as making a more clear, confident, sustained case than we\u2019ve seen before. \u201cI have won every race, every place every time,\u201d she said, emphasizing that she has won conservative and pro-Republican districts in the Midwest. It was a direct pitch to Democrats who tell pollsters their main desire is to pick a nominee who can defeat President Trump. Nowhere was her performance more clear and cutting than in the extended colloquy about health care. After Senator Bernie Sanders described his Medicare-for-All plan, Klobuchar said she was offering something better: \u201ca plan, and not a pipe dream.\u201d She also told Senator Elizabeth Warren that Warren had supported a bill that would have kicked 149 million Americans off their existing insurance plans. Of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s plans on Medicare and negotiating drug prices, she said, \u201cI actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 cosponsors. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can\u2019t negotiate for better prices [for drugs] for our seniors.\u201d She also pointedly warned against supporting progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, telling voters to avoid candidates promising \u201cgrand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day.\u201d Democrats looking for a practical, moderate challenger to President Trump will likely give the Minnesota senator a second look in the final days before the Iowa caucuses.  For a candidate trying to break into the top tier, that\u2019s a win. Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. After six Democratic debates in which foreign policy and national security received short shrift, I was really looking forward to a robust discussion during the seventh, especially given the real time crisis with Iran. I should have known better. There was too little discussion of the current crisis with Iran and too little about each candidate\u2019s conception of America\u2019s role in world. Here are my depressing and sobering takeaways. Biden\u2019s missed opportunity. He came close to articulating a strategy on North Korea. But the former Vice President missed a huge opportunity to demonstrate his experience, authority and clarity on foreign policy or why he was best credentialed to serve as commander-in-chief. It was the height of irony that the first candidate to even refer to the notion of an overall strategy was Tom Steyer \u2013 the guy with the least foreign policy experience. No coherent vision. Given the extent of Donald Trump\u2019s diplomatic malpractice, a huge opportunity opened up for any of the candidates to lay out a coherent vision and role for America in the world \u2013 simply and clearly. And each candidate was offered at least two chances to do it. None did.  What they did offer up \u2013 using more diplomacy; working with allies; getting out of endless wars \u2013 represented slogans and bumper stickers and offered not a single idea of substance on how they would approach these issues or the  other serious challenges America confronts. Withdrawal of US forces Fearful of alienating the party\u2019s progressive base, when asked about withdrawal of US forces, all six candidates expressed in varying degrees the need to withdraw US combat forces either totally (Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or partially (Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar). No distinction was made between defensive and offensive deployments or training missions. And, sadly, no candidate even bothered to identify US interests in the Middle East \u2013 the first step toward crafting policies to protect and advance them. Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of \u201cThe End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\u201d Miller was a State Department Middle East analyst negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. One thing\u2019s for sure, every candidate on the debate stage tonight would make a far better president than Donald Trump, who is more concerned with promoting his own interests above the country\u2019s. But it\u2019s still unclear which of them is poised to be the Democratic nominee. After seven debates, the primary race is predictably split along ideological lines with progressives pushing for deep structural change and moderates preaching pragmatism. No winner emerged largely because the conversations were redundant, a parroting of the same talking points \u2013 \u201cwe must stomp out corporate corruption\u201d, \u201cwe should build upon Obamacare,  not scrap it\u201d \u2013 and the same issues \u2013 health care, political experience, corporate responsibility, etc. that dominate each debate. Missing from the conversation are a range of issues that would more fully showcase each candidate\u2019s point of view and speak to the hearts and interests of the Democratic base. I put out a quick Twitter poll and found that voters want to hear more about: voting rights; election protection; criminal justice reform; immigration and family separation; the future of work; curbing the rise of white nationalist terrorism; women\u2019s rights and reproductive health; gun control; federal courts; education equity; eliminating the electoral college; poverty and Income inequality; veterans issues; affordable housing; addressing police brutality; disability rights; LGBTQ rights \u2013 and the list goes on. More of the same will not motivate or mobilize Democratic voters and that\u2019s true for the topics at these debates as well.

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. As a party loyalist, as opposed to someone supporting an individual candidate, the most important thing to me is nominating a candidate who can win in the general election. And a key component of that goal is making sure your party\u2019s nominee is fully vetted and scrutinized before they win the nomination, not after. There are several reasons for this.   First, you want to make sure the nominee can take a punch, because once the opposing party gets involved, you can be sure these will be delivered aggressively.  Second, and as important, you want to fully air all controversial statements, votes and other activities before the general election, so that your nominee can legitimately claim these issues are old news and have been addressed.  There is nothing more dangerous than having a new issue raised by your general election opponent at a key moment in the race. Thus, while it may seem counter-intuitive, I want all the primary candidates to scrutinize their opponents, attack their records and have full coverage of it in the media.  These  scrutiny stories need three elements \u2013 good opposition research, an enterprising reporter and another candidate willing to make the case in public for the relevance of the information. In the race for the Democratic nomination, the process has worked fairly well.  Opposition researchers, reporters and other candidates have made strong cases raising questions about the records of former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.   With differing degrees of success, each of these candidates has been forced to deal with their own political vulnerabilities.  At a minimum, most of what President Donald Trump will attack them on has already been litigated in the primary run. The exception to this rule, and a worry to many Democrats, has been the relatively lax scrutiny of Senator Bernie Sanders. Why Bernie Sanders is wrong about women To be sure, Sanders\u2019 signature idea \u2013 Medicare for All \u2013 has been dissected and debated. And the staggering total cost and severe political liabilities of Sanders\u2019 full agenda is now beginning to be examined, as my CNN colleague Ronald Brownstein wrote recently. However, there has been far too little discussion of Sanders\u2019 50-year record, nor have we seen a real view of how he would defend that record against a Republican onslaught. He\u2019s been lucky to avoid such an inquiry, because, for whatever reason, the media has discounted his ability to win the nomination.  Press scrutiny moves on a sliding scale \u2013 the closer you get to the nomination, the more intense the spotlight becomes.  And opponents of Sanders have been reluctant to take him on given the intensity of support from his voters and their knowledge of how important those voters will be in the fall. The result is that one of the leading candidates for the nomination has largely escaped the kind of scrutiny his opponents have been put through and that should worry every Democrat.  His vulnerabilities, like the rest of the candidates, should be tested before Democrats gather in Milwaukee later this summer. So, what might that look like? Though Trump would have an army of researchers digging into his past in courthouses and video archives, a  few Google searches reveal a vast trove of controversial information that I\u2019m confident is unknown to most Democratic primary voters. Even if none of these are themselves politically fatal, the totality would seem to offer the Trump campaign an enormous set of targets. Politicians are missing the big point on heath care Let\u2019s start with what he calls himself (and the label Trump tries to stick to every Democrat): a socialist. There\u2019s no ducking this one \u2013 Bernie has said a lot over the years, and a lot of it on camera.  The Associated Press reports that in a 1983 reelection debate he said, \u201cI am a socialist, of course, I am a socialist.\u201d  The Washington Examiner reported last year that in 1980 and 1984, Sanders campaigned for the Socialist Workers Party. The report said that Sanders \u201cproudly endorsed and supported\u201d  the Marxist group\u2019s presidential candidate,  Andrew Pulley, in 1980. According to the report, in a press release, Sanders said, \u201cI fully support the SWP\u2019s continued defense of the Cuban revolution.\u201d Sanders\u2019 support for Fidel Castro came up during a 2016 presidential debate when Hillary Clinton questioned him about remarks he made in a 1984 video in which he said, \u201cEverybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world\u2026They forgot that he educated \u2026kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\u201d Although Sanders agreed that Cuba was undemocratic and authoritarian, he seemed to refuse to take back his comments. The 1984 video and his refusal to disavow his comments could be a vulnerability for Sanders in 2020. In the 1970\u2019s, Sanders called for the abolition of the CIA, reducing the military, and returning to local militias, and the Coast Guard, to defend the homeland. Once in Congress, he called for spending cuts of 50% in the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Sanders has also made statements that will cause problems with key Democratic constituencies.  The allegations of sexual harassment by members of his 2016 campaign team  were covered (Sanders said he didn\u2019t know about the allegations during his campaign but apologized), but  little attention was paid to an article he wrote in 1969, exploring studies on stress and wondering if there could be a link between what parents taught their daughters about sexual mores and their child\u2019s likelihood of developing breast cancer.  In 2011, he suggested several times that there would be value  in a primary campaign against Barack Obama, one of the most revered figures in the Democratic Party. And in 2018, on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Sanders went to Jackson, Mississippi, and trashed the party and its first African American president. Speaking to a mostly black crowd, Sanders said, \u201cThe business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure \u2026 People sometimes don\u2019t see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy.\u201d It\u2019s well-known that Sanders has flipped his position on guns. He now says he supports gun safety, but in Congress, he initially voted against the Brady Bill, which requires prospective handgun buyers to wait up to five business days while a background check is conducted before completing a purchase, and later supported legislation immunizing the gun industry from several types of lawsuits. Few are aware that before he got to Congress, he was even more radical. In 1972, he backed a political platform\u2019s call for the abolition of all laws that interfere with the constitutional right of citizens to bear arms. I\u2019ve seen this kind of thing before. To depress turnout, the Trump campaign will micro-target this information to the constituencies who would be most repelled by them. And Russian operatives won\u2019t need to talk to Julian Assange or English spies to get this material; they\u2019ll just need a dial-up modem. Debates give us some insight into how Senator Sanders responds when he\u2019s on the defensive.  But the issues go well beyond what he may have told Senator Warren in a private meeting.  He has a long record, and just like all the other candidates, will need to defend it sooner or later.  For Democrats, sooner is a must option as we try to rationally pick our strongest nominee to defeat Donald Trump.",
