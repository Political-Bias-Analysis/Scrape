            "article_content": "Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Brock Turner to six months in jail, sex offender registration Panel reviewed thousands of complaints against Persky over sentence Judicial commission closes investigation without discipline The California judge in the Brock Turner sexual assault trial did not abuse his authority or show bias when he sentenced the former Stanford University student to six months in jail, an independent commission concluded. Santa Clara Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky\u2019s sentence, handed down on June 2, was widely criticized as too lenient, drawing significant public outcry and media coverage. It led to a new sentencing law, a hard alcohol ban at Stanford and an effort to remove Persky from the bench through a recall election. The Commission on Judicial Performance, an independent state agency, reviewed thousands of complaints to determine if Persky\u2019s actions amounted to judicial misconduct. The investigation could have led to sanctions or dismissal but it had no bearing on the sentence. \u201cThe commission has concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence of bias, abuse of authority, or other basis to conclude that Judge Persky engaged in judicial misconduct warranting discipline,\u201d the commission said. \u201cAccordingly, the participating commission members voted unanimously to close, without discipline, its preliminary investigation of the complaints against the judge regarding his sentencing decision in the Turner case.\u201d Mad about Brock Turner's sentence? It's not uncommon The complaints against Persky focused on five themes, the commission said: \u2022 Persky abused his authority and displayed bias in his sentencing. \u2022 The sentence was unlawful. \u2022 Persky\u2019s sentence displayed gender bias and failed to take sexual assault of women seriously. \u2022 Persky exhibited racial and/or socioeconomic bias because a nonwhite or less privileged defendant would have received a harsher sentence. \u2022 The judge\u2019s history as a student athlete at Stanford University caused him to be biased in favor of Turner and he should have disclosed his Stanford affiliation. However, the commission concluded the sentence was within the parameters set by law. Additionally, Persky followed the recommendation of the probation report and performed a balancing assessment of accounts from the victim and the defendant, the commission said. Persky read the assessment aloud at the sentencing hearing. He noted that Turner\u2019s age, 18 at the time of the assault, and lack of criminal record weighed in favor of probation over prison. The panel agreed, pointing out that under state law a judge is required to consider such factors when determining if prison or probation is appropriate. Woman in Brock Turner case has her say Persky was criticized for suggesting that Turner\u2019s level of intoxication served as a mitigating factor. The commission said that question had greater bearing on the sentence itself and would be better addressed on appeal. Otherwise, Persky\u2019s reliance on that factor did not rise to the level of judicial misconduct because it did not clearly show abuse of authority or disregard of the law or for fundamental human rights. Members of the public pointed to sentencing outcomes in other cases Persky handled as evidence of a pattern of bias. The commission said those cases did not support a finding of bias, either because Persky was not involved in the sentencing, or because the outcome came from a plea deal or the probation department\u2019s recommendation. Finally, the commission said Persky\u2019s association with Stanford University was insufficient to require disclosure or disqualification. The brevity of the sentence triggered outrage against Persky and conversation about how the justice system treats sexual assault survivors. Turner was released in September after serving three months under a state law intended to reduce overcrowding. He also must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. A target for much of the outrage, Persky recused himself from a child pornography case and stepped down from the criminal court in September. The campaign to recall him continues. \u201cWe will continue to proceed with the recall election as it is important for Santa Clara County voters to decide whether Judge Persky should remain on the bench,\u201d Michele Dauber, chairwoman of the Recall Persky Campaign, said in a statement. She disputed the commission\u2019s finding that Persky followed a probation recommendation in some cases. Otherwise, she said the decision shows that a recall election will be the most effective means of seeking Persky\u2019s removal. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the commission\u2019s conclusion on judicial bias and we believe that Judge Persky has in fact demonstrated a clear pattern of bias in cases of sex crimes and violence against women,\u201d Daubert said. \u201cUnder the California Constitution, Judge Persky is an elected official and voters have the right to decide whether he should continue to serve on the bench for the next six years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The 2016 election has put Muslims at the center of the American political debate. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has spent the past week engaged in an argument with the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed while serving in the Iraq War. The clash began when the parents, Khizr and Ghazala, condemned Trump at the Democratic National Convention for his call for a ban on Muslim foreigners entering the United States. The call was one of several controversial statements on Muslims the GOP candidate has made during the race, which have also including floating the idea of creating a registry for Muslim Americans, monitoring US mosques and questioning the impartiality of Muslim judges. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has called America\u2019s inclusion of people of different faiths and religions a cornerstone of the country\u2019s values and explicitly welcomed Muslim supporters. Numbering about 3.3 million, American Muslims make up just 1% of the US population, according to the Pew Research Center. That figure is projected to double by 2050, surpassing many other religious minorities, including Jews, Hindus and Sikhs. Though cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles host sizable Muslim communities, the population is spread all across the country. American Muslims are also quite diverse, with 38% of them white, 28% black, 28% Asian and 4% Latino. They are also a younger demographic group than their Christian or Jewish peers. And a Pew socioeconomic survey in 2007 called American Muslims \u201cmiddle class and mostly mainstream.\u201d Politically, however, they are overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2011, Pew found that 70% identify as Democrats with just 11% identifying as Republicans and 19% describing themselves as independent. A very large majority opposes terrorism, with Pew in 2013 finding that 81% feel that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are never justified. So how do the comments made during the course of the campaign strike the ears of Muslim voters who will head to the polls in November? How do they perceive US society and their place in the political system? What are their experiences of America? To answer some of these questions, CNN profiled five American Muslims from different walks of life in and around the nation\u2019s capital. They expressed anxiety, frustration, pain \u2013 but also hope. NAME: Talib Shareef AGE: 54 OCCUPATION: Imam, Masjid Muhammad Mosque in Washington, D.C. BIRTHPLACE: New York City When Imam Talib Shareef started his military career 35 years ago in intelligence, there was no chaplain, no mosque, no pause for Friday prayers and no break from rigorous training even during the month of fasting for Ramadan for the Muslims serving in the US military. At the time, it was a challenge for him to balance his religious observance and his professional duties. He recalled, \u201cWe did not have any mosques or musallah (prayer rugs) at the base. Now they are all over America.\u201d He added, \u201cSome of the Muslims changed their identity in the military system because they could not deal with disparaging comments.\u201d But that\u2019s in the past, as the military began to make accommodations for Muslim service members in the 1990s. Now, five of his six sons are serving in the military, and he said they feel at ease with the accommodations offered to Muslims. Shareef, who has retired from the US Air Force, was recently appointed an imam, or chief cleric, of the Masjid Muhammad Mosque, also called The Nation\u2019s Mosque because of its 80-year history at the heart of Washington. The section of street where the mosque is located is ceremonially designated as \u201cIslamic Way.\u201d In February, former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders delivered a speech at the mosque. The imam praised him for his efforts to \u201cspeak out against religious bigotry\u201d and bridge the growing gulf between the Muslim community and other Americans. While in the military, Shareef took part in six military campaigns, including the Gulf War in 1991 and the war in Afghanistan in 2001. He said he saw no conflict between his Muslim identity and his role as a serviceman. In response to Trump\u2019s statements on establishing a registry of American Muslims, Shareef said his military record speaks volumes about his allegiance to his country. \u201cI was one of many who put their lives on the line for many years for the country \u2013 I was protecting his (Trump\u2019s) life. I don\u2019t see in his history that he took that kind of stand for his country he wants to be commander in chief of,\u201d he said. In the wake of the San Bernardino, California, terror attack by an American Muslim and increasing fears of radicalization, the imam said the best course to contain this menace is more community engagement by Muslims instead of isolating themselves because of the incitement of a handful of people. \u201cWe engage with the community because we are part of the community. That\u2019s what Muslims can do: see themselves as a part\u201d of it, he said. \u201cWe can begin to stop this radicalization.\u201d NAME: Remaz Abdelgader AGE: 22 OCCUPATION: Recent graduate of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia BIRTHPLACE: Sudan During a town hall at George Mason University in Northern Virginia last fall, Sanders hugged an American Muslim student after she asked him a personal and an emotional question: How would he address the issue of racism and discrimination against minorities as president? Those moments captured the anxiety and pain Remaz Abdelgader has felt in an election year marked by rhetoric about Islam. To her, Sanders sounded authentic rather than being consoling merely for the sake of a sound bite. \u201cIt has been tremendous to just hear that kind of support,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a black, I\u2019m a Muslim and I\u2019m a woman. To be those three identities is very dangerous because everyday you are facing new battles,\u201d the George Mason senior said. In high school, she related, a man called her an \u201cIraqi bitch\u201d while nearly running her over. Abdelgader, who immigrated from Sudan when she was 6 years old, managed to escape any serious physical injury but long remained scathed by her memories of the event. After hearing Sanders answer her question, she began to campaign for the Vermont senator, saying he had given her a renewed sense of hope and promise in America. \u201cI don\u2019t really know home other than America,\u201d said Abdelgader, who aspires to be a human rights lawyer. Her involvement in the campaign provided her a rare chance to interact with people of diverse communities at the campaign\u2019s watch parties. For the first time, she started working closely with Jews and other groups. The exchange between Sanders \u2013 who responded to her question by noting that he is Jewish and his father\u2019s family died in Nazi concentration camps \u2013 and Abdelgader went viral with more than 130,000 views. She believes the exchange also underlines symbolic unity of Muslims and Jews and the need to build bridges to eradicate racism. Sanders, she said, \u201cis the epitome of what society needs to be. It does not matter if you are a Christian. It does not matter if you are Jewish, white, black, poor, rich. It\u2019s unity. We need that unity. We have moved from the word \u2018race.\u2019\u201d NAME: Colin Christopher OCCUPATION: Deputy Director of Government Affairs, Dar al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia AGE: 32 BIRTHPLACE: Madison, Wisconsin Some of Colin Christopher\u2019s own friends and family members grew uncomfortable when they found out about his conversion to Islam six years ago. And on the street, he at times feels the tension in the atmosphere when he is seen in public with his wife of Bangladeshi origin, whose head covering makes apparent their identity as a Muslim couple. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out in public (alone), I\u2019m at the top of the food chain. But when I\u2019m with my wife who wears (a) hijab, it\u2019s a totally different game,\u201d said the 32-year-old Wisconsin native. \u201cEspecially if we are in an all-white neighborhood, there is usually a tension in the air.\u201d Christopher said that the example of the Prophet Mohammad\u2019s love for all people and Islam\u2019s focus on service and charity prompted him to become a Muslim. And his desire to live out his faith in practice led him to become the deputy director of government affairs at the Dar al-Hijrah Mosque in Falls Church, Virginia, in 2015. In that role, he applies Islam\u2019s teachings on justice and equality to work with interfaith partners on gun violence prevention, affordable housing, environmental justice and other policies. Dar al-Hijrah Mosque has been labeled the \u201c9/11 mosque\u201d by critics because two of the 19 hijackers had stopped by the mosque to attend Friday services just before executing the terror plot in New York. And from 2001-2002, Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim who went on to serve as a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was an imam at the mosque. The 9/11 Commission explored how much he influenced the two hijackers directly. He was later killed in a US drone strike in Yemen. The mosque has also faced allegations of raising money for Islamic extremists such as Hamas. Christopher responded that the allegations have never been substantiated. \u201cIf, in an official capacity, the mosque raised funds for Hamas, this mosque would no longer exist,\u201d he said. After the ISIS-directed terror attacks in Paris in November, the mosque became a subject of hate crimes. Christopher blames the election-year rhetoric for a toxic atmosphere that encourages the incidents, such as a hoax explosive device at the mosque late last year. He blamed Trump and like-minded figures for creating \u201cthis dangerous atmosphere with their inflammatory and ignorant statements,\u201d which he warned have \u201crepercussions beyond the Muslim community.\u201d Christopher has also faced frequent security screenings at the airport, adding to his frustration: \u201cI\u2019m often flagged by the Transportation Security Administration because I have traveled to Pakistan a few times for vacation and to visit friends and because I\u2019m sure the government knows I\u2019m a Muslim. It is obnoxious and it really upsets me sometimes. It\u2019s like I\u2019m assumed guilty until proven innocent.\u201d Asked about the links his mosque has to 9/11 and the accusations leveled at it, he said that two of the hijackers happened to be there, as they may have been traveling, but that they were not part of the community and their presence was mere chance. On terrorism more broadly, he responded, \u201cWhy are Muslims the only group that are required to apologize for and condemn the actions of criminals that associate with their group?\u201d He added, \u201cYou must understand that by asking me whether I condemn terrorism, you are questioning my humanity.\u201d Still, Christopher hopes for a future when Muslims can pass out literature about their faith without provoking anger from others on the street. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time before someone handing out material about Islam on this sidewalk is seen in the same way as the believers of other faith traditions,\u201d he said. NAME: Noor Wazwaz AGE: 24 OCCUPATION: Producer, National Public Radio in Washington, D.C. BIRTHPLACE: Chicago \u201cPeople ask me if I go to sleep with my hijab. Do I shower in it? Are men in my religion controlling? If I\u2019m upset about terrorist attacks that are happening? How do I feel about 9/11?\u201d These are some of the questions Noor Wazwaz has heard from her fellow Americans, who are curious about her outlook and religion. Very few of them know that the hijab can be a fashion statement alongside a religious obligation, for instance. \u201cI have so many hijabs \u2013 I have a closet with my hijabs, so many different colors \u2013 you have to match, obviously, all kinds of patterns and colors,\u201d she said. At 24, Wazwaz is beginning her career as a producer at NPR in DC. One day she aspires to be an on-camera reporter, but it is a dream that she worries might be harder to achieve as a Muslim woman who covers her head. In her broadcast journalism class at Northwestern University in Chicago, students were given the opportunity to produce a live shot to be aired on one of the local PBS affiliates. \u201cThe producer told my professor he didn\u2019t want me to participate because my hijab was a \u2018distraction,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cAfter multiple conversations, he let me do it.\u201d Like many other American Muslims, Wazwaz was confronted with two different cultures and lifestyles: American at school and Arab Palestinian at home. \u201cWhen I was in college, I did go through an identity crisis,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cI didn\u2019t wear my hijab. I didn\u2019t want to. I wanted to go party and do whatever my friends were doing.\u201d Now she no longer sees a contradiction between her American and Muslim identities. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have to pick one or the other. That\u2019s what so great about America,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing an American does not mean that you have to drink alcohol or you have to eat pork. America is not telling you (what) you have to do to be an American.\u201d This year, though, the rhetoric and insults about her religion during the presidential campaign has made her feel for the first time that she is less American. \u201cDoes it make me feel like that I don\u2019t belong here? Sometimes yes, because of controversial statements that are coming that say that Muslims don\u2019t belong here,\u201d she said. Wazwaz loves what she does as a producer and hopes to get across this message to all America through her work: \u201cWe are your journalists, we are your police officers, we are your doctors. We have contributed to the society for a very long time.\u201d NAME: Dr. Tariq Shahab AGE: 54 OCCUPATION: Cardiologist in Falls Church, Virginia BIRTHPLACE: Pakistan Tariq Shahab came to the United States from Pakistan 26 years ago to study medicine but chose to stay as he felt America offered him more of he wanted: the best medical education, better economic prospects, religious freedom and, above all, a place to call home. \u201cThere is something about America that keeps you, attracts you and adopts you. We should keep that going. We should not change it. This is not the third world. We should stay the first world,\u201d said Shahab, who was visibly upset about the future of his country in the wake of the rhetoric about Muslims during the campaign. An American Muslim doctor, Shahab has observed the last five presidential elections in the United States but has never been as concerned about the outcome of the race as this time around. \u201cThis is the first time that it\u2019s being felt that, yes, if a certain individual is elected then it would be difficult for the minorities to live in the US,\u201d he said. In Pakistan, Shahab is known as the spouse of famous film actress Reema Khan. But in the United States, his decades of service as a physician is what he\u2019s known for among his patients in the community. As a cardiologist, Shahab said he has warm and trusting bonds with his patients, who come from all walks of American life, including the US military. But he sees that, despite his deep integration into the mainstream, there are American-born Muslims who feel isolated. \u201cWe should try to influence the younger generation if we see this kind of mindset,\u201d he said, appealing to his fellow Muslims. \u201cWe should have someone at the home spot that and intervene before something happens.\u201d This story has been updated to provide further information on Colin Christopher and his mosque.

Was it talking or singing? Right? But the language was so bad,\u201d Trump said Monday during his first of five rallies the day before Election Day. Trump\u2019s apparent criticism of rap and hip-hop comes in spite of the GOP nominee\u2019s repeated attempts to appeal to African-American voters during the final months of his campaign. It also comes as Clinton has ramped up get out the vote efforts in recent days by targeting young and African-American voters in particular. Still, Trump insisted that African-American voters are turning out in droves for him, an assessment contradicted by polls that show Trump with low single-digit support among black voters. And Trump also sought to once again undercut Clinton\u2019s support among the demographic by raising the former first lady\u2019s use of the term \u201csuper predators\u201d to describe criminals in the inner city. \u201cAfrican-Americans are turning out \u2013 and when they do a lot of them are voting for Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got not a lot of inspiration.

You walk to the store for a loaf of bread, you get shot,\u201d Trump said during a rally in Sanford, Florida, last month, repeating a line he has frequently used to describe crime rates in black communities. Trump has also described inner cities as worse than war zones and equated the lives of minorities living in inner cities with members of those communities at large, even though a majority of African-Americans do not live in poverty.",

            "article_content": "The RNC mailer is intended to \"turnout voters\" in 12 states The piece quotes Clinton saying: \"Obamacare is 'a crazy system' Former President Bill Clinton\u2019s description of Obamacare as a \u201ccrazy system\u201d is headed to mail boxes in a dozen key states in a piece of political literature paid for by the Republican National Committee. \u201cBill Clinton finally tells the truth \u2026 and it\u2019s not going to help Hillary,\u201d reads the mailer, which was provided to CNN by the RNC. The RNC\u2019s piece goes on to quote Clinton saying: \u201cObamacare is \u2018a crazy system\u2019 \u2026 where \u2018premiums doubled\u2019 \u2026 and recipients had \u2018their coverage cut in half.\u2019\u201d The RNC mailer is intended to \u201cturnout voters\u201d in 12 states that are vital to Donald Trump\u2019s chances on November 8. The anti-Clinton mailer will go to three states that Mitt Romney carried in 2012 where the GOP finds itself playing defense: Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. It will also go to an additional nine states that President Barack Obama carried in his re-election campaign where Republicans are hoping to make inroads this year: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The RNC moved quickly to get the \u201ccrazy system\u201d remark in a new mailer: Bill Clinton made the remark on Monday \u2013 a mere 72 hours ago \u2013 while campaigning on behalf of his wife in Flint, Michigan. Bill Clinton\u2019s criticism of Obamacare was focused on a specific group of Americans: those who are uninsured and earn too much money to qualify for subsidized coverage. The Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to Americans who earn less than 400% of the poverty line \u2013 that works out to $47,520 for an individual or $97,200 for a family of four. \u201cThe people that are getting killed in this deal are small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies,\u201d Bill Clinton said. To help middle-income workers struggling to afford insurance, Bill Clinton recommended an idea embraced by his wife\u2019s campaign that he first proposed during his 1998 State of the Union address: letting Americans buy into Medicare, the government-run health-insurance program that covers Americans once they reach 65. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was not pleased that the former president\u2019s \u201ccrazy system\u201d remark has provided ammunition to Republicans a month before voters go to the polls. But her aides are quick to point out that the former president was not attempting to condemn the entire Obamacare system, just the ways it has failed certain people. \u201cI probably would have chosen different words,\u201d John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and a former White House chief of staff to Bill Clinton, told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny following the vice presidential debate. \u201cBut I think what he was saying is: the law has been a success, but there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"I will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard,\" Obama said Hillary Clinton lauded Obama and directly took on the birther controversy President Barack Obama delivered an impassioned plea to the African-American community Saturday night to help stop Donald Trump, saying he would consider it a \u201cpersonal insult\u201d to his legacy if black voters didn\u2019t turn out for Hillary Clinton. Addressing the Congressional Black Caucus gala for the last time as president, Obama warned that while his name would not be on the ballot in November, all of the progress that the country has made over the last eight years was on the line. \u201cIf I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn\u2019t matter who we elect \u2013 read up on your history. It matters. We\u2019ve got to get people to vote,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI will consider it a personal insult \u2013 an insult to my legacy \u2013 if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.\u201d Obama\u2019s speech \u2013 coming less than two months away from Election Day \u2013 marked some of his harshest words yet about Trump, as well as his most forceful call on the black community to get behind Clinton. Why Democrats are anxious His remarks also had lighter moments \u2013 particularly as he addressed the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d controversy. The second-term president began his speech by remarking:  \u201cThere\u2019s an extra spring in my step tonight. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole \u2018birther\u2019 thing is over.\u201d Chuckling, the President said, \u201cI mean: ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change \u2013 none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. And to think: that with just a 124 days to go, under the wire, we got that resolved.\u201d Obama was referring to Trump\u2019s admission this week that the president was born in the United States. Trump has long supported the birther theory, raising questions about Obama\u2019s birthplace and demanding that the president present his birth certificate as proof of his origin. Obama\u2019s tone, however, soon turned serious as he outlined what he said was at stake in the election. \u201cYou may have heard Hillary\u2019s opponent in this election say that there\u2019s never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him.\u201d In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as \u201csomebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life.\u201d On Trump\u2019s quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: \u201cWell, we do have challenges, but we\u2019re not stupid.\u201d No, Hillary Clinton did not start the \u2018birther\u2019 movement Speaking moments before the president, Clinton lauded Obama and also took on the birther controversy that has been swirling. \u201cEven when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class, grace and integrity,\u201d said Clinton, who served as Obama\u2019s secretary of state. She added, \u201cMr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you are a great American.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s surreal Friday Clinton, who accepted the group\u2019s \u201cTrailblazer Award\u201d on Saturday night for becoming the first female presidential candidate for a major political party, nodded to Trump when she said that the choice in November \u201cis not about golf course promotions or birth certificates, it comes down to who will fight for the forgotten.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t let Barack Obama\u2019s legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn\u2019t understand that, whose dangerous divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards,\u201d she said, though she never mentioned Trump\u2019s name. Clinton\u2019s campaign is relying on the Obamas to help persuade the coalition of minorities, young people and women who propelled them to the White House to cast ballots for this year\u2019s Democratic candidate. The President made his first solo appeal this week, appearing at a campaign rally in Philadelphia and phoning in to African-American radio to talk up Clinton. \u201cI get frustrated hearing folks say, \u2018You know, we\u2019re so excited with Barack, we love Michelle, they take Hillary for granted,\u2019\u201d Obama told syndicated host Frankie Darcell. \u201cThis is not a reality show. This is not something where it\u2019s all flash and fizzle.\u201d On Friday, First Lady Michelle Obama made her first campaign appearance of 2016, trying to convince  her and her husband\u2019s supporters at a Virginia rally that Clinton is also worthy of their votes. \u201cWhen I hear folks saying they\u2019re not inspired this this election, I disagree. I am inspired,\u201d she said, urging the crowd to register to vote and actually cast ballots for Clinton.",

            "article_content": "Flint has gained national attention over the past year for its drinking water contamination The incident has been seized upon as an example of government mismanagement Donald Trump on Wednesday will visit Flint, Michigan, a campaign official confirmed to CNN. Flint has gained national attention over the past year after cost-cutting measures led to tainted drinking water that contained lead and other toxins. The incident has been seized upon by members of both parties as an example of government mismanagement and America\u2019s aging infrastructure. Critical counties: Genesee, Michigan, and the 2016 election Trump spoke to The Detroit News about the water crisis earlier this month. \u201cI think it\u2019s a horror show that it was allowed to happen, and to be honest with you, it should have never, ever been allowed to happen,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cThat was really the problem.\u201d Throughout most of his campaign, however, the real estate mogul has rarely addressed the crisis or offer his views, including whether Rick Snyder, the state\u2019s Republican governor, should resign amid mounting pressure. When he was asked in January as the crisis gained national media attention about the situation, Trump said he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be commenting.\u201d \u201cWell it\u2019s a shame what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan. A thing like that shouldn\u2019t happen, but again I don\u2019t want to comment on that. They\u2019ve got a very difficult problem,\u201d Trump said then. And in an interview with a local Michigan TV station on the morning of the state\u2019s primary, Trump called it a \u201ccatastrophic event,\u201d but declined to say whether he believed Snyder should resign. More than 40% of Flint\u2019s 98,310 residents live below the poverty line. And more than half are African-American, a historically strong Democratic voting bloc that Trump has recently appealed to on the campaign trail. His visit to Flint will come one day after the airing of an interview he gave with the minister of a predominantly black church he visited in Detroit earlier this month. Flint\u2019s most high profile moment in the 2016 election came in March when the city hosted a debate between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her primary rival, Bernie Sanders. Clinton spoke in Flint earlier this year, arguing that had the water crisis had happened in a rich Detroit suburb, the response would have been faster and more effective. \u201cI think every single American should be outraged,\u201d she said in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care.\u201d Clinton has been criticized, namely by Snyder, for politicizing the water crisis.",

            "article_content": "The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches They selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated The Democratic Party gathered in Philadelphia on Monday for the first night of its convention, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check Team put the speakers\u2019 statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Sanders on party platform opposing Trans-Pacific Partnership By Kate Grise, CNN Sanders touted the compromises made between his camp and Clinton\u2019s in the Democratic Party platform during his speech. \u201cIt (the Democratic Party\u2019s platform) also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d he said. There is no specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the platform. The platform lays out certain standards that Democrats \u201cbelieve must be applied to all trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\u201d These include cracking down on unfair and illegal subsidies from other countries, promoting innovation, keeping the Internet open and free and protecting the environment, food safety and health of American citizens and those in other countries. However, the platform stops short of denouncing the TPP altogether, as Sanders and his supporters were hoping for. As CNN reported earlier this month, the party avoided a potentially embarrassing situation for President Barack Obama, whose administration has spent most of his two terms negotiating the massive 12-nation trade deal, by keeping explicit opposition to the TPP out of the platform. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Sanders on the disappearing middle class By Ali Foreman, CNN Sanders bowed out of his battle with the Democratic National Committee to focus on what he has called \u201cthe war on the middle class.\u201d The former presidential hopeful boiled down the 2016 race, saying, \u201cThis election is about ending the 40-year decline of our middle class, the reality that 47 million men, women and children live in poverty.\u201d Sanders\u2019 claim about the number of Americans living below the poverty line is true. His implication, however, that a shrinking middle class caused that number is misleading. Income gains have caused rippling changes in every economic class. A new Urban Institute Report showed a nation climbing up the economic ladder \u2013 and a lower class that is shrinking. From 1979 to 2014, the middle class has decreased from 38.8% of the population to 32%. The lower middle and lower classes saw similar declines. And while these groups now control significantly less of the country\u2019s income, that doesn\u2019t mean the poor are getting poorer. Instead, previous middle class Americans are moving up the economic chain \u2013 resulting in a thriving upper middle class. It should be noted these results are not surprising, largely because the institute held fixed income ranges needed to be in a class, adjusting only for inflation. At the same time, however, report author Stephen Rose has commented that the standard of living has gone up for nearly all Americans. Multiple-car families are now considerably more common and American homes are growing in square footage. Seeing as middle class Americans aren\u2019t only moving down, but up, Sanders\u2019 claim went sideways. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Sanders on minimum wage By Lisa Rose, CNN Sanders said Trump wants to reduce the minimum wage. \u201cHe does not support raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cWhile Donald Trump believes in huge tax breaks for billionaires, he believes that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.\u201d Trump has not said that the $7.25 minimum wage is too high. In fact, he expressed sympathy for those who are struggling in low-paying jobs. \u201cI have seen what\u2019s going on and I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25,\u201d Trump said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in May. \u201cWith that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude, but I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide.\u201d Sanders isn\u2019t completely off the mark. Trump did make a comment during an autumn debate, \u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world.\u201d The business mogul and McDonald\u2019s devotee later clarified his remark via Twitter. \u201cWages (in our) country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.\u201d Because Trump has said wages should remain the same or go up, we rate Sanders\u2019 claim as false. Editor\u2019s Note: This Reality Check has been updated with additional detail to support our verdict. Reality Check: Trump being \u2018excited\u2019 for 2008 recession By Sonam Vashi, CNN Warren castigated Trump, alleging that he \u201csaid he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap.\u201d In 2007, Trump told the Globe and Mail that he predicted that the housing bubble would burst soon, albeit in a mild version. \u201cPeople have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I\u2019m excited if it is,\u201d he said in that interview. \u201cI\u2019ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\u201d And in a 2006 audiobook from Trump University called \u201cHow to Build a Fortune,\u201d Trump was asked a question about \u201cgloomy predictions that the real estate market is heading for a spectacular crash.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cI sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy.\u201d \u201cIf there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a good cash position \u2013 which I\u2019m in a good cash position today \u2013 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\u201d When Clinton used those comments in an ad in May, Trump defended them, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a businessman, that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do. I feel badly for everybody. What am I going to do? I\u2019m in business.\u201d Trump wasn\u2019t specifically referring to the 2008 financial crash in his remarks, which were made a year or two before the crisis hit. And neither Trump nor many economic experts predicted the severity of the crash or the following recession. For taking Trump\u2019s remarks almost completely out of context, Warren\u2019s claim is false. Reality Check: The achievements of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau By Laura Koran, CNN Warren, a hero to progressives, heralded the achievements of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency tasked with protecting the interests of American consumers that was put into place in 2011 following the financial crisis. \u201cFive years later,\u201d Warren gushed, \u201cthat consumer agency has returned $11 billion dollars to families who were cheated.\u201d Warren isn\u2019t just a fan of the CFPB. As a Harvard professor, author and longtime consumer advocate, she worked with the Obama administration to create it. But has Warren\u2019s brainchild, led by Director Richard Cordray, yielded the returns she claims? The $11 billion figure is seen in CFPB documents and independent reviews. It represents payouts and debt forgiveness the CFPB has secured through various enforcement actions against financial institutions and other organizations. For example, in 2012, they secured an $85 million refund for American Express customers for deceptive practices, including illegal late fees. A review by the University of Utah found 90% of that consumer relief \u201cwas awarded in CFPB cases in which the bank or other financial company illegally deceived consumers,\u201d and 90% \u201cwas awarded in cases where the CFPB collaborated with other state or federal law enforcement partners.\u201d Verdict: True. In fact, the number is slightly higher. And it\u2019s growing along with the agency\u2019s caseload. Reality Check: Obama on White House history By Kate Grise, CNN \u201cI wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves,\u201d the first lady said. Was the White House really built by slaves? In short, yes. According to the White House Historical Association, \u201cThe decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states \u2013 Virginia and Maryland \u2013 ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings.\u201d According to the association, the D.C. commissioners planned to import workers from Europe, but recruitment numbers were low and in the end, most of the laborers that built the White House were African Americans \u2013 both enslaved and free. There are payrolls from the time that show the government itself did not own slaves but paid their masters for the slaves\u2019 labor, according to the association. Slaves quarried and cut stone for the walls, among other jobs. The work force included white laborers from the area and immigrants from Ireland, Scotland and other European nations. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Trump says wages are too high By Sonam Vashi, CNN Trumka ran through a litany of complaints against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201cHe actually said our wages were too high, not just once but repeatedly,\u201d Trumka said. \u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t the solution to America\u2019s problems; he is the problem.\u201d At a November debate, in a response to a question about raising the minimum wage, Trump said, \u201cTaxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.\u201d The next day, the GOP candidate repeated that statement on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d When pressed on whether the federal minimum wage is livable, he said, \u201cOur taxes are too high. Our wages are too high. We have to compete with other countries.\u201d But the next day, on Fox News, Trump walked it back a bit. \u201cWhether it\u2019s taxes or wages, if they\u2019re too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete with other countries,\u201d he said. Since last fall, he has reiterated the idea that Americans should \u201cget more\u201d in wages. Maybe Trump was referring to a point where wages are just right. Trump did repeat the statement that he thought wages were too high, even though he later shifted his position. For that, Trumka\u2019s claim is mostly true. CNN Reality Check: Trump on offshoring jobs By Ali Foreman, CNN Casey relied on some old moves to land some fresh blows, attacking Trump\u2019s foreign manufacturing. \u201cDonald Trump says he stands for workers and that he\u2019ll put America first, but that\u2019s not how he conducted himself in business,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWhere are his \u2018tremendous\u2019 Trump products made? Dress shirts \u2013 Bangladesh. Furniture \u2013 Turkey. Picture frames \u2013 India. Wine glasses \u2013 Slovenia. Neck ties \u2013 China.\u201d Armed with an international laundry list of outsourcing, former Democratic and Republican candidates alike have accused Trump of seeking cheaper labor abroad. A CNN investigation from the primary season reported that Trump and his businesses offshored jobs to multiple countries, including China and Bangladesh. The Trump campaign responded to inquiries in a statement, falsely claiming that currency manipulation in China made it \u201cnearly impossible to compete and manufacture these products in America.\u201d We rate Casey\u2019s first claim as true. But Casey damaged his own credibility when he claimed, \u201cThe man who wants to make America great doesn\u2019t make anything in America.\u201d Trump built six hotels, 11 golf courses and 24 other properties in the US that indicate otherwise. Casey nearly got a Trump property in his own state when the Pennsylvania Trump Tower was in the works. Guess he\u2019ll just have to settle for the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia \u2013 which is in New Jersey. The verdict on Casey\u2019s second claim: false. Reality Check: The changing Mexican border By Kate Grise, CNN \u201cIf you know your history, Texas used to be part of Mexico,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m ninth generation American. My family never crossed a border, the border crossed us.\u201d In the early 1820s, Mexico won its independence from Spain and the newly independent country included the modern-day Texas, according to the Bullock Texas State History Museum. Mexico encouraged foreign settlers to come to the unified Mexican state \u201cCoahulia y Tejas,\u201d and Stephen F. Austin founded a new colony with 300 families. These new settlers, however, did not see themselves as Mexican nationals, but rather as \u201cTexians.\u201d Texans wanted statehood and self-rule, but Mexico was not ready to give up their hold on the territory. In 1835, the Texas Revolution began, and by 1836, Texas declared, and later won, independence. The Republic of Texas was formed and elected Sam Houston president. Texas was admitted to the United States in December 1845, and a border dispute over the southern border of Texas (and the United States) broke out with the Mexicans resulting in the US-Mexican war. In February 1848, the two countries signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hildago, establishing the border between the United States and Mexico that looked like the one know today. Longoria is correct in saying that the border between the two countries has changed. Texas was once a part of Mexico and it is true that many settlers who lived in the state found themselves annexed by the United States, but only after Texans declared their own independence from Mexico. We give Longoria\u2019s true history lesson an A+. Reality Check: Trump\u2019s LGBT positions By Lisa Rose, CNN Spearman said Trump opposes same-sex marriage despite his promise that he would be a protector of the LGBT community during his speech at the Republican National Convention. \u201cHe is against marriage equality and he has said he is all for overturning it,\u201d said Spearman. Actually, Trump hasn\u2019t said that he opposes same-sex marriage. During a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview in January, Trump said he was surprised by the Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. He then said that it\u2019s a states rights issue. He finally concluded that he would maybe consider picking judges who would reverse the decision. \u201cThis is a very surprising ruling,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can see changes coming down the line, frankly. But I would have much preferred that they ruled at a state level and allowed the states to make those rulings themselves.\u201d Trump was pressed to be more specific, asked repeatedly whether he would appoint justices to overturn the ruling. \u201cI would strongly consider that, yes,\u201d said Trump. Over the past six months, Trump hasn\u2019t clarified his position, although his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, famously signed a religious liberty bill in Indiana last year. Because Spearman said Trump is \u201call for\u201d overturning same-sex marriage, when his opinion is not all that clear, our verdict is false. CNN\u2019s Jasmine Lee, Justin Gamble and Amy Gallagher contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "GOP lawmakers are getting creative when faced with questions about Donald Trump Several say they simply aren't familiar with his controversial statements It\u2019s not easy working in the shadow of a Republican nominee that\u2019s always dominating the news with impolitic statements; just ask the House and Senate Republicans who spend much of their day at the Capitol responding to the latest stunning statement by Donald Trump. Last week at the Capitol was dominated by Trump\u2019s blasts against the federal judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit. Trump felt the judge\u2019s \u201cMexican heritage\u201d made him biased, which immediately drew accusations of racism. This week, GOP lawmakers face questions about Trump\u2019s response to the Orlando terror attack, after he said that President Barack Obama knew something about terrorists that he wasn\u2019t letting on and later re-emphasized his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country. For Republican lawmakers, there\u2019s no avoiding reporters in the Capitol, and no escaping controversy brought on by the presumptive presidential nominee. Some \u2013 the #NeverTrump crowd that includes Sens. Lindsey Graham \u2013 have it easy. It\u2019s no surprise where they stand on Trump, and they consistently blast away at the billionaire. But not everyone has it so simple. With that, here are the top five ways to field a comment by the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. Trump may have finally secured House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s formal endorsement, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the highest-ranking elected Republican (second in line to the President) from consistently skewering Trump. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up As he rolled out his anti-poverty plan last week, surrounded by African-American schoolchildren and leaders from Washington, Ryan called Trump\u2019s comment about U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d He later said that he did not think Trump himself was racist and he was not rescinding his endorsement, but the message was clear. One week later, Ryan was in the same position, this time blasting at Trump\u2019s call to ban Muslims from entering the country. A ban based on religion \u201cis not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it\u2019s not what this country stands for,\u201d he said. It\u2019s hard to talk about something you\u2019ve never heard of or don\u2019t know anything about \u2013 and saying just that is a tried-and-true deflection used by politicians of all stripes and at all levels of government. What makes it hard to use in this case is that Trump is just about everywhere. But it doesn\u2019t stop lawmakers from trying. Asked about Trump\u2019s recent comments questioning what Obama knew about the terror attack in Orlando, veteran Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said he had not heard about them and questioned if he had said that. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that comment. Did he actually say that?\u201d Hatch said Tuesday. After being told Trump\u2019s comments, Hatch said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d And Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican facing a tough re-election bid, said he had not heard Trump\u2019s speech Monday in response to the Orlando shootings. One week ago Kirk announced he would not support Trump, after Trump\u2019s comments about Curiel rocked the Capitol. Another Senate Republican facing a tough re-election challenge, Pennsylvania\u2019s Pat Toomey, said of Monday\u2019s speech \u201cI didn\u2019t follow it closely.\u201d After a rocky week dominated by the Curiel comments, one of the top Senate Republicans, Majority Whip John Cornyn, simply said he was done talking about Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that, all that\u2019s a distraction,\u201d Cornyn told CNN last week. Sen. Dan Coats \u2013 another Republican whose name had been floated as a possible running mate for Trump \u2013 also said he was just done talking about Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve said enough about Donald Trump for a while and I have to focus on a couple of other things,\u201d he said Tuesday. And then there\u2019s Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who bottled up last week after hitting Trump for his comments about Curiel, but eventually came out vociferously against Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims Tuesday. \u201cI do not think the comments that were made yesterday by Mr. Trump were necessarily the type of comments that needed to be made after 50 people perished,\u201d Corker said. He later noted that Senate Republicans had offered Trump advice on improving his tone: \u201cWe tried to offer words of public encouragement at times that were important, but were discouraged by the results.\u201d This has a clear expiration date on it, but for at least another month Republicans will be able to say simply: He\u2019s not the nominee. They\u2019re technically right \u2013 nobody becomes the nominee until the Republicans meet in Cleveland and cast their ballots to nominate their candidate for president. But barring a last-minute bid by Mitt Romney, a stroke of genius by Bill Kristol, or a lightning strike, Donald Trump will be the Republican Party\u2019s 2016 nominee for president. But, in politics, even the unthinkable allows for some wiggle room \u2013 and veteran Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander took it, telling Associated Press congressional correspondent Erica Warner that he wouldn\u2019t talk about Trump because he wasn\u2019t the nominee yet. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t have a nominee\u2019 Sen Alexander says in response to question on Trump. Informed he\u2019s the presumptive nominee: \u2018That\u2019s what you say,\u2019\u201d Werner tweeted Tuesday. \"We don't have a nominee\" Sen Alexander says in response to question on Trump. Informed he's the presumptive nominee: \"That's what you say.\" Just because you have to walk past reporters to get places in the Capitol doesn\u2019t mean you have to answer their questions. There\u2019s always the \u201cI\u2019m on the phone\u201d method \u2013 whether or not there\u2019s someone on the other line is irrelevant. Senators-only elevators are good hideouts \u2013 until the doors open again. But the best way is simply to move quickly. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a vulnerable Republican facing a tough re-election battle in New Hampshire, has gotten pretty good at one important part \u2013 walking briskly past reporters and pretending not to hear anything. She added to that Tuesday, when her staff stepped between her and a reporter to say she would not be commenting on Trump. An Ayotte press aide later returned and offered up a prepared statement from the senator condemning Trump\u2019s remarks Monday.",

            "article_content": "U.S. officials see the trip as a chance to reset relations after an era of discord Throughout his campaign, Mauricio Macri said he wanted to rewrite the playbook on Argentina's economy President Barack Obama aimed to capitalize on renewed goodwill in Latin America during a stop in Argentina on Wednesday for talks with a new leader more amenable to the United States. While not as historic as his visit to Cuba earlier in the week, Obama\u2019s stop in Argentina is seen by administration officials as symbolic of a thawing in the region prompted by opening ties to Havana. And the centrist government that recently took power, led by President Mauricio Macri, could be fertile ground for expanding U.S. ties. Obama sought to hasten those ties by announcing he would declassify documents about the U.S. role in Argentina\u2019s so-called Dirty War from the 1970s as a demonstration of openness. Watch the Obamas dance the tango in Argentina \u201cWe are absolutely determined to do our part as Argentina continues to heal and move forward as one nation, and I hope this gesture also helps to rebuild trust that may have been lost between our two countries,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a principle message that I have not only for Argentina but for the entire hemisphere.\u201d Despite the terror attacks that ripped through Brussels and dominated headlines Tuesday, the White House made clear that Obama planned to continue with his trip and complete his full schedule in Argentina. He said he remains committed to defeating global terrorism during an early afternoon press conference Wednesday. But his primary focused remained on bolstering ties with Argentina. \u201cPresident Macri is a man in a hurry. I\u2019m impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth and to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community,\u201d Obama said during a news conference with Macri, citing new economic reforms that have brought Argentina\u2019s economy back from the brink of ruin. He later said Macri was \u201csetting an example for other countries in the hemisphere. His engagement and willingness to have frank and constructive conversations with the world community \u2026 promises to heighten Argentina\u2019s influence on the world stage.\u201d Macri described Obama\u2019s visit as \u201ca gesture of affection, friendship, at a time when Argentina is embarking toward a new horizon and is in the process of changing.\u201d Ahead of Obama\u2019s arrival, the White House said the trip would serve as a way for the presidents of the two countries to discuss Argentina\u2019s new reform agenda and recognize Macri\u2019s speaking out on human rights in the region. Washington also hoped the trip would increase cooperation in trade and investment. READ: Obama hopes Cuba gamble has regional payoff Most importantly, U.S. officials see the trip as a chance to reset relations after an era of discord. \u201cI think Argentina is a good example of the shift that\u2019s taken place in terms of U.S. relations with other governments and other countries generally,\u201d Obama told CNN in an interview ahead of his trip. \u201cPresident Macri recognizes that we\u2019re in a new era, and we have to look forward.\u201d Obama described himself as having a \u201ccordial relationship\u201d with Argentina\u2019s last leader, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. He was blunter, though, in describing her positions. \u201cIn terms of her policies, her government\u2019s policies, they were consistently anti-American. I think she would resort to rhetoric that probably dated back to the \u201960s and the \u201870s, as opposed to today,\u201d he said. In Buenos Aires, Obama sat for a day of formal meetings with Macri followed by a state dinner. He\u2019ll also carve out time to memorialize victims of the \u201cDirty War,\u201d an organized system of rounding up and killing dissidents during the 1970s and \u201980s. Obama visits Argentina on the 40th anniversary of a military coup that installed the junta that carried out the killings. The date is an annual occasion for demonstrations, and this year protesters are also targeting the United States for allegedly supporting the coup. Expecting large-scale protests on Thursday, Obama and his family will decamp for Bariloche, a scenic resort in Patagonia. But his aides said Obama isn\u2019t looking to avoid the past, with the declassification of documents pertaining to the war an example of a willingness to reckon with history. Many in Argentina were surprised to learn that Obama was planning to visit Buenos Aires following his stop in Cuba. Ever since the Kirchners took power \u2013 Nestor Kirchner in 2003 and his wife, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, upon his death in 2007 \u2013 the two countries started to drift apart. Argentina began siding with the so-called ALBA countries, a coalition of left-leaning nations, alienating the United States. The relationship turned more tumultuous in 2005, when Argentina allowed Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales and Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez to lead an anti-American protest on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas, which U.S. President George W. Bush was attending. Analysts believe the trip by Obama to Argentina serves as a way to establish a new relationship. According to Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Wilson Center, Macri\u2019s policies are encouraging for the United States. \u201cThings are not going to change overnight, but (the Macri) administration is one that has articulated foreign policy and economic principles that are much more in line with the U.S. government,\u201d Arnson said. \u201cThere is a sense that Argentina has removed itself dramatically from a sympathy with (the) populist left in Latin American to more of the center-right, and that is obviously a change that the United States wants to encourage and be helpful in its success.\u201d Macri, a center-right candidate who was once the mayor of Buenos Aires and president of the Boca Juniors football club, won the election in December by uniting the center and right parties under a coalition named \u201cLet\u2019s change.\u201d Throughout his campaign, Macri said he wanted to rewrite the playbook on Argentina\u2019s economy \u2013 a campaign promise that made him popular on Wall Street. He also promised he\u2019d work to eliminate poverty in Argentina. He won the election largely by attracting the vote of businessmen and young people with his economic policies, while his infrastructure and development promises helped him get part of the vote in the rural areas. The economy in recent years has deteriorated and featured rampant inflation. In his victory speech, Macri doubled down on his campaign promise to bring Argentina back to the world stage. \u201cI also want to say to our Latin American brothers and our brothers around the world, that we want to have good relationships with all countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to work with everyone. We know that the Argentine people have much to bring to the world, and we hope to find an agenda of cooperation.\u201d Over the past three months, he has invited leaders from France, Italy and the European Union to visit Argentina. Argentinian political pollster and analyst Alejando Catterberg said he has seen a dramatic shift in foreign policy during Macri\u2019s first 100 days in office. \u201cCristina was very tough with the United States, accusing the U.S. that all of Argentina\u2019s problems were basically because of the international markets, because of the U.S. government,\u201d Catterberg said. \u201cMacri is totally different.\u201d Catterberg descrived him as from a new party and \u201ctotally pro-market.\u201d He continued, \u201cHe\u2019s a reasonable guy, and he has turned Argentina\u2019s foreign policy position very quickly, in less than three months.\u201d Macri\u2019s moves to rescue Argentina\u2019s beleaguered economy have played a major role in his welcome onto the world stage. Argentina never fully recovered its reputation in international markets after the country stopped paying its creditors and defaulted on a $95 billion debt in 2001. Earlier this year, the Macri government reached an agreement with major American hedge funds. The agreement opens the doors to allow foreign investment into Argentina again.",

Bundy and some of his supporters \u2013 who took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon \u2013 were pulled over in a highway traffic stop yesterday, which didn\u2019t go well considering shots rang out and their spokesman LaVoy Finicum was killed. So what happens now to the siege? Your guess is as good as ours. Firefighters killed: Three firefighters died battling blazes in north-central Washington state Wednesday, when they were overcome by flames after they had a vehicle accident.

To not do so would\u2019ve been political malpractice for both: Blacks are more than half the electorate in Saturday\u2019s primary; they heart Obama; and race relations are a top concern.

            "article_content": "Ford was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 He gained international notoriety after denying, then admitting to using crack cocaine He was a City Council member at the time of his death Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has died, according to his chief of staff, Dan Jacobs. Ford, who had been battling an aggressive form of cancer, served for a decade as a city councilor before being elected mayor in 2010. The 46-year-old Ford gained international notoriety after a video surfaced in May 2013 that apparently showed him using crack cocaine. He was re-elected to the City Council in 2014 and was serving in that role at the time of his death. His family had said Monday that he was \u201cresting comfortably\u201d in palliative care at Toronto\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, adding he was sometimes being sedated to help him deal with pain. Ford was a bombastic and larger-than-life personality who spoke bluntly, traits that helped him craft an image as a champion of the working class. When running for mayor, he campaigned as an anti-politician who would cut the size of government and stand up to what he called \u201cbig-city elites.\u201d \u201cToronto\u2019s government has grown bloated and wasteful,\u201d he said in a campaign video. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop the gravy train that provides luxuries and perks to politicians and rich contracts to their friends.\u201d Ford\u2019s time as mayor, however, was plagued by scandal. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford controversy In May 2013 a video surfaced that appeared to show Ford smoking crack cocaine. Ford denied any wrongdoing and ignored those calling for his resignation. \u201cI do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,\u201d he said at a news conference. Rob Ford: I drank a little with my friends before latest video But as more videos surfaced showing Ford in compromising circumstances, the scrutiny became more intense, and his relationship with the City Council became more acrimonious. Months later, the admission finally came: He told reporters he \u201cprobably\u201d smoked the drug at some point. \u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors.\u201d The situation unfolded like a piece of surreal, tragic comedy \u2013 and proved to be perfect fodder for late night TV and comedians around the world. Ford refused to step aside, even after the City Council stripped him of most of his powers. He launched a re-election bid and then spent two months in rehab, after which he returned to campaigning. But he had to abandon his re-election bid in September 2014 after being diagnosed with a malignant liposarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer that doctors said spread from the fatty tissue of his abdomen to other parts of his body. Ford was instead elected councilor for the seat he previously held, Ward 2 \u2013 his birthplace of Etobicoke North. His brother, Doug Ford, who ran for Ford\u2019s old job as mayor, lost. Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his condolences Tuesday, saying that Ford \u201cfought cancer with courage and determination.\u201d Rob Ford fought cancer with courage and determination. My condolences and best wishes to the Ford family today. The Toronto Star reported that flags at Toronto\u2019s City Hall and civic centers will fly at half staff to mark Ford\u2019s death and will remain lowered until his funeral. Toronto Mayor John Tory said the city was \u201creeling\u201d at the news that Ford had died, the newspaper reported. CNN\u2019s Ashley Fantz and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.",

Now they\u2019re Barb, Tammy and Dianne and Heidi,\u201d Mikulski mused in an interview with CNN. In 1986, when she was first elected, women weren\u2019t allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. They lacked a proper bathroom. And, there were only two female senators then \u2013 Mikulski and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. The Maryland Democrat is now leaving as one of 20 female senators \u2013 a bipartisan group that Mikulski is the unofficial dean of, gathering them all for monthly dinners. \u201cWe disagreed on issues, but what we said was, No. 1, we were going to be a zone of civility even when we disagreed,\u201d she said. Mikulski is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. Still, talking to us in one of her final interviews as a sitting senator, she made clear that she is retiring with unexpected sadness. On a scale of 1-10, she said her disappointment was a 52 on election night, after her old Senate colleague failed to become the first female president. At first Mikulski demurred when asked whether America was just not ready for a female president, responding that she will \u201clet the history books write about that.\u201d When pressed, she said of Hillary Clinton: \u201cThere were a lot of biases against her.\u201d \u201cYou know what we find when you break the glass ceiling? You end up living in a glass office. Where everything you do is scrutinized,\u201d she said. It\u2019s not just Mikulski\u2019s feminism that makes Clinton\u2019s defeat so crushing. It is that her own Democratic Party lost touch with the kind of working-class voters she says she never stopped fighting for. \u201cPeople right now in Baltimore that have three part-time jobs,\u201d said Mikulski. \u201cMany of my constituents fear that they\u2019re either losing their job overseas or they could lose it to a robot.\u201d When we suggested that she sounded a lot like Donald Trump, without missing a beat she replied: \u201cNo. I think I sound like Barbara Mikulski.\u201d She admits the election results makes it tougher to leave, worried a lot of her work \u2013 on Obamacare and beyond \u2013 may be undone. \u201cYou cannot take a wrecking ball to the very agencies that are designed to help American workers get on their feet,\u201d she said. Still, the first woman to ever chair the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee says that behind the scenes bipartisanship she witnessed and engaged in gives her hope. Longest serving female senator to retire In fact, with her offices already all packed up, our interview took place inside the historic appropriations room on the first floor of the Capitol, where she said she was part of many legislative efforts across the partisan aisle. Even the way senators sit at the imposing table \u2013 with the chairman and the ranking member sitting side by side in the middle \u2013 is aimed at a goal \u201cnot to square off.\u201d \u201cWe sit together,\u201d she said, standing over the side-by-side name plates of senators from opposing parties. \u201cThis is symbolic and an actual function of civility where side-by-side we bring our members together for thoughtful discussion thoughtful analysis,\u201d said Mikulski. It\u2019s that kind of quiet, unsung bipartisan work that she says she will miss. \u201cWhat I won\u2019t miss is the crazy partisan prickliness, and this loss of civility, and the fact that we don\u2019t take the time to listen to our constituents or to listen to each other. And how we can solve problems in a practical, affordable kind of way?\u201d she said. The 4\u2019 11\u201d tall senator, first elected to the House in 1976 and then the Senate in 1986, made a long career out of people underestimating her. \u201cI bring my own stool to have a longitudinal parity. It\u2019s not easy to be 4\u201911\u201d in an institution like this,\u201d she quipped. She has a reputation for churning out quotable nuggets like that, but also for being intimidating at times \u2013 making male colleagues cower, which she is quick to dismiss. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of this one before. And I think that when women are persistent and insistent we\u2019re viewed as tough. Now, I view it as just being effective,\u201d she said. Mikulski sets record on Capitol Hill She should know about persistence. She recalls one of her first legislative fights early in her career for parity for women when it came to medical research. \u201cWe got money for a famous hormone study that changed medical practice and has reduced breast cancer rates by 15% of the strength,\u201d she said. One of her proudest achievements was shepherding through the Senate the so-called Lilly Ledbetter legislation, aimed at giving women equal pay for equal work. It was the first bill enacted into law by the first black president, and he gave her the first pen he used to sign it. Now, it\u2019s the end of the Obama AND the Mikulski eras. As the trailblazing senator walked out the door dropping pearls of wisdom, she did something rarely seen in public: She choked up remembering the evening of 9/11, when lawmakers came together to sing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d on the Capitol steps. \u201cRegardless of who is president, we need to be able to stand on those steps and sing \u2018God Bless America\u2019 and feel the people in this Congress to come together and put the national interests above any party interest. We take an oath to the Constitution. I\u2019ve never took an oath to the Democratic Party. I\u2019m a strong Democrat but I believe in a credible country first, and always listen to the people,\u201d said Mikulski, ever and always the granddaughter Polish immigrants, and daughter of a working-class grocer. \u201cThey really do have the best ideas.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Day by contentious day, President-elect Donald Trump is building a White House Cabinet and staffing a new government. But if his first round of choices are any indication, he\u2019s going forward without a blueprint \u2013 relying on instincts and personal relationships over any grand design scheme or ideology. Trump\u2019s nominees range from a treasury secretary who spent nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street giant Trump the candidate frequently ripped as a den of corruption and cronyism, to a potential defense department chief who opposes the use of torture tactics his would-be boss called for during the campaign. His choices to lead the EPA and Department of Education support policies that would render their own agencies toothless or see them eliminated. During the campaign, Trump pledged to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d \u2013 or keep the familiar Washington, DC, insiders outside the halls of federal power. But wealthy, connected donors and bankers are grabbing up influential positions in the new administration. Rather than lobbyists, Trump has been seeking to hire their bosses. Here is a rundown of the nominees, some for Cabinet positions and others for administrative jobs, and how they mix with Trump\u2019s public policy pledges. Trump: If he\u2019s not a fan, then Trump certainly has nicer things to say about the Russian government, and its strongman President Vladimir Putin, than most in politics and the US government. \u201cThe man has very strong control over his country,\u201d Trump said admiringly in September, and often muses on improving bilateral relations with Moscow. And if that didn\u2019t complicate matters enough, there\u2019s now bipartisan concern, based on secret assessments provided by the CIA, that Russia sought to aid Trump and damage Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Rex Tillerson: After flirting with Putin critic Mitt Romney for weeks, Trump shifted his affections toward ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, whom he selected on Tuesday. Tillerson has done extensive business with the Kremlin and was awarded the the Order of Friendship by the Russian president in 2013. That came two years after the oil executive and Putin negotiated a mega-billion dollar deal that would have opened up Russia\u2019s arctic ice fields to joint exploration. But new US sanctions, imposed in response to Moscow\u2019s meddling in Crimea and Ukraine, froze the project indefinitely. Romney\u2019s relationship with the Russians is less chummy. He was skewered for it at the time, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee called Russia \u201cwithout question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.\u201d That Tillerson, who is expected to face a serious confirmation fight, and Romney were ever in the running for the same job is odd and suggests Trump\u2019s foreign policy is either inchoate, inscrutable \u2013 or both. Trump: A questionnaire circulated by his transition team set off concerns the new administration would target staffers who opposed Trump\u2019s climate skepticism. The document requests the names of department employees and contractors who have attended outside climate change meetings and any writings derived from those gatherings. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: Like Trump, Perry is wishy-washy on climate questions. He is a supporter of the fossil fuel industry and pledged during his brief 2016 campaign to revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, but during his time as governor also invested in renewable energy projects. Perry is no fan of the department he would run. He campaigned in 2012 on a promise to shutter it, along with Commerce and Education, though during a now infamous debate stage gaffe, could not \u2013 Oops! \u2013 recall its name. Trump: \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over (Ted Cruz). Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said during the campaign, And in an election eve ad, a video clip of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein rolls as Trump, in a voiceover, talks of defeating \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\u201d Steve Mnuchin: A former partner at Goldman Sachs, he worked at the company for 17 years before briefly joining a hedge fund and then buying a subprime lending company which would be questioned by regulators over predatory foreclosure practices. He has also worked with the liberal billionaire George Soros, a bogeyman to many on the right, who see his fingerprints \u2013 often without or in opposition to any evidence \u2013 on every protest of policy push. Soros, like Blankfein, also had a cameo in that final campaign video. Trump: Repeatedly pledged to bring back torture during stump speeches, in which he described a stark but vague plan of action against ISIS. In February, Trump said: \u201cTorture works. OK, folks? You know, I have these guys \u2013 \u201cTorture doesn\u2019t work!\u201d \u2013 believe me, it works. And waterboarding is your minor form. Some people say it\u2019s not actually torture. Let\u2019s assume it is. But they asked me the question: What do you think of waterboarding? Absolutely fine. But we should go much stronger than waterboarding.\u201d Trump has also spoken in wild, if detail-light terms, about fighting ISIS. \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me,\u201d he said at a campaign event. \u201cI would bomb the s\u2013t out of them.\u201d James Mattis: Despite courting controversy in 2005 when he told servicemembers \u201cit\u2019s fun to shoot some people,\u201d the recently retired marine general has also spoken at length about the ISIS threat. In 2014, he delivered a nuanced analysis to Congress on the group\u2019s growth and how they should be combated. He urged against ruling out \u201cboots on the ground\u201d but also said the Obama administration needed to be more specific about its goals. As Trump himself said following a conversation with Mattis, the military man does not support torture techniques. \u201cI met with him at length and I asked him that question,\u201d the President-elect told the New York Times. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you think of waterboarding?\u2019 He said \u2013 I was surprised \u2013 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve never found it to be useful.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.\u2019\u201d Trump: Says he wants to repeal Obamacare, but with a number of caveats. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after the election, Trump said he wanted to keep provisions that guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 \u201cIt happens to be one of the strongest assets. It adds cost, but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re gonna try and keep\u201d \u2013 and allow parents to keep their children on their policies until the age of 26. He also guaranteed that the law would be \u201crepealed and replaced\u201d with no gap between the two \u2013 not a \u201ctwo day\u201d or \u201ctwo year period where there\u2019s nothing.\u201d Tom Price: Also wants to repeal Obamacare, but has no interest in keeping any specific element or simply amending the original. Price, though, unlike many of his Republican House colleagues, has a thorough plan to replace it with a program that relies on tax credits for insurance seekers on the individual market and an emphasis on Health Savings Accounts. People with pre-existing conditions would likely be clustered in high-risk pools. The Price plan would also end the expanded Medicaid funding some states have accepted as part of Obamacare. On balance, experts say his plan would be a boon for healthy and wealthy, but reduce aid to the elderly and those who are already sick or in need. Trump: Pledged to bring jobs back to the manufacturing sector in part by renegotiating international trade deals like NAFTA. Trump also focused relentlessly on China\u2019s market activities, including allegations that their government had artificially undervalued its currency \u2013 a way of boosting exports and cutting down on imports. Wilbur Ross: The billionaire private equity firm man told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett Outfront\u201d that an effort to redraw NAFTA would be \u201ca logical starting point\u201d once he arrived on the job. And like Trump, he has been critical of China, saying that the country \u201cis the world\u2019s biggest exporter, but they\u2019re also the people with one of the highest tariffs on imports in the whole world. That seems a little bit oxymoronic.\u201d Ross boosted his fortune in the early 2000s by buying up sinking steelmakers, creating the International Steel Group, then selling it off a couple years later for $4.5 billion. Of all Trump\u2019s picks, Ross stands out as perhaps the most ideologically in-step choice. Trump: In a 2012 tweet, said that \u201cthe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\u201d and has expressed doubt over tmore recently about climate science. But he met with former Vice President Al Gore, this week and hedged his position in a post-election interview with the New York Times, saying, \u201cI think there is some connectivity (between activity and climate change). Some, something. It depends on how much.\u201d Scott Pruitt: While Trump\u2019s comments on the matter are open to interpretation, the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s are not. He is a prominent climate science denier and a frequent critic of the agency he will lead if confirmed. In a piece he co-authored for the National Review in May, Pruitt announced he would challenge Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2013 proposed in tandem with the White House by the EPA \u2013 in court. Though Pruitt cannot completely shutter the EPA or unilaterally cancel many of its regulations, he could accept diminished budgets and drastically diminish its influence. Trump: Spoke during the campaign only in vague terms about the troubles of America\u2019s \u201cinner cities,\u201d usually framing them as part of an appeal to African-Americans. \u201cWe will make your streets safe so when you walk down the street, you don\u2019t get shot, which is happening now,\u201d he said in August \u2013 an phrase he returned to in the first debate, when told viewers that \u201cAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell.\u201d Ben Carson: The celebrated brain surgeon has no experience in government, a fact his business manager cited and attributed to Carson as his reasoning for not initially accepting an administration job. Carson has also never lived in public housing, despite being raised in poverty in Detroit. In his limited public comments about HUD policy, he has been mostly critical of its activities. Carson disparaged 1970s busing programs meant to desegregate city schools as one of a series of \u201cfailed socialist experiments\u201d in a Washington Times op-ed from July 2015. He also fretted that the Obama HUD\u2019s use of the Fair Housing Act to tie federal funds to the construction of affordable housing in wealthier enclaves would \u201cchange the nature of some communities.\u201d Trump: Has pivoted, twisted and reversed himself repeatedly on the question of raising the minimum wage. Trump said he supported raising the federal number to $10 but, in earlier interviews, suggested it should be a question for the states. At a GOP primary debate, he said that wages in the country are \u201ctoo high\u201d and he would not raise the floor. Politifact rated Trump\u2019s position as a \u201cFull Flop.\u201d Andrew Puzder: The CEO of fast food chains Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s, Puzder is a stalwart opponent of the progressive push for greater regulation of the industry and the move to a $15 minimum wage. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed from March, he argued that \u201cdramatic increases in labor costs have a significant effect on the restaurant industry, where profit margins are pennies on the dollar and labor makes up about a third of total expenses,\u201d and said that ramped up expenses like a minimum wage hike would push corporations toward automation \u2013 and in so doing eliminate jobs entirely. Trump: Used the campaign season to push alarmist rhetoric about the threat of Islamic extremism inside US borders, at times proposing a temporary ban on the immigration of the Muslims into the country and flirting with the creation of Muslim registry. Trump isn\u2019t talking about a ban on Muslims traveling to the US *anymore*, but his transition team has expressed interest in a program similar to one enacted by the George W. Bush administration and met early on after the election with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped build the since disbanded NSEERS program (National Security Entry-Exit program). NSEERS focused on countries, not individuals, and did not block immigration. But it added an extra layer of screening for people from almost exclusively Muslim-majority nations \u2013 or any the administration deemed high-risk. John Kelly: Another retired Marine general, Kelly was the former head of the US Southern Command, which meant he administered the controversial Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. Kelly opposed Obama\u2019s efforts to close the camp, which Trump supports, telling the Military Times in an interview, \u201cThere are no innocent men down there.\u201d But unlike the President-elect, Kelly is more careful in his comments about the Muslim community. Speaking to NPR in December 2015, he described ISIS as being powered by a \u201ccorrupted Islamic view of life\u201d and \u201ctruly not representative of Islam.\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of Muslims are wonderful people,\u201d he added, \u201cwhether they live here in the United States or overseas.\u201d Trump: Has been difficult to read on the nitty-gritty of education policy, at points suggesting the department could be eliminated altogether. On his website, Trump promises to \u201cimmediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice\u201d \u2013 or private and charter schools. He also says that Congress should pass reforms to assure colleges and universities are making \u201ca good faith effort\u201d to reduce the costs and student debt \u201cin exchange for the federal tax breaks and tax dollars.\u201d Trump is an opponent of Common Core standards, which has called a \u201cdisaster\u201d and pledge to discontinue. Betsy DeVos: A billionaire Republican donor and school choice activist, DeVos has, unlike Trump, been a supporter of Common Core, one of the reasons her nomination raised eyebrows on the right as well as tempers on the left. Critics note that DeVos has sought to push voucher systems \u2013 funded with taxpayer bucks \u2013 that would funnel students to private schools, undermining and draining the lifeblood from public schools. Trump: Made infrastructure spending a focus point during the campaign and will now seek to negotiate funding from a Republican-controlled Congress loathe to spend on public projects. During the campaign, Trump said he wanted $1 billion to rebuild American roads, bridges, airports, rail systems, hospitals and other critical infrastructure as a means of creating jobs now and boosting furture growth. Elaine Chao: A former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, she is the daughter of a wealthy shipping family and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Chao has also worked as a banker in New York and San Francisco. In this role, she would likely be working in close quarters with McConnell as the White House tries to help maneuver legislation to fund Trump\u2019s infrastructure spending ambitions. Trump: Pledged as a candidate to bring back \u201claw and order,\u201d which in political speak usually translates to tougher policing and crackdowns on activists and protesters. It was a rallying cry during the 1960s, when former President Richard Nixon used the phrase as a coded nod to White southerners angered by the progress of the Civil Rights era. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions: A former US for the Southern District of Alabama and Alabama attorney general, Sessions\u2019 appointment to the federal bench was blocked in 1986 after an African-American former colleague testified he had called him \u201cboy\u201d and expressed past sympathies for the Ku Klux Klan. Sessions disputed the allegations, but his nomination was scuttled by the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which he now sits. He has also spoken out against the Voting Rights Act, called the NAACP and ACLU \u201cun-American,\u201d accusing the groups of having \u201cforced civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d Trump: Put forward a plan that would cut business tax rates across the board, reducing the rate to 15% for both major corporations and smaller firms. Linda McMahon:  The former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment helped turn a relatively small operation into a global goliath. In the process, though, the WWE has developed a reputation for its fierce efforts to preserve what is effectively a monopoly on pro wrestling by swatting down potential competitors \u2013 or small businesses.",

            "article_content": "If Joe Biden decides to run in 2020, he'd be running as the oldest presidential candidate in US history Of his years in elected office, Biden said, \"That's what I'm proudest of. My name.\" Vice President Joe Biden wants a say in the direction of the Democratic Party as it picks up the pieces from a nightmare electoral loss this year \u2013 and isn\u2019t willing to fully rule out a bid for the presidency if he thinks issues of economic fairness aren\u2019t being voiced. \u201cFour years is a lifetime in American politics,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd I think nominees are determined by their parties based mostly on what skill set is most needed at that time.\u201d \u201cWho knows where we\u2019re going to be two years from now when people are really starting to look seriously at what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. His comments came after a week of public back-and-forth on the prospects of a run in 2020; he somewhat facetiously told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday he was going to run, only to return Wednesday to the Capitol and insist \u201cI have no intention of running.\u201d If Biden, now 74, decides to run for president in 2020, he\u2019d be asking Americans to elect the oldest commander-in-chief in US history; Donald Trump, 70, will assume that record when he\u2019s sworn in next month. \u201cAge could be very much an issue, and it may not be,\u201d Biden acknowledged in the interview. \u201cIt depends on the state of my health and the health of whoever is running.\u201d RELATED: Biden: I\u2019m \u2018embarrassed\u2019 by the campaign After publicly weighing a presidential bid this cycle, Biden announced in October 2015 he wasn\u2019t emotionally prepared to enter the contest following the death of his eldest son Beau. But after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss in November \u2013 which was propelled, in part, by Trump\u2019s huge margins of victory among white, working class man \u2013 many wondered whether Biden might have fared better. He\u2019s spent his career appealing to working class voters, and has identified his popularity among that demographic as a reason then-candidate Barack Obama selected him as a running mate in 2008. Biden downplayed any suggestion he could have topped Trump in an election matchup this year \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019d probably be eating me alive,\u201d he said of Republicans \u2013 but he did lament a contest that lacked serious policy debates. \u201cIt got drowned out by the most vicious campaign, the craziest campaign I\u2019ve ever witnessed since I\u2019ve been involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bulk of the debate was emails and/or his boorish behavior.\u201d Biden, who came to Washington as a US Senator in 1973 and has remained in elected office ever since, is set to depart government next month for the first time in four decades. He says he\u2019s planning to establish a center at a university to continue his work toward finding a cure for cancer, a mission he began following his son\u2019s death. Biden said he\u2019s emerging from his life in public service gratified at his standing as an honest broker; a reputation he says crosses party lines. \u201cI\u2019m proudest of leaving here with a reputation among both Democrats and Republicans to never have misled anybody and viewed of someone who has been honorable. That\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of. My name,\u201d Biden said. RELATED: Senate pays tribute to Biden Whatever he ultimately decides about a bid in 2020, Biden said he wouldn\u2019t wait until a campaign to express his views on the future of his party. He insisted Democrats must huddle and determine a path out of their political woes following Trump\u2019s win in November, which also saw the GOP maintaining control of both the US House and Senate. \u201cThis is the time to reestablish the roots of the Democratic party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to engage in some real serious debates\u2026I think you\u2019re going to see a lot more focus on how to bring everybody on board in terms of economic growth.\u201d Questioned on who might lead Democrats out of the darkness, Biden listed congressional leaders like incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House. But also named himself, declaring he wasn\u2019t disappearing when he leaves his post in January. \u201cLike after every presidential election that the party loses, there is no single leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are voices that hopefully will be heard. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to have a voice in the direction of the party.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m really not.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The battle centered on how long the government should extend health benefits for retired coal miners Democrats pushed and failed to secure votes for a one-year extension The Senate late Friday cleared a bill to fund the government through the end of April, narrowly averting a shutdown. The 63-36 vote came just before a midnight deadline when the government could have run out of money. Final passage came after a procedural vote to advance the measure was narrowly adopted. Needing 60 votes, it cleared 61-38. The vote took nearly an hour and was tense and uncertain to the end as senators weighed political and parochial interests in deciding which way to vote.  Party leaders and whips, trying to save the must-pass bill, worked their members furiously. President Barack Obama signed the measure into law early Saturday. The late night action came after a day of back-channel negotiations aimed at alleviating concerns from coal-state Democrats who wanted a longer extension of expiring health benefits for retired coal miners. Democrats failed to secure enough votes to that extension. The battle centered on how long the government should extend health benefits for retired coal miners, as the Democrats called for an extension lasting one year, rather than the four months in the current proposal. And it amounted to the most intense partisan squabble on Capitol Hill since the general election, where Democrats struggled to win over white, working-class voters. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who faces reelection in 2018 and is under consideration for a job in Donald Trump\u2019s administration, took to the Senate floor Friday evening and demanded that his colleagues block the funding bill, which is needed to keep the government open past midnight. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working and fighting and really clawing for this,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some friends on the other side who believed it wasn\u2019t an emergency.\u201d Still, Democrats privately and publicly conceded they were unlikely to win over the 41 votes needed to shut the government down. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to get to the 41,\u201d Manchin said at a news conference Friday evening. What Democrats got from the exercise is unclear. Democrats contended they had elevated the issue, and hoped that their aggressive push would pressure top Republicans to cut a deal on a permanent solution early next year. But they did not get the legislative fix they had been demanding. During a caucus meeting Thursday, Senate Democratic leaders and coal-state Democrats agreed to use a threat of a shutdown to bring attention to the issue and push for a longer extension in January, a senior Democratic aide said. \u201cOur intention was never, never, ever to shut this place down,\u201d Manchin told CNN. Added Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut down the government on this issue.\u201d The late-evening developments come as Senate Republicans and Democrats engaged in behind the scenes negotiations to try to head off a shutdown at midnight. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll wrap it up this evening but I don\u2019t have anything to announce yet,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second ranking Senate Republican, told reporters. In a sign of possible progress that a disruption to government services could be averted, Cornyn said discussions were underway between GOP leaders and Manchin of West Virginia, the lead Democrat pressing for changes to the health insurance program. \u201cWe\u2019re working through third parties. Third party negotiators,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him directly but there are conversations taking place between leadership on the Democratic side and this side.\u201d Republicans argued McConnell, who represents miner interests in his home state of Kentucky, has already committed to work to extend the health insurance for a full year, which is the central demand of Manchin and the Democrats backing his effort. Republicans note that McConnell initially pushed to get a one year extension into the funding bill and has spoken on the floor about his desire to extend it that long. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of the leaders of the effort, told CNN that the GOP would squarely to be blame if there were a shutdown. Asked if he had the support to block a bill, Brown said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea what we have. I know that the support has been stronger than I expected from Democrats and from some Republicans that will vote with us.\u201d At issue is whether to extend the miners\u2019 insurance program \u2013 which serves retired miners and their spouses \u2013 for one year or for just for the four month length of the GOP-authored spending bill, which is known as a continuing resolution or CR. One person who is trying to build support for the measure is Manchin who was holed up in his office Friday talking to Democrats and some Republicans urging them to block the CR. Manchin, a moderate, had been scheduled to meet with Trump in New York Friday about a possible job in his administration but it was postponed until Monday so he could deal with the miners\u2019 issue. Democrats are worried Manchin might leave the Senate to work for Trump, which could lead to a Republican pick up of his Senate seat. Manchin is leading a pack of coal Senate Democrats \u2013 including Brown, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania,  each of whom is up for re-election in two years \u2014 to bolster the insurance benefits. Manchin has the support of at least one Republican, his fellow West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, while GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is weighing whether to join the Democrats as well. But even Manchin wouldn\u2019t predict that he has the 41 votes needed to scuttle the spending bill and force a change to help the miners. \u201cWe have a strong commitment from our caucus, I can tell you that. Very strong,\u201d is as far as Manchin would go when asked specifically late Thursday if he had 41 votes. One key Democrat has joined Manchin\u2019s battle. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York vowed Thursday, \u201cWe are going to win this fight.\u201d There could be political dividends for Democrats making a full-throated fight for the miners, even at the risk of a potentially risky shutdown. Trump won big in coal country and Democrats would love to claw back some of those working class voters. As he opened the chamber for what\u2019s been expected to be the final legislative day of the year, McConnell implored Democrats to accept the miners provision as it is and not recklessly shutdown the government over it. \u201cIt\u2019s been my intention that the miner benefits not expire at the end of April next year,\u201d said McConnell.  I\u2019m going to work with my colleagues to prevent that.  But this is a good time to take \u2018yes\u2019 for an answer.  We should pass the CR without delay.\u201d McConnell noted that the bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support Thursday, a sign House Democrats were okay with the four month extension.",

But Biden said Thursday this year\u2019s presidential campaign lacked a focus on improving the lives of working class voters, a flaw he suggested may have cost Clinton the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s been a shift in focus now that we got the car out of the ditch and on the road and running, on really focusing on the real inequities that exist and still exist for working class, middle class people who are left behind. And what happened was that wasn\u2019t a central part of the campaign moving forward in my view,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview. Biden: I\u2019m \u2018embarrassed\u2019 by the campaign \u201cI said at the convention when I introduced Hillary and praised her, I said we don\u2019t show enough respect to that group that has been in fact left behind,\u201d he went on. Biden disputed characterizations of working class Americans as racist or sexist, insisting the groups who tilted toward Donald Trump, in many cases, share his own values. \u201cI mean these are good people man!\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in some of our party that, wait a minute, we either have to tone down our progressive point of view and ramp up what we\u2019re going to do for working folks or somehow talk less about working folks and ramp. \u2026 There is no conflict in the neighborhoods I come from. None. None at all.\u201d Biden made an anguished decision in October 2015 to forgo a run for president, saying he wasn\u2019t ready to make the commitment following the death of his eldest son Beau four months earlier. He said Thursday it\u2019s impossible to know how he might have fared in a Democratic primary, or in a general election battle with Donald Trump. \u201cWho knows what would have happened?\u201d he said. \u201cI learned how to become popular. Once you\u2019re not running for president I mean boom, you\u2019re a popular guy out there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In speeches this week, Donald Trump and his VP have continued to promise big That includes repealing Obamacare, fixing the VA and rolling back taxes Donald Trump and Mike Pence are telling supporters across the country that they will make a sea change in decades old government policies before winter\u2019s cold has thawed, raising expectations for the first 100 days of their new administration. Pence and Trump, in the post election euphoria that comes with winning, have laid out dozens of promises that they say they will achieve in the first few months of 2017, including repealing Obamacare, beefing up military spending and dramatic changes in tax policy. At events in the last week both have said they intend to achieve these goals mere weeks after moving to Washington, telling supporters that they intend to be in the \u201cpromise keeping business.\u201d \u201cRight out of the box our President-elect is going to be in the promise keeping business,\u201d Pence said at a Heritage Foundation gala on Tuesday night where the former Indiana governor pledged to not only cut taxes and simplify the tax code, but to also do it within weeks of entering the White House. Trump describes Election Night jitters to donors; offers olive branch to critics Trump and Pence\u2019s big plans contrast to some of the other past incoming tickets, who after winning the White House have tried to ratchet back rhetoric and manage expectations. That isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s style, though. He and his running mate have set expectations high for the new administration and while they will enjoy control of both houses of Congress, the Republican duo will have to work at a break neck pace to actually achieve all that they are promising. Pence\u2019s speech to the conservative think tank was rife with promises to the Republican faithful, many of whom had bank rolled the Trump campaign. \u201cBefore we get to this spring, I promise you, we are going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms,\u201d Pence said blocks from the White House. \u201cWe are going to simplify the tax code, lower business taxes in America from 35% to 15% so companies in America can compete.\u201d Trump also has promised \u201cthe biggest\u201d tax cuts since Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1982 and 1984. \u201cThis includes lowering the tax rate on business, from 35% all the way down to 15% and massive tax cuts by the way for middle class workers,\u201d he said at a rally this week. Why Obamacare could be the messiest battle of 2017 Before that, though, Pence said the Trump administration\u2019s first priority will be repealing Obamacare, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement that aimed to provide healthcare for all Americans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CBS after his win. Unlike some of Trump and Pence\u2019s other promises, that effort has had vocal support from leaders in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said this week that repealing Obamacare would be the first issue of next year for his chamber. Trump specifically outlined military priorities on Tuesday during an event in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2013 a city adjacent to Fort Bragg, the largest military base in the world. \u201cWe seek peace through strength. That is why in my first budget report to Congress I am going to ask for the elimination of the Defense Sequester,\u201d Trump said of across the board cuts on defense spending. \u201cDepletion, I call it depletion.\u201d Trump promised \u201cchange like you\u2019ve never seen before\u201d at the scandal and delay plagued Veterans Affairs administration. At Pence\u2019s speech this week, he also promised that the \u201cObama era of weakening our national defenses is over\u201d because he and Trump will \u201crestore the arsenal of democracy\u201d and give the military \u201cthe resources and training they need to protect our nation and they are going to hunt down and destroy ISIS at its source.\u201d All of this, however, will have to go through Congress and while there is agreement on broad strokes, some Republicans disagree with certain aspects of Trump\u2019s plan. Democrats are watching Trump\u2019s victory tour with a mix of glee and dread. While many are reeling from defeat last month, those tasked with rebutting the President-elect see his promises as an avenue to tweak him once he steps into the White House on January 20. Schumer: If Republicans repeal Obamacare, \u2018they will own it\u2019 Paul Begala, a longtime Clinton adviser and CNN contributor, said that the transition period is usually the time that candidates \u201ctry to ease off on the afterburners\u201d and tell the American people that their promise are going to be difficult to achieve. \u201cHe did not, I mean he\u2019ll still in overdrive,\u201d Begala said. \u201cAnd if I were a Trump adviser I would still worry that we are going to over promise and under deliver. And he really set the bar high.\u201d Begala, who advises Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, added: \u201cBelieve me, my Democrats are recording every minute of (these promises) on videotape.\u201d",

Keith Ellison is looking to give a boost to his bid to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee by announcing Wednesday that he is willing to walk away from his Congressional seat if he gets the job. \u201cIn order to further their commitment and maximize my effectiveness, I have decided to resign as a member of Congress if I win the election for DNC chair,\u201d he said in a statement. Ellison has been dogged by questions about whether he could fully focus on rebuilding the Democratic party while also working full-time in Congress. The most recent DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, represented a Florida Congressional district while heading the organization. Other people interested in the job include Jaime Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley. Ellison also has faced recent accusations of anti-Semitism from a prominent Democratic donor, Haim Saban, who called him an \u201canti-Semite\u201d at a conference last week. \u201cIf you go back to his positions, his papers, his speeches, the way he has voted, he is clearly an anti-Semite and anti-Israel individual,\u201d donor Haim Saban said at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Saban Forum. \u201cWords matter and actions matter more. Keith Ellison would be a disaster for the relationship between the Jewish community and the Democratic Party.\u201d A CNN KFile review of Ellison\u2019s past writings and public statements reveal his repeated defense of Louis Farrakhan and other black leaders against accusations of anti-Semitism.

Bernie Sanders won the Democratic primaries in Wisconsin and Michigan Donald Trump's campaign manager said Sanders softened Hillary Clinton's base Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she believes the race would have been tougher for the President-elect had Hillary Clinton chosen Bernie Sanders as her running mate. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Conway on \u201cState of the Union\u201d if she thought the Vermont independent and primary challenger to Hillary Clinton would have made her job tougher had he been added to the Democratic ticket. \u201cYes,\u201d she told Tapper during a special edition of CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d filmed at Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cAnd Bernie Sanders \u2013 I\u2019d also like to publicly thank Bernie Sanders for his effect on our campaign because he softened up Hillary Clinton. He won 22 states and 13 million voters, and that ain\u2019t nothing.\u201d Sanders beat Clinton in the Democratic primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 states that Trump won in the general election. But Conway said those Sanders supporters didn\u2019t fully come around for the former secretary of state even after Sanders endorsed her and she won the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cThe fact is his supporters were still out there protesting her,\u201d Conway told Tapper in a conversation that included Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. \u201cHe was in \u2013 he was in the hall being, you know, a dutiful Democratic Convention soldier, but his \u2013 his supporters were not.\u201d RELATED: Robby Mook: Trump benefited from Russia \u2018intervening in the election\u2019 Both former campaign managers were in Boston for several events dedicated to analyzing the presidential election, which ended last month with Trump\u2019s upset victory. \u201cAnd you saw on Election Day, if you read the polls, that still many of them were upset by the way that (Sanders) was treated and that their views that they took to the table were never really assimilated into the Clinton-Kaine campaign,\u201d she added. \u201cI assumed her choice of (Virginia Sen.) Tim Kaine had something to do with Virginia, but it may have had something to do with not being overshadowed.\u201d Sanders \u2013 who was popular with millennial voters and working class white voters \u2013 was originally included on a list of possible vice presidential candidates. Clinton struggled with both of those groups throughout her campaign. But Clinton ultimately went with Kaine. \u201cThe decision about who should be your vice president should be a decision about who you think is ready to do the job and who you can see as a partner,\u201d Mook said. \u201cYou know, someone down the hall that you can call on to work with you.  And that\u2019s how Hillary approached this, and I assume that\u2019s how Donald Trump approached this as well.\u201d The former secretary of state believed that Kaine represented her \u201cviews and values\u201d best. \u201cAt the end of the day, she felt like Tim Kaine would represent her views and values if, God forbid, he had to become president; that he had the background and preparation to do the job.

            "article_content": "NEW: Pelosi, who has run the House Democratic caucus for the last 14 years, was re-elected Wednesday Tim Ryan challenged Nancy Pelosi for her post as House Minority Leader House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi defeated Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan \u200eto retain her post as the top elected Democrat in the House during a closed-door meeting Wednesday. The final vote was 134 to 63 for Pelosi, meaning she matched her prediction that she\u2019d retain the support of two-thirds of House Democrats. But it also means that close to one-third of the diminished group voted for a change in leadership after getting beat again on Election Day. Pelosi brushed aside those concerns Wednesday, telling CNN, \u201cThey weren\u2019t defections, I got two-thirds of the vote.\u201d The veteran leader, who has led the group since 2003 through three Republican House speakers and her own tenure at the top, said she viewed Wednesday\u2019s battle as a chance to start winning again. \u201cMy heart is broken that we didn\u2019t win the White House this time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know how to win elections, we\u2019ve done in in the past and will do it again.\u201d Even though he fell far short of toppling Pelosi, Ryan still claimed some victories Wednesday \u2013 including a dispersal of power inside the House Democratic Caucus and plans to focus on the economic, bread-and-butter issues that many Democrats say Donald Trump swiped from them in the election. \u201cI am proud that my bid for Democratic Leader pushed our members to have these tough family discussions about our future and how we win back the majority in 2018,\u201d Ryan said in the statement. \u201cI am also pleased to see that Leader Pelosi will adopt my proposal to expand leadership by creating a position for Freshman members and to bring back the power to the Committees by creating Vice-Chair/Vice- Ranking Member positions.\u201d House Democrats ended up winning six more seats than they had before, whittling the Republican lead in the House down to 239-194, but they fell far short of expectations \u2013 some of which, at a few high points during the fall, had them possibly recapturing the chamber. At least one Republican saw the results as a positive for the GOP. \u201cWhat a relief. I was worried they had learned from the elections & might be competitive and cohesive again,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted immediately after news of the results broke. What a relief. I was worried they had learned from the elections & might be competitive and cohesive again. https://t.co/cvwi0IxLdU Ryan, who has considered running for higher office in the past, including the US Senate seat held by Sherrod Brown, would not rule out a run for governor of Ohio when asked Wednesday. Governor races across the country remain one of the few potential bright spots for the Democrats coming off of November\u2019s defeats. \u201cI think I could make a big difference pulling those Trump voters back because those are the voters who voted for me,\u201d Ryan told reporters Tuesday evening. Pelosi, showing confidence, declined to address the caucus before the vote, letting surrogates talk on her behalf. After the vote, she addressed the caucus again but sources said she did not mention Ryan\u2019s name. At a press conference, she later congratulated him. House Democrats voted by secret ballot. Although there has been some grumbling in recent years about the refusal of top House Democratic leaders, who are mostly in their 70\u2019s, to provide chances for newer members, this race featured a rare public airing of that fight in the days leading up to the vote. Both Ryan and Pelosi called, emailed and met with their colleagues to make their pitches on why they should lead a demoralized caucus, which is still searching for a strategy for dealing with President-elect Trump and a strengthened Republican-led Congress next year. Ryan, 43, said Pelosi, a California Democrat who is 76, has limited appeal in the heartland and other working-class areas where Democrats lost badly this fall. For the most part, Pelosi had refused to engage in a back in forth with Ryan, but on Tuesday she fired back at the Ohio Democrat, who was a frequent surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in his home state, telling the Huffington Post in an interview, \u201che didn\u2019t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton.\u201d The minority leader insisted she had \u201cstrong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area.\u201d She brushed off his criticism that she can\u2019t appeal to voters in rural areas and on conservative media outlets, saying, \u201cYou know what? If you want to come interview me, I\u2019m happy to answer your questions about how we go forward. I\u2019m not going to pay attention to, \u2018I can\u2019t step in a union hall.\u2019 I\u2019m a woman of steel in there. \u2026 I\u2019m constantly invited by the unions to go to their meetings. That\u2019s just not, it\u2019s just not true.\u201d Ryan had about a dozen public supporters within the caucus going into the meeting, which will include over 190 members in the next Congress, but still claimed before the vote that he is \u201cwithin striking distance.\u201d Many of Pelosi\u2019s allies say she has deep support and her record-breaking fundraising skills are a quality members need to be competitive in 2018. She has already proposed some reforms to caucus rules to respond to the push from newer members that there are few opportunities to advance.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden's name floated as a possible Democratic National Committee chair How long will GOP lawmakers' \"Kumbaya\" moment last with Donald Trump? From VP to DNC? Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s possible role leading the Democratic Party, potential conflicts of interest for Donald Trump as commander in chief, and the GOP\u2019s \u201cKumbaya\u201d moment with the incoming leader and how long it will last. It\u2019s all in the \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast \u2013 where you get a taste of tomorrow\u2019s news today. It was the post-election narrative almost no one saw coming: The Democrats are picking up the pieces and considering revamping the party. A possible surprise pick for DNC chair? Their goal is to win back those voters who went Trump\u2019s way. As The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reports, one name that\u2019s been floated as a possible Democratic National Committee chair: Biden, the outgoing vice president. \u201cThere are a lot of people who think that he would be the sort of perfect voice toward the white working-class voters who the party is looking to attract,\u201d Haberman said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication that this is what Biden wants, but it is something that is being talked about right now.\u201d The President-elect has agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits dealing with Trump University. But will this case be the first of many possible corporate wrenches thrown into Trump\u2019s White House? Trump University isn\u2019t the only possible hiccup, according to Errol Louis, host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1 news channel. Trump's possible commander in chief conflicts \u201c40 Wall St., which is by far the most successful of the real estate deals that still has Trump\u2019s name on it, was the place where Trump University was headquartered,\u201d Louis said. \u201cBut there are also a couple of dozen other places where prosecutors have either convicted or investigated various people,\u201d he said, referring to investigations of alleged scams tied to the Manhattan skyscraper. \u201d. \u2026 It raises an interesting kind of conflict. Can the sitting president be earning money from people who his same federal government is supposed to be investigating, prosecuting, pursuing and in some cases prosecuting and imprisoning?\u201d Republicans on the Hill are all smiles right now as they wait for their incoming leader. But behind the scenes, they are also trying to determine what type of president  Trump will be legislatively. As Caitlin Huey-Burns of RealClear Politics puts it: \u201cThey don\u2019t really know him that well.\u201d Huey-Burns said, \u201cThey are still at odds (when it comes to) a lot of significant policy issues that are going to come out, perhaps, right off the gate. \u201cGovernment spending, when it comes to infrastructure projects, foreign policy, when it comes to Russia, and touching entitlements and those sorts of things; we\u2019ll be watching how Republicans navigate this new Trump world.\u201d We all know the President-elect likes to tweet. In his recent appearance on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he called it \u201ctremendous\u201d and a \u201cmodern form of communication.\u201d But as Philip Bump of The Washington Post notes, how Trump tweets may say a lot about how he\u2019ll transition from candidate to commander in chief. Bump said he\u2019ll be watching. \u201cThe way he interacts with the media, the way he keeps floating various rumors about his Cabinet picks, the way he gets into weird fights on Twitter continually, even as President-elect \u2026,\u201d Bump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be interesting to watch this transitional period, how he uses social media, how he uses rumors, as an indicator of how he\u2019ll actually be once he\u2019s President.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Pompeo has made his mark in the House as a conservative voice on national security issues The Kansas lawmaker was a strong critic of the Iran nuclear deal Donald Trump will nominate Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo to be his CIA director, the President-elect\u2019s transition team announced Friday. \u201cHe has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens,\u201d Trump said Friday in a statement. \u201cHe will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.\u201d Colleague, transcripts offer closer look to old allegations of racism against Sen. Jeff Sessions Pompeo announced Friday evening that he accepted the nomination, saying in a statement that he\u2019s \u201chonored\u201d and \u201chumbled\u201d by the president-elect\u2019s decision. \u201cThis was a difficult decision. I have genuinely loved representing the people of Kansas in Congress \u2013 working to make our community stronger and more prosperous,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut ultimately the opportunity to lead the world\u2019s finest intelligence warriors, who labor tirelessly to keep this nation and Kansas safe, is a call to service I cannot ignore.\u201d Pompeo has made his mark during his three terms in the House as a conservative voice on national security issues. Speaker John Boehner viewed him as a rising star and tapped him to serve on the House Intelligence Committee and the Select Committee on Benghazi, both posts that usually go to more senior members.  He also got a coveted seat on the Energy and Commerce panel and has proposed measures regarding energy production. He staked a tougher line on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton than some other Republicans. Pompeo was one of a handful of conservatives who argued House Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy did not go far enough in his report on Clinton earlier this year. The Kansas lawmaker was a strong critic of the Iran nuclear deal and introduced several bills focused on security concerns about the Iranian government, including one bill raising concerns about the cooperation between Russia and Iran. Pompeo backed Sen. Marco Rubio in the primary and criticized Trump from the right, but later developed a relationship with the Trump campaign. The campaign called him every once in a while to get advice on key national security issues, and during the vice presidential debate, Pompeo was a surrogate for Vice President-elect Mike Pence. After the elections, Pompeo met with Trump, including earlier this week in New York where they talked about the job. Trump seems to have trusted his gut that Pompeo was best suited for the role. Pompeo met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Pence, the leader of Trump\u2019s transition, at the Capitol Thursday. He declined to comment on their meeting as he left. The Kansas Republican becomes the first member of the House tapped by Trump, although Republican Reps. Jeb Hensarling and Tom Price both met with the President-elect this week and are being mentioned for other Cabinet positions. Giving up two years of your life for the 2016 campaign One of Pompeo\u2019s close friends and mentors on Capitol Hill was Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence panel. Rogers, who some considered as a possible pick for the CIA post, left the Trump transition team earlier this week after the President-elect removed those on the committee with ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Democrats were quick to paint Pompeo as a member who touted the party line, a quality they worried about for a nominee for the top intelligence post. \u201cThe Department of Justice and the CIA need nonpartisan leaders the American people can trust implicitly. Yet Congressman Mike Pompeo, a leading cheerleader of the Benghazi witch hunt, is now being asked to fill one of the most serious and sober national security positions there is,\u201d House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Friday. Before joining Congress, Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point. Pompeo was a classmate of Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s at Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review \u2013 although he declined to support Cruz in the Republican primaries. The selection of Pompeo rounds out a trio of national security picks Trump has made \u2013 including Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn for national security advisor that were announced Friday. Pompeo had considered running against Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran in the Senate Republican primary this year, but the Senate Republicans scrambled to prevent that. The National Republican Senatorial Committee hired a retired FBI agent to dig up dirt against him. And numerous senators, as well as Speaker Paul Ryan, urged him to stay out. Pompeo ultimately released a scathing statement when he decided not to run. Democratic groups blasted Pompeo\u2019s selection Friday. They cited Pompeo\u2019s allegations in 2013 that Muslim Americans do not speak out enough against terror attacks and could therefore be \u201cpotentially complicit\u201d in those attacks. \u201cThat mindset is horribly wrong when it comes to views of civil rights and civil liberties of Muslim Americans. Statements like those also further propaganda of radical terrorists, who, right now, are celebrating the election of Donald Trump, because they believe it will bring about a war of religions,\u201d said Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal group VoteVets.org. \u201cThis puts us all in extreme danger, but especially our troops, serving overseas.\u201d CNN\u2019s Mark Preston, Jim Acosta, John Berman, Sara Murray, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Bannon's interview largely didn't address the controversies surrounding the top Trump adviser It provided insight into the behind-the-scenes at Trump Tower Steve Bannon has no regrets. The ex-Breitbart executive, who serves as Trump\u2019s chief strategist for the new administration, told The Hollywood Reporter that \u201cdarkness is good.\u201d \u201cDick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That\u2019s power. It only helps us when they (liberals) get it wrong. When they\u2019re blind to who we are and what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said in an interview published Friday, his first outside of Breitbart since the election. Briebart News, which Bannon has been associated with since its start in 2007, has been vehemently pro-Trump throughout his presidential campaign, and is also known for pushing nationalist policy positions, as well as conspiracy theories, and has been criticized as being racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. The interview largely didn\u2019t address Bannon\u2019s previous controversies, though he denied being a \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d RELATED: Donald Trump settles Trump University lawsuits \u201cI\u2019m a nationalist. I\u2019m an economic nationalist,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f\u2014ed over. If (the Trump White House delivers), we\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years. That\u2019s what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It\u2019s not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.\u201d RELATED: What is Donald Trump\u2019s staff doing in Washington? Bannon also said he wanted to scrap the establishment Republican Party and start anew with Trump\u2019s movement. \u201cLike (Andrew) Jackson\u2019s populism, we\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. I\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2013 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d He also said he was a strong follower of Trump\u2019s leadership, adding that the way he speaks helped his message and to get him elected. RELATED: Civil rights groups denounce Sessions as AG \u201cHe gets it; he gets it intuitively,\u201d Bannon said about Trump. \u201cYou have probably the greatest orator since William Jennings Bryan, coupled with an economic populist message and two political parties that are so owned by the donors that they don\u2019t speak to their audience.\u201d He said he always knew that former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would lose the election. \u201cI knew that she couldn\u2019t close,\u201d he said. \u201cThey outspent us 10 to one, had 10 times more people and had all the media with them, but I kept saying it doesn\u2019t matter, they got it all wrong, we\u2019ve got this locked.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President-elect Donald Trump will find himself with an unlikely ally if he makes good on his promise to be an economic populist challenging corporate America, Bernie Sanders said Thursday. \u201cIf Mr. Trump has the guts to stand up to those corporations,\u201d said the former Democratic presidential candidate, \u201che will have an ally with me.\u201d The willingness on the part of Sanders, a longtime democratic socialist, to work with Trump on a series of economic issues underscores the unorthodox and strikingly populist message that Trump used during his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton. Sanders, speaking with reporters at a Christian Science Monitor sponsored breakfast, said he is ready to embrace Trump on a handful of campaign promises. Those include protecting Social Security and Medicare, negotiating for lower drug prices, raising the minimum wage to $10, imposing tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas, and re-regulating Wall Street by re-establishing Glass-Steagall. On these issues, Trump\u2019s promises put the President-elect closer to Sanders than to most Republican Party leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for example, would not commit to passing Trump\u2019s tariff plan during a Sunday appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union with Jake Tapper,\u201d saying that the solution is reforming the US tax code, \u201cnot tariffs, not trade wars.\u201d By embracing Trump\u2019s left-leaning stands, Sanders is hoping to make progress on issues of long-standing concern to the Vermont senator. If Trump backs away from these promises and sides with the conventional conservatives who lead the Republican Party in Congress, Sanders believes that Trump will be exposed as a \u201cfraud.\u201d Sanders, who is promoting his new book, \u201cOur Revolution: A Future To Believe In,\u201d during a series of appearances across Washington, is stepping into the leadership vacuum of the Democratic Party. He said it was not productive to look backward, waving off a question about whether he could have defeated Trump if he had won the Democratic nomination with a \u201cwho knows?\u201d response. Long-running tensions between Sanders and Clinton have not fully cooled. Sanders said he had not spoken directly with Clinton following her loss, but only on conference call with other Senate Democrats. Several Clinton advisers have blamed the primary campaign with Sanders for weakening Clinton\u2019s candidacy in the general election, a suggestion Sanders dismissed. \u201cAt the end of the day, my candidacy ended up being helpful to her \u2013 if we believe candidates should not be anointed,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to say my campaign brought millions of people into the political process, the vast majority of whom ended up voting for Hillary Clinton. I think it played a very positive role.\u201d Sanders said Clinton \u201chas a very important role to play\u201d in rebuilding the Democratic Party, noting that she received more votes than Trump. \u201cDoes that mean she and I are going to agree on every issue?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFrankly, we are not going to agree on every issue, but her voice is important to be heard.\u201d Even as Sanders offers to work with Trump on the populist components of his economic program, critical differences remain. Sanders is calling on Trump to fire Steve Bannon, the controversial former Breitbart executive who was recently named chief strategist of the Trump White House. Sanders is promising to fight Trump \u201ctooth and nail\u201d on climate change, an issue that Trump has dismissed as a \u201choax.\u201d The Vermont senator opposes Trump\u2019s tax policy, which would cut taxes for the top 1% of earners by $317,000 per year, according to the Tax Policy Center. And Sanders said it would be \u201can outrage\u201d that would \u201ccompletely divide the country\u201d if Trump were to make good on his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to \u201clock up\u201d Clinton. But on a series of bread-and-butter issues, Sanders said that Trump\u2019s campaign spoke to the concerns of the working class and promised to work with the President-elect \u201cif Mr. Trump was sincere.\u201d Asked by CNN about Trump\u2019s call to establish tariffs on companies that relocate jobs overseas, a promise that Trump set forth in his \u201cContract with the American Voter,\u201d Sanders said that Trump was right to stand up to corporations like Carrier and Nabisco that want to outsource jobs and vowed to work with Trump on this issue. \u201cA tariff may well be one of those options,\u201d Sanders said. \u201c(Trump) talked about a collapsing middle class in America,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cHe is right.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sanders said Democrats must focus on winning over working-class voters The demonstration was initially organized to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership Bernie Sanders is back on the stump. The independent senator from Vermont, who has emerged as a party leader in the aftermath of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat last week, said Thursday that progressives must dedicate themselves to winning over voters who turned to Donald Trump on Election Day. In a speech to hundreds of supporters and activists gathered on a chilly fall afternoon in Washington, Sanders pinned Trump\u2019s victory on the Democratic establishment\u2019s failure to engage with millions of Americans who feel forgotten by political leaders and hemmed in by stagnant local economies. \u201cThe party has got to recognize some very important realities that Donald Trump, in fact, recognized,\u201d Sanders said, keeping up a drumbeat he began last week in a New York Times op-ed and has returned to in a round of subsequent appearances. \u201cAnd that is, yes, we are better off today economically than we were eight years ago, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in a lot of areas. But there are millions and millions of people today, working-class people, middle-class people, who are living in despair. And we have got to recognize that reality.\u201d Sanders campaigned heartily for Clinton after she clinched the Democratic nomination this summer, but as the American left begins to consider its options in the wake of a slow-building electoral wipeout \u2013 Republicans now control the White House, both chambers of Congress, and dominate state politics \u2013 he and the movement that fueled his campaign are moving quickly to grab hold of the party. \u201cThere is a lot of pain in America,\u201d Sanders said in a short speech just a few hundred feet from his Senate office. \u201cCapitol Hill doesn\u2019t understand it \u2013 we do. And we are going to reach out to those brothers and sisters (who voted for Trump) and work with them.\u201d The organizers behind the rally, which was planned months before the election and initially slated as a demonstration against the the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pact President Barack Obama has championed but has been rejected by many progressives who are leery of expansive free trade bill. But as if to further underscore the odd, partisan-defying moment, the deal is now all but dead \u2013 thanks in large part to Trump\u2019s opposition. Activists in Upper Senate Park on Thursday wrestled with the irony, some by arguing that the President-elect had hijacked the economic populist movement they had resurrected. \u201cTPP was stopped because of you and Donald Trump had nothing to do with it,\u201d Tefere Gebre, the executive vice president of the AFL-CIO, told the crowd. \u201cWorking together, we made the TPP toxic for politicians. Then opportunistic politicians tried to jump on the bandwagon and say, \u2018I was there too.\u2019\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat and Sanders ally, congratulated activists on defeating a wide range of \u201cforces arrayed against us,\u201d including \u201cfinancial institutions, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the president of the United States, pharmaceutical industries, and big agriculture industries.\u201d \u201cThey thought we couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we certainly showed them.\u201d Before former Ohio state senator Nina Turner took the stage to begin emceeing duties, RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, confessed she and the group, which organized the event, had not expected such a swift or politically confounding victory. \u201cI wasn\u2019t anticipating this and I wasn\u2019t thinking of this when we planned the rally,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019re very, very excited about (the turnout). Millions of people want to engage. We\u2019re not seeing a falloff in terms of energy.\u201d On the same afternoon Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan formalized his plans to challenge to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, DeMoro argued that the power center in liberal politics had already shifted \u2013 and that while Sanders stood as progressives\u2019 \u201cfundamental leader,\u201d it would not rely on him for direction at every step. \u201c(Sanders) has has millions looking to him for hope and direction \u2013 he\u2019s critical,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving said that, the movie was there before Bernie. Bernie was able to galvanize the movement. The movement got much, much stronger. So while Bernie is critical, the movement exists, the movement has a life of its own.\u201d Two hours later, a group of about 25 union nurses walked a half-mile south to the Longworth House Office Building, passed through metal detectors, took elevators to the second floor, and gathered around the entryway to House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office. With a letter \u2013 and piece of pie \u2013 in hand, they asked a staffer if Ryan was available to discuss their opposition to his longstanding plans to remake Medicare. \u201cPaul is not here right now,\u201d he informed them politely, and then after exchanging contact information, closed the heavy wood door behind him.",

            "article_content": "Schumer, Trump know one another well The new Senate minority leader is willing to deal, but also to fight The battle for America\u2019s political soul could come down to a street brawl between two boys from Queens and Brooklyn. Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer are spoiling for a clash once the President-elect takes office next year and the new Democratic Senate minority leader gets his hands on his caucus after winning election on Wednesday. Trump's America Schumer had hoped to be directing a Senate majority to implement Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda, but the stunning upset in last week\u2019s election means he is the lone hope for Democrats as they resist an unexpected Republican presidency and GOP dominance on Capitol Hill. \u201cChuck Schumer is going to be the single most influential Democrat in Washington,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top aide to retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. \u201cHe is, as leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, the only thing standing between the Trump-Ryan legislative agenda and those who are opposed.\u201d Trump and Schumer \u2013 both flamboyant, media savvy, outspoken, deal-making larger-than-life New York personalities have history. In fact, Schumer is one of the few political figures in Washington who Trump actually knows well, and the billionaire contributed to several of his new rival\u2019s election campaigns. Schumer even rode to Trump\u2019s defense when he got embroiled in a primary spat earlier this year with Ted Cruz over \u201cNew York values.\u201d Schumer (Brooklyn) and Trump (Queens, then Manhattan), had common cause against the Texas senator. Schumer could never have expected he would be matching wits against Trump in the White House \u2013 but the next stage of their political relationship promises to be one of the most intriguing stories of 2017. Given their common experience in the New York fishbowl, where business and politics mix, both probably have an idea of what makes the other tick. That alone contrasts with the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who lacked a common political language. McConnell would prefer to work with Vice President Joe Biden instead. Skirmishes between Trump and Schumer will also reflect the ironic influence of the elite East Coast haven of New York on top-level politics in Washington \u2013 after an election decided in the industrial heartlands of the Rust Belt. Reid blasts Trump for hiring Bannon Trump, with his reality television background, promises to dominate the conversation once he moves to Washington in January. But in Schumer, Democrats also possess a megaphone, and a contrast to the soft-spoken Machiavellian Reid, who was more of an inside player. Schumer\u2019s facility with the media led to the Washington cliche that the most dangerous place in the city was between him and a camera, but in recent years he has refashioned his image and spent less time in television green rooms. He\u2019s promoted other Democrats from his spot on the party\u2019s Senate Democratic leadership team and become a more rounded political figure. \u201cHe has become a much more serious legislator and I think Republicans understand that,\u201d Manley said. Still, Schumer\u2019s capacity to drive a sharp political message and sense of shifting political winds will be vital to Democrats as they climb off the canvas. Schumer the politician is known as a schmoozer, who is willing to engage the other side but to also fight tenaciously. Schumer \u201chas generally worked well with Republicans even though he can be a fierce partisan,\u201d said Jim Kessler, who was a senior aide to Schumer on Capitol Hill for eight years and now is senior vice president for policy at Third Way. \u201cHe has a belief that politics is a rough sport but it can be played fairly and cleanly. If you play the game that way even if you take a shot at him he feels that it is fair and doesn\u2019t ruin the relationship,\u201d Kessler said. If it comes to a knife fight with Trump, Schumer is unlikely to shirk from a confrontation and will marshall his Democrats behind him. \u201cThis is a guy \u2013 he wants to win,\u201d said Jim Battista, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo, New York, where Schumer is a fixture at commencement ceremonies. \u201cIt\u2019s not much use being the minority leader, if \u2026 he is not winning.\u201d Still, if common ground does emerge in the new Washington, Schumer is likely to explore it. In recent years, he has built relationships with Republicans like Sen John Cornyn of Texas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. And it\u2019s likely his interactions with McConnell will not be as publicly acidic as those between Reid and the Republican leader in recent years. The Democratic leader in waiting\u2019s first task is to restore equilibrium to his traumatized party. By January, he must chart a strategy for their efforts next year to emerge as a roadblock to Trump and to salvage as much as they can of Obama\u2019s legacy by wielding the Senate filibuster. Then, Schumer must steel his party for a tough set of re-election races in the mid-terms in 2018. Clinton in emotional post-election speech: 'Coming here tonight wasn't the easiest' Fresh from his uncontested election on Wednesday, the product of years of behind-the-scenes maneuvering that speaks to Schumer\u2019s political shrewdness, the New York senator vowed to stand firm against Trump but to also seek areas where the next president and Democrats can work together. \u201cWhen we can agree on issues, then we\u2019re going to work with them,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve also said to the President-elect on issues where we disagree, you can expect a strong and tough fight.\u201d Possible common ground includes Trump\u2019s proposals for a massive infrastructure building program and a plan to censure China for what critics says is currency manipulation. But hopes for cooperation hit a reality check this week, with the appointment to a top White House job of Stephen Bannon, a Trump ally who has links to the white nationalist movement. The move alarmed some Democrats because it appeared to suggest that the Trump administration would embrace some of the darker aspects of the Republican\u2019s campaign \u2014 but it also energized a party that had spent the days since the election wallowing in grief. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep a really careful eye on the president and on him. If they do anything from this day forward \u2013 they\u2019ve done so much awful from this day back \u2013 and we\u2019re going to go after them in terms of bigotry,\u201d Schumer said. One of Schumer\u2019s most important duties \u2013 as the effective leader of his party in Washington, will be to repair Democratic links to blue collar and middle class Midwestern voters who defected to Trump. With that in mind, he expanded the Senate Democratic leadership team to include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose populist primary campaign tapped into the sense of economic malaise and anti-establishment fervor exploited by Trump. Schumer\u2019s critics have long pointed to his ties to Wall Street finance and big money donors to question his fealty to working class Democratic values. But Kessler said no one in American politics has a better understanding of the economic challenges facing voters. \u201cHe has the best intuitive sense of the middle class of any politician I have ever met,\u201d said Kessler. Climate change worries escalate as Trump elevates top deniers \u201cHe comes from the middle class, he still lives in a middle class area, and he obsesses about them and their well being. If there was ideology called middle class it would be his.\u201d As he reaches out to disaffected Democratic voters, Schumer might be influenced by his own dealings with economically challenged areas of his own state, where he won a thumping 70% of votes in his re-election race. \u201cHe\u2019s a broadly seen as a Manhattan guy who is working at not appearing so much of a Manhattan guy,\u201d said Battista, who said Schumer had taken pains to understand the concerns of Western New York, including campaigns to keep the Buffalo Bills from relocating. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who has always seemed to be comfortable sitting down and talking to the Rust Beltier parts of New York.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Nicole Gaouette contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Tim Ryan is weighing a challenge to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Ryan says Democrats need new messaging to win over working-class voters Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 whose name has been floated as a potential opponent to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s re-election bid \u2013 said Wednesday that he hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to mount a Democratic leadership challenge but that he believes Democrats need a shake-up. \u201cLook, the Obamas are gone. The Clintons are gone. The Bidens are gone. Harry Reid is gone. There\u2019s no one at the (Democratic National Committee) now. We\u2019ve got to \u2013 we\u2019ve got to say, what\u2019s America 2.0 look like?\u201d Ryan said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to re-evaluate what we\u2019re doing as Democrats, especially in the congressional campaign,\u201d the Ohio Democrat said. Asked by CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow whether he was planning on challenging Pelosi when Democrats hold their leadership elections after the Thanksgiving break, Ryan was coy. \u201cThat\u2019s the conversation we\u2019re having right now. My main goal was to get the election delayed. We were supposed to have it tomorrow, and now it\u2019s delayed for a couple weeks so we can actually have that conversation,\u201d Ryan said. Pelosi formally announced Wednesday in a letter to supporters that she was seeking re-election. \u201cIt is with both humility and confidence that I write to request your support for House Democratic Leader,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAs of this writing, I am pleased to report the support of more than two-thirds of the Caucus.\u201d Ryan was careful to also express his admiration for Pelosi and said he didn\u2019t blame her for Democrats\u2019 stinging losses in 2016. Rep. Tim Ryan calls Trump's Bannon pick 'disgusting' \u201cLet me just say, I love Nancy Pelosi. She\u2019s an amazing woman. She\u2019s got more energy than probably half of our Democratic caucus and is a terrific fundraiser, and I don\u2019t blame her for the past election. It wasn\u2019t her fault. We did get caught up in a national wave.\u201d And Ryan said he hadn\u2019t yet decided whom to support in the race for chair of the DNC, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for all\u201d the candidates and that \u201cI don\u2019t have a horse in that race yet.\u201d Ryan also discussed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen Bannon as a senior adviser, a move assailed by critics who have accused Bannon of catering to white supremacists and nationalists in his former role as chief of Breitbart News. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very, very hard to work with,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI can see a scenario where there\u2019s going to be a lot of Democrats who aren\u2019t going to want to be in meetings or want to work with Trump if that guy is in the room.\u201d He continued, \u201cFirst and foremost, it would be very helpful if he didn\u2019t appoint somebody or give someone a very high position that was very sympathetic to white supremacist groups.\u201d Ryan said that \u201cthere are things we would work with him on,\u201d such as reforming campaign finance and passing an infrastructure spending bill. But he added, \u201cIf he pushed this right-wing agenda, we\u2019re going to fight him every step of the way.\u201d The Democrat also sketched out his vision for the kind of messaging he believes Democrats should adopt, stressing the importance of speaking to the kinds of working-class voters who carried Trump to the White House. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about job retraining. People don\u2019t want to hear about running a computer. They want to \u2013 they want you to talk to them about how they can run machinery, or run a back hoe or sling concrete block. That\u2019s what they want to do. So we need an agenda for Democrats that speaks to those workers,\u201d Ryan said. He pointed to the renewable energy industry as an example of an issue Democrats could seize on to recapture those voters. \u201cI don\u2019t think we talked about it enough. There are 8,000 component parts to a windmill. There\u2019s gear shifts, hydraulics. These things need to be manufactured. And if the United States of America says we\u2019re going in on a clean-energy economy, and we are going to manufacture those products \u2013 in coal country, in Youngstown, Ohio, in the industrial Midwest, in the Great Lakes region \u2013 I mean, that is what we do in that region. We make those. So we need national policies that are going to allow us to get there.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders expressed his disappointment Monday with Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to secure the support of white working-class voters in last week\u2019s presidential election. Donald Trump \u201cvery effectively\u201d tapped into \u201cthe anger and angst and pain that many working class people are feeling,\u201d the Vermont independent senator who challenged Clinton in the Democratic primary said on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cI think that there needs to be a profound change in the way the Democratic Party does business,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is not good enough to have a liberal elite. I come from the white working class, and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.\u201d Sanders did point out that Trump shouldn\u2019t overstate his mandate since the Democratic presidential nominee has a clear lead in the national popular vote. Sanders not only believes the Democratic party needs to change but uses this as an opportunity to back Congressman Keith Ellison for the Democratic National Committee Chair position, saying this \u201camong other reasons is why I\u2019m supporting Keith Ellison who will shake up the Democratic Party.\u201d Sanders will give President-elect Trump a chance to live up to his promises. \u201cWe will hold Mr. Trump accountable.

            "article_content": "She said the first letter from Comey stopped her momentum She said the FBI development was too much to \"overcome\" Hillary Clinton told donors in a conference call Saturday that FBI Director James Comey delivered a double whammy to her candidacy in the final days of the campaign by taking another look at emails related to Clinton\u2019s private server before abruptly saying he found no wrongdoing. A member of her national finance committee who was on the call told CNN that Clinton placed at least some of the blame on Comey for her stunning defeat to Donald Trump. She said the first letter from Comey, sent to Congress on October 28, stopped the momentum she had built after three debates and the release of Trump\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. She said the second letter, which came nine days later and exonerated Clinton, simply fired up Trump supporters and didn\u2019t put any on-the-fence voters who had been leaning her way at ease. She said the FBI development was too much to \u201covercome,\u201d the donor on the call told CNN, but she acknowledged there were other headwinds facing her campaign that they didn\u2019t adequately combat. But several Democrats interviewed in the aftermath of the election say Clinton is hardly blameless, pointing to her original decision in 2009 to create a private email server outside of government systems during her time as secretary of state. \u201cIf there had been no private server in the first place there would not have been an FBI investigation,\u201d Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic strategist, wrote in a Twitter message on Saturday. On the call, Clinton urged supporters to move forward and keep fighting for their beliefs. The conversation, which lasted about 30 minutes, was not open to the press. Another Democrat on the call said Clinton described the loss as \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d As she said in her concession speech Wednesday, Clinton told supporters that she was sorry for not being able to defeat Trump. The call was far from a full accounting of the stunning upset, but rather a chance for Clinton to thank her supporters directly after the hard-fought campaign. She was not overtly critical of Trump, two participants on the call told CNN, but she did urge those to rise up and continue fighting against divisive rhetoric targeting immigrants and others. She did not engage in a back-and-forth over other factors that contributed to her loss, including what many Democrats said was a failure to articulate an economic message that appealed to working-class voters across the Rust Belt.",

            "article_content": "Those who agreed with both campaigns may have decided the election Clinton's appeal among white working-class voters was especially weak Nearly 18 million voters cast ballots this election despite believing that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton were qualified to be president. It was an astonishing dilemma created by two campaigns whose dominant message was that their opponent was unfit. Those who agreed with both campaigns may have decided the election. This disillusioned group \u2013 14% of all voters \u2013 broke heavily for Trump: 69% to 15%, according to exit polls. About 1 in 7 in this group voted for someone other than the major party candidates. Most were independent voters, with 38% Republicans and 18% Democrats. Had they sat out the election instead, Clinton would have won in a landslide with 53% of the vote to Trump\u2019s 44%. Further evidence of this disillusionment can perhaps be found in total voter turnout; while votes are still being counted, early indications are that turnout is on par with its lowest rate in 20 years. As both parties scour the exit polls for answers, they may have trouble distinguishing between fundamental shifts in the electorate and a strong distaste for both candidates. Voters who expressed negative feelings for both choices broke in Trump\u2019s favor. Of the 29% of voters who said neither candidate was honest, 45% voted for Trump compared to 40% for Clinton. Of those who had concerns or fears about both candidates, 49% voted for Trump while only 29% voted for Clinton. These findings suggest both the persistent negative attacks worked so well that some voters agreed with both campaigns. Voters who held their nose in the voting booth appear to have preferred someone new over someone who had been in politics for decades. Among this disaffected group, 44% favored change while only 13% prioritized experience. Beyond this group of voters, Clinton lagged behind other Democratic nominees in recent elections among groups that make up the party\u2019s base. She failed to make up that group with voters outside that core. Despite her prospect of being the first female president, her share of the female vote at 54% was no better than average. Her support among men \u2013 at 41% \u2013 fell nine points from 2008 and was the worst showing for a Democrat since her husband Bill Clinton ran for office in 1992, when he was able to win with the support of just 43% of voters because the general election was split three ways between him, Republican George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot. While it\u2019s no surprise that African-American voters were more enthusiastic for Obama than for Democrats in other recent elections, even Al Gore in his failed 2000 bid garnered 90% of the black vote compared to Clinton\u2019s 88%. Among younger voters, Clinton\u2019s appeal was closer to John Kerry\u2019s 54% than Obama\u2019s 66% in 2008. And union voters, long a bastion of the Democratic base, broke for Clinton by a 51% to 44% margin, the worst for a Democrat since Ronald Reagan\u2019s election in 1980. Her support among white voters \u2013 at 37% \u2013 was the lowest for any Democrat in the past seven elections. Her husband, Bill Clinton, garnered 39% of the white vote in 1992, while Obama got 43% in 2008. Clinton did better than average among college graduates, including hitting 45% among white voters with college degrees, the best showing for a Democrat since exit polling began in 1972. But she did worse with voters without a college degree \u2013 44% \u2013 than any Democrat since her husband in 1992. Her appeal among white working-class voters was especially weak. Just 28% of white voters without degrees backed Clinton, again the worst performance for a Democrat in exit poll history. Trump, meanwhile, hit a new high among white evangelicals, carrying 81% of those votes, better than Mitt Romney, John McCain or George W. Bush.",

            "article_content": "The primary exposed the divide between progressive and centrist wings of the Democratic Party Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will play leading roles The sting of defeat is still fresh. But Democrats are embarking on a soul-searching exercise to determine how they ended up in the political wilderness, losing the House, the Senate and the White House at a time when President Barack Obama\u2019s approval ratings are at record highs. How Clinton spent the morning after her concession Hillary Clinton may very well still win the popular vote, and there are myriad theories about why Democrats fell short when it came to electoral college math: inaccurate polling and modeling, an unprecedented surge of white voters for Trump, Clinton\u2019s failure to ignite enough enthusiasm and excitement among women, blacks and Latinos. But the former secretary of state\u2019s stunning losses in the Rust Belt spoke to deeper problems facing a Democratic Party that has become unmoored from its roots. Most stark in the results was the party\u2019s disconnect from white working-class voters. The primary exposed the deep divide between the progressive and centrist wings of the party, which clearly have not healed. And strategists learned the hard way just how difficult it is to replicate the Obama coalition without the President at the top of the ticket. As they sift through the results, most baffling to some Democrats was how some voters who supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 ended up backing Trump. As Clinton retreated to private life in Chappaqua, New York, and the President prepares to leave office, it was clear that there was no consensus about who should lead the party, or even lead the discussion about where the party needs to go after Tuesday. Trump calls Obama \u2018a very good man\u2019 Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will play leading roles. But there are broad policy disagreements among them, as well as competing objectives.  Schumer, for example, must keep his eye on the 2018 races when he will have slew of Democrats up for re-election in conservative states. Clinton\u2019s unexpected losses in industrial states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 as well as the razor-edge race in Michigan, which CNN has not called \u2014 underscored the view of Democratic strategists who privately complained throughout 2016 that Clinton hadn\u2019t found a message that connected with working-class Americans. Though polls showed many Latinos and women were repelled by Trump before Election Day, Trump actually slightly outperformed Mitt Romney among Latinos. And Clinton drew a slightly smaller share of women to the polls than Obama did in 2012, according to exit polls. She won the lowest share of union households of any Democrat since 1980 \u2013 notching 51% of union households to Trump\u2019s 43%, according to exit polls. By comparison, Obama won 59% of union households in 2008. Trump\u2019s campaign was vacuous. Many of his policy proposals were unachievable, even in the eyes of his supporters. Yet his populist message struck a chord with voters across the ideological spectrum. \u201cClearly what this election demonstrated \u2013 from the primaries through the general election \u2013 was that the centrist, more moderate wing of the (Democratic) party has no standing with working class and middle class voters in this country,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, who was campaign manager for Clinton\u2019s Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the progressive wing to reassert themselves and offer a bold agenda to the American people,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThe real losers in this campaign were the Democratic and Republican establishments. People clearly wanted change. Trump became the vehicle for that change in the general election. I think many people voted for him in spite of his outrageous positions, as opposed to in favor of them. So we need to demonstrate to people that we stand with them, not with the wealthy and powerful.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s America Though Clinton was raised in a middle-class household familiar with economic struggles, she never managed to find a message that connected with struggling working class families. That was particularly ironic considering she ran against a billionaire who lives in the penthouse of a gold plated tower. Long before Trump was viewed as a real contender, Bill Burton, a former adviser to Obama, recalled discussing the message challenges facing Democrats in 2016 as far as two years ago. He argued then that no one would be able to recreate the Obama coalition, because Obama was simply a uniquely talented candidate and \u201cspecial guy.\u201d Democrats already knew at that time, he said, that they had a problem with middle-class white voters \u201cthat we\u2019re not paying attention to.\u201d He believed that if the party didn\u2019t fix that, they couldn\u2019t win. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Burton said in an interview Thursday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t win a race where we didn\u2019t have enough white voters to make up for the gaps in the Obama coalition. There\u2019s any number of reasons for that \u2013 from (FBI Director) James Comey to Donald Trump having a message that appealed in middle America.\u201d Kaine: \u2018This isn\u2019t a time to give up\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of soul searching, and there\u2019s no one answer for it \u2013 anyone who suggests that there is, is just wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2020, we\u2019ve got to be thinking about a coalition of voters that builds on the Obama coalition to the best that we can, but also reaches out to a big group of voters in the middle of the country who feel like they\u2019ve been left behind.\u201d The conversation about how to do that will unfold over many months, after operatives and activists have time to digest the data and missteps from this campaign. One early proxy for the internal struggles of the party will be the election of the party\u2019s chair next year. On Thursday, Sanders said he would back Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota as the next chair of the Democratic National Committee and attributed Tuesday\u2019s losses to a lack of enthusiasm. Bernie Sanders on if he would have won: \u2018What good does it do now?\u2019 Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean pointed to what he views as party infrastructure problems Thursday, as he also threw his hat into the ring for party chair. \u201cThe Dems need organization and focus on the young,\u201d Dean tweeted. \u201cNeed a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.\u201d Donna Brazile is currently serving as the party\u2019s interim chair through March 2017 after stepping in replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz in July when Wikileaks released emails showing that Democratic officials tried to help Clinton clinch the nomination, instead of playing the role of neutral arbiter in determining the nominee. Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Hilary Rosen noted that the margins in battleground states where Clinton lost were relatively close, making the discussion about what to do even more complex. Many Democrats were stunned by the fact that Clinton and Trump were separated by only about a percentage point in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin\u2014and the race in Michigan still looks even closer than that. Sanders supporters noted it was hard to imagine him losing states like that in the Industrial Midwest. (Obama won Michigan, which is still too close to call, by 9.5 percentage points in 2012). \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think even a win would have masked, though it would have masked it more easily, is the divide between center left and left\u201d in the party, said Rosen, a Clinton supporter. She noted that many Sanders supporters will argue he might have done more to galvanize young voters and the Democratic base, but that could have come at the expense of votes from independents and centrists that Clinton won. Team Trump is already filled with Washington insiders In the annals of history, the election may be remembered as having been decided by Pennsylvania, Wisconsin \u2013 which nudged Trump over 270 electoral votes \u2013 and Michigan, where the vote count continues. When Trump\u2019s advantage in those three states is tallied, it currently amounts to close to 110,000 votes out of tens of millions that were cast (the final turnout figure may not be known for some time). \u201cBy virtue of those 110,000 votes, we\u2019re now going to have the conversation in the Democratic Party that we thought the Republicans were going to have in their party,\u201d Rosen said.

            "article_content": "Many Democrats believe the list should begin with this: Clinton and her campaign Advisers close to Clinton are trying to get ahead of a bitter round of finger-pointing The high command of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign believe there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around for their stunning loss to Donald Trump. They\u2019re pointing fingers at FBI Director James Comey, unfair media coverage and voters resistant to electing the first woman president. But many Democrats believe the list should begin with this: Clinton and her campaign. As a new political order falls over Washington, advisers close to Clinton are trying to get ahead of a bitter round of finger-pointing inside a newly-decimated Democratic Party. In a conference call with top donors Friday, campaign chairman John Podesta said a \u201chostile press corps\u201d contributed to Clinton\u2019s defeat. Other top advisers said Comey\u2019s decision to take another look at Clinton\u2019s emails stopped the campaign\u2019s momentum and motivated Trump voters. That bombshell contributed to a significant fall-off among college educated voters \u201cwho fizzled at the end,\u201d an adviser said. Those voters, always wavering about Clinton, were simply turned off at the end. Democrats try to pick up the pieces The call on Friday, which was described to CNN by several participants, did not specifically address one of the biggest questions many Democrats have: How did Clinton allow Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to fall away from the party? Clinton is expected to hold a conference call of her own later Friday with donors and other supporters, CNN has learned, to offer her first explanation of the crushing defeat. The campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement Friday that \u201cno one anticipated\u201d losing. She said many factors were at work, but she listed Comey as chief among them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t blame everyone but ourselves,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cWe acknowledged a lot of challenges we faced, plenty of mistakes made along the way, some challenges we weren\u2019t able to overcome.\u201d She added: \u201cWhat changed in the last week that made his turn out go up and our\u2019s go down?  The only thing apparent was Comey. It was one thing too many. Could not overcome it.\u201d Democrats close to Bill Clinton said Thursday that one mistake Clinton\u2019s top aides made was not listening to the former president more when he urged the campaign to spend more time focusing on disaffected white, working class voters. Many in Clinton\u2019s campaign viewed these voters as Trump\u2019s base, people so committed to the Republican nominee that no amount of visits or messaging could sway them. Clinton made no visits to Wisconsin as the Democratic nominee, and only pushed a late charge in Michigan once internal polling showed the race tightening. Bill Clinton, advisers said, pushed the campaign early on to focus on these voters, many of whom helped elected him twice to the White House. The former president, a Clinton aide said, would regularly call Robby Mook to talk about strategy and offer advice. But aides said the Clinton campaign\u2019s top strategists largely ignored the former president, instead focusing on consolidating the base of voters that helped elect President Barack Obama to the White House. In the closing days of the campaign, Clinton targeted young people, Hispanics and African-Americans with laser like focus, casting Trump as a racist who only sought the presidency to benefit himself. Sanders pushes Keith Ellison for DNC chair as Howard Dean plans run As Tuesday night\u2019s results rolled in, those voters seemingly didn\u2019t do enough to propel Clinton past the wall of white, working class people who backed Trump. Clinton\u2019s internal polling was also off. Days before the election, Clinton\u2019s internal polling showed Clinton up by four points in Michigan, according to an aide. \u201cIt\u2019s is nothing short of malpractice that her campaign didn\u2019t look at the electoral college and put substantial resources in states like Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Neither Clinton nor Obama visited Wisconsin once during the general election campaign. The state voted Republican for the first time in a presidential race since 1984. Wisconsin is emerging as one case study for where the Clinton campaign fell short. She won voters under 30 by just 4 points, according to exit polls, while Obama won them by 23 points four years ago. An aide said Friday that the campaign\u2019s top staffers understood they couldn\u2019t \u201crecreate the Obama coalition\u201d exactly, but deeply felt that \u201ccollege educated whites would be part of a new coalition for her.\u201d \u201cIn the end, that did not materialize in big enough numbers in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania,\u201d the aide said. Another aide pointed to Pennsylvania \u2013 a state Clinton visited 11 times after the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia \u2013 as proof that more visits would not have helped. Asked if there was anything they could have done in states like Michigan and Wisconsin to beat Trump, a top aide offered: \u201cNot had Comey send his letter.\u201d",

But Clinton\u2019s chief rival for the Democratic nomination was in no mood to question Clinton\u2019s campaign or whether he himself could have fared better in a general election. Asked by CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer whether he would\u2019ve brought Democrats to the White House, Sanders smiled before bellowing. \u201cWhat good does it do now?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it makes a whole lot of sense to do Monday-morning-quarterbacking right now. The election is over. Donald Trump won.\u201d Sanders said he felt Clinton was likely to win, but acknowledged that Trump had made a connection with working-class voters that kept him competitive. He said he had not yet phoned Clinton to discuss the race, and acknowledged, \u201cI owe her a call.\u201d He promised to work with Trump on several issues that unite them \u2013 a more protectionist trade policy, fixing America\u2019s tax code and enacting campaign-finance reform. Sanders said Americans upset with Trump\u2019s election have a right to be angry, but called for that anger to be channeled in a positive way. \u201cI hope that on those areas where Trump talked about the needs \u2013 where he was right, the middle class is hurting \u2013 let\u2019s work together to improve lives for millions of people who are living in despair and who have the right to do better than they are today,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cTrump talked about his concerns about outsourcing, about a bad trade policy. If he is serious about reforming our trade policies and creating jobs, let us work with him.\u201d The Democratic presidential nominee also declined to rule out even discussing a 2020 bid, saying voters are tired from the last campaign and are no longer interested in diving back into the electoral process. \u201cThe last thing in this world in this never-ending campaign we have not even sworn in this president is to talk about 2020,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLet\u2019s not go there at all.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she and Donald Trump share concerns about a rigged economy Warren said Trump's campaign pledges run counter to congressional GOP leaders' stances Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered an extraordinary pledge Thursday to work with President-elect Donald Trump on economic issues, declaring that \u201cthe truth is that people have a right to be angry.\u201d The firebrand Massachusetts liberal \u2013 derided as \u201cPocahontas\u201d by Trump during the presidential campaign \u2013 said at an AFL-CIO event that she and Trump share a sense that the economy is rigged against working Americans. Warren was one of Trump\u2019s chief antagonists on the campaign trail. Now, though, many Democrats are looking to her to fill the massive leadership void suddenly facing the party. Warren said she and Trump are on the same page about the need to invest in infrastructure, reform campaign finance laws and crack down on Wall Street and big banks. \u201cHe spoke to the very real sense that millions of Americans have that their government and their economy has abandoned them, and he promised to rebuild this economy for working people,\u201d Warren said of Trump. It is, she said, \u201cnot a liberal worry or a conservative worry. It is not a Democratic worry or a Republican worry. It is the worry that led even Americans with deep reservations about Donald Trump\u2019s temperament and fitness to vote for him anyway.\u201d \u201cWhen President-elect Trump wants to take on these issues \u2013 when his goal is to increase the economic security of middle-class families \u2013 then count me in,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI will push aside our differences and I will work with him to achieve that goal.\u201d Warren\u2019s comments come on the same day Trump was in Washington to meet with President Barack Obama, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. She echoed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, another frequent Trump critic who said Wednesday that she could work with the Republican President-elect on infrastructure spending. Warren said Trump\u2019s brand of populism is a major departure from Ryan and McConnell, the Republican congressional leaders. She said the congressional GOP\u2019s approach to the issues she highlighted was \u201crejected \u2013 rejected by their own primary voters, rejected during the campaign and rejected during Tuesday\u2019s election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "From the beginning, everyone underestimated Donald Trump. He pulled off a stunning victory after the most unprecedented of presidential campaigns. Trump channeled the fury of average Americans against Washington. He tapped into their anxiety about the present and the fear of the future. He spoke to the pain they felt about working hard and getting left behind. And in doing so, he eviscerated every convention about politics. The pundits thought Trump\u2019s reality show antics, his vulgar rhetoric, speeches filled with falsehoods and insults thrown at almost every sector of American society \u2013 Latinos, African Americans, war heroes, women and Muslims \u2013 would disqualify him from the presidency. It didn\u2019t. Instead Trump marshaled a movement \u2013 a modern day uprising of forgotten Americans, reminiscent of Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201csilent majority\u201d of the late 1960s. How Clinton lost He argued that Americans were hungering for change and that he alone could \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d by sweeping away corruption in Washington. Trump said he would change the complexion of the electoral map \u2013 putting Democratic states in the decaying industrial Midwest into the Republican column with his anti-trade rhetoric. He did. He said he could humble the most talented Republican field in a generation: He did. He said he could teach Republicans to beat their nemesis \u2013 the Clintons. He did. He said the polls were wrong and that he would pull off a surprise that would dwarf the shocking poll-defying Brexit vote in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. And he was right. Trump\u2019s rewriting of the rules of politics could usher in a period of global turmoil and uncertainty, as US allies, foreign markets and the Americans who were revolted by his behavior during the campaign look to the future with deep anxiety. How politicians, pollsters and media missed Trump\u2019s groundswell The question now, is when he becomes the most powerful man in the world in January, whether Trump will try to rewrite the rules and conventions of American government and the international system, just as fundamentally as he rewrote the rules of American presidential elections. Trump pledged unity during a victory speech in the early morning hours Wednesday. \u201cI say it is time for us to come together as one united people,\u201d he said. \u201cI pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.\u201d Still, Trump pulled off one of the most staggering upsets in the history of Western democracy. As recently as a month ago, pundits were still contemplating the possibility of a Hillary Clinton landslide. But the polls began to tighten, returning the race to a more accurate reflection of a deeply polarized country. Then came uncertainty as FBI Director James Comey cast a new cloud of suspicion over Clinton\u2019s campaign, reopening a review of emails tied to her server. Clinton allies said the damage was undeniable \u2013 their hope of swaying those final persuadable Republican women and independents \u2013 suddenly looked bleaker. As late as this weekend, the polls suggested Trump would have to run a near perfect race and chart a very narrow path to the White House, essentially pulling an inside straight. Somehow the candidate \u2013 who relied almost entirely on the Republican National Committee for his ground game \u2013 outmanned the Clinton campaign. The results Tuesday night stunned strategists from both parties. Many of the supporters who had gathered for Clinton\u2019s celebration in New York were shocked, some of them crying as they watched the states roll in for Trump. Early on Tuesday, Obama\u2019s former chief strategist, David Plouffe, tweeted a picture of vodka and Orange Crush, with the optimistic message: \u201cReady to watch her victory speech.\u201d Eight hours later, Plouffe tweeted that he had never \u201cbeen as wrong on anything\u201d in his life. \u201cStill a beating heart in WI, and the two (congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine). But sobriety about what happened tonight is essential.\u201d The world reacts to U.S. election results While Trump fueled an enormous amount of enthusiasm among working class voters and brought many new voters to the polls, many Republicans were also quick to credit the RNC, which essentially ran Trump\u2019s entire ground game. One Republican strategist noted that unlike in past campaigns, the GOP had permanent staff on the ground since the summer of 2013 in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. Working off the model of what the Obama campaign had done in 2008 and 2012, they spent the early days recruiting organizers and volunteers, testing their GOTV prowess in 2014. Over the past three years, they plowed money into voter registration and field staff \u2013 flipping ten counties in Florida, for example, from a Democratic advantage to a Republican advantage. GOP aides said they cut the voter registration disadvantage that Mitt Romney had in 2012 by half. Around the time of the Republican National Convention, the Trump campaign and the RNC forged an awkward alliance. Instead of building their own ground game, the Trump campaign looked at the infrastructure that the RNC had built to support the Republican nominee and agreed to work within that framework. Many of the voters drawn to Trump\u2019s campaign were new to the political process. So throughout the year, the RNC conducted countless trainings for phonebanking and door-knocking.",

Trump\u2019s defeat of Hillary Clinton turned on its head years of wisdom about how campaigns operate, how America\u2019s demographics are changing and how a controversial nominee can affect down-ballot candidates. Here are the five biggest surprises of Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning: The polls were wrong. Projection models were wrong. Veterans of previous presidential campaigns were wrong. Trump\u2019s victory is one of the most stunning upsets in American political history. American voters swept Republicans into power, handing the GOP the White House, the Senate and the House in a wave that no one saw coming. Political professionals will now spend the coming weeks and months studying just how and why everyone missed it. See full results Overwhelming support from white, working-class voters swept Trump to victory. Most important: Democrats\u2019 so-called \u201cBlue Wall\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin crumbled, with Trump winning two of the three outright, and leading in Michigan in the early Wednesday hours. Democrats won urban areas, as usual. But Clinton ran far behind President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 numbers in exurban America. And in rural regions, white voters supported Trump by margins that often topped 40 percentage points. In some places, it was the \u201chidden\u201d Trump supporters the campaign had touted but polls never found. Elsewhere, it was Democratic turnout falling off from 2012 levels. The difference was particularly evident in states where Clinton had struggled in the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders, whose protectionist message on trade largely matched Trump\u2019s. Or, at least, strong turnout from new Latino voters and support from college-educated women was nowhere near enough to match Trump\u2019s strength with white voters. Clinton was hurt by a downtick in African American turnout, which had helped Obama. But her loss also reflected the reality for a Democratic Party that has drifted leftward and relied more heavily on an urban base in the Obama years. \u201cBlue dogs\u201d \u2013 conservative Democrats \u2013 are gone. And the working-class voters who used to support politicians like Bill Clinton were nowhere to be found for Hillary Clinton. Read more: Why Clinton lost Clinton\u2019s campaign infrastructure was as impressive as any ever assembled. It had targeted, identified and reached crucial voters in battleground states. She\u2019d also outspent Trump on TV ads, set up many more field offices, and dispatched more staff to swing states, much earlier. Trump, meanwhile, ran a scattershot organization, entirely reliant on the Republican National Committee for all get-out-the-vote operations. None of it mattered. Or, perhaps, it did \u2013 Clinton, after all, won Nevada, a testament to the left\u2019s organizing prowess, and she came close in Florida after racking up huge leads in the heavily populated, heavily Latino southeastern portion of the state. But it was not enough. Clinton\u2019s operation didn\u2019t catch problem areas in the Rust Belt. By the time Clinton and Obama made last-minute visits to Michigan this week and closed the campaign in Philadelphia on Monday night, it was too late. Republicans everywhere assumed Trump would be a drag on the party\u2019s hopes of keeping Senate control. He wasn\u2019t. At all. And in some states, Trump appears to have helped Republicans. He had coattails, outperforming the GOP Senate candidates in Indiana and Missouri, and ran roughly even with those in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Wisconsin. The results suggested there just weren\u2019t many split-ticket voters \u2013 a reality that would have terrified Republican senators prior to the election, but that turned out to work in the party\u2019s advantage. \u201cDemocrats believed they had the golden ticket when Donald Trump officially earned the nomination,\u201d Ward Baker, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a memo early Wednesday morning. \u201cThey worked to nationalize every race \u2013 and when the bottom fell out of Clinton\u2019s candidacy, they had no message, no strategy, and no ability to pivot to local issues.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump's voters showed up on Tuesday The states had given Democrats 242 electoral votes Donald Trump on Tuesday eviscerated a piece of conventional wisdom that had become demographic and Democratic gospel in recent cycles: that blue states will always be blue states. That bedrock belief, which Republicans and Democrats had shorthanded to \u201cthe Blue Wall,\u201d was torn asunder as Trump romped through a series of Great Lakes states that had been Democratic cornerstones for decades. A trio of reliably Democratic states won by Trump, or with a Trump lead as of Wednesday morning \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 were never assumed to be a given, but every Clinton path to the White House took the Blue Wall as the starting point for any path by Hillary Clinton to 270 electoral votes. A fourth, Minnesota, showed just a slim lead for Clinton, and was too close to call by Wednesday morning. The 18 states and the District of Columbia that have supported Democrats for president since 1992 gave Democrats 242 electoral votes \u2013 placing Clinton only 28 votes away from clinching the nomination. Analysts on both sides of the aisle spent most of the past months devising the path of least resistance for obtaining that margin. 5 surprising lessons from Trump's astonishing win Tuesday made that exercise a fool\u2019s errand. Trump outright won two of the three \u2013 Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 and leads narrowly in the third, Michigan. The last time Republicans won in Wisconsin? 1984. The last time they won Michigan? 1988. The last time in Pennsylvania? Also 1988. And the last time Minnesota went red? 1972. Powered by an energized white working-class who dot small towns across those states, a Republican wave swept across and crumbled that wall. Trump\u2019s message on trade channeled a dissatisfaction with the de-industrialization that has changed the economy in the Rust Belt, and results show that it resonated on Tuesday evening. His voters showed up. Election Day in America Clinton was also not as popular with white voters as Obama was. She won only 37% of the white vote, compared to Obama\u2019s 39%. Surprisingly, Trump also garnered a slightly smaller share than Mitt Romney, capturing 58% of the vote to Romney\u2019s 59%. Republicans have striven for cycles to flip some of those states, particularly George W. Bush, who made efforts during his presidency to take Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But their position behind the wall was fortified each time GOP candidates tried to win them \u2013 and failed. Democrats, too, took the states largely for granted this cycle. Pennsylvania, to be sure, was pegged as a top-tier battleground from virtually the first day of the general election. Clinton did not visit Wisconsin a single time after the Democratic National Convention, and the state was not targeted for advertising during the final weeks. Pundits mocked Trump\u2019s last-minute trip to Minnesota. trAnd Michigan was largely overlooked for the entire race, scrambling in the final days to bring Clinton and President Barack Obama in a last-ditch effort to protect their turf. By that point, it appears, it was too late. CNN\u2019s Tami Lubhy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "72-year-old Webber teaches kids at a private school in the Syrian capital He and many of his students back Hillary Clinton, though Trump is also popular All agree that the outcome will have an important impact on war-torn Syria's future Every Thursday in the Syrian capital, a group of 9th graders meet for a debate club with a difference. These teenage students at Damascus\u2019 French school live in relative calm in the government-controlled city, while much of their country is engulfed in a brutal civil war. Once a week, their attention is focused thousands of miles away as they discuss the race for the White House with their English teacher \u2013 an American who has lived in Damascus for more than 40 years. New York State-born Thomas Webber says all the Syrians he knows are following this US election closely. Last \u2018True American\u2019 in Damascus doesn\u2019t want to leave \u201dThey are very well informed as they all know that Syria\u2019s future is in the hands of our new president. In each dinner party or get-together, US politics is the only subject we talk about,\u201d he told CNN by email. His students, aged between 13 and 15, are no exception. \u201dNo matter who the next president is, I hope they have good plans for the future of our country and the world,\u201d 14-year-old Hasan Latch told CNN in a video filmed on his classmate\u2019s phone. Echoing the regime catchall designation of the rebels as terrorists, Hassiba Nizameddin, 14, told CNN in a video message that Syria has been \u201csuffering from terrorism for almost six years. \u201dI would support the candidate that gives us hope in ending this war.\u201d Ashley Youssef, also 14, said she\u2019s following the campaign because she has relatives in the US. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t like to see anything bad happen to them or their country,\u201d she said in a video filmed by her classmate Asma Sukkar. \u201cI\u2019m also afraid that Syrians will have more difficulties traveling to America. The elections are very important to me, because they could affect my country as well, especially its security. The way we live in Syria depends on the new US president.\u201d Asma, who recently returned to Damascus after four years in Canada and Lebanon, says she enjoys learning about politics and listening to the candidates\u2019 answers in the debates. Clinton: Evidence that Trump is a gift for ISIS Her 72-year-old teacher watched all the presidential debates, which started at 4 a.m. in Damascus, and has already cast his absentee ballot in the battleground state of Ohio where he is legally resident. \u201cSo many people said it was the lesser of two evils. I didn\u2019t feel that was the case,\u201d Webber told CNN in a video message. \u201cI looked at the candidate that gave us the most experience, and especially the experience on an international basis. And that was definitely Hillary Clinton.\u201d Trump saying he would contest a Clinton win is \u201canti-American,\u201d Webber adds. Some of his students, however, admire the Republican candidate. Speaking in a class discussion filmed and shared with CNN, 14-year old Carmen Nahat said that if she had a vote, she\u2019d choose Donald Trump. \u201dI like the way he speaks, he speaks with enthusiasm,\u201d she said, while another classmate thought Trump would be better for Syria. Trump on Syria: How stupid is our country? A non-American\u2019s guide to US election Teddy Batal, 13, and 14-year old Jude Dirawi told the class Clinton would get their vote because of her experience. They felt the election of the first female American president would show that there is \u201dno difference between men and women.\u201d \u201dBut it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like Trump,\u201d they added. \u201dWe just think Clinton is better.\u201d Dirawi told CNN he hopes whoever wins will \u201dbring back security all over the world, and especially in America.\u201d But not everyone was so enthusiastic. Referencing Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, 14-year-old Dani Abouharb felt \u201dany candidate who has a lot of racism against Muslims and Arabs is not a good choice for Syria.\u201d Being Muslim American in the year of Donald Trump The teenagers at the private Lycee Charles de Gaulle are the children of the Syrian capital\u2019s professional classes and high earners. Webber says most parents are successful business people, while others are part of the cultural elite. The students\u2019 expensive, uninterrupted education highlights the deep division in Syria after a grinding war that has left more than 250,000 people dead and millions more displaced inside and outside Syria\u2019s borders. Millions of children and teenagers are experiencing the war very differently depending on which part of the country they live in. The United Nations and other international organizations speak of a \u201dlost generation\u201d of young Syrians growing up under the constant threat of regime airstrikes, in refugee camps or working instead of going to school. But those growing up in the relatively stable government-controlled parts of Syria are experiencing some semblance of a normal childhood, although many also have to contend with regular rebel attacks. Little boy in Aleppo a vivid reminder of war\u2019s horror The United Nations estimates that 60% of the population in Syria live in areas controlled by the government. \u201dWe\u2019re just like everyone else,\u201d Asma Sukkar and her classmate Hassiba Nizameddin told CNN by video. \u201dWe don\u2019t live in ashes like people think. We have houses, we have roofs. We eat, study, sleep. We listen to music, watch TV, just like the rest of the world. Syrians are not different.\u201d For Webber, there is no contradiction between living and working in government-held Damascus and voting for a candidate who has been very critical of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and who advocates a no-fly zone in parts of the country. \u201dShe\u2019s talking hawkish but she\u2019s a dove inside,\u201d he told CNN, speaking by phone from Damascus. \u201dIt\u2019s not going to be her decision alone to do anything major in Syria, her activities will be controlled and influenced by the House, the Senate, her Secretary of State.\u2019 \u201dI\u2019m very proud that I made my vote in this very important election. Every vote counts in America.\u201d US-backed forces launch bid to seize ISIS \u2018capital\u2019 Raqqa",

            "article_content": "Suspect is dead and was heavily armed, police say Family told police he had been \"bingeing on cocaine\" The man suspected of fatally shooting one man and wounding two women Tuesday near a Southern California polling station had been \u201cbingeing on cocaine,\u201d police said. The 45-year-old suspect lived in Azusa, a suburb of Los Angeles, where the shooting happened. His family told police that he had been heavily using cocaine and that they left to get away from him on Monday night. On Tuesday afternoon, the man opened fire in his neighborhood and began shooting at random cars and passersby, killing his 77-year-old neighbor and wounding a woman, police said. He later ambushed police when they arrived on scene, said Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The third victim may have been hit during the ensuing gunfire \u2013 leaving two women, ages 65 and 59, in critical condition. One of the women was shot in the face, and the other in the torso. Police said they had no identities for the three victims. Hours after the shooting began, the unidentified suspect was found dead in his home, police said. He appeared to have been shot by police. The shooting happened near a polling place, triggering a lockdown at the Memorial Park North Recreation Center, where voters had come to cast their ballots. Investigators have ruled out any connection between the shooting and Tuesday\u2019s elections, Corina said. LIVE: Election results and coverage \u201cIt was a coincidence, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an elementary school nearby, it didn\u2019t involve the school either.\u201d Officers responded to calls about gunshots being fired and found several victims on the street, said acting Azusa Police Chief Steve Hunt. The suspect, who was wearing military-style gear, walked up and down the street shooting people and was heavily armed, carrying a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun, authorities said. \u201cThe suspect shot at officers when they arrived on scene, causing them to return fire,\u201d Corina said. Five Azusa Police Department officers and one officer from the neighboring city of Irwindale fired back, he said. 1st arriving officers arrived/found multiple shooting victims.. they came under fire... Multiple ofcrs returned fire All officers initially pinned down by gunfire are accounted for, safe and rescued Situation has transitioned from active to barricade/containment... All those near scene shelter in place all others stay out of the area The suspect was formerly in the military and had been a city employee in Orange County, police said. Earlier, Azusa police said they were looking for a female suspect, but Corina told reporters at a late news conference that there was no evidence of another shooter. Police searched yards in surrounding homes just to be sure there were no other victims or suspects. The shots rang out in a working-class neighborhood, with well-kept front yards at mostly single family homes. The shootout happened right across from Memorial Park. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice neighborhood,\u201d said resident Jason Jonasson. \u201cMy wife, myself and the kids walk our dogs every night. My daughters play basketball here. It\u2019s safe.\u201d Two schools were locked down for hours following the shootings, and the polling center, along with another nearby, were \u201cimpacted,\u201d authorities said. Two voters who were inside the Memorial Park North Recreation Center when the shooting occurred spoke to CNN, but didn\u2019t want to give their names.   One voter said he was inside when he heard a bunch of shots ring out and people from outside rushed in before officials locked the doors. Another voter told CNN she also heard the shots. \u201cAt first, I thought it was construction but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest and a white shirt,\u201d she said. Officials later evacuated the building and some voters were directed to other sites to cast their ballots.

            "article_content": "Trump starts with four must-wins: Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa Here's a look at some scenarios in which Trump could get to 270 electoral votes Donald Trump\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes remains precarious \u2013 but with some breaks, he can get there. Trump\u2019s campaign has made clear exactly what its targets are. It is spending $25 million on TV ads in the final week of the campaign in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Those ad buys are based on the assumption that Trump doesn\u2019t need extra help to keep Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Texas or any other traditionally red state in the Republican column. Can Teleprompter Trump stay disciplined? Trump starts with four must-wins: Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa. Those \u2013 plus making sure he doesn\u2019t surrender other typically Republican states, and winning the one electoral vote that can come from Maine\u2019s Second Congressional District \u2013 get Trump to 260 electoral votes. \u201cWe believe 100% that we\u2019re winning all four of those. And once we do that, then we put ourselves in a position to win one of those other swing states,\u201d Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie said. The other targets include bigger states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia and Michigan, any one of which would put Trump over the top \u2013 and smaller states, Nevada, New Hampshire and New Mexico, of which he\u2019d have to win two. Those make up Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall, and Trump has to crack it somewhere. \u201cI think all of those, we are closer in some than others, but we\u2019re within the margin of error in many. We are fighting for every single vote,\u201d Bossie said. Here\u2019s a look at some scenarios in which Trump could get to 270 electoral votes: This one, according to polls, is probably Trump\u2019s best bet \u2013 but it\u2019s also one in which he has no margin for error. Trump could carry every state Mitt Romney won in 2012 (including North Carolina) and flip the Barack Obama states of Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire. How tight would this path be? So tight that Trump would also have to lock up Nebraska\u2019s Omaha-based congressional district and Maine\u2019s rural district to get those single electoral votes. This map places him at exactly 270, without a single electoral vote to spare: This is Trump\u2019s dream scenario, because it cracks Clinton\u2019s blue wall of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 which he hasn\u2019t been able to win in polls. In this map, Trump doesn\u2019t need to sweat tight races in Nevada or New Hampshire. As long as he locks in Florida and Ohio, he could afford a fumble like North Carolina, as well: Three smaller, fiercely independent states could tip from Clinton\u2019s column to Trump\u2019s if she loses many of the Republican-leaning voters who just aren\u2019t comfortable with Trump \u2013 not to the GOP nominee, but to Libertarian Gary Johnson. Those states are Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado \u2013 all places where Johnson has beaten his poll numbers from big swing states \u2013 and they\u2019d be enough for Trump to win: There are signs in the early vote numbers from North Carolina, Florida and Georgia that fewer black voters (who typically back Democrats) are turning out compared to previous election cycles \u2013 resulting in whiter electorates. That would help Trump in those three states \u2013 and could boost him in Michigan, too, where much of the Democratic vote comes from African-Americans in cities like Detroit and Flint: All of a sudden, the West could become much more competitive \u2013 with Trump securing Arizona and having a chance at flipping Florida, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico. This scenario would also lock up Florida for Trump, and would allow him to forget about New Hampshire: Forget Maine\u2019s Second District \u2013 perhaps Trump can flip the whole state. And he could take New Hampshire with him. In this scenario, Trump would vastly outperform expectations among suburban, middle-class voters \u2013 and win the election\u2019s biggest prize of all: the Philadelphia suburbs: CORRECTION: A map in an earlier version of this story mislabeled Florida. In the no-margin-for-error map, Florida would go to Clinton.",

            "article_content": "The best path to the White House for both candidates is via Tobacco Road Clinton is banking on support from African-American voters in a state Obama won in 2008 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump each campaigned Thursday in North Carolina, which is emerging as perhaps the state on which the 2016 presidential race turns. Clinton has held a small but persistent lead in the state in recent weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday showed Clinton ahead, 48% to Trump\u2019s 46%. It\u2019s made North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes Democrats\u2019 best chances of winning a state Mitt Romney carried \u2013 albeit by just 2 percentage points \u2013 in 2012. And for Trump, whose path to 270 electoral votes is already precarious, North Carolina is essentially a must-win \u2013 a test of whether he can turn out working-class white voters and survive organizational and TV ad spending disadvantages to the Clinton campaign. The races that could flip the Senate If Trump can\u2019t do it in North Carolina, he has little shot of remaining within striking distance of Clinton and pulling off the same feat in some combination of states like Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all even more difficult to win. Here\u2019s why North Carolina matters so much \u2013 and what to watch there in the days ahead: Every Trump path to 270 electoral votes starts with one reality: There are four battleground states he simply cannot afford to lose. \u201cOur path to victory is through Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Iowa. And we believe 100% that we\u2019re winning all four of those. And once we do that, then we put ourselves in a position to win one of those other swing states,\u201d Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie said this week. North Carolina is the only one of those four that Romney won in 2012 \u2013 yet it\u2019s also the one where Clinton\u2019s poll numbers are the best in 2016. Say Clinton wins North Carolina. Trump could win every other Romney state \u2013 plus Florida, Ohio and Iowa \u2013 and that still only puts him at 244 electoral votes. He\u2019s competitive elsewhere \u2013 in states like Nevada, Colorado in New Hampshire. He\u2019s bet big on Pennsylvania, and made a late push in Wisconsin. But none of those states alone would get him to 270 without North Carolina \u2013 and in most cases, even a combination of two of them wouldn\u2019t get him there. There\u2019s also the reality that Clinton outperforms Trump in most other battleground states by more than she does in North Carolina. If he loses North Carolina, it likely means he\u2019s already lost the election. One trend that has alarmed Democrats is a dip in African-American turnout across the country \u2013 particularly in states like North Carolina, Georgia and Florida \u2013 compared to the 2008 and 2012 elections. A surge in Latino voters has helped make up for it in some states, particularly in the West. But polls show the demography of the electorate is crucial: The more ethnically diverse a state\u2019s voters are, the better it is for Clinton; the whiter the state\u2019s electorate, the better for Trump. Clinton is leaning on President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to make the case to their African-American supporters that 2016 is just as important as the last two elections \u2013 particularly in North Carolina, a state that had been reliably Republican before Obama carried it in 2008 and nearly repeated the feat in 2012. \u201cIf the African-American vote is strong in North Carolina, then you will decide this election,\u201d Obama said in an interview with North Carolina-based WQMG radio on Thursday, adding that Clinton will win if the state\u2019s black turnout matches its 2012 numbers. \u201cYour vote from \u201908 and \u201812 will be negated if you don\u2019t vote this time out. This is what seals the deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cShow the country and the world this isn\u2019t just about me and my campaign or Michelle, but it\u2019s about a community that is empowered and wants its voice heard.\u201d Obama also raised the stakes Wednesday during a campaign stop on Clinton\u2019s behalf in North Carolina, saying: \u201cI hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.\u201d The backdrop for North Carolina\u2019s 2016 election is a lawsuit that voting rights advocates filed this week alleging that at least three counties have purged their voter rolls of a disproportionate number of African-American voters. NAACP files suit in North Carolina on voting registration purge The NAACP filed the lawsuit, arguing that boards of elections in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties have canceled thousands of voter registrations after a small number of individuals challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters based \u201cexclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.\u201d They argue the \u201cen masse\u201d cancellation was done in violation of the National Voter Registration Act that prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election. On Wednesday, US District Judge Loretta Biggs said North Carolina\u2019s process of removing voters sounds \u201cinsane\u201d and \u201clike something that was put together in 1901.\u201d But she has not yet ruled, with just days until the election. In 2012, 61% of North Carolina voters cast their ballots before Election Day \u2013 a number expected to rise this year. So far, early voting numbers, based on a breakdown of the party registration of those who have voted already, show Democrats have reason for worry. African-Americans made up 28% of the state\u2019s early voters at this point in 2012 \u2013 but are just 22.7% so far this year, according to data from CNN\u2019s partner Catalist. White voters, meanwhile, make up 73% of the state\u2019s electorate to date, compared to 67% at this point four years ago. Overall, though, Democrats still have a lead of 243,000 ballots cast so far in the early vote. But that\u2019s off their 2012 pace \u2013 when Democrats led at this point by 307,000 votes, and still lost the state to Romney. Perhaps the best evidence of North Carolina\u2019s importance is how much attention each campaign\u2019s top surrogates are paying it. Ivanka Trump was in the state Wednesday for an event. Clinton\u2019s campaign has sent the Democratic nominee herself, husband Bill Clinton and the Obamas there. It\u2019s also where Hillary Clinton held her first joint event with Michelle Obama of the 2016 campaign. The candidates are putting a particular emphasis on targeting millennials and North Carolina\u2019s swelling ranks of college graduates. President Obama\u2019s event Wednesday was at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The joint Hillary Clinton-Michelle Obama event was held at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem.",

Lawyers for the civil rights group argued that boards of elections in Beaufort, Moore and Cumberland counties had canceled thousands of voter registrations after a small number of individuals challenged the registration of approximately 4,500 voters based \u201cexclusively on mass mailings that were returned as undeliverable.\u201d They argued the \u201cen masse\u201d cancellation was done in violation of the National Voter Registration Act that prohibits systemic voter removal programs within 90 days of a federal election and that it disproportionately targeted African-American voters. \u201cThe court finds that a narrowly tailored injunction is warranted to ensure that eligible voters are not deprived of their right to participate in the upcoming election due to a flawed process engaged in by the State and County Boards,\u201d Biggs wrote. One plaintiff, James Edward Arthur Sr., said that he had planned to vote but recently learned that his voter registration was canceled, \u201cas a result of a third-party challenge brought under North Carolina\u2019s voter challenge statute.\u201d Grace Bell Hardison, a 100-year-old African-American woman living in Beaufort County is another plaintiff. In court papers the NAACP argued that she has voted in nearly every election for the last 12 years but recently learned that her registration was challenged based on an alleged change of residence \u2013 even though she hasn\u2019t moved since 2011. Her nephew was \u201cultimately successful\u201d in presenting evidence of her residence. The NAACP alleged the purge was done after first-class mail to the voter at the address listed on the voter registration card was returned. \u201cIn many cases, voters purged by defendants still reside at the address where they are registered to vote, or have moved within the county and remain eligible to vote there,\u201d NAACP lawyers argued. \u201cNonetheless, a single item of returned mail has resulted in their ultimate removal from the voter rolls.\u201d The Justice Department had weighed in on the case, telling the judge in court briefs that if the allegations made by the plaintiffs were true \u201csafeguards\u201d were absent and federal law was violated. Kimberly Westbrook Strach, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, says that the challenges at issue were not initiated with the counties, but by private individuals. Under North Carolina law any voter in a county can challenge the eligibility of any other county voter up to 25 days before the election. The challenge can include a residency challenge. Strach addressed the controversy in a letter sent last week to Dr. William J. Barber II, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. \u201cA challenge validly entered will trigger a preliminary hearing, written notice to the affected voter and a full hearing on the merits before the appointed members of the county board of elections.\u201d She said that in all the cases \u201ccounty officials indicate that their respective boards of elections held preliminary hearings, notified the challenged voters by mail, and held hearings on the merits.\u201d In the letter Strach emphasized that while the federal law prohibits a state from \u201cconducting systematic list maintenance within 90 days of a federal election,\u201d the challenges involved in the case come from private citizens and were resolved through a \u201cstatutory process that ensures notice and an opportunity to be heard before the appropriate body within the county.\u201d In a statement after the lawsuit was filed she said, \u201cthe statutes at issue are decades old and are common across the country and widely regarded as compatible with the National Voter Registration Act. If the plaintiffs are right, then most states are wrong.\u201d After the hearing, and even before the opinion was released, Strach issued a statement saying that, \u201cAs the independent agency that administers elections in North Carolina, we will comply with any court order.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Critical Counties is a CNN series exploring 11 counties around the country that chief national correspondent John King has identified as key in the 2016 election. These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Macomb County is the 10th county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties. Donald Trump has a big task. Not only does he need to dominate the swing states, but he needs to edge into blue territory. By many indications, Trump\u2019s campaign is looking for a Republican victory in Michigan. And the people of Macomb County, Michigan, could make or break that dream. This largely white county outside of Detroit has been pretty evenly divided in previous elections, although it swung for Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Now Trump\u2019s goal is to nip that more recent Democratic trend in the bud. He needs to turn out the Republican voters from suburbs like Macomb County and hope Democratic strongholds like Detroit stay at home. Early on, Trump signaled he would make a real play for the Rust Belt, working to appeal to the white working-class people the post-industrial economy has devastated. But to look at the polls in Michigan, that\u2019s been a tough sell. Members of Trump\u2019s campaign have pointed to Bernie Sanders\u2019 stunning victory in this state over Hillary Clinton as an indication the GOP can pull out an upset despite polling pointing otherwise. Another thing to keep in mind: There is no early voting without an excuse here, so Trump and Clinton have until Election Day to make their pitches to voters. It remains an open question whether the FBI\u2019s last-minute bombshell turned off Clinton voters, but if data from Google Trends are any indication, it\u2019s not the most pressing question voters have. As mentioned above, Macomb is a swing county, and it has swung far in its history. Faced with Republican 1964 nominee Barry Goldwater, the people here largely voted Democrat. Years later, the people of Macomb turned around and voted for Ronald Reagan\u2019s transformative Republican candidacy. And most recently, they split about evenly, but ultimately in favor of Obama.

            "article_content": "CNN spoke to Hillary Clinton supporters in Florida, Ohio They explain why they support the Democratic nominee The day after FBI Director James Comey dropped a grand piano on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, setting off a round of recriminations from top aides and allies, the candidate looked out on a happy-go-lucky assembly of supporters gathered in a small, sticky Daytona Beach gymnasium. If Comey\u2019s letter had resurrected the dreaded specter of Clinton\u2019s emails, her diehards in Florida, where she spent most of Saturday, were openly untroubled. They dutifully jeered Comey\u2019s name as Clinton called his decision and its timing \u201cpretty strange,\u201d but roared when she pivoted back to her usual fare \u2013 a promise to keep \u201cfocused on one thing, you and your families.\u201d Apart from the quick round of booing, the crowd here had little to say about the campaign\u2019s new b\u00eate noire. Minutes away from the historically black Bethune-Cookman University, this was a safe space. Her supporters in this coastal city \u2013 the kind of quiet loyalists who could vault her to the White House next week \u2013 didn\u2019t just take the FBI news in stride, they mostly strode right past it. Retired veteran Walter Browning, his \u201cOperation Iraqi Freedom\u201d cap tipped up high on his head, strained to explain just how little he cared. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the meat and potatoes. We don\u2019t want no more of the salad, let\u2019s talk about the meat and potatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about Hillary,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe hating don\u2019t really matter. You have the character of a person \u2013 everybody has dirt on them, everybody \u2013 but you have to focus on what that person can do. You look at their stats. Hillary? She gives you the opportunity.\u201d In the months since he emerged as the favorite to win the GOP nomination, Trump and his supporters have been scrutinized and psychoanalyzed, their motivations and \u201canxieties\u201d studied like the Dead Sea Scrolls of American politics. Why I\u2019m voting for Trump: CNN talks to 150 people in 31 cities Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s gravitational pull has been treated less like a force of nature than a mundane fact of life. It\u2019s understandable. For millions of Americans, her place in the firmament is fixed and the decades-long run-up to the 2016 election, with its unexpectedly rancorous primary and the lingering email server scandal, has cemented many of the less pleasing impressions of the former first lady, senator and secretary of state. But while the Trump voter is widely viewed as a man on a mission to reclaim some past greatness, the caricature of a Clinton voter manages to be both less distinct and more rigid. Ideology plays a part \u2013 but only up to a point. As a candidate, Barack Obama drew crowds to rival or exceed Trump\u2019s while pitching ideals that directly contradict the Republican nominee\u2019s performative pathos. Same for Bernie Sanders, who because of some topline similarities \u2013 mainly a broad economic populism and faddish personal brand \u2013 is too often conflated with Trump, or held up as a false conduit for Republicans making eyes at working-class Democrats. Clinton cannot play that game. In 2016, she has embraced her inner wonk and bet that voters would do the same. Victory next week would offer a fittingly paradoxical end to this daft campaign: the election of one of our most politically sane and rhetorically mild candidates. \u201cShe evokes a peacefulness in people,\u201d said Martha Massfeller, 58, after the Daytona Beach rally. \u201cIt\u2019s more hometown \u2013 she\u2019s seems more hometown to me. It\u2019s more grassroots. I love her \u2013 that\u2019s all I can say. I\u2019m just very proud, very proud.\u201d At the New Mount Olive Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Sunday, Clinton was received with glee. Rapturously, by some. The candidate is a Methodist, but she knows the room. And she said hello, smiling and in pious lavender, with a piece of scripture. \u201cNow this is the day the Lord has made,\u201d Clinton said upon taking stage, her voice attuning itself to the regional twang, much like Obama and generations of politicians before her have done with relative peace. Among those present waving their approval, Julia Paul-Momdaizie, an American citizen born in Trinidad, spoke with delight in her eyes about Clinton\u2019s policy positions. \u201cShe has great ideas for the country,\u201d Paul-Momdaizie said. \u201cChange is good, yes, but if it\u2019s not broke then you shouldn\u2019t fix it. Our country isn\u2019t broken. We have things we need to work on and I think she can fix those areas.\u201d \u201cMr. Trump wants to burn it all down,\u201d she added with a laugh, \u201cget rid of all of us.\u201d On the trail, signs at rallies for the Republican showman declare that \u201cthe Silent Majority stands with Trump.\u201d The reference is a cultural marker, still-valuable currency with crowds that fill up at the mention of \u201claw and order\u201d in a campaign speech. But it is Clinton who, at press time and for long stretches of the campaign, has commanded not only more support, but from a less vocal band of backers. Alma Ellis, 70, was chatting about the opponent with a friend before Clinton arrived. \u201cJust like the scripture in the Bible: \u2018Satan is going to and fro seeking whom he can divide. He desires to sift us wheat.\u2019 If Trump gets elected he is going to sift all of us as wheat,\u201d she said, and paused. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that someone is leading you when they don\u2019t know the way themselves.\u201d Being Muslim American in the year of Donald Trump Opposition to the Republican nominee is not incidental, even to many of the people who call themselves enthusiastic Clinton voters. A night earlier in Miami, at a \u201cget out the vote\u201d concert headlined by Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony, college student Diana Zelaya, 23 years old and nearing graduation, argued that Trump was not being held to a very simple standard she expected to face on the job market. \u201cHe basically woke up one day and said I\u2019m going to run for president,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair \u2013 even most college graduates need to have experience to jump into a field. He has no political experience to jump in the field.\u201d Clinton, she added, \u201cis more qualified, just like (students) need more experience for wherever we want to go work. She worked in this her whole life.\u201d On Monday in Ohio, at Clinton\u2019s first stop \u2013 a rally on the campus of Kent State University \u2013 ticketed supporters lined up an hour before the doors to the school\u2019s Recreation and Wellness Center were scheduled to open, and two more before Clinton was expected to arrive. Along with a friend, Lyric Aquino, a sophomore double major in anthropology and aspiring photojournalist, bested the Midwestern chill in a long shawl. She spoke about the relative mellow of a Clinton event when set against the sometimes ugly and weird scenes at Trump\u2019s gatherings. \u201cHillary has been bashed but she still remains to be so strong,\u201d Aquino said. \u201cSo she is able to hold attention and cast a sense of power and it makes people want to listen to her. I like that she\u2019s able to do that and it\u2019s not dangerous, it\u2019s not a harsh vibe \u2013 it feels good to know that you\u2019re in a safe environment where you can listen to her and actually hear her talk.\u201d On Monday, Clinton\u2019s first order of business was to deliver a message about Trump. These lines of attack tend to drive news coverage and win broader attention, but the live audience seemed distracted. After 25 minutes, though, Clinton began a riff on the diversity of her coalition and the room began to heat up. Then, as she closed, listing the sundry accomplishments of the Obama years, it blared. \u201cThat is something to defend and build on,\u201d she said, \u201cand in the end, that is what this election is all about.\u201d As the last of the crowd filtered out past what had behaved like an airport checkpoint, a trio of merchandise sellers \u2013 \u201cJ&J Concessions\u201d \u2013 were cleaning up. Kevin Terry, 40, said his small company had been as far south as Texas and all the way up to Maine hawking both both Clinton and Trump gear. The big sellers at Kent State, he said, had been pins reading, \u201cHill, Yes!\u201d and another featuring \u201cRosie the Riveter\u201d saying \u201cHillary 2016.\u201d This is America, 2016: Confessions from the campaign trail The big movers at Trump rallies also focused on Clinton, he said \u2013 stuff like \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d tee shirts and another that says, \u201cLife\u2019s a bitch, don\u2019t vote for one.\u201d The demand was such that Terry, who had arrived at the convention in Cleveland this summer with \u201cAmerican flag elephant shirts saying, \u2018Cleveland rocks\u2019 and \u2018RNC 2016,\u2019\u201d had to put in a late order for the nastier swag. Hanging back a few hundred feet away with her mother, Ann, Sarah Schlosser, 22, pinned the contrasting nature of the the year\u2019s campaign rallies on the candidates: \u201cTrump has a very dark and gloomy message and that is going to attract a very dark and gloomy voter. Hillary\u2019s message is very different and you see that in the demeanor of the people who attend.\u201d A former vice president of marketing at the Chamber of Commerce, Ann professed awe at Clinton\u2019s fortitude, but underlined what she saw as one of the candidate\u2019s fundamental handicaps: what men expect from powerful women. \u201cShe\u2019s not warm and fuzzy,\u201d Ann said. \u201cBut we as women are supposed to (be) warm and fuzzy and embracing and love and hold hands and skip off into the sunset together. We should sh\u2013 rainbows and pee puppies. But that\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to get things done.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Where the candidates are spending the final days tells a lot Clinton, Trump target appeals to key voters groups that could decide the outcome With Election Day on the horizon, the candidates and their top surrogates are logging thousands of sky miles as they barnstorm across the country, making closing arguments and cajoling supporters to hit the polls. On Tuesday alone, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign hosted more than 10 events around the country with  big-name headliners hitting Florida, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and Ohio, where President Barack Obama pushed early voting. Donald Trump\u2019s side is no less busy, but his bench is shorter, with the nominee, his family, and running mate Mike Pence doing the bulk of the work. Trump alone is on pace to hit four states in three days, with four stops in Florida alone. His son, Donald Jr., was in Iowa on Tuesday, and his children will be hitting Michigan later in the week. So what does it all mean \u2013 what do these breakneck itineraries tell us? Actually, quite a bit. The campaigns\u2019 decisions right now offer a unique insight into how they view the race to 270 electoral votes \u2013 they tell us about the states still in play and the demographics of voters the campaigns see as key to victory. In the final days of this increasingly tight contest, both Clinton and Trump will be thinking about where to deploy their precious human resources. And the places they choose to visit can be just as telling as those they skip. Clinton\u2019s deep roster of surrogates allows her to defend precious blue states like Colorado and Wisconsin while simultaneously keeping leading figures focused on battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. Trump doesn\u2019t have the same star-studded lineup to stump for him in places he can\u2019t be. Here is a detailed at look at where Trump, Clinton and their most dedicated allies will be directing their attentions over the coming days. Hillary Clinton Tuesday, November 1: Clinton campaigned outside Tampa, Florida \u2013 a state in which she had already spent two of the past three days. Her weekend travels took her to Daytona Beach and Miami, where she appeared onstage with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony at a \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d concert. Tampa, Daytona Beach and Miami offer distinct demographic opportunities and challenges. Tampa is in Hillsborough county, often the most hotly contested counties in the state, while Daytona Beach \u2013 where Clinton made a pregame appearance at a Bethune\u2011Cookman University football game \u2013 has a sizable African-American population. Miami, of course, offered a chance to run up the score, especially among Latino voters, in the Democratic stronghold. How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 Wednesday, November 2: Clinton heads to the normally deep-red state of Arizona. Both its senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, oppose Trump (McCain after some hedging) and polls show the state\u2019s 11 electoral votes within reach. But this stop, like Trump\u2019s planned foray into Wisconsin, could also be a ploy designed to set the other side on its heels \u2013 forcing them to spend resources on defending a traditionally Republican state. Thursday, November 3: Clinton hits North Carolina with Sanders, which means one thing: Get the kids to the polls. Sanders was and remains a popular figure with left-leaning, younger Democrats, so anytime you see him on the schedule, expect that it\u2019s part of a plan to whip up millennial voters. Friday, November 4: Clinton appears with hip hop star Jay-Z in Ohio, where early voting is underway and Clinton needs to run up a big margin in cities like Cleveland, with its considerable African-American and youth vote. Saturday, November 5: Clinton will end the day in Philadelphia, for a concert headlined by Katy Perry \u2013 another move to get the youth vote off the couch and enthused and help appeal to professional, highly educated women in the city and suburbs. (Trump is making a similar play by sending wife Melania Trump to speak in the Philadelphia suburbs this week.) President Barack Obama Tuesday, November 1: Obama hits Columbus, Ohio, home to Ohio State University and more young voters the Clinton campaign needs to keep the incumbent\u2019s coalition intact. Obama\u2019s final mission: Help Clinton close the deal Wednesday, November 2: Then to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and the University of North Carolina. Again, the goal here is to get out students and the highly-educated voters that tend to live in and around college towns. Thursday, November 3: The President then heads to Miami, Florida, a vote-heavy metropolis where he will appeal to the diverse cohort we now commonly refer to as the \u201cObama coalition.\u201d Miami-Dade County delivered more than 6-in-10 of its votes for him in a narrow 2012 statewide contest. Vice President Joe Biden Tuesday, November 1: Biden hit Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday \u2013 another chance to appeal to the white, working-class vote that has been resistant to Clinton yet looks at the vice president as one of their own. Wednesday, November 2: Then it\u2019s on to Tampa \u2013 at the center of swinging Hillsborough County. Then it\u2019s on to Palm Beach and its population of seniors, a group with which Biden has always performed well. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine Tuesday, November 1: Kaine was in Wisconsin, playing defense in a state Democrats haven\u2019t lost in decades. Wednesday, November 2: It\u2019s off to Iowa, where the native Midwesterner \u2013 Kaine was born in Minnesota and grew up on the Kansas City area \u2013 will try to make some inroads in a state that Trump has consistently led in the polls. (Update: This visit has been canceled following an ambush that killed two police officers in Iowa early Wednesday.) Thursday, November 3: A day after Clinton, Kaine is set to visit Arizona (Phoenix and Tucson) himself \u2013 another example of the Democratic ticket having the resources to put a sustained effort into an unlikely state. Former President Bill Clinton Tuesday, November 1: With the nominee nearby, Bill Clinton made three stops in southern Florida on Tuesday, including events in Florida City and Immokalee. Both cities are minority-majority, a good play for Bill Clinton, who remains extremely popular among African Americans, a community that early-voting estimates suggest may not be turning out for the Democratic nominee in as strong numbers as in previous cycles. Wednesday, November 2: Clinton heads back north a day later, with two stops scheduled in Iowa. (Update: This visit has been canceled following an ambush that killed two police officers in  Iowa early Wednesday.) Chelsea Clinton Tuesday, November 1: The former first daughter visited Aurora, Colorado. Wednesday, November 2: Boulder and the University of Colorado is on the schedule for Wednesday, another play to get out the youth vote \u2013 in this case, that mostly means mailing in their ballots \u2013 in a state most polls show Clinton leading comfortably. Then it\u2019s off to play some more defense in Oshkosh and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a state where Clinton has a strong but not unbreakable hold. Thursday, November 3: Another day in Wisconsin, this time with at a coffee shop Milwaukee, not far from Marquette University. Friday, November 4: Clinton\u2019s busy week ends in battleground New Hampshire, with stops planned in Keene and Hanover, home to Dartmouth College. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren Tuesday, November 1: A busy day for Clinton\u2019s former primary rival, who stumped for her in Plymouth and Hanover, New Hampshire, before heading up to Portland, Maine. Wednesday, November 2: Warren is expected to join phone-banking efforts in Carson City and Reno, Nevada, as the Silver State goes down to the wire. Meanwhile, Sanders will continue on his mission to burnish Clinton\u2019s liberal credentials, especially with young voters, of which there figure to be a few on hand at his visit to Western Michigan University. He\u2019ll also be in Traverse City, Michigan, before finishing the day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Over the coming days, he will also make appearances in Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and California. Donald Trump Tuesday, November 1: Gaining in the polls, Trump took his anti-Obamacare message to friendly crowds in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania \u2013 a blue state that, if turned, could swing the election in a hurry. Trump also held a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Wednesday, November 2: A busy day in battleground Florida will likely see Trump stops first in Miami, then up to Orlando and Pensacola. Thursday, November 3: Before leaving the Sunshine State, Trump will look to shore up his base in Jacksonville, which like his latter two rallies on Wednesday, is farther north and in a more traditionally Republican leaning region. After that, Trump heads to North Carolina, another state where he could be gaining ground, for visits to Concord and Selma. Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence Tuesday, November 1: A full day in Pennsylvania. After joining Trump for the Obamacare speech in King of Prussia, Pence set off for another rally in Youngwood, a borough in the more Republican-heavy western part of the state about an hour outside Pittsburgh. Pence is often dispatched to more traditionally conservative areas, where he has a credibility that Trump does not. Wednesday, November 2: Another busy day for the Indiana governor, who will first try to match voices with Clinton in Arizona. Pence will be in the GOP stronghold of Mesa, launching a rearguard action in one of the reddest cities in the country. But after that he\u2019s scheduled to kick up some dust in New Mexico, a traditionally reliable blue state \u2013 is it a feint or does the campaign see a path there? They\u2019re saying the polls are closer than we might expect. Pence finishes in Loveland, Colorado. Melania Trump Thursday, November 3: The prospective first lady is expected to give a speech in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump Tuesday, November 1: Trump\u2019s eldest son visited two Hawkeye State colleges, where he spoke to crowds at Iowa State University in Ames and at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. Wednesday, November 2: More higher ed for Trump Jr., when he\u2019ll visit Michigan and Grand Valley State University in Allendale. Like her brother, Ivanka Trump will also be in Michigan at a separate event on Wednesday, part of the campaign\u2019s offensive in another state expected \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 to go blue on Election Day. Friday, November 4: Eric Trump will follow his older siblings to Michigan for an appearance at the end of the week. There are no details available yet about his or Ivanka Trump\u2019s events.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama rallied an Ohio crowd to vote for Hillary Clinton He touted her qualifications over GOP rival Donald Trump A boisterous President Barack Obama tied baseball, voting and Taco Bell together during an Ohio campaign appearance Tuesday, joking that if you have time to get a taco, you have time to vote, likening it to a \u201ccombo meal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like you get something good for your soul and then you get something good for your appetite,\u201d he said, making reference to the World Series featuring the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Cubs, who face off for Game 6 Tuesday night. Taco Bell had a promotion for a free taco in the event of the first stolen base. Obama then zeroed in on what amounts to his closing argument on behalf of Hillary Clinton. After spending the last year making entreaties to young people, African-Americans and women to cast their ballots, Obama appealed to an altogether different demographic: men. Speaking at the first in a stretch of closing campaign rallies for Hillary Clinton, Obama argued the Democratic nominee has been unfairly maligned in her decades-long political career. And he implored men in the crowd \u2013 who polls show favoring Donald Trump in next week\u2019s presidential vote \u2013 to take a true measure of their opposition to Clinton, the first woman to clinch a major party nomination. \u201cI want every man out there to kind look inside yourself and as yourself, if you\u2019re having problems with this stuff, how much of it is that we\u2019re just not used to it?\u201d Obama told a young and rowdy crowd in Columbus. \u201cWhen a guy is ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well that\u2019s OK. But when a woman does it suddenly we\u2019re like \u2018Why\u2019s she doing that?\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest. Just want you to think about that because she is so much better qualified than the other guy.\u201d Obama was launching a week of rallies for Clinton, spread across the electoral battlegrounds that will determine his successor. On college campuses in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, Obama hopes to galvanize the coalition of voters who propelled him into office to support Clinton this time around. Polls show Clinton with a deficit among men \u2013 not a surprise, given men have overwhelmingly supported the Republican candidate in the past several contests. A CNN/ORC survey taken October 20-23 showed 47% of men respondents backed Trump, with 44% supporting Clinton. That\u2019s a closer margin than the 2012 election, when 54% of men backed Mitt Romney and 46% supported Obama. In his remarks Tuesday, Obama said that men wary of the candidate should investigate their own sentiments, suggesting they might be unaware of a latent sexism in their political views. He pointed to his own marriage as an example of a man embracing a powerful woman. \u201cI know that my wife is not just my equal but my superior,\u201d he said. Even his attacks on Trump sought to ding the billionaire candidate\u2019s manliness, saying his attacks on women demonstrated a weak character, and that his appeals to the working class were false. Trump \u201cain\u2019t never worn a baseball hat \u2018till he started selling em,\u201d Obama said, later imploring voters not to be \u201cbamboozled.\u201d Obama insisted Clinton was a warrior for working class Americans and children, and not the conniving operator he claimed her opponents were painting her as. \u201cIf you get beat up enough in this political environment that\u2019s so toxic, after a while people start believing stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there.\u201d As expected, Obama didn\u2019t mention the FBI controversy that has shaken the presidential campaign in its final stretch. But he did warn the thousands of people who had gathered in a college gymnasium here to ignore \u201cnoise and distractions\u201d in the waning days of the contest. He cited \u201csystematic attacks\u201d on Clinton\u2019s character as an example of what the candidate has weathered since entering public life in the 1980s. \u201cHas she made mistakes? Of course. So have I,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in the public arena over the course of 30 years that doesn\u2019t make some. But she\u2019s a fundamentally good and decent person who knows what she\u2019s doing who will be an outstanding president.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the terms of the Taco Bell promotion.",

            "article_content": "FBI Director James Comey\u2019s letter to Congress Friday alerting the world to the possibility of new emails in the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server certainly has upended the presidential race. Comey in harsh spotlight of 2016 campaign One question now: By doing so, did Comey violate federal law? Specifically the Hatch Act, a 1939 law intended to keep federal employees from directly supporting candidates. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid suggests he may have, as detailed in a Sunday night letter to Comey. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s guide to the Hatch Act, what it prohibits, and how it is usually enforced. Congress passed the Hatch Act in response to concerns that federal employees had been used to support candidates during the 1938 congressional elections. Its general intent is to greatly restrict the ability of most federal employees to engage in political campaign activities (such as soliciting campaign donations or actively working on behalf of individual candidates), especially while on the job \u2013 or to otherwise \u201cuse [their] official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d And as its text suggests, the law does not require that the employee\u2019s wrongful conduct actually interfere with or affect the result of an election. Of course, laws that restrict speech will often implicate the First Amendment. But the Supreme Court has twice rejected First Amendment challenges to the Hatch Act, and it has, more recently, taken a narrower view of the First Amendment rights of government employees \u2013 especially when speaking in their official capacity. And although the law is 77 years old, it has been repeatedly amended by Congress, most recently in 2012 to, among other things, clarify the available penalties for violations of the Act and allow a broader class of employees to run for political office without resigning. The Hatch Act is actually enforced on a fairly routine basis \u2013 albeit usually in cases that do not attract the same kind of national headlines. Typical violations result in disciplinary action \u2013 including suspensions, fines, demotions, duty restrictions, or, in especially serious cases, termination. Don't blame Comey for this mess But violators aren\u2019t going to jail: the Hatch Act is not a criminal statute. Instead, it is an administrative constraint on government employees. The law is enforced by a special independent federal agency \u2013 the Office of Special Counsel \u2013 which is charged with investigating complaint allegations and, where found to be meritorious, either pursuing a settlement with the offending employee or prosecuting their case before the federal agency that oversees internal employment disputes \u2013 the Merit Systems Protection Board. And for presidential appointees like Comey, the Office of Special Counsel submits a report of its findings along with the employee\u2019s response to the President, who makes a decision on whether discipline is warranted. Finally, in addition to the Hatch Act itself, numerous federal agencies have issued their own guidance to employees about how to avoid Hatch Act violations, especially in the run-up to presidential elections. Thus, as relevant in the case with FBI chief Comey, the Justice Department issued a memo in March 2016 (like similar memos in previous election years), emphasizing that employees \u201cshould be particularly mindful of these rules in an election year,\u201d and defining prohibited political activity to include all \u201cactivity directed toward the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.\u201d The Hatch Act provision most commonly invoked in discussions of Comey\u2019s letter is 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7323(a)(1), which prohibits a government employee from \u201cus[ing] his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election.\u201d The key text is the emphasized phrase \u2013 which conditions a violation of the statute on whether the employee\u2019s purpose was to interfere with or affect the result of an election. Thus, the Hatch Act does not focus on the effect of the employee\u2019s conduct, but the intent. To that end, if Comey did not intend to interfere with or affect the upcoming election through his letter to Congress, then he did not violate the letter of the Hatch Act. Of course, only Comey knows what his intent was. But Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005-07 (during the George W. Bush Administration), argued in a New York Times op-ed on Sunday that Comey\u2019s intent can be inferred from the absence of a good reason for sending the letter. Harry Reid: Comey may have violated the Hatch Act \u201cAbsent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending F.B.I. investigation involving a candidate that is made on the eve of an election is \u2026 very likely to be a violation of the Hatch Act and a misuse of an official position,\u201d Painter wrote. And Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid invoked the Hatch Act in a letter to Sunday night. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d Painter on Saturday formally filed a complaint with Office of Special Counsel \u2013 and with the Office of Government Ethics \u2013 seeking to trigger an investigation of Comey\u2019s conduct. Whether those complaints have any traction remain to be seen \u2013 but even if they do, there is no scenario in which they will be resolved by Election Day. Even if the FBI director\u2019s conduct did not violate the letter of the Hatch Act, it may well have violated the spirit of the Act. After all, the animating purpose of the law is to minimize the ability of individual government employees to use their office in a manner that influences the electoral process. Some have argued that it would have been just as problematic for Comey to not disclose the existence of the new e-mails before the election. But when faced with such a dilemma, the Hatch Act is best understood as requiring the relevant government employee to balance the importance of the disclosure to pre-election public discourse against its potential prejudice. In this case, where Comey communicated with Congress knowing that none of the e-mails were to or from Secretary Clinton, is difficult to understand the argument that the value to public discourse outweighed the potential prejudice to Clinton. That calculus could well have been different if the e-mails contained information tending to incriminate (or exculpate) Clinton, but Comey had no way of knowing whether they did at the time of his communication \u2013 and, at least so far, they appear not to do either. All the while, Comey\u2019s letter has inflamed public passions \u2013 and reinvigorated the public debate \u2013 over Clinton\u2019s e-mail scandal, a matter that, even with no substance, can only redound to the detriment of Clinton and the benefit of Donald Trump. Finally, even if Comey\u2019s actions were consistent with the Hatch Act, there is the separate matter of federal ethics rules, and the broader claim that Comey has abused his power in his various public statements concerning the e-mail scandal \u2013 including his public statement and press conference in July announcing that he would not be pursuing charges against Clinton. Callan: Time for FBI director Comey to go Formally, the Hatch Act does authorize the termination of the relevant federal employee as a penalty for an especially egregious violation of the law. But as noted above, absent some evidence of Comey\u2019s purpose, it will be difficult for the Office of Special Counsel to establish a violation\u2014or for the Merit Systems Protection Board to order his removal. But unlike most federal employees, the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the President (and for no more than 10 years). Although Comey\u2019s term will not expire until September 2023, nothing prevents President Barack Obama (or his successor) from terminating him. And although the President does not need a reason to fire an employee who serves at his pleasure, it is quite possible that this latest episode will provide one, at least once the 2016 election is over. If, that is, it ever ends. Steve Vladeck is a CNN contributor and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law.",

            "article_content": "\"Well, oh God, Anthony Weiner,\" Biden said Biden also discussed life after the vice presidency, the Supreme Court and Donald Trump Vice President Joe Biden is \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. In a wide-ranging interview with CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish \u2013 in which Biden also discussed life after the vice presidency, the Supreme Court and Donald Trump \u2013 the vice president said FBI Director James Comey should release the newly discovered emails that are connected to the bureau\u2019s probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. Law enforcement sources told CNN Friday that a probe into Weiner triggered the review of the emails. The FBI and the New York Police Department have opened preliminary investigations of allegations that Weiner exchanged sexually explicit text messages with a purportedly underage girl. \u201cI think Hillary \u2013 if she said, what I\u2019m told she said, is correct \u2013 release the emails. For the whole world to see,\u201d Biden said in the interview, a portion of which was released Friday night. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it won\u2019t prejudice the investigation, but that\u2019s the stilted language the agency always uses,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Weiner, the former Democratic representative from New York, recently separated from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin in light of the sexting incident over the summer. When asked about Weiner\u2019s involvement in the emails, Biden said he didn\u2019t want to comment. \u201cWell, oh God, Anthony Weiner,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI should not comment on Anthony Weiner. I\u2019m not a big fan. I wasn\u2019t before he got in trouble. So I shouldn\u2019t comment on Anthony Weiner.\u201d When asked if the renewed Clinton email controversy made Biden regret not running for president, he defended his decision to stay out of the election. \u201cI thought I could beat Hillary. I thought I could beat anybody that ran. No one should run for president unless they think they can do that,\u201d Biden replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t run for one simple, overarching reason: My son was dying and he died. That\u2019s the total reason. I have great respect for Hillary.\u201d He was also asked about reports that he was on a list of possible choices for secretary of state if Clinton were to win the White House. \u201cI will do anything that she wants if she\u2019s elected president to help her. But I\u2019m not looking to be in the administration. It\u2019s time for me to move on,\u201d Biden said. He also said he\u2019s not considering a role on the Supreme Court, either. \u201cLook, Michael, there\u2019s a lot of things I want to do \u2013 cancer moonshot, other things I want to work on, and I\u2019m not going away. I plan on being as deeply engaged as I am now in the capacity of a citizen that has more of a platform and the ability to convene people,\u201d Biden said. Smerconish asked Biden, who received a standing ovation at a Philadelphia Eagles game in September, why he is so popular among the working class of the United States. \u201cLook, it\u2019s where I come from, Michael,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think that both parties, we pay attention in terms of policy but not in terms of our attention \u2026 They\u2019re not looking for anybody to be sorry for them. They want people to recognize this is a struggle.\u201d He said Trump hasn\u2019t done anything for the working class in the United States. \u201cPeople are upset and angry. They hate the dysfunction of Washington. Trump comes along and talks about how he\u2019s going to change all that, he\u2019s this breath of fresh air. And then people started to see who he is,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s offering nothing, nothing, zero for those folks.\u201d Biden acknowledged that Americans don\u2019t trust Clinton, but said \u201cfewer people\u201d trust Trump. \u201cLook at the polls,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFewer people trust him than trust her. And so this is not a case where one person is really trusted and another person isn\u2019t.\u201d Biden said that if Clinton is elected president, she should renominate federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court justice. His nomination has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate since President Barack Obama nominated him to succeed late Justice Antonin Scalia in March. \u201cI think she should stick with Garland, but that\u2019s her choice,\u201d Biden said. Smerconish asked Biden about his comment last week when he said he wished he \u201ccould take (Trump) behind the gym\u201d in light of the GOP nominee\u2019s vulgar comments about women that surfaced earlier this month. \u201cI was making a point,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI think it\u2019s insulting to say \u2026 that we talk like that. This is not \u2018locker room talk.\u2019 And you know as well as I know Michael \u2026 if somebody in the locker room talked that way, and your sister\u2019s outside with her friends, you know what you do. You know what you do. You don\u2019t let it go on.\u201d Biden also slammed Trump\u2019s leaked 2005 hot mic conversation, where he bragged about being able to grope women because he is a celebrity. Trump defended it as a \u201clocker room talk,\u201d but Biden called it sexual assault. \u201cWe have to change the culture in which we talk about women and we treat women. It\u2019s essential,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been one of the causes of my life. And here\u2019s the guy who says, \u2018Because I am a star\u2019 \u2013 implicitly \u2013 \u2018Because I have a lot of money, I can walk out and grope any woman I want.\u2019 That is a textbook definition of sexual assault \u2026 Think how crude this campaign has become.\u201d Biden said Trump is \u201cfully unqualified\u201d to be president. But he insisted that if Trump becomes the next commander in chief, he would be willing to lend a hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay involved as much as I possibly can. This is the time after (November) 9, after the election is over, no matter who wins, reach out,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI pray that doesn\u2019t happen. I want Hillary to be president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is down in CNN's Poll of Polls Trump and his aides insist he has momentum Donald Trump got a morale boost this week \u2013 but it likely won\u2019t be enough to propel him to the White House. After weeks of devastating headlines, the Republican nominee seemed to give himself a break. He largely avoided incessant talk about allegations of sexual assault by multiple women and claims that the election is rigged \u2013 both of which made wavering Republicans nervous. Michelle Obama fires up North Carolina crowd for Hillary Clinton The drumbeat of WikiLeaks disclosures yielded material to lambast Hillary Clinton and her family\u2019s foundation. And news of rising Obamacare premiums gave him an opening to criticize President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy that Clinton is running to inherit. Trump edged up in some state surveys and CNN moved two crucial states \u2013 Florida and Nevada \u2013 from lean Democratic to battleground status on its electoral map. But 11 days before the election, Trump is down six points in CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls. His path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency remains daunting and it will be tough to overcome the deficit in the remaining time. Trump seemed to acknowledge the challenges Thursday. Final days of the 2016 campaign \u201cJust thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump,\u201d he quipped during a rally in Toledo, Ohio. Also telling: Trump donated just $31,000 to his campaign in early October despite promises to give up to $100 million to his campaign, according to a fundraising report filed Thursday. He has only donated $56 million to his race as of October 20. Republicans: No honeymoon if Clinton wins With the new changes, CNN\u2019s electoral college map leaves Clinton with 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction. Trump has 179 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in his direction. That leaves 87 electoral votes up for grabs at the moment. Trump will have to pitch a perfect game to secure the ones he needs, especially as he struggles to pull states such as Virginia, Pennsylvania or Michigan out of Clinton\u2019s column. \u201cTo have a fighting chance in this election of getting to 270 electoral votes, he has to win North Carolina, Ohio and Florida. If he does win all three that still gives him only 253 electoral votes,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a GOP strategist. \u201cThe biggest problem for the Trump campaign is overall, where are you going to get 270? He basically almost has to run an inside straight and almost has to have them all fall into his hands.\u201d Trump and his aides insist he has a path and momentum, citing huge crowds, long lines for early voting and the few polls in his favor. A Fox News poll Wednesday put the national gap to Clinton at only three points and a Bloomberg Politics survey in Florida said he was two points up. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a tremendous victory,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash Wednesday. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think it, I wouldn\u2019t say it.\u201d Clinton won\u2019t mess with Texas Trump\u2019s schedule shows that he knows the stakes. He spent several days in Florida earlier this week, was in North Carolina on Wednesday and spent Thursday in Ohio. Without that trio, Trump has no platform to mount what even then would be a long shot bid for the White House. Clinton is of the same mind. She was in Florida Wednesday and plans to go back Saturday. She campaigned in North Carolina with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday. Clinton could effectively stop Trump in his tracks if she can win either state \u2013 barring a huge and unpredictable upset elsewhere. If Trump does win North Carolina, Ohio and Florida, he can trace the narrowest of routes to 270 electoral votes by winning New Hampshire, a congressional district in Maine, Iowa and Nevada. But Clinton is leading or in a tight race in those states. Trump also cannot afford to drop any red state, and is already fighting rearguard actions in Arizona and Utah, and some Democrats believe that Georgia could be competitive. Again, Trump\u2019s travel is instructive \u2013 he is campaigning in Maine, New Hampshire and Iowa on Friday. New DC routine: Wake up, search WikiLeaks, wince Some Democrats worry Clinton\u2019s biggest risk is that her voters think she has the presidency in the bag and will fail to show up to vote. \u201cNo complacency here,\u201d Clinton said Wednesday at a rally in Tampa, Florida. \u201cDonald Trump says he can still win and he is right. That is why it is so important everyone gets out and votes.\u201d Clinton\u2019s advisers also warn that the race will probably narrow in the days to come. \u201cQuite likely we are in store for one final round of tightening,\u201d Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted Wednesday. In essence, Trump\u2019s hopes rely on a huge turnout of his base voters, who are largely white and working class. He also needs significantly depressed enthusiasm among Clinton voters and a poll-defying shock on the scale of Brexit, the surprise British vote this year to quit the European Union. Trump has repeatedly said the polls are wrong. And it\u2019s true that some pre-election polls underplayed the size of Obama\u2019s re-election victory in 2012 and the Democratic mid-term election debacle two years later. But if he goes into Election Day with his current deficit, Trump would require a massive polling miss outside the margin of error in multiple states. The Republican nominee\u2019s own strategy makes his task even more difficult. Since he has likely alienated minority and educated women with his rhetoric and behavior, Trump must pull in vast numbers of new white voters \u2014 some who may have voted for Democrats in the past \u2013 to make up for the shortfall. But the Fox News poll, like some other recent surveys, suggested Trump is underperforming 2012 nominee Mitt Romney among this core constituency. Romney won white voters by 20 points over Obama according to exit polls, but Trump is only 14 points ahead of Clinton in the poll with the same voting group. Trump\u2019s problems with educated white female voters have been well documented. If those numbers hold, it means that the GOP nominee must reverse trends in which white voters have become a smaller share of the electorate in recent elections. \u201cThere are just not enough white men in these battleground states for him to win this election,\u201d said Tharon Johnson, who ran Obama\u2019s southern states strategy in his 2012 re-election bid. Still, Bloomberg\u2019s poll of Florida does suggest Trump has some traction in the state he regards as a second home \u2014 even though most other recent surveys have given Clinton a lead of a few points.  Some close observers of Sunshine State politics do believe his intense campaigning is having an impact. \u201cI think it has moved some polls. He has been very strategic about going into some of the media markets where there are a lot of suburban voters,\u201d said Professor Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida, who does not rule out a late Trump surge. \u201cNever say never in our state. On paper, it should be Hillary\u2019s to lose. But it\u2019s not an on paper election. She has soft spots in her base, so does Trump.\u201d",

Michael Moore's 'Trumpland' is our land \u201cIf he\u2019s able to pull it off, it will be because on that day, a lot of angry white guys, a lot of guys who have a justifiable right to be angry \u2013 guys and women\u2013 who have suffered during the last decade,\u201d Moore said. Moore told Lemon that unlike African Americans and women, the white working class haven\u2019t figured out a way to \u201cform movements and organize themselves politically and express their anger.\u201d \u201cTrump has very expertly figured out how to appeal to people that are down on their luck, who used to be in the middle class,\u201d Moore said. 'Michael Moore in TrumpLand' more notable for stealth than content \u201cYou have - right now in America - white men over the age of 35 make up only 19% of the population and you know they\u2019ve been very used to a certain way which is white guys running the show. And those days are over.\u201d Moore added, \u201cIn fact they\u2019ve been over for some time now.\u201d In Moore\u2019s new film, \u201cMichael Moore in Trumpland,\u201d a one-man stage performance starring the director, he urges voters to support Hillary Clinton at the ballot box. Moore hasn\u2019t always supported Clinton for the presidency. He backed President Barack Obama in 2008 and supported Bernie Sanders during the primaries, citing his disagreement with Clinton\u2019s vote for the Iraq war and her close ties to Wall Street. Lemon asked Moore if he thought whether Clinton was addressing the concerns and fears of the white middle class. \u201cWhite guys over 35 like me needs to stand up,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe have an economic system in this country that is unfair, unjust and it\u2019s not democratic and it benefits the few at the top.

            "article_content": "Trump and Clinton looked anything but happy Thursday night They struggled to disguise the anger, bitterness and sheer open dislike No one would confuse Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for happy warriors. The rivals showed up Thursday night at a fabled staging post on the final stretch of presidential campaigns \u2013 the Al Smith charity dinner in New York. Smith, the former New York governor and 1928 Democratic presidential nominee, was once dubbed the \u201chappy warrior of the political battlefield\u201d by Franklin Roosevelt. Trump delivers harsh remarks on Clinton at charity dinner But Trump and Clinton looked anything but happy when they limped off the 2016 campaign trail Thursday night. They struggled to disguise the anger, bitterness and sheer open dislike that has pulsed through their recriminatory White House race, perhaps not surprisingly since he has threatened to throw her in jail and she says he\u2019s a threat to the republic. An evening known for sharp humor that often goes right up to the line but rarely crosses it quickly degenerated into an uncomfortable experience. They just imported the acrimony of Wednesday night\u2019s debate to a new venue. In short, the evening became an apt metaphor for the campaign. Neither candidate seemed at ease or performed particularly well \u2013 after all, they are the most unpopular presidential hopefuls in recorded history. But in the end, Trump seemed to come across as the more unacceptable \u2013 and appeared to misjudge the tone of the evening worse than Clinton. \u201cDonald had some very solid minutes early on and eventually he crossed the line and took it a little too far,\u201d Al Smith V, whose family hosts the dinner, said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Friday. \u201cHillary, on the other hand, was able to laugh at herself and at the same time not underplay any of the serious things Donald Trump has said or done,\u201d And everyone in attendance seemed to just want it to be over, much as the nation seems desperate to rid itself of the ugliest presidential race in decades. Thursday\u2019s dinner was notable because it lacked the genuine respect and even warmth that President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney showed when paying tribute to one another\u2019s families at the same event four years ago \u2013 after throwing their jabs. Political humor works best when there is at least some respect between the parties and everyone is in on the joke. It\u2019s especially important for the person doing the roasting to also turn the humor on themselves, otherwise the barbs can come across as too harsh. Obama and President George W. Bush proved themselves to be particularly adept at this. But Trump clearly didn\u2019t get the memo. Some of his jokes did hit the spot but many just seemed a little too cutting for the venue. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned so much from WikiLeaks. For example, Hillary believes that it is vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,\u201d Trump said, drawing boos \u2014 which are unheard of at this annual event. Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s OK, I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re angry at, Hillary, you or I. For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.\u201d Smith V said that joke changed the tone of the room. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough crowd to drop that line in front of,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest with you, that certainly took the tone in a different direction, and you know, I think ultimately at the end of the day, that made things a lot harder for Hillary when, ultimately, she got the mic \u2013 she had some funny things that she had said, and I don\u2019t think they got as many laughs as they could have because the tone in the room had shifted a bit.\u201d Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan offered a different picture the morning after, saying Trump gave some encouraging words to Clinton behind the scenes. \u201cWhen we were going in, I said could we pray together as we were waiting to be announced and after the prayer, Mr. Trump turned to Sec. Clinton and said, \u2018You know, you are one tough and talented woman,\u2019\u201d Dolan told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d on Friday. \u201cThen he said this has been a good experience, this whole campaign, as tough as it\u2019s been. And she said, \u2018Donald, no matter what happens, we need to work together afterwards.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s appearance was much like his debate performance: He started off well, but seemed to run out of energy and momentum and get more and more hard-edged the longer he went on. Al Smith dinner: Most memorable lines from Trump, Clinton He did make several good cracks. He said the former secretary of state had bumped into him backstage and said \u201cpardon me.\u201d And to be fair to Trump, it wasn\u2019t exactly a Republican crowd. The gaggle of rich New Yorkers from business, politics and the media, in ballgowns and white tie and tails could hardly be more different than blue-collar, white working-class crowds that have flocked to his outsider message. But by the time he reached his last jokes, Trump had clearly lost the room. \u201cAccording to her sworn testimony, Hillary has forgotten more things than most of us will ever, ever know \u2013 that I can tell you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re having some fun here tonight,\u201d he deadpanned with all the enthusiasm as someone experiencing root canal surgery. Clinton cut less close to the bone than Trump, but her speech also seemed to lack the generosity the evening requires. At least the former secretary of state did not take herself quite as seriously as Trump. The soul-crushing 2016 campaign \u201cThis is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,\u201d she said, referring to Trump\u2019s claim she lacks stamina. Poking fun at the top-dollar fees that she racked up for corporate speeches, Clinton said: \u201cIt\u2019s a treat for all of you, too, because I charge a lot for speeches like this.\u201d But Clinton is not a natural speechmaker \u2014 and her jokes sometimes came across as nakedly political. Her best joke poked fun at Trump\u2019s attitude towards women \u2014 though given recent accusations against the GOP nominee might not have been in the best of taste. Al Smith V: Trump 'took it a little too far' at charity dinner \u201cPeople look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants. A beacon of hope for people around the world.\u201d \u201cDonald sees the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4. Maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,\u201d Clinton added. Too soon? In the end, the off-color evening will have little impact on the presidential race. It\u2019s probably too late after all, and no one is likely to be waiting to decide on their vote based on a tony dinner in Manhattan. But like the election itself, it left a bad taste. \u201c2016 is now ruining everything in its wake,\u201d former top Mitt Romney aide Kevin Madden said on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon. \u201cWe have the Al Smith dinner that is supposed to be about collegiality and supposed to be about charity and they left a chill in the room.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama made Friday his fourth campaign rally in support of Clinton Obama said Trump 'spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people' Facing a seemingly endless presidential campaign, marked by a viciousness and vulgarity not seen in either of his own election contests, President Barack Obama has boiled his incredulity down to one phrase. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d a grinning Obama repeated twice during a lakeside campaign rally for Hillary Clinton here on Friday. Deploying a sharp line against Trump\u2019s claims to be for the working class, Obama wondered why anyone would believe the nominee\u2019s claims. \u201cIf a guy\u2019s spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people, there\u2019s no record that he\u2019s supported (the) minimum wage or supported collective bargaining, invested in poor communities, and then suddenly he\u2019s going to be the champion of working people? Come on,\u201d Obama said. Donald Trump is running out of ways to win He was speaking during his fourth campaign rally in support of Clinton, coming to Ohio as the window for early voting opens in this key electoral prize. Each of his stump speeches has sharpened his attack lines about the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, from his avoidance of paying taxes to his treatment of women. Drawing Obama\u2019s scorn Friday, Trump\u2019s insistence a \u201cglobal elite\u201d is working to rig the election. \u201cThis is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTalking about how great his buildings are, how luxurious and how rich he is and flying around everywhere. All he had time for was celebrities and now suddenly he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a populist out there. I\u2019m going to fight for working people.\u201d \u201cCome on, man,\u201d Obama repeated. Obama was speaking in Ohio a day after Trump claimed during a rally in Florida the entire US political system was corrupt. \u201cThe only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.\u201d It was the latest in a pattern of remarks from Trump casting doubts about the validity of the upcoming vote, claims Obama said have no place in US Democracy. \u201cThis is somebody who threatens to jail his political opponents. Or silence the media, who welcomes Russian meddling in our electoral process, and is now suggesting that if the election doesn\u2019t go his way, it\u2019s not because all the stuff he\u2019s said, but it\u2019s because it\u2019s rigged and it\u2019s a fraud,\u201d Obama said. Trump: Clinton \u2018has to go to jail\u2019 And for the second day in a row, Obama hit back at Republicans who are now disavowing Trump, saying it\u2019s too little, too late. He spent Thursday night railing on lawmakers like Ohio\u2019s Sen. Rob Portman, who withdrew his support for Trump after his sexually aggressive remarks from 2005 were released on tape. List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him? \u201cI know that some of them now are walking away but why did it take you this long? You said you\u2019re the party of family values. What, you weren\u2019t appalled earlier when he was saying degrading things about women?\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that some of them now said \u2018wow, this is really bad, I guess we need to walk away,\u2019 but if you\u2019re doing it just for political expedience just because you\u2019re looking at poll numbers and you say \u2018Oh, this might get me in trouble,\u2019 that\u2019s not enough.\u201d",

Trump\u2019s campaign has been rocked by allegations of sexual assault and a 2005 video that shows the candidate casually talking about groping women. In response, they have pledged \u201cwar\u201d on the Clinton campaign, hoping that an increase in negativity will turn off so many Americans that turnout will be dramatically low. Clinton\u2019s campaign, while nodding to the fact that they are concerned about the strategy, have said made a concerted effort to push that their ground game \u2013 and early voting that is already taking place in a number of battleground states \u2013 will render the strategy moot. \u201cAll of the data that we are seeing is reinforcing that this will be the biggest election and biggest turnout in our history,\u201d Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said on a conference call about turnout with reporters Thursday. Mook went state by state highlighting turnout numbers that hint at not only a high turnout election, but one that favors Clinton. Mook highlighted higher-than-normal expected turnout among Hispanics in Florida, North Carolina and Nevada. Hispanic voters overwhelmingly back Clinton and Mook stressed that in each swing that registration numbers and early vote figures \u2013 some of which are proprietary to the campaign and not specified to the media \u2013 refute Trump\u2019s strategy. John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, said this week that Trump\u2019s strategy is to \u201cdisgust everyone with our Democratic dialogue so that they won\u2019t come out to the polls.\u201d Trump\u2019s aides have backed up that comment. On Thursday, a Trump aide described their strategy towards Clinton as \u201cwar.\u201d Early in the campaign, Clinton\u2019s campaign believed that Trump\u2019s comments about Latinos, African-Americans and women would boost turnout in those communities, surpassing whatever gains the Republican nominee enjoyed with white, working-class voters. And aides said Thursday that, for now, that theory still holds. But as Trump goes more negative, there is a fear that the tenor of the debate could depress day-of voting.",

            "article_content": "An \u201cunshackled\u201d Donald Trump makes Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aides happy, but it does come with concerns, they said Tuesday. They are worried that a negative, race to the bottom with Trump could stifle turnout, arguing that it has become clear to them \u2013 especially over the last 48 hours \u2013 that Trump\u2019s strategy is to run the race into \u201cthe sewer.\u201d The thought goes like this: Trump scorches Republicans, gets nastier with Clinton to the point that she has to respond, voters get turned off and decide that they\u2019ve had enough with this election \u2013 so they don\u2019t vote. \u201cI think that this seems to be their strategy, disgust everyone with our Democratic dialogue so that they won\u2019t come out to the polls,\u201d John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, told reporters aboard Clinton\u2019s campaign plane. He added: \u201cI think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate. I guess he fires up the people who go to Alex Jones and Breitbart. But I think it is very unbecoming.\u201d This view is a change in the way Clinton\u2019s aides initially approached Trump\u2019s candidacy. In early 2016, Clinton\u2019s aides said they felt that Trump\u2019s comments about Latinos, African-Americans and women would boost turnout in those communities, surpassing whatever boost the Republican nominee enjoyed with white, working-class voters. But as Trump\u2019s campaign has grown more negative \u2013 Trump tweeted that the \u201cshackles have been taken off\u201d from the GOP establishment \u2013 the view from Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters has changed. Clinton herself gave voice to turnout concerns. \u201cDespite all of the terrible things he has said and done, he is still trying to win this election. And we cannot be complacent, we cannot rest,\u201d she told a Florida radio host on Tuesday. She added, quoting scripture: \u201cDo not go weary while doing good. That applies to this election as well as to our lives and our communities and our faith.\u201d One way Clinton\u2019s aides feel she can counter Trump\u2019s negativity is to speak about her affirmative message. The issue with that is that incessant releases of hacked emails from Wikileaks and Trump\u2019s flame-throwing comments get more coverage than Clinton\u2019s policy proposals, a fact that irks Clinton\u2019s aides. To overcome that, Clinton\u2019s aides plan to campaign more with candidates running against vulnerable Republicans in key swing states, hoping to tie those Republicans with Trump. \u201cFor down ballot Republicans, people running for the Senate, people running for the House, are they going to stay in line with this unshackled Donald Trump?\u201d Podesta rhetorically asked. \u201cAre they with him, or are they against him?\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign also hopes that their ground game can counteract any apathy that may be out there on this election. On Tuesday, Lily Adams, Clinton\u2019s director of battleground communications, sent reporters an email that touted higher ballot requests for Democrats than Republicans in Florida, a more diverse electorate in North Carolina and a sizable uptick in Hispanic registration in Nevada.",

            "article_content": "Thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman were released Friday The hacked emails from John Podesta were released just hours after the U.S. accused Russia of trying to hack its elections Thousands of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, were posted online Friday evening, including what appears to be excerpts from transcripts of closed-door speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department. WikiLeaks, which has been alleged to work with Russia, posted more than 2,000 emails from Podesta and promises to post more from a trove of more than 50,000 the group said it has access to. US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with 2016 election The Clinton campaign would not confirm the authenticity of any of the documents but has not disputed the contents. Clinton\u2019s comments to financial firms, if legitimate, would validate what supporters of Bernie Sanders long said about her: Clinton is a fake populist who is really out of touch with the middle class. But the timing of the leaks, well after the Democratic primary and the same night video emerged of Donald Trump bragging about being able to grope women, could blunt any political impact. About a week after Sanders raised the issue in a January debate, the campaign\u2019s head of research, Tony Carrk, sent around the excerpts, apparently provided by \u201cHWA\u201d (likely referring to the Harry Walker Agency, a firm representing Clinton and other high-profile speakers), to Podesta and other top campaign officials, including Podesta and Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri. The speech excerpts shed light on Clinton\u2019s relationship with Wall Street behind closed doors, as well as her positions on issues such as trade and regulation. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has sought to cast the former secretary of state as a fighter for the middle class, someone who will stand up to monied interests and corporations, and advocate on behalf of people who have seen wages stagnate over eight years under President Barack Obama. In one 2014 speech, Clinton admits to being \u201ckind of far removed\u201d from the struggles of the middle class. \u201cMy father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing,\u201d she said in the remarks. \u201c\u2026And now, obviously, I\u2019m kind of far removed because the life I\u2019ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven\u2019t forgotten it.\u201d The emails released Friday range from menial email blasts and newsletters to highly sensitive internal campaign discussions from inside the Clinton campaign as they were facing a strong primary challenge from Sanders. And they come just hours after top national security officials accused Russia of trying to influence the US elections through highly-coordinated hacks. US accuses Russia of trying to interfere with 2016 election Podesta fired off a series of tweets Friday night, blasting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and pointing to Russia as the source of the hacks, although there is no official link between his specific emails and hacks by Russia. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\u201d Podesta tweeted Friday night. In another tweet, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\u201d The Clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the emails were Podesta\u2019s. Podesta tweet-storms about the hack and seemingly confirms the authenticity of some of the emails pic.twitter.com/pcwvpJ1fkr \u201cEarlier today, the US government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy,\u201d Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said in a statement Friday night. \u201cWe are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton.\u201d Caplin also pointed to concerns that Russian hackers could have doctored the content in the emails, saying, \u201cGuccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign.\u201d For many Sanders supporters, including some who remain wary of Clinton, the release of Clinton\u2019s paid speech transcripts is too little, too late. Sanders made Clinton\u2019s speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial interests a cornerstone of his stump speeches, regularly slamming Clinton for the private remarks. \u201cI kind of think if you\u2019re going to be paid $225,000 for a speech, it must be a fantastic speech,\u201d Sanders said during a speech in Warren, Michigan. \u201cA brilliant speech which you would want to share with the American people.\u201d He regularly added that the remarks must be \u201cShakespearean\u201d given Clinton\u2019s fee. With Sanders\u2019 urging, the refrain caught hold among his supporters. Protesters at Clinton events routinely yelled \u201cRelease your transcripts\u201d and the phrase became a commonly used hashtag on social media. But the reality of Friday\u2019s release is that these partial transcripts would have had more impact had they been released in March, not October \u2013 especially Clinton\u2019s comments on trade. After calling the Trans Pacific Partnership the \u201cgold standard\u201d as secretary of state, Clinton has said publicly that she now does not support the deal. \u201cI oppose it now, I\u2019ll oppose it after the election, and I\u2019ll oppose it as President,\u201d Clinton said earlier this year in Warren, Michigan. But in a 2013 speech, Clinton told an audience that her \u201cdream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\u201d Clinton has publicly said that she believes in trade, but has made running against the way certain trade deals are enforced - including the North American Free Trade agreement - a key to her outreach to union and white working class voters. \u201cI am not satisfied with the status quo, I am not telling you everything is peachy keen,\u201d Clinton said about trade in a July speech in Philadelphia. \u201cI am telling you we have made progress but we have work to do.\u201d While Clinton\u2019s comments at the paid speeches are different than what she usually says, Clinton has been up front - in public - about the fact that she and Bill Clinton have vaulted from the middle class to wealth since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s. \u201cBill and I have been blessed,\u201d Clinton said in Raleigh in September. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come from millionaire families. My husband\u2019s father died before he was born.\u201d She added, \u201cThey struggled, they worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being president.\u201d In a 2013 speech, Clinton told members of the National Multi-Housing Council, \u201cyou need both a public and a private position\u201d in politics. \u201cI mean, politics is like sausage being made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody\u2019s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\u201d Clinton also weighed in on her use of technology at the State Department \u2013 an issue that would later plague her campaign when it was revealed she exclusively used a private email server to conduct State Department business. \u201cWhen I got to the State Department, it was still against the rules to let most \u2013 or let all Foreign Service Officers have access to a Blackberry,\u201d Clinton said in August 2014. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have desktop computers when Colin Powell was there.\u201d State Department releases new batch of Clinton emails She also spoke about how the State Department was targeted by hackers \u201cevery hour, more than once an hour.\u201d \u201cAnd we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier,\u201d said Clinton. Carrk, the man who wrote the hacked document, currently serves at Clinton\u2019s research director and is part of Clinton\u2019s campaign inner circle, trusted enough that he has been part of Clinton\u2019s tightly controlled debate preparations. Carrk worked for Clinton during her 2008 campaign and later led rapid response research at the Democratic National Committee. Before joining Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, the Democratic operative lead the research operation at the Center for American Progress.",

            "article_content": "Trump attempts to reframe himself as a fighter in Colorado Clinton questions Trump's business skills in Ohio Donald Trump \u2013 struggling to move past a week of one controversy after another \u2013 is making clear that he\u2019s willing to go it alone in the final weeks of the campaign. As the Republican nominee tries to recover from one of his toughest stretches, few prominent GOP leaders \u2013 other than those who advise him or are on his payroll \u2013 seem willing to launch a full-throated rescue effort. So Trump sought to do the heavy lifting himself Monday, delivering a feisty speech here that attempted to reframe the campaign and extract him from the quagmire of the past week, which included a disappointing debate performance, a roiling controversy over whether he paid taxes, and ill-advised attacks on a Latina beauty queen \u2013 a feud he couldn\u2019t seem to let go. Trump running out of time as controversies pile up With a new CNN/ORC poll showing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a five-point lead over Trump after the debate, Trump for the first time seemed to relish the role of underdog in the presidential race. He mounted an unapologetic defense of his business record, previewing lines he might deploy during his rematch with Clinton on Sunday. Responding to a stunning New York Times report over the weekend that he may have paid no taxes for the last 18 years, Trump acknowledged here that he had been a \u201cbig beneficiary\u201d of \u201cthe unfairness of the tax laws.\u201d He acknowledged that he \u201cbrilliantly\u201d used U.S. tax laws to pay as little in federal income taxes as possible. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? Donald Trump: I'm working for you now, not for Trump But, he added to an appreciative crowd, \u201cI\u2019m working for you now, I\u2019m not working for Trump.\u201d Indeed, the day was all about Trump as few prominent Republicans rushed to his defense. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a policy wonk who once chaired the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, was the most senior lawmaker to address Trump\u2019s troubles Monday in comments that were relatively tepid. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that harmful,\u201d he told local reporters in Michigan, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cI think people who don\u2019t like him are going to continue disliking him.\u201d Back in Colorado, Trump took on the stance of a fighter as he detailed his financial troubles in the 1990s \u2013 which he described as a \u201cbad time\u201d and an \u201cugly time\u201d \u2013 boasting that he never considered giving up, and compared his own losses to those of working class voters across America. \u201cWhen the odds are stacked against me and you \u2013 because many of you people are the same way \u2013 when people say it can\u2019t be done, that\u2019s when we just get started,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are looking for a comeback.\u201d \u201cThe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is absolutely impossible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFor me, impossible is just a starting point.\u201d 6 questions about Trump\u2019s taxes and the political fallout Across the country at Clinton\u2019s event in Ohio \u2013 a state that may be beyond her reach despite its bellwether status in past elections \u2013 the former secretary of state sharply pointed out that it was difficult for Trump to claim stellar business skills after declaring $916 million in losses in his 1995 tax records, according to the weekend report in the New York Times. Clinton: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars? \u201cHere is my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\u201d Clinton asked. Before attempting to reframe his life story as one of resilience and overcoming obstacles, Trump\u2019s campaign seemed at the verge of unraveling this week, once again sending GOP lawmakers slinking away from their flailing nominee, as they try to contain the collateral damage to vulnerable House and Senate candidates. Somewhat laughably, Trump blamed the fact that he failed to prosecute his case against Clinton in the first debate on a faulty microphone. He then attempted a Twitter takedown of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a Clinton supporter who he had once criticized as overweight. Before long he was mired in the controversy over The New York Times story that found his reported losses may have resulted in him not paying federal income taxes for 18 years. CNN has not independently verified the documents\u2019 authenticity, but Trump\u2019s campaign has not challenged any of the facts reported by The Times. How Trump could lose a billion bucks but still live a billionaire life Trump\u2019s apparent self-sabotage \u2013 or perhaps merely tone-deafness \u2013 continued Monday morning at a forum in Virginia with the Retired American Warriors PAC where he seemed to suggest that U.S. soldiers and veterans commit suicide because \u201cthey can\u2019t handle\u201d post-traumatic stress or weren\u2019t strong enough. Donald Trump's empire At the same forum, he also pointedly questioned the U.S. approach to defeating ISIS, wondering aloud whether airstrikes by the U.S. and its allies are actually taking out members of ISIS. \u201cWe don\u2019t have victory,\u201d Trump said at the veterans\u2019 forum in Virginia. \u201cWe\u2019re dropping things all over the place. Who knows what they are hitting? Who knows how many people are being killed? Who knows if they\u2019re the right people?\u201d As Trump\u2019s comments about PTSD blazed across social media, news reports emerged that New York\u2019s (Democratic) Attorney General issued a cease-and-desist letter to Trump\u2019s charitable foundation, ordering it to stop raising money in the state after a series of reports about the foundation\u2019s questionable spending. While most Republicans were silent Monday, Democrats were gleeful \u2013 doing their part to stir up the uproar over Trump\u2019s comments about PTSD, with even the White House weighing in. \u201cThe commander in chief made a firm declaration that it is not a sign of weakness to get help,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, alluding to President Barack Obama\u2019s comments during a town hall with service members last week moderated by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a sign of character, and a sign of strength to ensure that you are taking care of yourself. And the president has acknowledged the cultural barriers in the military to changing attitudes about this,\u201d Earnest said. For much of the past month, Republican leaders believed that Trump was finally on message and making an effective case against Clinton. His poll numbers rose, giving a boost to GOP senators down-ticket while improving Republican prospects of keeping the House. But his feud with Machado, renewed questions over his taxes and his rocky performance at the first debate have once again renewed long-standing concerns within GOP ranks that their standard bearer remains an unpredictable wild card when it comes to their party down-ticket. Why Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a case against The New York Times \u201cEvery prediction I\u2019ve made has been wrong about Mr. Trump and his impact,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, who told CNN earlier this year that Trump could be an \u201calbatross\u201d for his party. Asked about the next debate, Cornyn said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see him do better. Obviously, he doesn\u2019t have as much experience as Secretary Clinton \u2014 and it showed\u201d at the Hofstra debate. Asked about Trump\u2019s attacks on Machado, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 4 Senate Republican, said Trump \u201cis at his best\u201d when he focuses on economic issues and national security \u2013 not personal matters. \u201cI would focus on Hillary\u2019s record on politics of 30 years,\u201d Barrasso said when asked about Trump bringing up Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandals. \u201cThis is a change election \u2013 change versus more of the same and this country cannot afford to have the next four years to be like the last eight years with Obama.\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana also said Trump needs to re-engage on the issues that drove up his poll numbers in late August and early September. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t comment on that, it\u2019s not what I would do,\u201d Cassidy said when asked about Trump relitigating the Clinton scandals from the 1990s. \u201cI think people know that. Folks now \u2014 they\u2019re hurting and they want to know somebody understands.\u201d Indeed, GOP leaders publicly and privately have long shown a level of discomfort with Trump\u2019s unorthodox campaign \u2014 especially in the aftermath of last week\u2019s events. At a press conference to wrap up the pre-election congressional session, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not talk about Trump\u2019s impact on the battle for the Senate majority. \u201cLook to avoid wasting our time here,\u201d McConnell told reporters, \u201cthis is not something I\u2019m going to discuss today \u2013 the implications of the presidential race on the Senate.\u201d Asked why he wouldn\u2019t answer Trump questions, McConnell said flatly: \u201cBecause I choose not to.

            "article_content": "This is the second time Obama has had to cancel campaigning Aides describe him as eager to stump for Clinton President Barack Obama canceled another campaign event for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, just as his party hopes the sitting commander in chief can use his near-record popularity to help propel its nominee to victory. The White House said Obama was scrapping his planned trip to Florida as the state prepares for a major hurricane, forecast in some models to hit the eastern coast on Thursday. Obama was due to talk up his signature health law in Tampa, as well as stump for Clinton in Miami. It was the second time Obama has postponed a campaign event for Clinton; in July, his first appearance on the trail for the Democratic nominee was canceled after a nightclub shooting in Orlando. With five weeks to go until Election Day, Obama has made only two appearances for Clinton: his campaign trail debut in Charlotte in July, and a solo appearance in Philadelphia last month. He will make the case for Clinton in Ohio next week, at a Democratic dinner in Columbus and a rally in Cleveland. Other presidential obligations, including a week-long swing through Asia and the annual United Nations meetings in New York, have precluded further campaigning from the current Oval Office occupant, though he and his aides describe a president raring to make the case for Clinton. For Democrats, it\u2019s a reminder that relying on Obama to drive turnout and galvanize voters comes with a downside: the obligations and schedule inherent in his full-time job as president of the United States. While Obama is still set to campaign for his preferred successor more than any sitting president in recent history, the White House has maintained that his official duties must take priority. Instead of campaigning for Clinton, Obama will take time Wednesday for a briefing on hurricane preparations at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington. And while he\u2019s expected to return to the campaign trail next week, Obama isn\u2019t likely to make it to Florida before the state\u2019s October 11 voter registration deadline. \u201cWe are hoping to be able to reschedule those events relatively soon,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Tuesday. \u201cBut that will be determined by the impact of the storm and by other components of the president\u2019s schedule.\u201d White House officials have said Obama would make one or two campaign appearances per week for Clinton in the first weeks of October. To allow for an intensification of his political efforts, his schedule nearer to Election Day has remained flexible, with no major foreign trips slated. He\u2019s also expected to cut television and radio ads for Clinton, and continue his intense fundraising efforts for Democrats. His next stop on the high-dollar circuit is his hometown Chicago, where he\u2019ll raise cash for congressional Democrats and the Clinton campaign this weekend. Obama is also expected to cast his ballot in Chicago, potentially as early as Friday, to highlight the early voting options for Democrats ahead of Election Day. Instead of Obama, it\u2019s his White House cohorts \u2013 first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 who have taken on the bulk of the campaigning so far. Michelle Obama has delivered barn-burners in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia on Clinton\u2019s behalf, as well as taped a 30-second ad for the Democratic nominee. Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes the first lady can drive suburban women and minorities to the polls in November. Biden, meanwhile, has made stops in Florida and Pennsylvania to bolster Clinton\u2019s appeal among working class voters.",

These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Stark County is the fifth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties. In this election, as in all others, all eyes are on Ohio. The quintessential swing state is a must-win for Donald Trump, and signs there have pointed in his favor. Among his potential prospects: Stark County. Situated in northeast Ohio, Stark is a swing county in the swing state, and it\u2019s a generally accurate bellwether that goes the way of the nation.  It has trended Democratic in the past couple of cycles, but this election, it could go Trump. Much has been made of Trump\u2019s appeal to the white working class, and that\u2019s what this county \u2013 a relatively white, less-educated populace \u2013 is made up of. But there is always potential for backlash: Google Trends data showed high search interest in \u201ctaxes\u201d even before a New York Times report on Trump\u2019s taxes shook up the race. The Republican nominee has a strong opportunity to overtake Hillary Clinton in Stark County \u2014 a low-key victory that could indicate a win in Ohio \u2026 and from there, a shot at the presidency. Ohio is less diverse and somewhat less educated than the nation as a whole, and Stark County is even moreso. The county\u2019s economy has largely tracked with the rest of the country, although Canton, the county seat, is less wealthy with higher poverty rates. Stark County has been very competitive almost since its inception. In 1960, Kennedy lost Stark County but went on to win Ohio. As recently as 2012, the contest came down to barely a percentage point difference. Take a look at the search data for the area from our partners at the Google News Lab.

            "article_content": "Clinton has already been highly critical of Trump and his tax returns The Clinton campaign insists Ohio is still within reach Hillary Clinton laced into Donald Trump on Monday for living a billionaire\u2019s lifestyle while \u201ccontributing nothing to our nation,\u201d in her first public remarks about a New York Times report that revealed Trump might have avoided paying federal income taxes for close to two decades. Speaking at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, the Democratic presidential nominee attacked her Republican opponent as representing \u201cthe same rigged system that he claims he\u2019s going to change.\u201d \u201cWhile millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard and paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIn other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.\u201d The Times story, Clinton said, \u201ctells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business.\u201d \u201cAfter he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn\u2019t lift a finger to protect his employees, or all the small businesses or the contractors he\u2019d hired, or the people of Atlantic City,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s weekend meltdown Clinton also mocked Trump for his massive losses during the 1990s, saying they undercut Trump\u2019s claim that he is a successful businessman who can help revive the US economy. \u201cHere is my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\u201d Clinton said. The New York Times story, which published online Saturday evening, has the potential to be deeply damaging for Trump in the final weeks of the presidential election. Through an examination of portions of Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, the New York Times determined that Trump declared $916 million in losses in his 1995 income tax returns \u2013 \u201ca deduction that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years,\u201d the article stated. The Times did not look at Trump\u2019s federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax returns as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. CNN has not independently verified the documents, but the Trump campaign has not questioned their accuracy. The story offers powerful ammunition to Clinton as the 2016 campaign enters its final homestretch. The former secretary of state has already been highly critical of Trump and his tax returns during the general election. She has gone after the real estate investor for defying the tradition that modern presidential nominees have followed by refusing to release his tax returns (Trump insists it is because his recent returns are under IRS audit, though that does not preclude him from making them public). During the first debate last week, Clinton suggested that Trump was hiding something \u2013 including, potentially, that \u201che\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes.\u201d Post-debate, Clinton takes the lead In Ohio on Monday, Clinton once again suggested that Trump must be covering up something. \u201cYou may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is he hiding? It must be really terrible.\u201d Clinton\u2019s top surrogates are also getting in the action. Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning for Clinton in Orlando and Florida on Monday, said: \u201c(He) says, \u2018I didn\u2019t pay any federal taxes possibly for more than 18 years.\u2019 He said, \u2018that makes me smart.\u2019 What does that make the rest of Americans?\u201d Trump went on offense Monday in his first rally since The New York Times story published. Speaking in Pueblo, Colorado, Trump said he has \u201cbrilliantly used\u201d tax laws to his benefit and downplayed his alleged financial losses from the 1990s. \u201cThe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax violation from the 1990s, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Trump said. Monday marked the first time Clinton has campaigned in Ohio since Labor Day. Recent polls have shown Trump with a small advantage in his heavily white and working-class state. But the Clinton campaign and its allies insist that the state is still within reach, and that Ohio is a must-win for the Republican nominee. As a part of the strategy to appeal to blue-collars workers in this region, Clinton on Monday went after what she called \u201cegregious corporate behavior\u201d that undermines the middle-class. One of her prime targets was Wells Fargo and the recent revelation that the bank created a slew of accounts without customers\u2019 consent to collect fees. \u201cLook at Wells Fargo \u2013 really shocking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOne of the nation\u2019s biggest banks, bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing their personal information and sticking customers with hidden fees.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump is losing control of the campaign's narrative after a strong September Time is dwindling for Trump to regain his grip on the campaign's message Donald Trump\u2019s tax controversy and his self-destructive lack of discipline threaten to drain the Republican nominee of something he can\u2019t afford: time. With 36 days remaining before Election Day, the real estate mogul\u2019s campaign is consumed with the fallout from a New York Times story published over the weekend that found Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995. That loss could mean Trump went 18 years without paying federal income taxes. Those findings \u2013 which Trump\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t disputing but haven\u2019t been independently confirmed by CNN \u2013 would be daunting for any presidential candidate to overcome. But they\u2019re especially challenging for Trump, who is losing control of the campaign\u2019s narrative after a strong September in which he narrowed the race with Hillary Clinton. 6 questions about Trump\u2019s taxes and the political fallout In just the past week, Trump delivered an underwhelming debate performance, struggled to recover from it, engaged in a counterproductive feud with a Latina beauty queen, posted early morning Twitter tirades and spewed insinuations without any evidence about Clinton\u2019s marriage. The tax story \u2013 which could undermine Trump\u2019s image as a successful businessman \u2013 will dominate the next few days. Time is dwindling for Trump to regain his grip on the campaign\u2019s message as Clinton supporters seize on the drama to reinforce their point that he isn\u2019t suitable for the presidency. \u201cThe reality is that we are in day six of the meltdown,\u201d Clinton supporter Neera Tanden said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cHe had a terrible debate performance. Everybody sees that. He sees the state polls moving towards Hillary. Eleven state polls were out this week. She\u2019s beating him in every single one. He can\u2019t take that. And so this is the latest meltdown.\u201d Of course, the tax story might not emerge as the kind of October surprise-style impact that Democrats hope. It is possible that Trump truly is a Teflon candidate who is so appealing to voters that his actions don\u2019t really matter. The GOP nominee\u2019s closest surrogates launched a fierce defense of Trump Sunday, portraying him as a master of business who expertly used the tax code to his benefit \u2013 and that of his investors. In a spirited showdown with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani hailed Trump as a \u201cgenius.\u201d \u201cHe knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he\u2019s serving,\u201d Giuliani said. Giuliani: False claims about Clinton\u2019s marriage are \u2018fair game\u2019 Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dismissed the idea that Trump had done anything wrong or that the report would hurt him. \u201cThis is actually a very, very good story for Donald Trump,\u201d Christie said. The impact of the story \u2013 and the swirling controversies that have bubbled up over the past week \u2013 will come into greater focus Monday as Trump returns to the campaign trail in the key swing states of Virginia and Colorado. He largely stuck to the script at the first event of the day in which he discussed cybersecurity. But he stumbled during a question and answer session when he suggested that American soldiers and veterans who commit suicide do so because they can\u2019t handle the post-traumatic stress of war. \u201cWhen you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over and you\u2019re strong and you can handle it but a lot of people can\u2019t handle it. They see horror stories, they see events you couldn\u2019t see in a movie, nobody would believe it,\u201d Trump said during a panel interview at the Retired American Warriors PAC, in Herndon, Virginia. The tax issue will almost certainly play a significant role in Tuesday\u2019s vice presidential debate. If that\u2019s the case, it will be a lost opportunity for Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, to present himself to the country as a moderating force on the GOP nominee and someone who can offer a coherent case against a Clinton presidency. And ahead of the next presidential debate on Sunday, there\u2019s no sign Trump will do something to address the lack of focus, preparation and impulse control that helped contribute to Clinton\u2019s win at last week\u2019s showdown. Trump is now vowing to be nastier than Clinton at the second debate, bringing up Bill Clinton\u2019s marital indiscretions. At a wild rally on Saturday night, he even questioned whether Hillary Clinton had been \u201cloyal\u201d to her husband. How Donald Trump could have - legally - paid no taxes Such rhetoric not only calls into question Trump\u2019s strategy, it lets Clinton slide on some of her most significant vulnerabilities, such as her email server and questions of trust and honesty. The first presidential debate Trump\u2019s approach, and refusal to ignore a trap laid by Clinton in the first debate over his treatment of former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, raises doubt over whether he can make inroads with educated women voters who could be vital to claim must-win states like Pennsylvania. The freewheeling Trump on display in recent days is particularly notable because he had been doing so well and appeared keen to project more discipline under his retooled campaign team. The GOP nominee effectively wiped out Clinton\u2019s lead in national polls after an effective spell through August and mid-September. He was beginning to match her in swing states on the electoral map. Donald Trump and the art of losing money Then, after an encouraging first 30 minutes of the debate, it all went downhill. Trump has not allowed himself to get back on message ever since. \u201cWhat happened to him was he was doing well,\u201d said Van Jones, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton, on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI was terrified 10 days ago this guy was going to be able to be disciplined. Hillary Clinton in 15 minutes said two or three things and threw him off his game and he has not been able to recover since the debate.\u201d The GOP nominee\u2019s only route to the White House lies in running the table through the Rust Belt from Pennsylvania, through Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. That\u2019s why the tax story could prove powerful if struggling blue collar workers disaffected with the Democrats and considering Trump are alienated by the revelation \u2013 even if everything was perfectly legal. The tax issue also allows Democrats to reclaim the narrative about economic equality and fairness that proved so powerful for President Barack Obama against Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton\u2019s primary rival, Bernie Sanders, relished the chance to make that point. \u201cSo, you have got the middle-class people working longer hours for low wages. They pay their taxes. They support their schools. They support their infrastructure. They support the military. But the billionaires, no, they don\u2019t have to do that, because they have their friends on Capitol Hill. They pay zero in taxes,\u201d Sanders said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cSo, Trump goes around and says, \u2018hey, I\u2019m worth billions, I\u2019m a successful businessman, but I don\u2019t pay any taxes. But, you, you make 15 bucks an hour, you pay the taxes, not me.\u2019\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s why people are angry and want real change in this country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The newspaper called the Libertarian ticket \"agile\" and \"practical\" The Detroit News endorsed Johnson earlier this week The Chicago Tribune, a Windy City newspaper that historically backs Republican candidates, endorsed Libertarian Gary Johnson on Friday calling him \u201cpractical,\u201d \u201cagile\u201d and \u201cexperienced.\u201d \u201cLibertarians Gary Johnson of New Mexico and running mate William Weld of Massachusetts are agile, practical and, unlike the major-party candidates, experienced at managing governments,\u201d the paper said. \u201cThey offer an agenda that appeals not only to the Tribune\u2019s principles but to those of the many Americans who say they are socially tolerant but fiscally responsible.\u201d The Tribune has a long history of supporting Republican presidential candidates and did not endorse a Democrat for president until 2008 when then-Illinois Senator Barack Obama ran for president. They also endorsed Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012. While the Johnson endorsement might be a hit for Illinois native Hillary Clinton, the refusal to back this year\u2019s Republican nominee also speaks to the paper\u2019s lack of support for Donald Trump. The paper suggested that both Trump and Clinton have appealed to voters whose beliefs are not in the best interest of all Americans. \u201cHow did pandering to aggrieved niche groups and seducing blocs of angry voters replace working toward solutions as the coin of our governing class? How could the Democratic and Republican parties stagger so far from this nation\u2019s political mainstream,\u201d the paper asked. The support also comes as Johnson was criticized for his high-profile comments earlier this week, where he failed to identify a foreign leader he admires. He also came under fire recently for not knowing Aleppo \u2013 the besieged city in Syria. The endorsement is the second for Johnson in two days. The Detroit News endorsed the former New Mexico governor Thursday admitting that backing him is \u201cthe longest of long shots.\u201d \u201cWe recognize the Libertarian candidate is the longest of long shots with an electorate that has been conditioned to believe only Republicans and Democrats can win major offices,\u201d the News said. \u201cBut this is an endorsement of conscience, reflecting our confidence that Johnson would be a competent and capable president and an honorable one.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama signed the bill into law Thursday afternoon The bill ended up getting broad support Congress cleared a bill Wednesday to fund the government and the federal response to Zika, avoiding a potentially embarrassing government shutdown just weeks before the election. The House and Senate approved the measure \u2013 which would fund federal agencies through December 9 \u2013 with just two days before federal agencies were set to run out of money. Obama signed the bill into law Thursday afternoon, before departing for Israel. Once leaders resolved the final sticking point \u2013 finding a mechanism to approve money for the city of Flint, Michigan, after its water system was contaminated with lead \u2013 members of both parties were eager to wrap up votes and head home to campaign in the final sprint to the November election. Once bipartisan leaders agreed to add an amendment to a separate water infrastructure bill earmarking funds for Flint there was quick agreement to approve the spending bill. After weeks of negotiation and stalemate, the Senate approved the so-called \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d or CR with broad support, passing 72-26. A few hours later the House followed suit and approved the bill, 342-85. Senators and House members up for re-election were eager to wrap up business in Washington and return home. The final package included $1.1 billion for Zika, $500 million for flooding in Louisiana and other states, and $37 million for opioid addiction. The White House praised the Senate\u2019s passage of the bill, though it expressed disappointment that the measure did not include provisions to restore a board quorum to the Export-Import Bank or allow the Securities and Exchange Commission greater authority in regulating public companies\u2019 political spending. \u201cThe administration looks forward to working with the Congress to support investments equally balanced between defense and non-defense spending that will create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security,\u201d the statement said. Under the outline of the deal, reached Tuesday night by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker Paul Ryan, the leadership agreed to add aid for Flint on a separate water projects bill, setting up the Wednesday vote on that package. The House approved that water legislation shortly before it voted on the CR. A House-Senate conference committee would later reconcile the two competing bills, setting the stage for final approval of the Flint aid in December. During the House debate on the water provision, Michigan Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, who represents the city of Flint and pleaded for months for Congress to help with resources to replace lead pipes and provide health services to sick residents, said \u201cmy constituents have been waiting for more than a year for the help they need.\u201d Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga of Michigan, who said his family is originally from Flint, called the situation there \u201ctragic\u201d and said \u201cthese folks have experienced failure of government at all levels for decades\u201d Speaking at the Washington Economic Forum on Wednesday morning, Ryan said he believed moving the Flint aid on the water bill \u201cwill help unlock\u201d the funding package, asserting that the Flint issue \u201cnow, I think, will be unstuck.\u201d The deadline to fund federal agencies is Friday at midnight. Ryan said Wednesday there won\u2019t be a shutdown because GOP members understand the process behind backing a short-term bill. \u201cBasically, we are having a low-drama moment now,\u201d Ryan said. On the Senate floor Wednesday morning, Minority Leader Harry Reid said the movement in the House is a \u201cstep in the right direction.\u201d But he had warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not to back off commitments to approve money for Flint. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they just say they\u2019ll do it?\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to exercise caution moving forward, but I\u2019m glad to see progress has been made.\u201d Reid said on the floor of the Senate he has been given assurances by Republicans that Flint funding will get done in the lame duck session, the period after the elections. \u201cI am convinced there is going to be help for Flint in the lame duck,\u201d he said, adding this should clear the way for government funding to pass probably Wednesday in the Senate and then the House. Soon after Congress returns for its post-election session it will begin wrangling on the next round of spending bills, with little time again to avert a potential shutdown.",

            "article_content": "The exchange over the massive trade deal was one of the most explosive of the evening Clinton jumped at the opportunity to slam her opponent for refusing to release his taxes Donald Trump lit into Hillary Clinton on trade at the start of the first presidential debate, hammering away at a policy area that has both haunted Clinton and helped Trump\u2019s brand during the 2016 campaign. As the candidates discussed their respective economic plans, Trump blamed former President Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA, referring to it as the \u201cworst thing that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\u201d Then, Trump went after Clinton herself on a key vulnerability: \u201cAnd now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d The exchange over the massive trade deal, which involved the candidates talking over each other and hurling accusations, was one of the most explosive of the evening and marked the spirited return of a political issue that was a prominent feature of the primary season. Trump noted that Clinton had once favored the trade pact before coming out against it. Trump and Clinton spar over NAFTA \u201cThat is just not accurate,\u201d Clinton shot back. \u201cI was against it once it was fully negotiated and the terms were laid out.\u201d \u201cYou called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals,\u201d Trump said, recalling a description Clinton once used while the trade deal was being negotiated. \u201cDonald, I know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said \u2013 a jab alluding to Trump\u2019s past involvement in reality TV. \u201cI said I hoped it would be a good deal \u2026 I concluded it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Trump cut in to ask multiple times: \u201cSo it is President Obama\u2019s fault?\u201d RELATED: Trump, Clinton clash in debate showdown Clinton was criticized for flip-flopping on her past support for TPP throughout the primaries when she ran against liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. She came out against the deal after she started running for president and as she faced pressure from progressives to oppose what many Americans fear would take jobs away from the United States. Trump, meanwhile, has been very vocal during this election in his opposition of TPP \u2013 a position that has helped the businessman boost his populist economic message and win over working-class voters. Trade wasn\u2019t the only topic that made the two nominees testy, however. Trump, Clinton spar over jobs When NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, the debate moderator, brought up the issue of Trump\u2019s tax returns, the billionaire gave his usual answer: that his tax returns are current under audit. He said that he would release his tax returns if Clinton \u201creleases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.\u201d Clinton kept the emails on a private server she used as secretary of state that was later destroyed. She jumped at the opportunity to slam her opponent for refusing to release his taxes, something that has been customary for presidential nominees for years. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself: Why won\u2019t he release his tax returns?\u201d Clinton said, suggesting that Trump may not be as wealthy or charitable as he claims. \u201cOr maybe he doesn\u2019t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something he\u2019s hiding!\u201d Clinton alleged. When Holt asked Clinton to address the email scandal, she offered a short and succinct answer: that she had made a mistake and would do things differently if she had the opportunity. \u201cThat was more than a mistake,\u201d Trump shot back. \u201cThat was not a mistake. That was done purposefully.\u201d When the debate turned to the sensitive issue of race and politics, Trump boasted that he had recently visited places like Detroit and Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home,\u201d Trump said to Clinton. Clinton responded: \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know hat else I prepared for? I prepared to be president, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Trump repeated multiple factually inaccurate statements during Monday\u2019s debate, including the assertion that he had opposed the Iraq War. But one claim in particular drew a particularly sharp rebuke from Clinton: that it was her 2008 campaign that had fueled the so-called \u201cbirther\u201d movement. Trump has for years repeated the allegation that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and only recently acknowledged that the president was born in the country. Clinton charged that Trump had spread a \u201cracist lie.\u201d These comments likely foreshadowed an argument that Clinton will continue to make as she attempts to capitalize on the perception of a majority of voters who view Trump as appealing to bigotry. \u201cHe tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can\u2019t be dismissed that easily,\u201d Clinton said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Part of an occasional series on the political makeup of the United States \u201cLemme show you the Trump truck!,\u201d says Bob Belonzi, excitedly. He\u2019s got the cutting Long Island accent of a man who\u2019s lived out here his entire life and he just took the Ford F-150 in on a trade at Sayville Ford on Sunrise Highway, where he works. The pickup had a \u201cTrump 2016\u201d decal on the back. This is where we would do our interview. But first one of his guys would need to peel the confederate flag sticker from above the Trump decal. This is New York after all. The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will be held tonight next door in Nassau County at Hofstra University. Donald Trump, whose business empire grew out of neighborhoods an hour\u2019s drive from where Belonzi grew up, got more votes in Suffolk County, Long Island, than anywhere else in New York. And while Suffolk has voted Democratic in every general election since 1992, the conservative resistance is mounting. More Republican primary votes were cast here in May than Democratic votes. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a landslide,\u201d Belonzi says. Trump voters across the country trumpet the billionaire\u2019s political incorrectness, his outsider status. They want change, and they see him as their change-maker. He\u2019s going to send their message. Introducing #MyVote: A nationwide social tour to Election Day That\u2019s true here in Suffolk County as well. But what\u2019s perplexing is exactly why voters here want it. The median household income is $88,323 \u2013 56 percent higher than the national figure. Unemployment sits at 4.4 percent \u2013 lower than both the statewide and national rates. Those income and employment levels would be welcomed in most parts of the country. And yet uncertainty eclipses reality. Will our children be better off than us? Will we retire with dignity like our parents? These are the questions of the white working class. According to a poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation and released last week, a full 50% of working class white voters believe their children\u2019s lives will be worse than theirs. \u201cI think drastic times need drastic changes,\u201d Chris Cavanaugh, the owner of an eponymous Irish sports bar in Blue Point, said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of a common-sense thing, that the way things are going, it\u2019s not working and we need big changes.\u201d Cavanaugh looks like a middle-aged man on the verge of a peaceful retirement spent on a small boat in the waters off his town\u2019s shoreline. In fact, he now works three days a week in his bar\u2019s kitchen, just to save money. \u201cYou would think after 30 years of doing this, it would get somewhat easier, but it seems I\u2019m working harder now than I ever did \u2013 to make the same amount of money that I was making 20 years ago.\u201d The stories are the same across Suffolk County. As old industries die out or shift to cheaper states or countries, new industries come in, and so does a new pay scale. \u201cFolks that used to make $25, $35, $45 an hour on an assembly line may now be making $15 or $20 an hour working in the healthcare business,\u201d said Lawrence Levy, the executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra. \u201cMany people have remained in the [same] houses they did when they were making more money \u2013 they just owe more,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThey have had to scale back their retirement plans, their kid\u2019s education.\u201d Southern liberals have a fondness for Hillary Clinton Artie Burke used to live in the relatively well-off town of Huntington Station. He left the New York City police force shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and opened a pizza restaurant in Northport. Things were going well. He bought his parents a house in Florida. But the economic downturn took a toll, and he and his wife consolidated and moved to the loft apartment above the restaurant. The financial stresses eventually unraveled their marriage. \u201c[I] live paycheck to paycheck, basically,\u201d Burke said. \u201cAnd then in the wintertime \u2013 this is a summer town \u2013 I have to juggle my money. Basically try to figure out, you know, take a loan here or whatever just to keep the place afloat until the summertime and then pay back all of those loans.\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d he laughs, \u201cI\u2019m back at the same position I was last year.\u201d Burke says he\u2019s \u201c51% leaning towards Trump,\u201d but he\u2019s just as unhappy with his choices this year as he was in 2012, when he just didn\u2019t vote. \u201cI might not vote,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which way to go.\u201d Indeed, only 14% of working-class white voters believe the government in Washington represents the views of people like them, according to the CNN/Kaiser poll. And in a further indictment, 62% of them think the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for their economic woes. Outside Cleveland, thousands of Democrats are becoming Republicans Many perceive Trump voters \u2013 and specifically this subset of white working class folks who support him in droves \u2013 as angry. Trump says he\u2019s \u201crepresenting a lot of anger out there,\u201d but not \u201cangry people\u201d \u2013 just people who are angry at the system. If the white working class is made up of angry people, they\u2019re reluctant to admit it. The CNN/Kaiser poll proves Trump may be correct: 79 percent of white working class voters describe themselves as happy. Just 18 percent say they\u2019re angry. So what\u2019s driving these voters to Trump on the far reaches of Long Island? \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s no spirit in the United States,\u201d Cavanaugh said. \u201cThere\u2019s no, I don\u2019t want to say the word \u2018fear,\u2019 but we were always held up a pedestal and it\u2019s not like that anymore. It\u2019s not a good feeling.\u201d",

Since September 1, Kaine has headlined 25 fundraisers in 12 states and Washington, DC, while Clinton has only held eight. The billionaires strike back Kaine continued his fundraising blitz on Wednesday in California with multiple events in the Bay Area, including a luncheon featuring two long-time Republican donors. Thursday, he\u2019s in Houston for an event that features singer Michael Bolton. This is Bolton\u2019s second fundraiser for Clinton; he appeared at an event during the Democratic primaries. The Texas Tribune first reported Bolton\u2019s appearance. The Houston event is part of Kaine\u2019s cash-raising spree. Kaine appeared Wednesday at the Atherton home of Jillian Manus, a Republican donor, philanthropist and businesswoman. The event will be co-hosted by HP CEO Meg Whitman, who ran for California governor as a Republican in 2010. Whitman endorsed Clinton in August, writing in a statement that she would vote for and donate to Clinton. According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the Clinton campaign, Kaine has raised over $16 million in September, as of Wednesday. Clinton has raised around $13 million by the same standard. Clinton also canceled her trip to California earlier this month after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. The change comes after an August where both Clinton and Kaine focused more on fundraising than they did on campaigning. The Democratic duo headlined 70 fundraisers in August (37 for Clinton, 33 for Kaine). The events raised over $80 million, according to CNN\u2019s estimate. Clinton aides say that August will be the high-water mark for Clinton personally headlining events. While she will continue to headline events, one aide said more of the load would continue to fall on Kaine. The change is one that donors have long expected and were somewhat surprised it didn\u2019t happen in August. Even if Clinton was a more prolific fundraiser in August, Kaine hit the ground running on the fundraising circuit after he was named Clinton\u2019s running mate in July. To date, the former Virginia senator has headlined 58 fundraising events and raised closed to $30 million. Clinton still remains a far bigger draw than Kaine, with many of her fundraisers costing tens of thousands of dollars to attend. But Kaine has headlined his share of top dollar fundraisers. An event at the Los Angeles home of Cynthia and Charles Hirschhorn on Tuesday raised $1.4 million. Charles Hirschhorn, a movie producer who worked on \u201cBull Durham\u201d and \u201cDirty Rotten Scoundrels,\u201d was housemates with Kaine in their student days at Harvard Law School. On Monday, Kaine headlined a \u201cLatinos for Hillary\u201d event at the Los Angeles home of actress Eva Longoria. Kaine also headlined an event Tavern on the Green, the historic New York restaurant in Central Park, where five donors paid a whopping $500,000 to dine with the VP candidate. In all, the intimate event raised $2.5 million. Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was tapped as Clinton\u2019s running mate, in part, because of his ability to raise the money needed to compete in a presidential election. While other factors like his preparedness and ability to win over white working-class voters were key factors in Clinton\u2019s decision to pick Kaine, aides said in July that the Virginia senator was the best fundraiser being considered.",

            "article_content": "This time of year in Delaware, Ohio they like a close race with plenty of mud and lots of noise. It\u2019s not the rollicking presidential race but the Rough Truck competition at the county fair. But even here, politics are never far away. Across the midway in the merchants\u2019 barn, you\u2019ll find booths for both political parties. And just like the polls in Ohio, the booths are pretty close \u2013 maybe too close. \u201cWe had a life size cut out of Hillary Clinton but somebody took it,\u201d said a Democratic volunteer. The volunteer wasn\u2019t pointing any fingers but this year the political shenanigans aren\u2019t limited to the fair grounds. In this key battleground state, both campaigns are reaching out to some very unlikely voters. For the Trump campaign, that would be Jeff Hill. \u201cYeah, Donald Trump\u201ds who I\u2019m voting for,\u201d Hill said. 2016: Last call for working class whites? He is a disaffected Democrat, drawn by Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Hill is exactly the demographic Trump appeals to \u2013 older, white and blue collar. Census numbers show Ohio has more voters like him than any other battleground state. It explains why Trump is in Ohio almost every week, showing up on traditional Democratic turf like factory towns, coal fields even Union halls. The Republican nominee recently appeared at the Canfield Fair, Ohio\u2019s largest county fair, where he drew a huge crowd in a county where Republicans rarely get more than 35% of the vote. Bob Paduchik, Trump\u2019s Ohio campaign director, credits Trump\u2019s message of security and fairer trade deals. \u201cI think that resonates not just with Republicans but also Independents and Democrats,\u201d he said. Trump isn\u2019t the only one after non typical voters. Donald Trump: \u2018There\u2019s a lack of spirit between the white and the black\u2019 The Clinton campaign has set its sights on suburban neighborhoods like Powell just north of Columbus, which is predominantly white, upper middle class and rich in Republicans. The Clinton campaign believes some voters here might side with the Democratic nominee if they\u2019re unable to stomach the idea of voting for Trump. Some Republicans don\u2019t need much selling. Sherrie Scarton has been a long time conservative voting for Ronald Reagan, John McCain and Mitt Romney. She even voted for Ohio Governor John Kasich in the primary. But she is not voting for Trump. \u201cHillary\u2019s a smart woman and Trump is just, I hate to say it, he\u2019s a maniac,\u201d she said. But Paul Beck, a political science professor at The Ohio State University, isn\u2019t so sure this kind of political sniping is enough to win an election. He thinks many Ohio voters haven\u2019t made up their minds how they will vote or even if they will vote at all. \u201cWhat events occur between now and November 8th, what the debates look like what kind of terrorism activity \u2013 there are all these kind of things that are out there in the firmament that can have an impact on what people end up doing in Election 2016,\u201d Beck said. When asked whether anyone has the Buckeye State wrapped up, Beck\u2019s answer was simple: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d",

            "article_content": "RNC Chair Reince Priebus is pushing the party's 2016 field to back Donald Trump Priebus warned that those who don't could face penalties if they run for president again Republicans are preparing for the penalty phase of the 2016 election. The next Republican civil war came into greater focus over the weekend when party chairman Reince Priebus threw a thinly veiled warning at former GOP 2016ers who haven\u2019t yet endorsed Donald Trump: \u201cGet on board\u201d or face penalties if you ever seek the presidency again. The nudge \u2013 aimed at Republicans such as John Kasich, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush \u2013 was no off-the-cuff expression of frustration. Several Republican party chairs in early voting states told CNN that Priebus has spent days talking about enforcing the pledge that all 17 GOP candidates signed at the outset of the 2016 primary to support the eventual nominee. Find out all you need to know for the 2016 election on \u201cThe Daily DC\u201d podcast \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people have asked me, \u2018What are you going to do about these candidates that are not keeping their promise?\u2019\u201d Iowa GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann told CNN Monday. Donald Trump's empire He said the Iowa state GOP receives 10 to 20 calls per week from rank-and-file Republicans wondering what, specifically, the party will do to force Kasich, Cruz and Bush to stick to their pledges and back Trump. \u201cIf I\u2019m hearing it here from a state of 3 million, it must a megaphone there in DC,\u201d said Kaufmann, who has spoken with Priebus and other Republican officials about enforcing the pledge. \u201cThere\u2019s no wiggle room in terms of what that promise was, and it should be honored.\u201d A representative for Priebus didn\u2019t comment on the conversations. But his call for penalties wasn\u2019t widely embraced \u2013 with the No. 2 House Republican breaking with Priebus Tuesday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s a better way to unite people. I\u2019m not a big believer that punishment unites people,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters at a weekly session in the Capitol. The California Republican added, \u201cIf Hillary (Clinton) can\u2019t unite Republicans, I don\u2019t think anything can.\u201d Of course, talk of penalties on candidates who might run in 2020 could be all for naught if Trump wins. The race between Trump and Clinton has narrowed dramatically in recent weeks, though the Democratic nominee still has more paths to the White House. But the episode underscores the frenzy that could consume the GOP if Trump loses the race and the party searches for a new direction. The anatomy of a white, working-class Trump voter \u201cWe\u2019re watching the trailer for the GOP civil war, out in theaters November 9,\u201d said a top Republican strategist, who asked not to be named to avoid openly feuding with Priebus. The penalty talk spilled into the open Sunday, when Priebus told John Dickerson on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that members of the 2016 Republican presidential field who haven\u2019t yet abided by their pledge to back the eventual nominee and endorsed Trump need to \u201cget on board.\u201d And for those who don\u2019t, he said future presidential bids won\u2019t \u201cbe that easy.\u201d \u201cIf a private entity puts forward a process and has agreement with the participants in that process, and those participants don\u2019t follow through with the promises that they made in that process,\u201d Priebus said, \u201cwhat should a private party do about that if those same people come around in four or eight years?\u201d Kasich\u2019s camp quickly zipped off a response accusing Priebus of putting party over principles. Kasich strategist John Weaver said the Ohio governor \u201cwill not be bullied by a Kenosha political operative that is unable to stand up for core principles or beliefs.\u201d The Republican National Convention Cruz brushed Priebus off Tuesday evening. \u201cThese are serious times. I think the last thing we need to worrying about is bickering between Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus is on defeating Hillary Clinton and helping preserve a Senate Republican majority.\u201d Penalties, several Republicans said, would likely come from the national party in the form of restrictions on access to the Republican National Committee\u2019s data and voter files \u2013 and potentially bans from primary debates. Individual states, though, likely couldn\u2019t keep candidates off their ballots. Still, Republicans cautioned that talk of penalizing pledge-breakers is aimed at nudging Kasich, Cruz, Bush and others to support Trump in 2016 \u2013 not to handicap the party\u2019s presidential candidates in the future. Some said it\u2019s not even clear the RNC would have authority to impose the crackdown Priebus discussed. \u201cReince has simply posed a question to which there is no good answer yet \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure that the question deserves an answer. That\u2019s to be determined,\u201d said Matt Moore, the South Carolina GOP chairman. RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to address the possibility of penalizing future presidential candidates who didn\u2019t abide by their pledges to support Trump. \u201cWe are focused on winning back the White House and maintaining our majorities in the House and Senate,\u201d Walters said in an email. Donald Trump opens the personal insult vault (again) While some party honchos like Kaufmann backed Priebus\u2019 warning shot, others \u2013 including Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges \u2013 bristled. \u201cNo. This is not what we are all about as a party. Besides, let\u2019s stay focused on 2016 for the next 50 days,\u201d Borges tweeted Sunday night. Top Mitt Romney 2012 strategist Stuart Stevens tweeted: \u201cSo idea is most popular recent Republican governors of battleground states should run as independents? Great plan.\u201d The RNC\u2019s handling of Trump under Priebus will be on trial as the party picks a new chair \u2013 or extends the Wisconsin operative\u2019s tenure \u2013 shortly after the election. Then comes a swing-state governor\u2019s race in Virginia, followed by the midterm elections, where Trump\u2019s brand of populism could butt against more orthodox conservatives. And in 2020, the early stages of the Republican primary would be defined by how the candidates treated Trump. It would be the clearest differentiator of like-minded conservatives like Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who became Trump\u2019s running mate and chief defender, and Cruz, the Texas senator who was booed off stage for refusing to endorse Trump at his own nominating convention. \u201cAssuming Trump loses, there\u2019ll be a really pitched battle for the heart and soul of the party,\u201d said Weaver, the Kasich strategist who wrote the scathing rebuttal to Priebus on Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have off-year elections, you\u2019re going to have midterms \u2013 some of that will impact the defining of the party, clearly. But you won\u2019t have any new definition of it until there\u2019s a new nominee,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThere\u2019s a broader debate ultimately about what the party stands for and where the country should go.\u201d Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP Many Republicans still fault Priebus for failing to criticize Trump forcefully enough in late 2015, when he proposed a clearly unconstitutional ban of all Muslims from entering the United States, and believe the party could have done more to slow Trump\u2019s rise. They point out a particular irony: The party that insisted it couldn\u2019t intercede in the 2016 nominating contest is now threatening to use its leverage to undercut individual candidates in future races. Saul Anuzis, a former Michigan GOP chairman who helmed Cruz\u2019s state effort in the primary, defended pledge-breaking candidates, arguing that \u201ccircumstances change\u201d \u2013 a reference to the pledge\u2019s creation as a tool to keep Trump from launching an independent campaign. He said he doesn\u2019t see how Priebus could impose penalties on future presidential candidates. \u201cThere\u2019s no provisions in the RNC rules that allow anybody to punish anybody,\u201d Anuzis said. \u201cThe idea of doing that, I think, is extremely difficult, because you normally are looking toward the future, not the past.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: White, Working-Class and Worried is a CNN partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation - an extensive survey of white, working-class Americans and voters, who form a backbone of the support for Donald Trump. Watch Anderson Cooper 360 and CNN.com for reports throughout the week. Each morning for the last 65 years, 93-year-old Ed Shepard has walked to work to open up the Union 76 service station, here in rolling hills of West Virginia coal country. When he looks out his window, he can see a sweeping mural that shows what life in Welch used to be like. A United Cigars shop on one side of the street, a Western Union sign on the other. Lines of cars stretch into the distance. Even Shepard himself \u2013 who is as much a fixture of Welch as any of its buildings \u2013 is in the mural, a blue cap perched on his head.  \u201cThere wasn\u2019t ten square feet in this town that didn\u2019t have a successful business in it, a business of every kind,\u201d Shepard said in an interview. \u201cNo matter what you wanted or needed, you could buy it in Welch.\u201d Those were better days. Now it\u2019s a place, people who live here say, that politicians use as a convenient photo op and that the federal government has left behind, a sentiment common among white working class voters. 56% of non-college educated whites say the government in Washington does not represent them, according to a new poll conducted by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation. And two-thirds say they are dissatisfied with the influence people like them have on politics. Locals referred to the once-bustling Welch as \u201cLittle New York,\u201d but now the town and the county around it are slowly slipping away. The storefronts are empty. The buildings and houses here are now crumbling with decay. Shepard used to take checks to the bank each Monday \u2013 sometimes $1,000, sometimes $1,500. He hasn\u2019t had to do that in four or five years he said, because he hasn\u2019t had one customer in that long. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to watch the population disappear, the business disappear and the activity to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the 50s, 60s, 70s, it\u2019d be hard to walk up the sidewalk because there was so many people. Now you walk up the sidewalk and there\u2019s nobody.\u201d McDowell County\u2019s population is just 19,835 down from 100,000 in the 1950s. That decline is expected to continue. West Virginia University economists estimate that McDowell will continue to lose residents at a rate of 1% each year. Some, particularly in rural areas like McDowell County, say the government\u2019s at fault. Rural working class whites are more likely to blame the federal government for their economic problems than their urban counterparts. Seven in ten say the federal government deserves all or most of the blame for the economic problems facing the working class, in the CNN Kaiser survey, compared with half of urban working class whites. That could explain the appeal of a candidate who is not only intent on upsetting the political system, but has at times seemed bent on breaking it down to start over again. On this winding drive through the hilly roads of Appalachia, there are few signs signaling support for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but Trump is expected to do well here. West Virginia hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat since Bill Clinton\u2019s second term. Much has changed in the last 20 years and now Clinton is seen as squarely at odds with the coal industry, which is the bedrock of Welch and the surrounding county. No matter who wins in November, some residents of West Virginia coal country don\u2019t believe anything will change their lives. They have come to accept, as Gary Hall, a 55-year-old Trump supporter put it, \u201cthat next year is going to be worse than the last year\u201d no matter who is president. Hall said he felt alienated from the political process, but rejected the idea that he and other whites without college degrees were angry and flocking to Trump as a result. The CNN/Kaiser foundation survey suggests that\u2019s the case, too. Just 19% of working class white voters described themselves as angry about how things are going in their own lives. \u201cWe\u2019re conditioned that there\u2019s really nothing you can do about it. The only thing outrage and protesting and stuff does is cause bad feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are just resigned to have what they have. The ones that want to leave, the ones that can leave and want to leave leave. Everybody else just stays here.\u201d Rural working class white voters like Hall are more likely to say America\u2019s best days are behind us and that their children will be worse off than they are today. In the CNN/Kaiser survey, 58% of rural working class whites say America\u2019s best days have come and gone and 57% say their children will be worse off compared with less than half of urban working class whites who say the same. West Virginia is one of the nation\u2019s largest coal-producing states and McDowell County used to produce more coal than any county here. But there\u2019s been a steep downturn in coal jobs across the state due to competition with cheaper natural gas, tougher environmental rules and mechanization, and this county has seen the worst of it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have another option,\u201d said Cecil Patterson, 51, who spent his life working in the coal industry and serves on McDowell County\u2019s county commission. \u201cOnce we shut down the coal industry here there\u2019s nowhere to go, there\u2019s nothing else to do, there\u2019s no other jobs available.\u201d The unemployment rate here was 12.5% in July, compared with 4.9% nationwide. When work dries up, people leave, Patterson said, doing anything they can to make ends meet. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go to the next county here, you have to leave the state. A man tries to go out of the state, maintain an apartment, try to keep his home back up here, it just puts such a struggle on the family.\u201d Trump won McDowell handily in West Virginia\u2019s May primary, taking 91.5% of the Republican vote \u2013 his largest margin of victory in the country. But even before becoming his party\u2019s presumptive nominee the week prior, he was the favorite to win in the state. During a campaign rally in West Virginia in May, Trump promised to bring back lost-coal mining jobs but hasn\u2019t said how he\u2019d pull it off. Many people here were skeptical that he could \u2013 but credit him with giving them hope. And animosity toward Clinton runs high. Even months later, people still repeat \u2013 verbatim \u2013 the comment Clinton made that her climate change policies would \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Many people here with ties to the coal industry \u2013 virtually everyone here is linked to it \u2013 see Clinton\u2019s comments about coal disqualifying and Trump as their only answer. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna be Hillary,\u201d said 34-year-old Ryan Barnette, his face black with soot, minutes after leaving the mine. \u201cShe wants to shut down the coal industry \u2013 that\u2019s gonna put me out of a job.\u201d Elaine Lacaria \u2013 known here as Laney \u2013 was a lifelong Democrat and voted for Clinton eight years ago. But now things have changed. \u201cI won\u2019t vote for her again. No, never,\u201d she said in an interview in the dress shop she opened in 2008, the same year then-Senator Barack Obama was elected president. In the eight years since then, she said things have gotten worse. Jobs have dried up, people are leaving and not coming back and addiction has ravaged this community and others near it. \u201cWhen we drive anywhere you see small town USA is no more,\u201d Lacaria said. \u201cThis has affected all of us, not just the coal fields.\u201d Lacaria said she\u2019ll never vote for a Democrat again and this year, she\u2019ll support Trump. \u201cWhen I see Trump as a businessman, I think he will help our county definitely, but I think he will help our country as a whole. He knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Patterson, who also said he plans to vote for Trump due to his support of the coal industry, said the same. \u201cWhen we wake up the morning after an election, our roads are going to be getting worse, our sewer, our water, our schools are failing, Patterson said. \u201cThey want us to keep paying more and we keep getting less, so there\u2019s my take on where we\u2019re at the day after the election.\u201d Others, like 69-year-old Vira Rose, say no politician or government got them in this position. And they don\u2019t expect to be saved. Rose, who was one of the first women to work as a mine foreman in the area, owns her own auto repair shop. She once sold new tires, now a stack of used tires for sale sits outside of the shop. People can\u2019t afford new ones anymore, she said. \u201cSometimes I come here at 8 a.m., I get out of here at 8 or 9 at night. Any job comes, you don\u2019t turn it down and say tomorrow. If you say tomorrow, tomorrow won\u2019t be here. You grab it, you do it \u2013 then you help others,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re the forgotten tribe.\u201d She has no faith in Clinton or Trump. \u201cWhat am I gonna do? I\u2019m not gonna vote for neither damn one of them,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s not much difference, there\u2019s really not.\u201d",

It seems like the attacks are getting a little more intense.\u201d Pence defended Trump\u2019s recent comments about Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom Trump accused of keeping interest rates low and creating a \u201cfalse stock market\u201d in order to help President Barack Obama. The Indiana governor declined to accuse Yellen of political gamesmanship, but said he had a hard time figuring out the Fed\u2019s policies. Donald Trump\u2019s unfulfilled promises \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to understand why the Fed continues to advance policies that really work for hedge fund managers on Wall Street, here in New York City, but really aren\u2019t working for working families on Main Street,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI think Donald Trump is saying that it\u2019s time that we brought forward the kind of economic policies that will allow interest rates to return to a rational point.\u201d He added, \u201cI just think it\u2019s very curious to see the Federal Reserve continue to resist efforts to respond in the marketplace in a way that puts the interest of middle class families first.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2013 which the GOP nominee has refused to release \u2013 Pence reiterated the campaign\u2019s stance that voters won\u2019t see them until the conclusion of what Trump has said is an ongoing IRS audit. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot of people talking about tax returns,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s been very forthcoming about saying that he\u2019ll reveal those tax returns when a routine audit is done.\u201d Pence maintained that voters curious about learning more about Trump\u2019s financial dealings already have that information available. \u201cWhat your viewers ought to know is that both Donald Trump and I, and frankly the other two major party candidates in this race, have all filed the full financial disclosure that federal law requires,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd people that want to learn about Donald Trump\u2019s financial interests can read over 100 pages of disclosure online right now at the Federal Election Commission. And I encourage people that are curious to do that. Those tax returns will be coming when that routine audit is done.\u201d Pence also defended Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s controversial comments earlier Thursday when he referred to \u201cwarming up the gas chamber\u201d in complaining about the treatment his father has received from the media compared to its coverage of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump goes after Flint pastor who interrupted him for attacking Clinton in church \u201cWell, clearly he was talking about capitol punishment and not making reference to that awful period of history we know to be the Holocaust,\u201d Pence said. \u201cBut look, his point is well made beyond whatever rhetoric he chose to use.\u201d When asked about Trump\u2019s new child care plan that the businessman unveiled on Tuesday with the help of his daughter Ivanka, Pence said that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s \u201cappreciation for the role of working women.\u201d Pence also defended his 1997 remarks when he wrote, \u201cThe daycare kids get the short end of the emotional stick,\u201d saying that he has since changed his mind about the issue. \u201cThat was probably a real long time ago \u2026 I think I still had dark hair back then, Erin \u2026 I will always believe that the best child care is an is in the home where a family that has the means to be able to provide that,\u201d Pence said, adding, \u201cBut we have some world-class child care in our country today.\u201d",

While Clinton remained at home in New York recovering from pneumonia, Obama poked fun at Republican nominee Donald Trump and otherwise looked like he thoroughly enjoyed himself. Obama: \u2018I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton\u2019 Here\u2019s a look at his most memorable quotes: \u201cThink about the fact that (Russian President Vladimir Putin) is Donald Trump\u2019s role model. I have to do business with Putin, I have to do business with Russia, but I don\u2019t go around saying, \u2018That\u2019s my role model.\u2019 Can you imagine Reagan idolizing somebody like that?\u201d \u201cCan you imagine Reagan idolizing somebody like that?\" Obama hits Trump for Putin comments https://t.co/yVBwqipVXf https://t.co/uNsJWwD2Pa \u201cOne candidate\u2019s family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate\u2019s foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a 6\u2019 tall painting of himself. And he had the taste not to go for the 10\u2019 version,\u201d Obama joked. \u201cYou want to debate transparency? You\u2019ve got one candidate in this race who\u2019s released decades\u2019 worth of her tax returns. The other candidate is the first in decades who refuses to release any at all,\u201d Obama said. President Barack Obama: \"I am really into electing Hillary Clinton\" https://t.co/rkkaVLGqN4 https://t.co/YXtImXOxci \u201cI am really into electing Hillary Clinton. This isn\u2019t me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u201cShe knows that in a democracy in a big, diverse country like this one it doesn\u2019t work if we just demonize each other and call each other names. She knows that love trumps hate.\u201d President Obama: Hillary Clinton \"knows that love trumps hate\" https://t.co/5hVyiq5XW1 https://t.co/uKFUYdu7kL \u201cThis is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people? This guy\u2019s suddenly going to be your champion? He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could. And now this guy is going to be the champion of working people? Huh?\u201d \u201cFor four years, I had a front-row seat. I watched her intelligence, I watched her judgment, I watched her discipline. I saw her in the situation room where she argued for the mission of (Osama) bin Laden \u2026 because she had never forgotten what she was fighting for.\u201d President Barack Obama: Hillary Clinton \"had never forgotten what she was fighting for\" https://t.co/rkkaVLGqN4 https://t.co/K8w4vCQ59f \u201cIn election season, you will often hear crazy stuff. But I got to say, this year we\u2019ve been hearing a little more crazy than usual. Having said that, after almost two terms as your president, I am here to tell you I\u2019m more optimistic about our future than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Obama on this election season: \"This year we've been hearing a little more crazy than usual\" https://t.co/rkkaVLGqN4 https://t.co/Kjz4reVaXi \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Republicans don\u2019t like to hear good news right now. But it\u2019s important to understand this a big deal. More Americans are working. More have health insurance. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling.\u201d \u201cAnd gas is $2 a gallon!\u201d yelled a person in the audience. \u201cAnd gas is $2 a gallon. I didn\u2019t even \u2013 Thank you for reminding me. Thanks Obama,\u201d Obama joked. President Obama on gas prices: \"Thanks, Obama\" https://t.co/rkkaVLGqN4 https://t.co/QY45OoPdOM \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen from the other side in this election is this isn\u2019t Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Republican Party. This isn\u2019t even the vision of freedom that Ronald Reagan talked about. This is a dark, pessimistic vision of a country where we turned against each other. We turn away from the rest of the world.\u201d President Obama: \"This isn't Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party\" https://t.co/rkkaVLGqN4 https://t.co/Fw0aCdcgUb \u201cWe\u2019ve got somebody fainted. This is what happens, they\u2019ll be OK, just give a little room. Everybody bend their knees one time \u2026 keep on bending them a little bit, we\u2019ll do a little exercise right now.

            "article_content": "\"You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,\" Clinton said Clinton described the rest of Trump supporters as people who are looking for change in any form Hillary Clinton expressed \u201cregret\u201d Saturday for comments in which she said \u201chalf\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are \u201cdeplorables,\u201d meaning people who are racist, sexist, homophobic or xenophobic. \u201cLast night I was \u2018grossly generalistic,\u2019 and that\u2019s never a good idea. I regret saying \u2018half\u2019 \u2013 that was wrong,\u201d Clinton said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out \u201cbigotry\u201d in Trump\u2019s campaign. The Democratic presidential nominee sparked an uproar late Friday when she described Trump\u2019s supporters at a fundraiser. \u201cTo just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cRight? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.\u201d She added: \u201cAnd unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric.\u201d Clinton then said some of these people were \u201cirredeemable\u201d and \u201cnot America.\u201d She described the rest of his supporters as people who are looking for change in any form because of economic anxiety and urged her supporters to empathize with them. The Democratic presidential nominee made similar comments in an interview Thursday with an Israeli television station. But when they were widely reported Friday night, Trump and Republicans quickly pounced on the remarks, which drew comparisons to President Barack Obama\u2019s comments about clinging to \u201cguns and religion\u201d at a 2008 campaign fundraiser and Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d remark in 2012. \u201cIsn\u2019t it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cFor the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans.\u201d Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, forcefully condemned Clinton \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d Saturday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. \u201cThe truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump\u2019s campaign are hard-working Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country, who know that we can make America great again,\u201d Pence said. \u201cLet me just say, from the bottom of my heart, Hillary, they are not a basket of anything,\u201d Pence continued. \u201cThey are Americans and they deserve your respect.\u201d Clinton had earlier divided Trump\u2019s supporters into \u201ctwo big baskets,\u201d what she called \u201cthe deplorables,\u201d in an interview with Channel 2 News Israel that aired Thursday. \u201cIf I were to be grossly generalistic, I would say you can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere are what I call the deplorables \u2013 the racists, you know, the haters, and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he\u2019s going to restore an America that no longer exists. So just eliminate them from your thinking, because we\u2019ve always had an annoying prejudicial element within our politics.\u201d Clinton made the comments before introducing Barbra Streisand at an LGBT fundraiser in downtown New York. According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the campaign, Clinton raised around $6 million at the fundraiser, at which some attendees paid $50,000. In seizing upon the comments, Trump used the opportunity to do some fundraising as well. \u201cNow is the time to show Hillary the consequences of her words,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign wrote in an appeal to supporters. \u201cI\u2019m asking you and the millions of hard-working, patriotic Americans whom she just insulted, to fight back with a contribution of $100, $65, $50, $35, $25, $15, or even $5 to elect Donald Trump to the White House.\u201d In her statement Saturday, Clinton was emphatic in condemning what she said was Trump\u2019s racially insensitive campaign. She listed a series of controversial moments from Trump\u2019s campaign, including his fight with a Muslim Gold Star family, criticism of a federal US judge of Mexican heritage and his insinuation that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US. \u201cI won\u2019t stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign,\u201d Clinton said. She also noted her comments about empathizing with other Trump supporters. \u201cAs I said, many of Trump\u2019s supporters are hard-working Americans who just don\u2019t feel like the economy or our political system are working for them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are \u2018stronger together.\u2019\u201d Around the same time Clinton issued her statement, Trump also made a case for unity. \u201cWhile Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!\u201d Trump said on Twitter. While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all! A senior Democrat close to the campaign told CNN it wants to have a conversation about what it sees as the racism in Trump\u2019s campaign, but could not have that part of the conversation until Clinton backed away from the \u201chalf\u201d comment. The Democrat added that Clinton\u2019s concession drew a contrast with Trump. \u201cShe can admit when she is wrong \u2013 Trump never does,\u201d the Democrat said. Clinton\u2019s comments amounted to startlingly blunt talk for a candidate who is usually measured in her assessment of the Republican nominee. Although Clinton has accused Trump of racism before, she has never explicitly called him a racist. Last month, she delivered a major speech in which she accused Trump of aligning himself with far-right extremists and saying he \u201cbuilt his campaign on prejudice and paranoia.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party,\u201d Clinton said in Reno, Nevada. \u201cHis disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.\u201d Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, cited the speech in attempting to clarify the Democratic nominee\u2019s comments Friday night. \u201cObviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right, but alt right leaders are with Trump,\u201d Merrill tweeted, adding, \u201cAnd their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign was continuing to dig in Saturday morning as outrage swirled over the comment, though surrogates were emphasizing that Clinton was talking about Trump\u2019s supporters \u2013 people who attend his rallies \u2013 and not Trump voters, a larger group, in the eyes of the campaign, that includes more moderate Republicans. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine told The Washington Post that Clinton\u2019s statement didn\u2019t require an apology. \u201cShe said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m generalizing here, but a lot of his support is coming from this odd place, that he\u2019s given a platform to the alt-right and white nationalists,\u2019\u201d Kaine told the newspaper. \u201cBut then she went on to say, \u2018Look, there\u2019s also a number of his supporters that have economic anxieties, and we\u2019ve got to speak to those.\u2019\u201d Added Kaine: \u201cThere are supporters we\u2019re not going to get.\u201d Tyrone Gale, a Clinton spokesman, rejected Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway\u2019s call on Twitter for an apology by tweeting a New York Times video depicting vulgar and obscene comments made by some Trump supporters at his rallies. And Bakari Sellers, a Clinton surrogate and CNN contributor, was defiant when asked about the remark. \u201cThis election is about beating back bigotry and hate,\u201d Sellers said in an interview. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 10% or 50%, Donald Trump and his supporters have elevated it. If you\u2019re not a bigot, her comments shouldn\u2019t offend you.\u201d The Clinton campaign directed surrogates on Saturday night to push the press if asked about the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d comment, according to a talking points obtained by CNN. \u201cI think we can all agree that if Donald Trump said something controversial about Clinton supporters, it wouldn\u2019t have been in his top 10 list of offensive statements in a day. It\u2019s well past time the press stopped grading Trump on a curve,\u201d the talking points said. \u201cSo is the press going to cover this story in the right contact, or are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again?\u201d The controversy recalled rhetorical stumbles in previous campaigns. In 2008, Obama told an audience at a closed fundraiser that decades of lost jobs and unfulfilled promises from Washington had left some Pennsylvanians \u201cbitter\u201d and clinging \u201cto guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren\u2019t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\u201d He later acknowledged that the comment was \u201cboneheaded.\u201d And late in the 2012 campaign, Romney, the GOP nominee, was memorably caught in a secretly recorded video telling donors that \u201cthere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the President no matter what,\u201d saying they \u201cbelieve they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.\u201d Romney later told reporters the comments were \u201cnot elegantly stated.\u201d Trump himself invoked the gaffe to slam Clinton Saturday night, also retweeting Obama\u2019s remark four years ago that \u201cWe need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.\u201d What separates Obama and Romney\u2019s comments from Clinton\u2019s, however, is that they believed their remarks were private. Clinton\u2019s event on Friday was only the sixth out of the more than 330 fundraisers she\u2019s attended as a candidate that was open to the press. Almost immediately, \u201c#BasketofDeplorables\u201d began trending on Twitter, and conservatives and Trump supporters were predictably outraged. \u201cThe truly deplorable thing in this race is the shameful level of condescension & disrespect @HillaryClinton\u2019s showing to her fellow citizens,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Twitter. The truly deplorable thing in this race is the shameful level of condescension & disrespect @HillaryClinton's showing to her fellow citizens Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt suggested Trump open each speech by asking his crowds, \u201cSo, which half of you are in the #basketofdeplorables?\u201d 4 @realDonaldTrump: Every speech should start \"So, which half of you are in the #basketofdeplorables?\" In every TV hit you should reference. Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, a notable Trump critic, tweeted, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s creed: \u2018All men are created equal\u2019 \u2013 except for those I\u2019ve consigned to the basket of deplorables, who are irredeemable.\u201d Hillary Clinton's creed: \"All men are created equal\" -- except for those I've consigned to the basket of deplorables, who are irredeemable. Even some Democrats noted the political opportunity Clinton had given Republicans. \u201c\u2018Basket of deplorables\u2019 reminds me of \u2018binders full of women.\u2019 Equally tone deaf statements divorced from reality,\u201d tweeted Lis Smith, Obama\u2019s director of rapid response during his 2012 campaign. David Axelrod, a former chief strategist to Obama who is now a CNN commentator, referenced the controversy over Obama\u2019s \u201cguns and religion\u201d line at a 2008 fundraiser, tweeting, \u201cFundraiser remarks are treacherous things.\u201d Fundraiser remarks are treacherous things.  https://t.co/BF87ArNIwM Speaking to CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish Saturday morning, Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale\u2019s 1984 presidential campaign, offered no defense of Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong thing to say,\u201d Beckel said.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and vice presidential hopeful Tim Kaine appeared together for the first time this election cycle With record-high disapproval ratings, Biden said he worried Clinton may struggle to reach voters Vice President Joe Biden, on his final campaign lap as one of the leading lions of the Democratic Party, offered this blunt advice to Hillary Clinton: \u201cOpen up. Let them see your heart a little more.\u201d Two months before Election Day, questions of trust and honesty are weighing heavy in the race between Clinton and Donald Trump. Biden said the criticism of Clinton has been \u201cveiled and unspecific,\u201d but she needs to show voters that she understands their challenges and pain. \u201cThe truth is Hillary knows it\u2019s a problem. And she\u2019s trying to figure out how to remedy it,\u201d Biden told CNN about perceptions of Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness. \u201cMy advice to her the best way to remedy it is to talk about what you care about. Talk about it with some passion and people will see through it.\u201d Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even race Democrats are sending their full bench to the campaign trail, with Biden and President Barack Obama working aggressively to keep the White House in their party\u2019s hands. They are set to campaign more than any sitting president and vice president have in a generation for their successors. At a Labor Day rally here in Pittsburgh, Biden and vice presidential hopeful Tim Kaine appeared together Monday for the first time in this election cycle. Both men are trying to improve the Democratic ticket\u2019s standing with white working-class voters. \u201cPeople are looking for a ladder,\u201d Kaine told CNN. \u201cThey want to see there is a ladder that they can climb and that\u2019s what Hilary and I are talking about. At the end of the day, that will pose a comparison that is very, very stark.\u201d How Donald Trump could win A year after Biden decided against running for president himself, he said he is \u201c100 percent\u201d invested in helping Clinton. He said Trump was not qualified to be president, but acknowledged it was \u201can incredibly confusing year,\u201d and Democrats should not grow complacent. \u201cI just can\u2019t fathom what he\u2019d do,\u201d Biden said of a Trump presidency. \u201cThe idea that he cares about the plight of middle-class people is just inconsistent with what he\u2019s done.\u201d With both candidates facing record-high disapproval ratings, Biden said he worried Clinton could struggle to reach voters. \u201cThis could be the most negative campaign in the history of modern politics,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy question is, is anybody going to be able to break through what is just sort of a notion of a pox on both your houses?\u201d Sanders solo stumps for Clinton, but do Dems buy it? For Clinton, under constant siege over her use of a private email server as secretary of state and facing questions over whether Clinton Foundation donors had improper access to her State Department, polls have shown trustworthiness is her most significant weakness. Asked whether Clinton had been successful trying to explain the controversies, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a moving target.\u201d But he added that he was \u201cabsolutely confident she is doing it by the book.\u201d \u201cShe is going to figure out what she is going to say,\u201d Biden said, \u201cto be crystal clear to the American people about what the relationship will be between the family and the foundation going forward.\u201d One issue dividing the Democratic Party is trade, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation accord that Obama is trying to win Congressional approval before his term ends. Kaine and Clinton oppose the agreement, which Obama and Biden support. Why the Clinton Foundation controversies won\u2019t go away Asked how he and the President could win over Kaine and Clinton, Biden declared: \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good enough deal to support. The President and I think it is,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut the bottom line is we\u2019re going to attempt in a lame duck (session of Congress) to actually have a vote.\u201d Eight years after Biden was tapped to be Obama\u2019s vice president, he offered one piece of advice for Kaine. \u201cUnderstand that the bureaucracy is gigantic,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs well as you think you know it, take control of it, grab it by the throat. And make sure you follow up in detail on whatever initiative the president gives you.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There could be more turmoil and turnover from the Trump campaign, post-Manafort Clinton is prepping for a big ad onslaught focused on swing states Pollster petition: some want third-party candidates included by name in upcoming polls The prospect of more turmoil in Trump land, new efforts by Team Clinton to target millennials \u2013 and a plea that could shape how many candidates get debate invites: it\u2019s all a part of our Inside Politics forecast. Additions in politics often bring subtraction. More Trump campaign turmoil? Paul Manafort, for example, resigned Friday as chairman of the Trump campaign, just days after his role was significantly reduced with the hiring of a new campaign manager and chief executive. And there\u2019s word that more of the team Manafort brought in is thinking about leaving. Political director Jim Murphy and pollster Tony Fabrizio are among a handful of Trump staffers known to have expressed frustration to close friends in recent days \u2013 suggesting the new team has pushed them out of the loop to the point that they have learned of some new campaign plans either from the media or by watching the candidate on television. Will they head for the exits? Stay tuned. National GOP leaders are worried more departures will cause more questions about a campaign team already considered not up to the challenges of the final months of the campaign. There is talk of trying to resolve these internal conflicts, or perhaps shift some operatives to the national party payroll. But several sources familiar with the internal Trump campaign turmoil said they would not be surprised if one, two or a few current staffers headed for the exits in the days ahead. Hillary Clinton has had a lighter public campaign schedule of late, and along the way drawn some barbs from Donald Trump \u2013 who questions her stamina to be president. Major new Clinton ad buy coming up this week But the Democratic nominee hasn\u2019t been home resting \u2013 she has had a busy schedule of fund-raising, and Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reported the fruits of that effort will be coming soon to battleground state TV screens. \u201cI understand, from the Clinton campaign, they\u2019re going to put down (an) 8-figure buy here this fall. And the idea behind doing that now is you lock in the best rates possible for the ads. And you send the message that you\u2019ll intensify the onslaught against Mr. Trump.\u201d Team Clinton is also planning a big new push to win over millennials. It\u2019s a constituency that tended to favor Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, but the Clinton campaign sees an opening because of millennial doubts about Donald Trump. As Washington Post\u2019s Abby Phillip explained, the Clinton campaign plans to woo those younger voters by using her Republican rival. \u201cMillennials are going toward Clinton over Trump in pretty dramatic numbers. Democrats are really trying to lock that in, not just for this election but for many elections to come. Republicans have not done that kind of outreach. Trump certainly has not done that kind of outreach. And that could be a mistake. This is a very large demographic group rivaling the baby boomers. That could haunt them for elections to come.\u201d Nevada is a holdout at a time many swing states have trended toward Hillary Clinton \u2013 and she is sending in a high-powered emissary to get the lay of the land. Clinton campaign gambling on Nevada Vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine, the Virginia senator, is off to get a firsthand assessment of why Nevada has stayed a virtual dead heat \u2013 and CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson says union workers are one focus. Clinton herself will be in Nevada on Thursday. \u201cThe interesting thing is that demographically, at least racially, it\u2019s very similar to Colorado and Virginia. But yet, it\u2019s still neck-and-neck,\u201d explained Henderson. \u201cThe focus [of the visits] is on union voters, working-class white voters. That\u2019s the difference in the state. It\u2019s 16% union households there. Barack Obama won 60% of those households. So that\u2019s going to be the focus there.\u201d The first fall presidential debate is a little more than a month away, and Libertarian Gary Johnson needs to improve his poll standing if he is to get an invite. So he is asking for help \u2013 from the pollsters. One challenge is that not all polls ask about third-party candidates, and Mary Katharine Ham of the Federalist said a petition campaign designed to change that could help Libertarian chances, but in an odd twist might also hurt them. \u201cEarly this summer, mostly by Johnson, the Libertarian candidate supporters, there was a petition drive to basically say to polls please include his name so he can maybe hit 15%. He\u2019s hit double digits in some. But the petition may have worked too well because now all four candidates are included in many of these polls, which may split that anti-establishment thing. So some jockeying will continue to happen as these invitations to the debates go out in the next two, three weeks.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden will campaign with Clinton in Scranton, as she vies to capture Pennsylvania Clinton hopes Biden can appeal to working and middle class voters Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden stumped together Monday and took on Donald Trump here in Pennsylvania, slamming the Republican nominee as a threat to national security who is unfit to handle economic issues and unable to understand what most Americans are going through. The event in Scranton, a town in Northeast Pennsylvania that both Clinton and Biden have ties to, marked the first time the vice president has hit the campaign trail with Clinton. Biden, in his standard long-winded and free-wheeling style, blasted Trump for \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d comments he made about President Barack Obama being the \u201cfounder\u201d of ISIS. \u201cIf my son were still in Iraq and I say to all those who were there, the threat to their life has gone up a couple of clicks, it has gone up a couple clicks,\u201d Biden said, referencing his late son Beau, who died of cancer in 2015. At one point, Biden noted there is an aide who follows him at all times with the nuclear launch  codes should it be necessary for him to use them if Obama were not able to. \u201cHe is not qualified to know the code!\u201d Biden said of Trump, calling him \u201ctotally unqualified\u201d to be president. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted!\u201d Biden argued that comments like that, as well as glowing statements Trump made about dictators and strongmen like Vladimir Putin \u2013 \u201cHe would have loved Stalin,\u201d Biden said \u2013 show that the Republican nominee is unfit to be president. \u201cNo major party nominee in the history the United States of America \u2026 has known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security than Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd what actually amazes me that he doesn\u2019t seem to want to learn it. I really mean it. He doesn\u2019t seem to want to learn it.\u201d Clinton, who introduced Biden, touted the vice president as a hometown hero who has always remained true to his roots while slamming Trump for not understanding those same origins. On the economy, Clinton said even before Trump laid out his economic agenda last week, she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was going to be good for working Americans.\u201d \u201cBut it turned out to be worse than I even imagined,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI know, friends should not let friends vote for Trump.\u201d Clinton argued that Trump \u201chas been all over the place on ISIS\u201d and noted that he was giving a speech about the terror group on Monday. \u201cWe will wait and see what he says today. Sometimes he says he won\u2019t tell anyone what he will do because he wants his plan to be quote, secret, then it turns out the secret is he has no plan,\u201d Clinton said to laughs. Biden, 73, has emerged as one of Clinton\u2019s most powerful surrogates. The former Delaware senator\u2019s ability to connect with middle- and working-class voters will be especially potent in battleground Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where economic frustrations are running high. Trump has made this region a focal point of his general election strategy and is banking on the populist economic message that helped propel him to the top during the primaries to win him independents and Reagan Democrats on Election Day. The event Monday was both a political rally and a homecoming for Biden and Clinton. Biden grew up in Scranton and spent summers in the town after moving to Delaware at age 10. Clinton, while growing up outside of Chicago, spent summers at Lake Winola outside of the Pennsylvania town. \u201cThe story of the Rodham\u2019s and the Biden\u2019s isn\u2019t unique. What is unique is the country where those stories were written,\u201d Clinton said Monday. \u201cNo matter what Donald Trump says, America is great. And the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise.\u201d Clinton said \u201cJoe grew up over on North Washington Avenue and no matter how far he travels, he never forgot where he is from,\u201d casting him as \u201ca fighter for everyone who needs a champion, for towns like Scranton and above all a fighter for families.\u201d Clinton also said that she would ask Biden to help her administration, should she be elected in November. Biden, after his son\u2019s death, launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative last year, aiming to double the research breakthroughs in curing cancer. \u201cHis wonderful son Beau, a great father, a great public servant, a great human being, passed away last year, so this is personal to Joe Biden,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat is why he is fighting so hard to made a difference. And If I am elected this fall, I am going to ask Joe to continue the important work he has begun.\u201d Monday\u2019s event was originally scheduled for last month, but was canceled in the aftermath of an ambush in Dallas that killed five police officers. Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons told CNN in a recent interview that there is no one better than Biden at connecting with voters who feel \u201cleft out and overlooked.\u201d \u201cIf I were campaigning in Pennsylvania for the United States Senate, there is no one I would want next to me more than Joe Biden,\u201d Coons said. \u201cNo one works a diner, no one works a volunteer fire hall, no one works a senior center better than Joe Biden.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden on the loss of his son Beau Famous for his gregarious personality and unfiltered style, Biden is the latest in a string of high-profile Democrats to hit the road for Clinton. Obama held his first joint event with his 2008 rival in North Carolina last month, and Clinton has also picked up endorsements from popular liberals like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and primary rival Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator. For many of Biden\u2019s fans and long-time allies, the vice president\u2019s appearance at the convention was bittersweet. Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2008, and last year, he contemplated launching a third White House bid. But the death of his son made it impossible for Biden to pursue that dream. With his wife, Jill, and Obama by his side, Biden announced at the White House Rose Garden in October that he had finally closed the door on this decades-old political aspiration. Can Donald Trump pick the lock of the Keystone state? \u201cWhile I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.\u201d Lisa Goodman, president of Equality Delaware, watched Biden speak inside the convention arena last month. She described the moment as an emotional one for the Delaware delegation, particularly as they listened to Biden speak about his son. \u201cIt was bittersweet for us as Delawareans \u2013 it might be the last time that we ever see him on a stage like this,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cI think that Joe is nothing if not heart. And his heart was broken. And as he says, he\u2019ll be stronger in the broken places but it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d Trump: If Clinton wins Pennsylvania, she cheated Steve Schale, a longtime Democratic strategist who was a part of the Draft Biden 2016 effort, said when he recently saw Biden, there was no question that the vice president was \u201cat complete peace with the decision he made in October\u201d \u2013 and now wholly dedicated to the mission of electing Clinton to the White House. Trump is going hard after Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral votes, campaigning last week in the western part of the state, hoping his anti-trade and anti-establishment message sells well with blue-collar workers in the Rust Belt. At the same time, Trump says the only way he can lose the state is if there is \u201ccheating.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch Pennsylvania,\u201d he said in Altoona on Friday. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we\u2019re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump says Republican leaders are \"very concerned\" about cheating Recent polls show Hillary Clinton with a 10-point lead in the state Donald Trump and his campaign are increasingly casting doubt on the legitimacy of the presidential election. The Republican nominee declared Friday there\u2019s only one way he could lose the state of Pennsylvania: if he\u2019s cheated out of it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch Pennsylvania.

The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d Then on Saturday morning a Trump spokeswoman detailed the campaign\u2019s concerns. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said the campaign was concerned with potential election fraud, particularly over electronic voting machines, which security researchers have warned are vulnerable to hacking. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claims that the elections would be \u201crigged\u201d against him, and asked about making an unjustified assertion, Pierson said it was a concern over a hypothetical scenario. \u201cThere is no evidence because the election hasn\u2019t occurred yet.\u201d Pierson said. \u201cThis is not far-fetched. Election fraud has been a concern for a very long time.\u201d The Trump campaign went still further, calling on its website for supporters to volunteer to be Trump election observers. \u201cHelp me stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election,\u201d the site reads. After signing up to become a \u201cTrump Election Observer,\u201d the user is redirected to a donation page. Although Trump\u2019s claims about electoral fraud may be unprecedented for a national politician in the modern era, the Republican Party has faced legal pushback in the past for its attempts to have poll watchers similar to what the Trump campaign is now requesting from its supporters. Trump on Friday said Republican leaders in Pennsylvania \u201care very concerned\u201d about the possibility of cheating \u2013 adding, \u201cWe have to call up law enforcement, and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the polls in Pennsylvania is solid \u2013 a Quinnipiac survey of likely voters released Tuesday found Clinton leading Trump 52% to 42%. But both candidates are devoting significant resources to the state, which has a base of working class voters that Trump\u2019s campaign hopes could work in his favor. RELATED: Clinton, Trump battle for Pennsylvania Trump, who campaigned earlier Friday in Erie, Pennsylvania, said he \u201cknows the state very well\u201d and knows Clinton \u201ccan\u2019t beat what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Unless there\u2019s cheating. \u201cThe only way they can beat it, in my opinion \u2013 and I mean this 100% \u2013 if in certain sections of the state, they cheat,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s latest moves echoed \u2013 but went even further than \u2013 his statements last week in Ohio that he\u2019s \u201cafraid the election is going to be rigged.\u201d RELATED: Trump: \u2018I\u2019m afraid the election\u2019s going to be rigged\u2019 Pennsylvania does not require voters in the state to show photo identification \u2013 which Trump said he finds \u201cshocking.\u201d Ben Carson, who supports Trump, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that the focus should be on how to make sure there is no voter fraud \u2013 which he noted would be good for both parties. He also acknowledged he might not have used the words as Trump, his former Republican primary rival. \u201cI would\u2019ve said it in a different way.

            "article_content": "Trump has never held elected office, a top government post or a high military rank Many historians see the surge of business candidates as a throwback If Donald Trump makes it from the corner office to the Oval Office, he will be pulling off an unprecedented feat: He will be the only head of the executive branch of government whose principal professional credential is having served as a chief executive officer. Plenty of presidential candidates have pointed to their business acumen in making a case for the White House, most recently Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. But Trump is a rarity for a major party nominee, since he\u2019s never held elected office, a top government post or a high military rank. RELATED: Can Clinton return secretary of state to presidential steppingstone? In recent election cycles, candidates from the private sector have surged, suggesting voters are more open to politicians with business resumes, though no others have made it as far as Trump. Many historians, however, see the feat as less a modern development than a throwback to the early days of the republic. \u201cThe idea of presidents as businessmen has a long history,\u201d Dan Mahaffee, director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency & Congress, told CNN. Mahaffee noted that many of the earliest Founding Fathers, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, had various business interests as plantation owners. Indeed, America\u2019s first president was quite the entrepreneur. In addition to running the large Mt. Vernon plantation in northern Virginia, Washington also served as head of the Potomac Company, which made canal infrastructure improvements along the Potomac River. And the whiskey distillery he operated on his property was the largest whiskey distillery in America at the time of his death in 1799, producing 11,000 gallons a year, according to the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington. However, Washington\u2019s business success was not without controversy. Like many plantations at the time \u2013 including other plantations owned by presidents \u2013 Mt. Vernon used slave labor. The slaves were only freed after the death of Martha Washington. But Mahaffee said that in subsequent years, \u201cstronger political institutions and a political class developed,\u201d leading to \u201ca shift towards lawyers, career politicians and candidates with military experience \u2013 usually a general who had distinguished himself in a recent war.\u201d The notion of a businessman-president enjoyed a bit of a resurgence during the so-called \u201cRoaring Twenties,\u201d a time of economic prosperity for the nation. Republican Calvin Coolidge, who was president from 1923-1929, famously said, \u201cThe chief business of the American people is business.\u201d Although Coolidge had been a career politician, he had also been the vice president of the Nonotuck Savings Bank in Northampton, Massachusetts. His administration was defined in part by its hands-off approach to the economy. His successor, Herbert Hoover, was perhaps the most prominent American businessman to rise to the presidency. His career as a mining engineer made him a multimillionaire, amassing a fortune that The Atlantic Magazine estimated at about $75 million in today\u2019s dollars. But the start of the Great Depression in 1929 marked a shift away from presidents with substantial business experience. The GOP\u2019s 1940 nominee, Wendell Willkie, was the last person before Trump to have never held government office prior to winning the nomination. He had been president of Commonwealth & Southern, a major electric utilities holding company based in New York. Willkie campaigned against Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal \u2013 he called it an \u201cattack on business\u201d upon accepting the nomination \u2013 but was easily defeated. But in the 1970s, presidents with entrepreneurial expertise once again emerged. Jimmy Carter had been a successful farmer prior to being elected, making him a bit of a return to the tradition of the Founders. And George H.W. and George W. Bush both worked in the Texas oil industry, with the elder Bush having founded his own company and the younger working for various oil firms. Bush also helped lead the purchase of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team, making a profit upon the team\u2019s sale in 1998. Independent candidate and billionaire Ross Perot mounted third-party bids in 1992 and 1996 largely on the strength of his business credentials, getting almost 20% of the vote in the first contest. And former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a successful founder of Bain Capital, a private equity firm, and former CEO of Bain and Company, a consulting company, won the Republican nomination in 2012 touting his record in business. It may be no surprise that Republicans have put forward more candidates with business backgrounds. An October Associated Press-GfK poll found that Republican voters preferred private sector leadership experience over experience holding elected office 76% to 22%. Only 33% of Democrats, meanwhile, saw private sector experience as more important. Republicans have argued that the qualities of businessmen make them especially fit to be good political leaders, emphasizing their ability to motivate and manage others and make prudent decisions with both short-term and long-term consequences in mind. Business experience can also provide candidates with a broader understanding of economic issues, which tend to be the top concern of modern voters. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up And the Republican Party itself has been increasingly identified with corporate America, advocating business-friendly policies like lower taxes and few regulations. The 2016 platform reads: \u201cRepublicans will pursue free market policies that are the surest way to boost employment and create job growth and economic prosperity for all.\u201d While running for president in 2012, Romney even pitched the idea that private sector experience should be a constitutional pre-requisite for the presidency. And while Romney lost the election to incumbent Barack Obama \u2013 whose background is in constitutional law \u2013 there are indications voters are more receptive to candidates from the private sector than in previous eras. Given all the news of American debt, said William Seale of the White House Historical Association, \u201cpeople think that a businessman could come in and fix the situation, manage the books.\u201d Yet Trump\u2019s business ties also pose a liability. His many international business holdings could create conflicts of interest for him if elected. In a recent CNN poll, 70% of voters said Trump should cut his business ties while running for president, demonstrating the sensitivity of the issue. And if the past is a guide, experience in business hasn\u2019t always led to celebrated White House success. Hoover was blamed for a lackluster response to the Great Depression, and he along with Carter and H.W. Bush were voted out of office after a single term. George W. Bush, the only president with an MBA, from Harvard Business School, left office as the 2008 recession was underway. The business record of candidates also hasn\u2019t always been a selling point. Amity Shlaes of the Coolidge Foundation noted that many, including President Harry Truman, a former owner of a haberdashery, were \u201chard-up financially.\u201d The experience, according to Shlaes, actually caused Truman to lose his faith in commerce, making him less inclined to support big business as president. \u201cIn fact,\u201d Seale of the White House Historical Association said, \u201can awful lot of them were bad businessmen.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton has strong advantage in Pennsylvania Trump allies say there's enthusiasm surrounding the GOP nominee On paper, Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes look like a slam-dunk for Hillary Clinton So why isn\u2019t anyone here acting like it? \u201cPredictions would be foolhardy\u201d says Terry Madonna, presidential historian and longtime Pennsylvania pollster at Franklin and Marshall College. \u201cYes, Secretary Clinton has a sizable lead now, but this year almost anything can happen.\u201d Poll: Tight Senate races for Rubio, Toomey as Trump drags ticket Clinton has several strengths here. Her statewide campaign operation is enormous and growing. The state has 800,000 more active Democratic voters than Republicans. She got a huge bounce from the Democratic convention held in Philadelphia. And the last time a Republican presidential candidate won Pennsylvania, Kokomo by the Beach Boys was topping the charts \u2013 that was in 1988 by the way. A Quinnipiac poll of likely voters released Tuesday found Clinton leading Trump 52% to 42% in Pennsylvania. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll also released Tuesday found Clinton leading Trump by 11 points. But David Urban, senior adviser to the Trump Campaign for Pennsylvania, says there is one thing Clinton doesn\u2019t have \u2013 enthusiasm. \u201cWhen Hillary is here she gets maybe 1,000 people at her rally\u201d says Urban. \u201cWhen Trump is here, we\u2019re talking 10,000.\u201d Trump looks to claw back Virginia, but Clinton confident Working in Trump\u2019s favor, Pennsylvania voters are traditionally working class and not particularly ideological. Barack Obama handily beat John McCain in 2008 but won by a much smaller margin against Mitt Romney in 2012. Republicans here also point out that the party performs quite well at the state level. After all, the GOP controls both houses of the state legislature and 13 of the state\u2019s 18 congressmen are Republicans. \u201cWe\u2019re part of the so-called Rust Belt theory,\u201d says Madonna. \u201cWin the white blue-collar workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin and you got an electoral college mix that could get Donald Trump to 270.\u201d Consequently, the Clinton campaign appears to be leaving little to chance. It views Pennsylvania as a firewall; stop Trump here and one forecloses a menu of options for him getting to 270. This week alone, the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party opened eight offices statewide. It\u2019s even going after conservative votes. Soon it will have offices in 12 conservative counties won by Romney in 2012. Clinton\u2019s Pennsylvania headquarters is a hive of activity, located high up in a gleaming Philadelphia office tower. To date, she has three dozen offices scattered across the state and soon will have four dozen. By contrast, the Trump campaign is only just this week opening its first three major Pennsylvania offices, in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and Philadelphia. \u201cI think the Clinton campaign is a little bloated,\u201d says Urban. \u201cWe don\u2019t need 500 people in Pennsylvania right now.  When needed, we\u2019ll be able to match them toe-to-toe.\u201d Florida: The swingiest swing state The Clinton campaign, as of the convention in late July, had 300 people on the ground in Pennsylvania staffing its offices across the state. In addition to Lebanon, Clinton has also opened an office in York, which is a Republican leaning county. The Trump campaign says it will have around a dozen staffers by the end of this week and the RNC says it has 80 staffers that will focus on the campaign. Urban says the RNC has sunk time and money into Pennsylvania and would be a much bigger part of the ground game no matter who the candidate turned out to be. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania woes also look bleak when it comes to political advertising. Since early June, the Clinton camp spent just over $4 million across the state on ads through this week, according to Kantar Media/CMAG that tracks such spending. In the same period the Trump campaign spent $0. Despite all of it, according to pollster Madonna, the key ingredient this election cycle is turnout. In Pennsylvania, that means performing well in the suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia, where about a third of all votes in the state exist. \u201cAs Willie Sutton used to say when he was asked why he used to rob banks, \u2018cause that\u2019s where the money is,\u2019\u201d says Madonna. \u201cWhere do you go in politics? Where the votes are.\u201d The Clinton campaign is targeting a traditional Democratic constituency: women, minorities, students and the elderly.  But it is also pushing into conservative territory looking for votes among college educated Republicans or swing voters turned off by Trump. Republicans say their best shot at winning Pennsylvania is finding voters upset with the establishment and the status quo and getting them to realize Trump represents change. \u201cNeither of the candidates are particularly well liked so it\u2019s going to come down to policy,\u201d says Andy Reilly, Delaware County GOP Chairman. \u201cWhen it comes down to policy and Trump\u2019s policy, he will win. He just has to show some discipline. It\u2019s not unexpected what he\u2019s done because he\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman who thinks common sense first. Hopefully he\u2019ll get his sea legs and bring the Republican Party together. We have the ground game to do it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Yon Pomrenze, Greg Wallace and Terence Burlij contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Midwest is emerging as the epicenter of the 2016 campaign Clinton repeatedly issued a sober warning about Trump On a Rust Belt bus tour spanning three days and more than 600 miles over the weekend, Hillary Clinton embarked on a daring strategy that could decide the 2016 election: stealing from Donald Trump\u2019s base of support. The day after accepting her party\u2019s nomination for president in Philadelphia, Clinton boarded a bus emblazoned with her campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together.\u201d Her motorcade headed west into the country\u2019s former industrial heartland, stopping in blue-collar cities like Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Ohio, with a message aimed at white working-class voters \u2013 the very foundation of Trump\u2019s support. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up On factory floors and in school gymnasiums, Clinton pitched her economic vision to union members, teachers and assembly line workers, most of whom described themselves as part of the lower and middle classes. She promised huge investments to revive manufacturing and higher wage jobs, and a country where \u201cpeople still make things.\u201d And she repeatedly issued a sober warning about Trump, calling him reckless, inexperienced and out to get the little guy. \u201cDonald Trump goes around with that hat on, Make America Great Again. Everything he make, he makes somewhere else besides America. The only thing he makes in America are bankruptcies,\u201d Clinton said at a K\u2019NEX factory in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, on Friday, surrounded by injection molding presses, surface grinders that flatten steel and other large machinery. \u201cWe don\u2019t resent success in America,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we do resent people who take advantage of others in order to line their own pockets on the way up.\u201d With Election Day less than 100 days away, the region spanning the country\u2019s Midwest and Northeast is emerging as the epicenter of the 2016 campaign, with Trump\u2019s populist message resonating powerfully with the working class here. Get ready: The election is 100 days away Clinton\u2019s support in national polls has come largely from non-white voters, women and people with college degrees, while Trump has depended on a strong following of lower-income whites. If Clinton can substantially undercut Trump\u2019s support with that group, and even win over a segment of moderate Republicans turned off by Trump, it could devastate the businessman\u2019s prospects. At campaign stops over the weekend, Democrats and independents described Clinton as steady and competent, with an optimistic vision for the country. They contrasted her message against what they described as Trump\u2019s darker and more cynical worldview, with some expressing dismay at his volatility and off-color remarks. Vickie Helman, a 56-year-old Democrat from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, waited three hours to get into an event with Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, at the Broadway Street Market in the state\u2019s capital. She said the city is still filled with rundown areas and it can be a struggle to find a steady job. Helman was recently laid off and went on unemployment for a year before she found her current job at a community college working in mail services. \u201cIf you hear what Trump says and then you hear what Hillary says, it\u2019s like night and day. I don\u2019t know how anybody could not see that,\u201d Helman said. A group of men she works with, Helman added, is struggling to make sense of the election: \u201cThey\u2019re Republican, and they say: \u2018We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 Trump, they say, is just ridiculous.\u201d Chris Wiseman, an administrator at a private school from Landsdale, Pennsylvania, is an independent who supported President Barack Obama in the past two elections. Attending a Clinton campaign event in nearby Hatfield, Wiseman said he believes there is ample opportunity for Clinton and Kaine to win over moderate Republicans in his own community. \u201cI have a lot of Republican friends and buddies who aren\u2019t going to vote Republican this year. They\u2019ll either not vote or they\u2019ll vote Hillary,\u201d said Wiseman, 43. \u201cIt\u2019s the same group that refused to vote for (John) McCain when (Sarah) Palin was on the ticket.\u201d A tale of two conventions Kaine helped Clinton make her pitch on the bus tour. The Virginia senator featured his humble roots in Kansas City, his ironworker father and Catholic upbringing in his introduction to this vital part of the country. \u201cThis is the part of the campaign I really like,\u201d Kaine said on the first day of the bus tour. \u201cI mean, the big events are fun, but I don\u2019t like wearing a tie that much.\u201d Clinton, too, reminded voters of her personal connection to the region. Her grandfather immigrated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, from England and worked in a factory his whole life, she said. Her father was born in Scranton, and she and her brothers spent many childhood summers and Christmases there. She described the American values instilled in the workers she was meeting on her bus tour. \u201cWe have the most productive, competitive workers in the world \u2013 we just need to give our people the chance to succeed,\u201d she said during a visit to Johnstown Wire Technologies, where every surface inside the production floor appeared to be covered with a thin film of white-gray powder. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to people, meeting people who have each other\u2019s backs. And you truly are the reason why I have so much confidence that America\u2019s best days are still ahead of us.\u201d While his Democratic opponents were driving through the Rust Belt to sell their economic message this weekend, Trump had become embroiled in yet another controversy. He went after Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier who died in Iraq, and suggested that Khan\u2019s wife had not spoken at the Democratic convention because \u201cmaybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.\u201d Khizr Khan: Trump has a \u2018black soul\u2019 \u201cIf you cannot show empathy for a Gold Star mom and dad, there is something fundamentally missing in your personality,\u201d Kaine told reporters Sunday morning en route to Columbus, Ohio. Highlighting Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and demagogic rhetoric could pay off for Clinton and Kaine. When they arrived at East High School in Youngstown on Saturday night, more than two hours behind schedule for their for their last stop of the day, one man stood on the risers behind the stage holding up a red sign that read: \u201cRepublican for Hillary.\u201d Did Trump go too far? Sean Cornelius, a 32-year-old worker at an automotive assembly, told CNN after the event that he voted for Trump during the primary. \u201cThere are some things I disagreed on, but he seemed like he was the man,\u201d Cornelius said. But Cornelius, who said he makes a decent living for the area, has been particularly impressed by Clinton\u2019s promise to invest billions into manufacturing. And it became impossible for him to continue supporting Trump recently, he said, when the New York real estate mogul appeared to encourage Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails. Trump later said he was being sarcastic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he was being sarcastic or not, you just don\u2019t make those type of comments when you\u2019re running for public office. And that\u2019s what made me decide to go for Hillary,\u201d Cornelius said. \u201cLately, anything just sets him off pretty quick. \u2026I just don\u2019t trust him with the presidency anymore.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works at the institute. John Dickerson spends a lot time thinking about politicians \u2013 as host of CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and now as the author of the new book \u201cWhistlestop: My Favorite Stories from Presidential Campaign History,\u201d a collection of presidential campaign lore. So when asked to size up Democratic and Republican candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as they move into the general election, Dickerson considered the way both candidates perform under the grueling demands of a national campaign. Clinton\u2019s challenge, Dickerson suggested, is that her skills and persona may lend themselves more to governance than campaigning. \u201cCampaigns maybe encourage us to pay attention to attributes that maybe aren\u2019t that important in the presidency,\u201d Dickerson said in a conversation with David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \u201cThere are some [attributes] that are, of course, crucial. I think she\u2019s just not a very good campaigner.\u201d \u201cOnce I asked her to give us three words that give us a sense of who you really are,\u201d Dickerson recalled. \u201cShe kind of threw up her arms and said, \u2018I am a real person!\u2019 I think that was a genuine expression of frustration with the process. It was a genuine response.\u201d Trump, on the other hand, is much more open and accessible but often unwilling to acknowledge his own statements or back up his claims. \u201cThe challenge with Donald Trump is that he\u2019ll deny things he said the day before or even in the same interview,\u201d Dickerson noted. \u201cAnd then sometimes when you try and talk about a fact that he misstated or something that he said out loud that he now disagrees with himself on, it\u2019s very frustrating. On the other hand \u2026 he\u2019s quite candid on some things in a way that I can\u2019t imagine any other politician being.\u201d Dickerson also points out that Trump\u2019s unconventional, carnival style may seem entirely new, but has roots in the American political history he charts in \u201cWhistlestop,\u201d which will be released Tuesday. It is based on Dickerson\u2019s podcast of the same name. \u201cIn 1840, William Henry Harrison is the first one to really campaign as a candidate and the campaigns were totally frivolous, I mean, people were drinking hard cider all day. They were big parades, no one was debating the issues,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cSo when you see Trump flying his plane over the stadium where he\u2019s going to give a rousing speech, it feels very much in touch with that.\u201d During the hour-long conversation with Axelrod, Dickerson also likened Trump\u2019s run to former (and future) Alabama Gov. George Wallace\u2019s third-party effort in 1968. \u201cPeople thought \u2018[Wallace] is not going to get on the ballot\u2019 and he got on the ballot in all 50 states. People thought \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s just a regional thing,\u2019 but he started to do so well in the North that both Humphrey and Nixon were worried about Wallace because there were a lot of working class whites who resented the riots, peace marches, as well as the African-American rising labor costs.\u201d The difference, Dickerson says, is that Republicans today are \u201cspeaking out against Trump in way no one spoke out about Wallace.\u201d To hear the whole conversation with Dickerson, which also touched on his views on his career in journalism, the changing news media landscape, and much more, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine are kicking off a tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania The campaign events come the week Clinton was formally nominated to be her party's presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine hit the road Friday as the Democratic Party\u2019s official White House ticket, launching a three-day bus tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio to highlight their economic vision. Their target audience: white working-class voters who make up the core of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s base. The first day began in Philadelphia, where Democrats wrapped up their national convention Thursday, and ended in the state\u2019s capitol, Harrisburg. Here, Clinton and Kaine spoke to supporters under the lit-up sign of the Broad Street Harrisburg Market and in front of a bus emblazoned with their slogan, \u201cStronger Together,\u201d and likened their campaign events to \u201cour big job interview.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re on firm ground,\u201d Clinton said about the progress the economy has made since the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to figure out: What do we do next? This election will be in large measure about what each of us says we can do to try to get the economy moving.\u201d Clinton and Kaine were joined by their spouses, Bill Clinton and Anne Holton, on Friday, which started with a mid-day rally in Philadelphia. The duo vowed that their policies would would create jobs and raise wages as they cast Trump as a \u201cYou\u2019re Fired\u201d president. Making a direct pitch to lower-income and middle-class Americans, Clinton pledged to focus on areas of the country \u201cleft out and left behind,\u201d and \u201cplaces hollowed out by plant closures.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do. I\u2019m not satisfied with the status quo. I\u2019m not telling you everything is peachy keen. I\u2019m telling you we\u2019ve made progress but we have work to do,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make this economy work for everyone \u2013 not just those at the top.\u201d Hillary Clinton, Tim Kaine launch bus tour Kaine, who introduced Clinton in Philadelphia, described the former secretary of state as someone who \u201cknows how to battle and get things done for regular people.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you want a president who knows how to battle and get things done for regular people?\u201d Kaine said as he introduced Clinton. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do over the next couple of days: We\u2019ll talk about creating jobs, we\u2019ll talk about raising wages, we\u2019ll talk about the leadership that America needs to play in the world.\u201d Over the nest 48 hours, Clinton and Kaine will continue on to cities like Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Ohio, cramming in multiple rallies and retail stops each day. Their first stop on Friday after Philadelphia was a K\u2019NEX toy manufacturing company in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. After touring the company, Clinton and Kaine spoke to voters on the factory floor surrounded by large machinery and injection molding presses. They pointed to K\u2019NEX as a model company that honors the \u201cMade in America\u201d motto. \u201cWe know that if we\u2019re smart about it, we can bring jobs back from China and other places if we make up our minds to do that, just like that\u2019s happened here,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton and Kaine both hit Trump\u2019s business record, saying the New York billionaire has profited personally by sending jobs overseas and stiffing his employees. \u201cWhen someone runs for president and says their primary qualification for being president is because they claim to be a successful businessman, then it\u2019s only fair to ask how did you become successful?\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t resent success in America but we do resent people who take advantage of others.\u201d The primary focus of the bus tour is jobs and the economy, including a plan for the first 100 days of a Clinton-Kaine administration. The decision to campaign through this region right out of the Democratic convention sets up the Rust Belt to be one of the epicenters of the general election. RELATED: 10 takeaways from the Democratic convention The three-day trip will highlight the campaign\u2019s strategy of reaching out to Republican voters and targeting GOP-leaning areas as it looks to woo rural working-class white voters central to Trump\u2019s base. The bus tour will also serve as an important opportunity for Kaine to introduce himself to the country, particularly to voters who know little about the former Virginia governor. Elaine Gelb, a real estate manager from Philadelphia, said although she didn\u2019t view Kaine as an \u201cexciting\u201d pick, the senator appeared to be a good match and political partner for Clinton. \u201cI think she picked somebody who\u2019s a lot like Joe Biden, who\u2019s a nice complement, sort of a soft, easy-going kind of guy,\u201d Gelb, 60, said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s exciting and I don\u2019t think too many people have heard of him, so we have to learn who he is.\u201d Tom Goodwin of Titusville, Florida, said he sees 2016 as the most important election for the Democratic Party as it confronts a \u201cdangerous\u201d GOP nominee. In Philadelphia for the summer to help take care of his grandchild, Goodwin said he hopes to see Clinton and Kaine continue to draw out the contrasting visions of the two parties as they hit the road this weekend. \u201cWhat I heard last night and over the last couple of days at the Democratic convention was exactly the right note. It was such a contrast to the Republican message. It was so much more uplifting,\u201d Goodwin said. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: First in an occasional series from CNN Politics and CNN Money examining the political anthropology of the United States and how demographic and social shifts are changing the political landscape If Donald Trump is to win Ohio, it'll be because of places like Mahoning County in Ohio, where thousands of Democrats joined the GOP The county has long been reliably blue Dozens of lifelong Democrats were calling and Mark Monroe knew something was going on. They were calling the local Republican Party chairman because they wanted to join his party. They wanted to join Donald Trump\u2019s party. It turns out that registering is as easy as asking for a ballot on Ohio\u2019s primary day. So, he told them, just show up on March 15, and request a Republican ballot. So they did. Trump\u2019s convention choice: Bring the party together or blow it apart In Mahoning County, home to Youngstown, one of the great steel cities of the early 20th century, 6,171 Democrats did this. Fewer than 200 Republicans wanted to become Democrats. \u201cI looked at Republican turnout on election night and I saw 34,000 Republicans had voted,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cI nearly fell off my chair because there were only 14- or 15,000 Republicans in Mahoning County.\u201d Most shocking of all, is that 18 Democratic precinct captains \u2013 local party officials in the county \u2013 were among the switchers. Dave Betras, the county Democratic chair, summarily fired them. \u201cI just simply with the stroke of a pen removed them and filled their positions with other loyal Democrats,\u201d he said. If Donald Trump can win Ohio in November, it\u2019ll be because of places like Mahoning County. He badly lost the Ohio primary to Gov. John Kasich, but he won in Mahoning County. It should also be noted, however, that Hillary Clinton won big here, too. She got 21,000 primary votes, nearly 60% of county\u2019s Democratic primary votes. Trump got 17,139 primary votes, 50% in the Republican primary. 2016 RNC viewers\u2019 guide Democrats of Mahoning County, until this year at least, have been loyal. President Obama beat Mitt Romney here by 28 percentage points four years ago. He topped Arizona Sen. John McCain by 26 percentage points in 2008. The county hasn\u2019t voted for a Republican in a general election since Richard Nixon in 1972. Even then, the area\u2019s heyday had long since passed. A Depression-era magazine advertisement billed Youngstown as the \u201ccity of homes.\u201d As the steel mills cranked out necessities for both life and war, Mahoning County prospered, as did its ballooning middle class. But that all changed on Black Monday, September 19, 1977, a date forever etched in the minds of Youngstonians. That was the day the first mill, Campbell Works Mill, closed its doors. Soon others followed. \u201cOver that period of time unemployment continued to rise to the point in late 1982 there were something like 25 percent unemployment in this metropolitan area,\u201d said John Russo, a local historian and professor at Youngstown State University. \u201cThe unemployment rate dropped very quickly, but it was because people were leaving. They were no longer counted.\u201d Today, Youngstown\u2019s population stands at 67,000. Less than a third of what it once was. Unemployment is marginally higher than the national average, but that could simply reflect a workforce that has given up. \u201cMahoning County is a shell of its former self,\u201d said Debbie Taylor, 62, who was born in Youngstown. Taylor ran for county commissioner in 2000 as a Democrat. Four election cycles later, she\u2019s one of the switchers: No longer a Democrat, she\u2019s voting for Donald Trump. RNC, Donald Trump prepare for rebellion\u2019s last chance \u201cI was one of the people that never, never thought he would have the temperament or the ability,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe more he talked and the more everybody said, \u2018He\u2019s not a Republican, he\u2019s not a Republican,\u2019 it started to hit me. He\u2019s an American \u2026 and when I believed that he had the ability to pull it off, I was 100 percent behind him because I believe in his message and I believe in what he stands for.\u201d It\u2019s a common refrain heard from Trump loyalists across the county \u2013 we need to bring back trade skills. But few places would such a policy have such a profound impact as the rust belt and counties like Mahoning. Denise Cooper and Denny Zimmit both had family members lose their jobs at the steel mills. Zimmit remembers when his grandfather\u2019s employer walked away from his pension. \u201cI can\u2019t say it actually killed him but when you just lose everything you have, and you\u2019re 70-some years old, what are you going to do?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 70, after working in the mills all those years, you\u2019re pretty beat up.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump said he wants to bring things back. He\u2019s going to bring things back and I believe that we all have to take a little bit of concessions somewhere along the line to bring back our steel, to bring back our trades.\u201d Some 6,000 party switchers may qualify as a phenomenon, but Chad Jones, who is retired from the Air Force and now a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, was surprised for another reason. \u201cIt\u2019s only 6,000? Wait until the general election. You just wait,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they go to general, there\u2019ll be probably double, maybe triple that amount are going to switch.\u201d Monroe, the Republican chairman, is optimistic. Clinton, Democrats try not to get drowned out during GOP convention \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that Donald Trump can actually carry Mahoning County,\u201d he said. \u201cIf [he\u2019s] able to carry Mahoning County, I think he wins the White House.\u201d That\u2019s a pipe dream, says Betras, the local Democratic chairman. \u201cThe people here are just not going to buy [Trump\u2019s] bullsh\u2013t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re more sophisticated than that.\u201d \u201cI know these people will come back.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton wants to take advantage of a a yawning divide between Donald Trump and the business community Business advocates used a speech last week to send a message: That Trump's policies would spell economic disaster Hillary Clinton has an opportunity that has eluded Democratic presidential nominees for decades: Being the candidate of big business. In an election already rocked by bizarre twists and turns, Donald Trump\u2019s speech meant to galvanize working-class voters in the Rust Belt last week exposed a yawning divide between the billionaire and the business community \u2013 a powerful force in U.S. presidential elections that has historically aligned itself with the Republican Party. As Trump railed against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and threatened to withdraw the U.S. from the North American Free Trade Agreement at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other leading business lobbies publicly condemned the GOP presumptive nominee. Their warning: Trump\u2019s policies would spell economic disaster. Trump VP search enters home stretch The extraordinary rebuke from the business community was a reminder of just how upside down politics are this year. It comes as Trump is looking to garner support from the GOP establishment just weeks out from his party\u2019s convention in Cleveland this month. It also opened the door for Clinton to court corporate leaders and donors who, in a typical election year, may have been inclined to back the GOP nominee. Even before Trump\u2019s speech in Pennsylvania last week, the Clinton campaign was actively reaching out to industry leaders across the political spectrum. Former Walmart executive Leslie Dach has been involved in outreach efforts to business leaders on the campaign\u2019s behalf, according to a source familiar with Dach\u2019s role. Clinton aides acknowledge the split between Trump and the business community presents an opportunity to gain allies, winning over Republican-leaning interests or at least persuading them to stay neutral. Clinton, who campaigns Tuesday for the first time with President Barack Obama, used Trump\u2019s response to the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote last month \u2013 he cheered Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, which sent markets into turmoil \u2013 to argue that Trump is too volatile to play a leading role in the global economy. Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who until last year was head of the American Bankers Association, said the Chamber\u2019s public scorn at Trump\u2019s economic vision marked a \u201cvery significant\u201d break in the alliance between big business and the GOP. With Clinton, Obama to campaign for his own legacy \u201cIt\u2019s certainly counter cultural,\u201d said Keating, a Republican who has not endorsed Trump. The Trump campaign should be particularly wary, Keating added, of the national Chamber\u2019s scorn trickling down to local business groups and leaders. \u201cThe Oklahoma City chamber or the Natchez, Mississippi, or the Albany, New York, chamber, a chamber of commerce in a small town California: If they think what the Republican presidential candidate makes no sense for small business development, I would be very concerned,\u201d Keating said. Late last month, the Clinton campaign rolled out endorsements from a bipartisan group of business executives. Several of them made this striking admission: they have never before supported a Democrat for president. \u201cSince my time at the Naval Academy and service in the Navy, I have consistently voted for Republicans for president,\u201d Dan Akerson, former chairman of General Motors, said in a statement shared by the campaign. \u201cServing as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics.\u201d Clinton to ride Air Force One; Trump asks who pays Jim Doyle, founder of the trade group Business Forward, described the depth of public support Clinton is receiving from the business leaders this election as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d \u201cCEOs of major corporations are growing less likely to endorse at all,\u201d said Doyle, a former official in the Bill Clinton administration who is married to Patti Solis Doyle, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager and a CNN contributor. \u201cSo the fact that you\u2019ve got Republican CEOs endorsing Hillary is remarkable.\u201d But for Clinton, courting big business is also a political risk. Clinton only recently wrapped up a contentious Democratic primary race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a populist liberal who accused her of being too close to big business. During the primary, Clinton ran to the left on a number of policy areas, including TPP. A deal that she had once hailed as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade agreements, Clinton declared last year that she could not support it in its current form. Trump campaign defends tweet as a \u2018basic star\u2019 in wake of criticism Some in the party have urged Clinton to pick a staunchly liberal running mate, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, to please the Democratic base \u2013 a move that could alienate the very business leaders who are already rejecting Trump. Any perception that she is pivoting away from the progressive positions she staked out during the primary season could agitate liberal voters, including former Sanders supporters. Former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said he was disappointed when Clinton came out against TPP. He chucked: \u201cBut I understand the dynamics of a Democratic primary.\u201d Kirk, who is now co-chair of the international trade practice at the law firm Gibson Dunn, described Trump\u2019s economic vision as \u201cdiplomatic and economic disengagement with the rest of the world.\u201d Even after a primary race that pushed her to the left, Kirk said, Clinton is much better positioned than Trump to appeal to centrist business leader in the general election. Republican business leaders \u201cfor a while comforted themselves with the belief that \u2014 \u2018Oh, Trump is just saying this stuff to get the nomination. He doesn\u2019t mean it,\u2019\u201d Kirk said. \u201cThey are horrified at the damage that he is already doing and the amount of time they\u2019re already having to spend to comfort  allies and customers and partners around the world.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance Obama defends trade policies during meetings in Canada President Barack Obama laid into Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist trade stance Wednesday, blasting the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s call for a withdrawal from trade deals as the \u201cwrong medicine.\u201d Obama\u2019s comments, which came during a trip to Canada to meet with his fellow North American heads of state, came as Trump fights a public war with the business lobby over the issue. \u201cOrdinary people who have concerns about trade have a legitimate gripe about globalization,\u201d Obama continued, pointing to \u201cgrowing inequality and stagnant wages.\u201d \u201cThe question is, what do you do about it. And the prescription of withdrawing from trade deals and focusing solely on your local market \u2013 that\u2019s the wrong medicine,\u201d he said. Road to 270: The 2016 Electoral Map Obama called the idea \u201cnot feasible\u201d because local businesses would suffer and lose jobs if they didn\u2019t have access to international markets and because the costs of local goods would rise. Trump, speaking at a rally in Bangor, Maine, focused his fire on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, saying they are \u201ctotally controlled by the special interest groups \u2026 they want to have the deals they want to have.\u201d Trump also took on the Chamber earlier in the day, tweeting, \u201cThe @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts.\u201d Trump plans to press ahead with his anti-free trade message in a speech in New Hampshire set for Thursday afternoon. Powerful business lobbies \u2013 both traditionally supportive of Republican candidates \u2013 took the highly unusual step of lashing out at Trump during a speech he gave Tuesday that hammered U.S. free-trade deals. \u201cUnder Trump\u2019s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,\u201d the Chamber tweeted during Tuesday\u2019s speech in Monessen, Pennsylvania, linking to an analysis that argues Trump\u2019s trade positions would throw the United States into an economic recession. Under Trump's trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy https://t.co/3xcCNgiS2k pic.twitter.com/9jPtGXAOlQ And the Chamber kept up its attacks on Trump Wednesday. \u201cThe U.S. Chamber represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country, who recognize that free trade agreements, like the (Trans-Pacific Partnership), are an important way to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation in the U.S.,\u201d Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokesman for the Chamber, said in a statement. \u201cThis is not personal. It\u2019s not election politics. It\u2019s smart policy.\u201d The onslaught reflected a major break between right-leaning business interests and the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee and demonstrate the possible downside to Trump of running as a protectionist Republican. It also comes as Trump attempts to ramp up fundraising \u2013 a challenge that could prove more difficult if the party\u2019s business backers decide to back Hillary Clinton or focus their money on assisting down-ballot Republicans. The truth about trade, American jobs and Donald Trump Clinton\u2019s campaign released a statement as well, saying Trump\u2019s speech rejected \u201cthe idea that Americans can compete and win in the global economy,\u201d and went point-by-point disputing Trump\u2019s arguments or made the case with past Clinton statements that she had better ideas. \u201cThroughout this campaign, Trump\u2019s statements on trade, like everything else he says, have been erratic and irresponsible, full of bluster and the promise of a reckless trade strategy that would put American jobs at risk,\u201d Clinton\u2019s statement said. Trump has broken from Republican orthodoxy and embraced a protectionist trade stance that more closely mirrors liberals such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The real estate mogul has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and on Tuesday said he\u2019d seek to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 a move that would result in the upheaval of economies across the continent. Trump argued that by doing so, he\u2019d create more manufacturing jobs in the United States \u2013 a key element of his appeal to white, working-class communities in swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. \u201cWhy would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?\u201d Trump also tweeted Wednesday. Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters? The Chamber rebutted Trump point-by-point, arguing that NAFTA has created 5 million jobs, that the United States is selling more to South Korea since signing a trade deal and that the Trans-Pacific Partnership would add $77 billion to the U.S. economy by 2025. \u201cEven under best case scenario, Trump\u2019s tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,\u201d the Chamber tweeted. Even under best case scenario, Trump's tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs https://t.co/3xcCNgiS2k pic.twitter.com/3SSHHqotNv Jay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, also took aim at Trump in a series of critical tweets. Directing his comments at Trump, he said that \u201cyou have it backward\u201d and that \u201cto win, WE need to write rules on trade \u2013 not China.\u201d He also tweeted: \u201c.@realDonaldTrump should understand 40% of manufacturing jobs are related to exports. We need more exports\u2013 not less.\u201d .@realDonaldTrump you have it backward. Trade is GOOD for #mfg workers & #jobs. Let\u2019s #MakeAmericaTradeAgain. https://t.co/XylgW023aX .@realDonaldTrump should understand 40% of manufacturing jobs are related to exports. We need more exports\u2013 not less pic.twitter.com/Hp60LeXGMo The Business Roundtable, another leading U.S. business organization representing the CEOs of major companies, also weighed in with a Medium post on what candidates are getting wrong on trade \u2013 though it\u2019s much less direct than the Chamber and National Association of Manufacturers attacks. Asked if the criticism of Trump is an unprecedented step into a presidential race by the traditionally Republican-leaning Chamber, Holmes said in an email Tuesday that \u201cthis is about policy, not politics.\u201d \u201cThe Chamber has long supported advancing and expanding trade, including TPP,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDespite much of the rhetoric we have heard out on the campaign trail, the next president should understand that selling more American-made goods and services around the world is one of the best ways to spur economic growth, support small businesses, create good-paying American jobs, and keep the United States one step ahead of its international competitors. \u201cAfter all, 95% of the world\u2019s consumers now live outside America\u2019s borders, representing nearly limitless expansion opportunities for U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs.\u201d Holmes did pour cold water on the possibility that the Chamber could endorse Clinton in the presidential race despite its opposition to Trump\u2019s trade positions. The Chamber has in the past hit Clinton and Sanders for failing to offer broad enough support for free trade. Clinton has said she, too, opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 a deal negotiated under President Barack Obama, and which Clinton had once called the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade pacts during her tenure as secretary of state. But free trade critics point out her husband, Bill Clinton, was responsible for implementing NAFTA \u2013 the first mega-regional trade deal. \u201cFor 104 years, the US Chamber has never gotten involved in a presidential race, and we do not plan to,\u201d Holmes said. Holmes quickly followed up to signal that the Chamber\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s trade positions won\u2019t soon be ending. \u201cI want to add that while we don\u2019t engage in presidential politics, we\u2019ve also never hesitated to engage in a policy discussion,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Every step of Clinton's campaign seems to be an acknowledgment that she's learned lessons from 2008 National polls released over the weekend show Clinton leading Trump Hillary Clinton has one big advantage over Donald Trump heading into November: hindsight. Every step of her 2016 campaign \u2013 from her embrace of the historic nature of her candidacy to her more personal connections with voters \u2013 seems to be an acknowledgment that she\u2019s learned the lessons of her failed campaign eight years earlier. The efforts may be working. A national Washington Post/ABC News poll released Sunday found her leading Trump 51%-39% while a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found her five points ahead. Clinton leads Trump, pair of polls show Clinton still faces huge challenges. She is dogged by the controversy surrounding her use of a personal email server as secretary of state and has struggled with the perception that she\u2019s dishonest. Perhaps most notably, she has to figure out how to prevail in a year when major blocs of both parties are attracted to outsider candidates like Trump \u2013and are weary of political dynasties. As her general election campaign kicks into full gear, here\u2019s a look at the lessons Clinton has learned from 2008. Clinton has held many political titles in her long career. But for the 68-year-old candidate, her recently claimed title of grandmother appears to bring her more pride than any other achievement. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight \u201cI\u2019ve talked so much about being a grandmother. Now I\u2019m going to be talking doubly about being a grandmother,\u201d Clinton crooned at a campaign rally in Columbus, Ohio, last week, as she boasted about the birth of her second grandchild. The constant reminder to voters that she is a woman is a notable contrast from the way Clinton approached the issue eight years ago. Back then, the second-term senator and her team viewed her gender as a potential liability that could undercut her efforts to exude strength and experience in a field crowded with men. But this time, Clinton is enthusiastically embracing her gender. In her campaign launch speech in New York City last summer, Clinton said she hoped to make history by becoming the country\u2019s first female president and spoke about her late mother\u2019s struggles and triumphs. The strategy could be potent against Trump, who is struggling with female voters. It\u2019s a message that\u2019s resonating among Clinton\u2019s supporters \u2014 and not just women. John Bartholow, a 39-year-old student working in retail, attended a Clinton event Raleigh, North Carolina, last week with his 4-year-old daugher in tow. Bartholow had supported Bernie Sanders during the primary, and eight years ago, voted for President Obama. But now, he\u2019s more than happy to call himself a Clinton supporter. Kaine confesses \u2018I am boring\u2019 in response to VP talk Looking at his daughter in his arms, Bartholow choked up as he explained why he was there: \u201cI\u2019m here so Ella can see the first female president.\u201d Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign was rocked with drama that made the campaign look inept and disorganized. So far this cycle, no such stories have dragged her down. And to the contrary, Clinton is now competing against an opponent who has confronted several rounds of embarrassing staff turmoil. Road to 270: The 2016 electoral map Eight years ago, the Clinton operation was rife with clashes between top aides, staff shake-ups and a series of embarrassing leaks, with much of the dysfunction playing out in public. This time, the campaign has largely avoided such unflattering headlines. After suffering a crushing double-digit loss to Sanders in New Hampshire, there were rumors of a possible staff shake-up, but it never came to fruition. Meanwhile, Clinton has watched Trump slog through wave after wave of personnel drama, culminating in the dramatic dismissal of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski last week. Veteran Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said Clinton appears determined to minimize the kind of dysfunction that was a harmful distraction last time. \u201cIt seems to me that the Clinton campaign this go-around has taken that to heart,\u201d Elmendorf said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all easier when you\u2019re wining \u2013 but obviously it\u2019s been harder than they thought at the beginning and they\u2019ve stayed on message and on target.\u201d Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up In 2008, Clinton was haunted by her vote to invade Iraq, as her 2002 decision emerged as one of the single biggest dividing lines between Clinton and Obama. But if being perceived as a hawk and an interventionist was a significant liability for Clinton in 2008, she confronts a different political landscape eight years later. Clinton ad knocks Trump over Brexit response Now, the 2002 Iraq War resolution is a more distant memory \u2013 Sanders repeatedly tried to use Clinton\u2019s Senate vote against her in the primary, but to no particular effect. As she heads into the general election season that\u2019s dominated by concerns about terrorism, Clinton finds herself facing an opponent without much of a national security background and who is under fire from his own party for his isolationist-leaning foreign policy. Clinton is unapologetic in expressing her hawkish views this cycle. She\u2019s even staked out a different policy stance from Obama on Syria, calling for a no-fly zone over the country and suggesting that the United States be more deeply involved in foreign conflicts. Clinton is garnering support even from national security leaders across the aisle. This month, she won the endorsement of Brent Scowcroft, who served as national security adviser to Presidents George H.W Bush and Gerald Ford, along with Richard Armitage, George W. Bush\u2019s deputy secretary of state. Prominent neoconservative scholar Robert Kagan is helping Clinton raise money. In her first White House campaign, Clinton suffered from accusations of being remote and overly programmed as she ran against an opponent who was the epitome of cool. This time, the former secretary of state is working to shed the image of being a stiff and inaccessible candidate. Aides say the effort includes shifting emphasis from large rallies to smaller events to allow Clinton to speak directly with voters, and sharing more personal stories about the candidate through social media. Hillary Clinton\u2019s views on Israel win out in DNC platform, for now Her Facebook page, for example, is filled with photos and videos that tell not only the narrative of a first-lady-turned-senator-turned-secretary-of-state, but also the story of a daughter, a mother and a grandmother. And days after clinching her party\u2019s nomination earlier this month, the campaign began to air a series of television ads highlighting her pre-2008 biography, particularly shining a light on the work Clinton did on be half of children. Tara Minter, 44-year-old African-American woman from Raleigh, voted for Obama in 2008 and is now supporting Clinton. Attending a Clinton rally last week, Minter said she has enjoyed learning about a side of Clinton that she knew little about eight years ago. \u201cShe\u2019s not taking anything for granted this time around,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing I like is she started going on the road months before people were thinking about (the campaign), to earn people\u2019s votes.\u201d Another shift: Clinton openly acknowledges that she is not entirely comfortable on the stump. \u201cShe\u2019s not as skilled at campaigning as her husband or Barack Obama but she has learned to embrace that,\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager and CNN commentator. \u201d I think that\u2019s the biggest change \u2014 that she\u2019s just much more comfortable in her skin this time around.\u201d Clinton has made the support from minority voters a bedrock of her 2016 campaign. By the end of the 2008 primaries, Clinton was largely winning working-class whites, while Obama was outperforming her in states that represented the diversity of the Democratic Party\u2019s base. Her comments that \u201cSenator Obama\u2019s support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again\u201d were panned and perceived as divisive. This year, the Clinton campaign used its hard-fought battle against Sanders to prioritize grassroots outreach across the country in areas with large Hispanic and African-American populations. She is now poised to carry that base into a November battle against Trump, who has offended various minority groups with inflammatory and anti-immigrants remarks. Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and former Democratic South Carolina House representative, said Clinton\u2019s strength with African-Americans this time has largely to do with an obvious variable: the absence of Obama. But, Sellers also stressed that it is difficult to overstate how seriously the campaign prioritized courting that community. \u201cThere is no Barack Obama in the race so that makes it a lot easier for Hillary Clinton. But Hillary Clinton has some very, very, very deep and long relationships with African-Americans,\u201d said Sellers, a Clinton supporter. During this campaign, he added, the Clintons \u201creally, really, really took the African-American vote seriously.\u201d",

A new Ohio name being floated as a possible Clinton VP pick Rubio to the rescue, Trump\u2019s UK trip, Clinton\u2019s next \u201cDefine Donald\u201d speech and a new Ohio name on the veepstakes list are just some of the future headlines in this week\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast. The official line is that Marco Rubio is talking things over with his family this weekend, with a final decision due soon. Rubio to the rescue? But CNN\u2019s Chief National Correspondent John King is reporting that barring some unexpected last-minute glitch, Rubio is set to jump back into the Senate race in the week ahead, according to several Republicans involved in the deliberations. \u201cThe Florida senator is telling top supporters he has changed his mind \u2013 and will run for re-election to the Senate,\u201d said King. \u201cThis change of heart will be a boost to Republican hopes of holding their Senate majority after a tough couple of weeks.\u201d Strategists working key Senate races in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire report a drop in Donald Trump\u2019s numbers in those states, and there are growing worries he could drag some Senate incumbents down with him if he is unable to reverse his fortunes. Florida was another big worry \u2013 because Rubio was adamant after his presidential campaign fizzled that he was leaving Washington. Now, with Rubio reversing course, Republicans are a lot more optimistic about the Sunshine State. Donald Trump is heading to Scotland next week \u2013 right after the UK votes on whether or not it should stay in the European Union. Trump's trip to Scotland--helpful or harmful? And The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reveals it\u2019s a trip that some of his advisers are hoping he will cancel. \u201cIt\u2019s coming right after the Brexit vote \u2013 it\u2019s a very tumultuous time across the pond \u2013 there was just a slain politician,\u201d said Haberman. \u201cHe\u2019s also not planning on making any kind of high-level meetings there. He\u2019s going to literally go from one golf property to another.\u201d \u201cSo there are some people who, while that might help him reset and be in a comfort area, are hopeful that he will ultimately decide this is not where he should be.\u201d Trump has been generating a lot of headlines this weekend by saying he didn\u2019t need the GOP to help him fund his campaign \u2013 but if they didn\u2019t help him, he wouldn\u2019t help them. \u201cLife is like a two-way street,\u201d said Trump in Las Vegas Saturday. \u201cThey have to [help], otherwise I\u2019ll keep doing what I am doing. I\u2019ll just keep funding my own campaign. I\u2019m ok with that. That\u2019s the easy way.\u201d How much money is he actually contributing to his own campaign? CNN\u2019s MJ Lee points out that Monday is the FEC filing deadline for May and those numbers will reveal where the billionaire\u2019s backers are coming from and how his general election fund-raising figures stack up to Clinton\u2019s. \u201cTwo things I think are worth watching: the first is whether Trump has given himself more money,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThe second thing is how he sort of sets expectations in terms of how much money he thinks he\u2019ll be able to raise and also how much money he thinks he needs to raise.\u201d Next up in Hillary Clinton\u2019s ongoing Trump lecture series: the economy. Clinton's anti-Trump campaign continues In Columbus on Tuesday, Clinton picks up where she left off in her widely-covered foreign policy speech in San Diego, where she declared Trump unfit for the presidency. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reports she will unleash a detailed take-down of Trump\u2019s business record, arguing that he\u2019s only looking out for himself, at the cost of American workers and a middle-class that\u2019s invisible to him. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the Clinton campaign\u2019s continued effort to define Donald Trump early,\u201d said Zeleny. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing after another on this but it raises the question: can she get to the White House \u2013 can she win in November on anti-Trump sentiment alone? The campaign believes no.\u201d That\u2019s why Zeleny also points out the campaign is making a big investment in battleground state ads on her biography. Which tactic will shape the race more? Only time will tell. As the running-mate guessing game ramps up in both parties, The New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Martin zeroes in on a name that popped up last week in a Wall Street Journal write up \u2013 a young congressman with working class credentials, Tim Ryan of Ohio. \u201cAs these things work, there are often names that are put in circulation by campaigns who like surrogates,\u201d said Martin. \u201cI think Ryan falls in that category.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s probably not going to be the pick, but keep an eye on him for either a slot in the administration or to run for governor of Ohio in 2018. The Clinton folks like him a lot.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama listed every major economic achievement of his presidency A White House source said Obama was chomping at the bit to get out and \"get people fired up\" President Barack Obama on Wednesday delivered a fervent appeal for a Democratic successor, wading deeper into the race to replace him even as his party has yet to produce a presumptive nominee. Without mentioning any presidential candidates by name \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 Obama lambasted what he said were economic myths peddled by the GOP, insisting any clear-eyed assessment shows the country better off now then when he took office. Speaking in Elkhart, Indiana, a city he frequented at the beginning of his term as he worked to stave off an economic depression, Obama listed every major economic achievement of his presidency, from expanding overtime rules to tightening regulations on big banks. And while he made clear, specific references to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Obama steered away from lauding the economic plans being offered by the two Democrats vying for the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cIf we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of \u2018okey-doke,\u2019 just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we\u2019re not going to build on the progress we started,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf we get cynical and just vote our fears, or if we don\u2019t vote at all, we won\u2019t build on the progress that we started.\u201d During his hour-long remarks, Obama cast the upcoming general election as a choice between his own policies and those that would only benefit wealthy Americans. But because the Democratic primary race is still being fought between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Obama avoided making any specific case for a candidate that would carry on his agenda. Clinton is all but assured to secure the Democratic nomination, and it\u2019s little secret that Obama regards his former secretary of state as the natural heir to his presidency. But on Wednesday, the only mention of the word \u201cClinton\u201d during his speech came when he lauded lower deficits during President Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Instead, Obama spoke in broader terms about the upcoming vote. \u201cIf what you care about in this election is your pocketbook, if what you\u2019re concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about \u2013 the economy \u2013 the debate is not even close,\u201d Obama said, at one point calling Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate new banking regulations \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. Why would you do that? Less oversight on Wall Street would only make another crisis more likely,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHow can you say you\u2019re for the middle class and then you want to tear down these rules?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think that actually this agenda is going to help you,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to help you. And the evidence of the last 30 years, not to mention common sense, should tell you their answers to our challenges are no answers at all.\u201d Ahead of his remarks Wednesday, a White House source said Obama was chomping at the bit to get out and \u201cget people fired up\u201d about the upcoming election, though the source conceded Obama will remain largely on the sidelines until the Democrats have a nominee. Obama expects to \u201cexplode onto the scene\u201d once the nominee is selected and \u201cknows his power\u201d to fire up the Democratic base, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving him crazy\u201d to be mostly hands-off, the source added. In his speech, Obama used his strongest language this year to push back against GOP proposals. \u201cIn today\u2019s economy, we can\u2019t put up walls around America. We\u2019re not going to round up 11 million people, we\u2019re not going to put technology back in the box, we\u2019re not going to rip away hard-earned rights for women and minorities and Americans with disabilities,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThese are permanent fixtures in our economy and rolling them back will not help folks in Elkhart or anywhere else.\u201d Later, Obama claimed a Republican president would \u201clead to lower wages, it would eliminate worker protections, it would cut investments in things like education, it would weaken the safety net, it would kick people off health insurance, it would let China write the rules for the global economy, it would let big oil write the rules that protect our air and water, it would let big banks weaken rules that protect families from getting cheated, it would cut taxes for wealthy Americans to historic lows.\u201d Obama was returning to Concord Community High School \u2013 the site of his first major trip as President \u2013 to a town that has dramatically recovered from the recession. Since Obama\u2019s first speech there, Elkhart\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped from 19.6% to 4.1% today, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Manufacturing and graduation rates in Elkhart have also significantly improved from 2009. In a statement, Michael Short a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Obama was \u201ctrying to convince voters his record of weak growth, stagnant wages and a shrinking middle class is really a success story.\u201d \u201cThe fact that there are 264,000 fewer manufacturing jobs today than when President Obama took office more than seven years ago is a stark reminder of the failure of his policies,\u201d Short said. In his final year in office, Obama has been returning to sites in the U.S. with significance for his presidential tenure. In February, he visited Springfield, Illinois, where he first announced in 2007 he was running for the White House.",

            "article_content": "CNN interviewed more than a dozen veteran GOP campaign strategists and others about what Trump needs to do to win Most said Trump faces an uphill battle Yet all agreed not to underestimate Trump Donald Trump\u2019s transition from primary flame-thrower to general-election standard bearer has been marked by controversy. In just the past week, he\u2019s caused an uproar by blasting the Republican governor of New Mexico \u2013 one of the party\u2019s most prominent Latinas \u2013 while also calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d and abruptly parting ways with his recently hired political director. But there are also signs that he\u2019s willing to moderate some of his primary positions and take more conventional steps to prepare for November, such as building out a national finance team, hiring a pollster, accepting checks from wealthy donors and hitting the fundraising circuit. Trump\u2019s strategy: Where he says he can win CNN interviewed more than a dozen veteran Republican campaign strategists, pollsters and past and current officeholders about what Trump needs to do to win. Their consensus: He needs to flip blue-leaning states to his column, soften his public image \u2013 particularly as he targets independents, women and minority voters \u2013 and drive up Hillary Clinton\u2019s already high negatives even further. Most said Trump faces an uphill battle in a race that promises to be one of the most divisive and vitriolic in recent memory, one in which both Trump and Clinton have historically high unfavorable ratings. Yet all agreed on one thing after a primary season that shattered conventional wisdom: Don\u2019t underestimate Trump. A recent Quinnipiac poll found Trump and Clinton in an extremely tight race in several vital swing states. \u201cEverything that so many of us have learned by observing politics for the last 30, 40 years is going to be challenged this cycle,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to George W. Bush. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if Donald Trump is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20th.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at the Trump roadmap, based on these interviews: Trump must win every state Mitt Romney did in 2012 \u2013 plus an additional 64 electoral votes. In the past few elections, Republicans have looked to a handful of battleground states to put them over the top: among them, Virginia, Florida, Ohio and Colorado. The Quinnipiac poll had Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Still, GOP veterans believe the traditional swing states make up a tough line-up for Trump. The Republican primaries consistently revealed Trump\u2019s weakness with minority and educated voters \u2013 vulnerabilities that do not bode well for Trump in an increasingly blue state like Virginia. The ugly fall campaign \u201cIf you add up African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics in Virginia, which are all growing constituencies, that\u2019s about one third of the electorate,\u201d said Tucker Martin, a Virginia consultant and former aide to ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell. \u201cAnd then you combine the fact that we\u2019re a well-educated state \u2013 it\u2019s a very bad match for him.\u201d Meanwhile, western states like Colorado with sizable Latino populations could also prove to be problematic for Trump. \u201cHe can\u2019t lose the states that Romney won. If he starts losing states that Romney won, it\u2019s over,\u201d said political consultant John Brabender, who was a senior strategist to Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who has endorsed Trump. \u201cThe states that Romney thought were in play \u2013 can Trump put them in play?\u201d In other words, Trump must redraw the map. That means targeting states with demographics that favor Trump, such as blue collar, less educated and older white voters, and even competing in states that have consistently leaned blue in recent presidential elections. A key part of Trump\u2019s strategy is to ensure high turnout of white, working class Republican voters. But he\u2019s also looking to capture a segment of the Democratic base with his populist economic message. \u201cI really think he has an opportunity with working class Democrats, who we knew years ago as Reagan Democrats,\u201d said Michigan Republican strategist John Truscott. \u201cThat\u2019s where his unique opportunity is to get some cross over.\u201d All of this brings Trump to the Rust Belt. Resetting red and blue in the Rust Belt Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, who ran for president this cycle and is now calling for the GOP to unite behind Trump, said he expects this region to be Trump\u2019s gateway to a November victory. \u201cIf Donald Trump can hold the South, and I think he can, and all of a sudden become the spokesman for the disenfranchised working men and working women in the industrialized Midwest, suddenly he can be competitive in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota and Pennsylvania,\u201d Gilmore said. (Trump won three of those states \u2013 Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania \u2013 during the primaries). Pennsylvania strategist Mark Harris believes the cards are stacked against Trump in the general election. The significance of Trump pulling off a victory in the Keystone State, which has not voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988, is difficult to overstate, he said. \u201cPennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin \u2013 those sorts of states I think are going to be important to his efforts. And certainly probably are friendlier than the Floridas and Colorados of the world,\u201d said Harris, who worked for Marco Rubio\u2019s super PAC. Trump\u2019s populist, economic message has deeply resonated in former industrial states across the Midwest and Northeast \u2013 once the center of the country\u2019s manufacturing boom. As part of a broader foreign policy view that promises to put \u201cAmerica first,\u201d Trump regularly laments that the United States has become second-tier next to countries like China and Japan. Campaigning in areas where voter frustration and anger about the economy run deep, Trump has been relentless in his attacks on international trade agreements and companies that outsource jobs. In the general election, Trump is expected to slam Clinton for saying earlier this year that as President, she would \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d New Jersey state Sen. Mike Doherty, one of Trump\u2019s earliest political supporters, said the key to Trump\u2019s success in the Rust Belt will have everything to do with the candidate staying on message on the economy. \u201cI would continue to focus on the United States has been de-industrialized, these international trade agreements have been a disaster and we need to make better deals,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cThe real issue is the economy.\u201d As he stands on the cusp of formally accepting his party\u2019s nomination in July, Trump\u2019s unfavorable ratings are through the roof. Trump is determined to make Clinton equally toxic \u2013 perhaps the only condition under which he can defeat her. Never have both the Democratic and Republican presumptive White House nominees suffered from such historically high negative ratings. A CNN/ORC poll this month showed 56% of voters view Trump unfavorably, while 49% have a negative view of Clinton. \u201cBoth of them have such significant vulnerabilities that it\u2019s just a matter of whether there is a major stumble by either one of them or one campaign better exploits the weaknesses of the other,\u201d said Peter Ernaut, a Nevada GOP strategist. \u201cThese actual campaigns are going to matter a lot.\u201d It\u2019s an ugly match-up that could bring out an unprecedented level of vitriol in the general election. Republicans believe Clinton\u2019s high negatives, fueled by the widespread perception that she is not honest or trustworthy, should be one of Trump\u2019s biggest advantages \u2013 even as he is widely disliked himself. \u201cI\u2019d make this campaign a race to the bottom,\u201d said Gregg Keller, who has advised Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. \u201cI believe the pathway to victory is not in convincing (some people) to vote, but convincing them not to vote at all.\u201d In other words, Trump needs high turnout from his supporters while discouraging Clinton voters from showing up. Trump is already waging full war against Clinton. Labeling her \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d Trump has hit the former secretary of state on her qualifications, pointing to her past support for the Iraq War and her handling of the downfall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. One scandal that\u2019s poised to continue haunting Clinton is her use of a private email server at the State Department, particularly after an Inspector General report released last week said she failed to follow proper protocol. Trump\u2019s attacks have not only targeted Clinton but also her husband. He\u2019s revived controversies dating back to Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, including the former president\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky and other allegations of sexual misconduct. Last week, Trump dredged up one of the ugliest debunked conspiracy theories from the 1990s, telling The Washington Post that he believed there was something \u201cfishy\u201d about Vince Foster\u2019s death. Foster, who was a personal friend of the Clintons and served as Bill Clinton\u2019s White House deputy legal counsel, committed suicide. The episode foreshadowed the bitterly personal feud that is likely to fuel the general election. \u201cHillary Clinton has never run against a candidate with ten arms and eight legs like Donald Trump. He\u2019s going to be all over her,\u201d said GOP consultant Alex Castellanos. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t figure out how to run against a skinny, first-term, U.S. senator named Hussein \u2026 much less this political raptor, which is what Donald Trump is.\u201d Republicans agree that Trump\u2019s success so far has largely centered on his aggressive tone and his famous aversion to political correctness. \u201cHe needs to double down on being Donald Trump, don\u2019t try to play to the middle, don\u2019t try to moderate, don\u2019t try to be anything that you\u2019re not,\u201d said Keller, the Scott Walker adviser. \u201cYou have a brand that is recognizable to tons of people. Don\u2019t abandon that.\u201d But Republicans also caution that the general election is an entirely different beast. Trump\u2019s political success has centered on his nontraditional rhetoric and approach to the nation\u2019s problems. But he still may need to find a way to moderate his tone for the broader general election audience. One of Trump\u2019s biggest challenges heading into November is to broaden his appeal and convince non-primary voters to support him in November. That includes winning over independents and even some Democrats, and stopping the bleeding with minorities, younger voters as well as suburban and moderate Republicans \u2013 particularly women. \u201cMake the tone a little bit more appealing to everybody \u2013 make it a little bit more G-rated,\u201d said veteran pollster and strategist Jim McLaughlin. \u201cMake it so that that Walmart mom, that middle class mom, heck, that African-American mother, that Latino mother that is looking for the best for their children will say, you know what, he\u2019s got better ideas than Hillary Clinton does.\u201d Lanhee Chen, a top policy adviser to Romney, said Trump must effectively beat back Clinton\u2019s suggestion that he is \u201can unserious person for a serious time\u201d if he wants to broaden his base heading into November. A critical part of that, Chen said, is to get much more serious about policy. \u201cIt would seem to me that the best way to counteract would be by saying, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve got some serious ideas. And it doesn\u2019t need to be a 200-page policy book but it does need to be more than, \u2018We\u2019re going to get tough on China,\u2019\u201d Chen said. \u201cThat would be effective for both for independents but also for conservatives who have questions about what is this guy going to do.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Donald Trump would need to win 64 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney to win the election.",

            "article_content": "Clinton has amped up her attacks against Trump while campaigning in California this week \"The fact is Donald Trump thought he could make money off of people's misery,\" she said As she has trudged toward the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton has struggled to find a message that could impassion her Democratic voters the way her rival Bernie Sanders has. But that changed this week in California when she turned her full attention to Donald Trump. With the brash real estate magnate as her full-time foil, Clinton finally seemed to find her voice. In speech after speech across the Golden State, Clinton delivered a fiery, point-by-point takedown of the real estate magnate, casting him as a greedy bully who was eager to profit from the financial woes of the middle class Americans who lost homes and jobs in the 2008 economic crash. \u201cI will continue to stand up and speak out against what he says \u2013 the kinds of positions and policies he\u2019s putting forward, the way he treats people, how divisive he is,\u201d Clinton said Wednesday in Buena Park. It could be a key turning point for her campaign. Her supporters and donors have been baffled for months about her inability to vanquish Sanders, given her influence and the depths of her support in the Democratic Party. Recent polls have shown Trump closing in on Clinton in potential general election matchups \u2013 raising the level of alarm about her ability to focus on the general election campaign. But while Clinton may have momentarily found her stride, fresh controversies like the one that emerged Wednesday \u2013 the State Department Inspector General report saying she failed to follow the rules or inform key department staff regarding her use of a private email server \u2013 could quickly knock her back off message. State Dept. IG: No one okayed Clinton private email server Though the former secretary of state has not yet clinched the magic number of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, she campaigned here as though Sanders\u2019 campaign was the farthest thing from her mind. Her singular focus on Trump was most striking when she campaigned a few miles from Sanders in Riverside Tuesday, but never mentioned him. Delivering a speech that sent a jolt of electricity through the initially subdued crowd, she vowed not to let Trump go unanswered. Targeting Trump\u2019s image as a champion for the little guy as a fraud, Clinton pounded Trump repeatedly for comments that he made in 2006 in a Trump University audiobook where he said he \u201csort of\u201d hoped that predictions of looming housing market crash were accurate. If the bubble burst, \u201cyou can make a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy on earth would we elect somebody president who actually rooted for the collapse of the market?\u201d she said with indignation in Riverside as the crowd roared their approval and chanted her name. \u201cThe fact is Donald Trump thought he could make money off of people\u2019s misery.\u201d In Orange County on Wednesday, Clinton also cast Trump as \u201ca divider\u201d who has denigrated women, Muslims and people with disabilities. Keying off his raucous event in New Mexico on Tuesday night, she specifically called him out for attacking Gov. Susana Martinez. Why did Trump swipe at GOP governor Martinez? \u201cHe makes a habit of insulting women,\u201d Clinton said in Buena Park. \u201cLast night he insulted the Republican Governor Martinez of New Mexico \u2013 just gratuitously. I don\u2019t know. He seems to have something about women.\u201d \u201cWhatever reason he does it, it is setting Americans against Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a recipe for more divisiveness at a time where we must be united.\u201d Donald Trump has a woman problem \u2013 3 of them Trump did not directly respond to those attacks in Anaheim Wednesday, but told the crowd he was eager to run against the former secretary of state \u2013 who he continues to call \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Recalling her 2008 campaign ad, where she was portrayed as the only candidate qualified to take the 3:00 am emergency call in the White House, Trump repeatedly questioned her judgment and fitness to be commander-in-chief, faulting her for turmoil in Iraq and Libya. \u201cYou remember the famous ad \u2013 when they call at 3 in the morning, who\u2019s going to be there to answer the call?\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe was sleeping. They called. They kept calling. Did you see hundreds and hundreds of emails and calls? And they kept calling and she was sleeping, folks. She was sleeping. I don\u2019t sleep much. I don\u2019t sleep much.\u201d Trump: Hillary Clinton a 'lowlife' After watching Trump slay one Republican rival after another, Clinton\u2019s campaign has spent months workshopping the most effective way to target the real estate mogul. For now, they seem to have settled on that three-prong attack \u2013 that Trump is a businessman who only protects his own interests; that he is a man who is incapable of working with others; and a candidate who would pose a risk to national security. Clinton looks to pop Trump\u2019s populist appeal Attempting to tie those threads together at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers event on Tuesday, Clinton suggested that Trump may have never paid any federal income tax. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, because he says he is under audit. \u201cHe goes around saying, \u2018Well we have got to have a stronger military,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWell he certainly doesn\u2019t want to pay a penny to protect our men and women in uniform.\u201d Elizabeth Warren calls Trump 'insecure money-grubber' Top campaign aides, in discussions with Clinton, have settled on a strategy of responding to Trump with policy-focused attacks while casting him as someone who has no idea what real Americans actually want. Clinton will not, aides say, respond to Trump\u2019s personal attacks, particularly about her husband\u2019s marital indiscretions. I fight for working families every day, @realDonaldTrump. You fight only for Donald Trump. Clinton\u2019s surrogates have gotten behind that message, taking on Trump\u2019s business dealings and painting him as a selfish and callous self-promoter. On Wednesday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren leveled a series of Twitter attacks on Trump, but one stuck out to Clinton\u2019s aides. \u201cI fight for working families every day, @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cYou fight only for Donald Trump.\u201d As the contours of the potential Trump-Clinton matchup take shape, Sanders is making his last stand here in California before voters cast ballots on June 7, which will mark the end of the primary season. Though they acknowledge that Sanders\u2019 path to victory is a narrow one, the young, diverse, passionate supporters flocking to his events have a very clear message for Clinton: It\u2019s not over. \u201cWhen there are large voter turnouts we win,\u201d Sanders said at his Riverside event this week. \u201cWe are going to be running up and down this beautiful state. We are going to be speaking to over 200,000 Californians \u2026 We are going to win here in California.\u201d Sanders on Clinton declining debate: A bit insulting He asked the largest state in the nation to tell \u201cthe entire world\u201d that \u201cCalifornia believes in the political revolution.\u201d Most striking at Sanders\u2019 events, however, is how much work Clinton may have ahead of her to win over his  followers \u2013 and how much frustration they feel at what they see as condescension from her campaign. That was emblematic in a T-shirt that some Clinton backers were wearing this week as the Democratic candidates campaigned across town from one another. \u201cSpoiler Alert,\u201d the shirt said. \u201cClinton wins.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a trustworthy person to vote for,\u201d said Yasmeen Dabbos, a 20-year-old second-year anthropology student at UC Riverside as she waited to enter Sanders\u2019 event. \u201cI didn\u2019t like her from the beginning and I feel like people wanted her there just because they thought she was the only option. But I always felt like there was someone else who could beat her, and Bernie obviously filled that position.\u201d While Dabbos plans to volunteer for Sanders, she said would never put in that kind of effort for Clinton. \u201cI would just cast my ballot, that\u2019s all I could do for her,\u201d Dabbos said. Even then, she added, it would be more of a vote against Trump. President Barack Obama, himself familiar with a long, drawn-out primary, called it \u201ca grind\u201d when asked about it during a news conference in Japan Thursday. \u201cI guarantee you the eventual nominee sure wishes it was over now, because this is a grind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. And in some ways, one of the things I\u2019ve always found is that it\u2019s a lot more draining arguing against your friends than it is arguing against your political opponents. It weighs on you more. Being criticized by folks in your own party always hurts just a little bit more.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton's campaign hopes to use Trump's comments on the housing market against him In California, Clinton said Trump wanted a financial crash so that he could \"make some money for himself.\" Trump responded by defending his business record Donald Trump has cast himself as a populist hero during the 2016 campaign: A champion of impoverished middle class Americans shunned by a corrupt political establishment. Hillary Clinton is launching a concerted effort to pull that image apart, beginning with highlighting quotes from 2006 and 2007 where the real estate mogul speculated he could cash in on a housing market crash. The message is simple: Trump is pretending to be a defender of middle class Americans when in fact, he has sought to personally benefit from their losses. In an audiobook produced for Trump University 10 years ago, Trump, asked about predictions of a forthcoming housing market crash, responded: \u201cI sort of hope that happens because then, people like me would go in and buy.\u201d Trump added: \u201cIf there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money.\u201d At a campaign rally Tuesday, Clinton accused Trump of wishing for a financial crash so that he could \u201cmake some money for himself.\u201d \u201cHe said \u2018I sort of hope that happens.\u2019 He actually said that,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd now he says he wants to roll back the financial regulations that we have imposed on Wall Street to let them run wild again. Well I will tell you what \u2013 you and I together, we\u2019re not going to let him.\u201d Will Trump v Clinton be a nailbiter? The attacks recall the 2012 election, where President Barack Obama and Democrats relentlessly went after GOP nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s work in private equity. Obama and his surrogates sought to paint Romney as a wealthy and out-of-touch businessman who struck profitable business deals even at the expense of middle class jobs. At a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Tuesday night, Trump slammed Clinton for her campaign\u2019s online video hitting the presumptive Republican nominee on the quotes. \u201cYeah, if it goes down I\u2019m gonna buy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman, that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d \u201cIf it goes down it goes down. I feel badly for everybody. What am I going to do? It\u2019s business!\u201d Trump added. Earlier, in a statement, he defended his business record. RELATED: Trump protesters smash door, break through barriers \u201cI am a businessman and I have made a lot of money in down markets, in some cases as much as I\u2019ve made when markets are good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFrankly, this is the kind of thinking our country needs \u2013 understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation. Politicians have no idea how to do this \u2013 they don\u2019t have a clue. I will create jobs, bring back companies and not make it easy for companies to leave. If they do, they will fully understand that there will be consequences. Our jobs market will flourish.\u201d The housing market crashed in 2008, setting off a devastating financial crisis that wrecked the livelihoods of millions of Americans. Years later, plenty of voters across the country feel that they never fully recovered, and have flocked to anti-establishment, populist candidates like Trump and Sanders this year. With the general election still more than five months away, the Clinton campaign is testing out a range of political attacks against Trump including on his controversial rhetoric and his foreign policy views. Last week, Clinton questioned Trump\u2019s eligibility to be president, telling CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo: \u201cHe is not qualified to be president of the United States.\u201d Donald Trump brings up old attacks against Bill Clinton Trump managed to maintain his popularity throughout the campaign despite making public statements that would have seriously damaged most other politicians. Trump has referred to some Mexicans coming into the United States as criminals and rapists; mocked Sen. John McCain\u2019s captivity in the Vietnam War, saying: \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured\u201d; and made questionable comments about women including then-presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. RELATED: Here\u2019s who buys the most weapons from the U.S. The housing crisis quotes are an attack Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes can work in swing states such as Florida, Ohio and Nevada. Multiple members unleashed their criticism on the House floor on Tuesday. Nevada Rep. Dina Titus lamented the devastation in Las Vegas after the housing crash, and had this to say to the presumptive GOP nominee: \u201cKeep your short fingers out of the Nevada housing market.\u201d Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan also weighed in, saying, \u201cShame on you, Mr. Trump. You are supposed to be rooting for the American people not rooting against them.\u201d Nightcap: Harry Reid\u2019s unity play: \u2018Lay off\u2019 Sanders | Sign up Clinton\u2019s surrogates will continue going after Trump on the issue in six battleground states through a series of press calls, statements and events, according to campaign aides. The campaign also highlighted a 2007 interview in which Trump said he was \u201cexcited\u201d at the prospect of soft real estate markets. \u201cPeople have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I\u2019m excited if it is,\u201d he told the Toronto Globe and Mail. \u201cI\u2019ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\u201d In a call with reporters Tuesday, Tampa, Florida, Mayor Bob Buckhorn said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you make America great again when you root for it to fail so you can make a quick buck,\u201d Buckhorn said. The Democratic National Committee also jumped on the newly surfaced remarks from Trump on the housing market. In a press release accusing Trump of having \u201ccheered on\u201d the collapse of the housing market, the DNC noted that the crash was devastating to minorities like Hispanics and African-Americans. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s lack of concern for the economic well-being of hard-working families shows that he doesn\u2019t have the judgment and temperament to occupy the Oval Office,\u201d wrote DNC spokesperson Luis Miranda.

            "article_content": "A prominent Hillary Clinton surrogate went wildly off-message Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell has come under fire for the remark Prominent Hillary Clinton surrogate Ed Rendell is coming under fire for suggesting that \u201cugly women\u201d will help doom Donald Trump\u2019s chances in November. Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, was making a point to The Washington Post about Trump\u2019s untoward comments about unattractive women. \u201cWill he have some appeal to working-class Dems in Levittown or Bristol? Sure,\u201d Rendell told the Post in a story published Wednesday. \u201cFor every one he\u2019ll lose 1\u00bd, two Republican women. Trump\u2019s comments like \u2018You can\u2019t be a 10 if you\u2019re flat-chested,\u2019 that\u2019ll come back to haunt him. There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally.\u201d RELATED: The nasty, multibillion-dollar general election campaign begins The comments were met with swift denunciation from Democrats and progressives. Ian Millhiser, an editor for Think Progress, tweeted, \u201cCan we all agree that Ed Rendell should never open his mouth again ever please?\u201d Doktor Zoom, responding to Rendell\u2019s \u201cpeople take that stuff personally\u201d line, wrote for Wonkette, \u201cUm. Why yes, we suppose people do. Can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d And CNN contributor and Clinton supporter Bakari Sellers told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d: \u201cThat was stupid. That was just outright stupid, asinine and ignorant.\u201d A message left with the Clinton campaign was not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon. This isn\u2019t the first time Rendell has raised eyebrows with his comments on women. \u201cI do not have affairs with women,\u201d Rendell told PhillyMag.com in 2010, \u201cand it\u2019s really unfair. It\u2019s particularly unfair to attractive women. I should go out and find an unattractive woman to have an affair with.\u201d Trump\u2019s advances on and remarks about women were thrust into the spotlight in a lengthy article in The New York Times this weekend, a story that Trump and his surrogates have loudly protested this week. Trump has signaled that he plans to mount a strong challenge in Rendell\u2019s Pennsylvania, where an early poll has shown him competitive. But super PACs supporting Clinton plan to raise concerns similar to those lodged by Rendell, unveiling this week a pair of advertisements that broadcast Trump\u2019s comments about women\u2019s physical appearances.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton squeaked by in Kentucky; Bernie Sanders won Oregon All roads still lead to California and the June 7 primary Bernie Sanders won more delegates than Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night \u2013 but not enough to slow Clinton\u2019s march to the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton won Kentucky by a razor-thin margin, while Sanders notched a bigger 53% to 47% victory in Oregon. The 61 delegates Kentucky had on the line and Oregon\u2019s 74 will be divided proportionally among the two candidates based on results in those states \u2013 and that\u2019s the bad news for Sanders. He needs to win by overwhelming margins the rest of the way to stand a chance at catching Clinton. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries: With an all-but-insurmountable delegate lead, Clinton didn\u2019t need to win Kentucky. But she\u2019s surely glad she did, however narrow her victory. Her triumph \u2013 particularly in a largely white, working-class state \u2013 will prevent Clinton from limping into California\u2019s June 7 primary on a string of May losses. In Kentucky, Clinton learned the lessons of Indiana, where Sanders outspent her on television, nearly $2 million to $0. Unlike Indiana, where she held just three events, Clinton devoted much more time to campaigning in Kentucky. She held 11 campaign stops over three visits, spread over a two-week span. And she played up the economic credentials of her husband, Bill Clinton \u2014  the last Democrat to carry Kentucky in a general election, in 1992 and 1996. Also helping Clinton with the registered Democrats who voted in Kentucky\u2019s primary: Her carefully cultivated status as President Barack Obama\u2019s natural heir. The party\u2019s gains have been hard-won in the state. Former Gov. Steve Beshear fought to set up a state program for Obamacare that became a national model \u2013 only to watch Republican Gov. Matt Bevin strive to dismantle it. The changes of the Obama era are still not secured in Kentucky \u2013 so Sanders\u2019 big-picture liberalism feels much less feasible there. Sanders\u2019 win in Oregon wasn\u2019t nearly enough to put him in a realistic place to overtake Clinton in the number of pledged delegates \u2013 but it did mean he\u2019ll close Tuesday\u2019s contests with more delegates that day than Clinton, and it\u2019ll keep his campaign chugging along. The largely white, liberal, homogenous state was the perfect place for a Sanders victory. He was so confident he\u2019d win Oregon that he spent the days leading up to the primary campaigning in California and Puerto Rico. Nightcap: Democratic disarray | Sign up \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be: I agree with you. We are in \u2018til the last ballot is cast,\u201d Sanders told supporters in Carson, California, late Tuesday night. Sanders turned his election-night speech into a rant against media and political establishment figures who are increasingly calling on him to exit the race. He touted California\u2019s positioning as a delegate gold mine. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Secretary Clinton, she might get nervous: I think we\u2019re going to win here in California,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd as all of you know, California has 475 pledged delegates.\u201d What that means: Sanders has staked everything on staying in the race until the last votes are counted. Suddenly, the party that expected to sit back and watch Republicans duke it out at their convention in Cleveland is fretting that chaos could come to Philadelphia. The turmoil at Nevada\u2019s Democratic convention over the weekend spilled into Tuesday night. After reports that the state chairwoman faced threats from Sanders supporters, his campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN that \u201cwe condemn that, absolutely, categorically.\u201d Weaver promised peace at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any violence in Philadelphia \u2026 I guarantee you that. We hope for a fair and orderly convention,\u201d he said. But Sanders\u2019 supporters might not be easy to mollify. The big question is whether what happened in Nevada will occur again. \u201cWhat happened at that convention was unacceptable,\u201d said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, laying the blame heavily on Sanders\u2019 supporters by saying they should \u201caddress process concerns in a civil way\u201d in a Tuesday night interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThe bottom line is, we have the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama, and these rules were adopted by state parties around the country in 2014,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were followed, and even if the Sanders supporters were frustrated, there is never a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to.\u201d More people voted for Martin O\u2019Malley in Kentucky than the margin between Clinton and Sanders at the end of the night, a margin close enough to make a recount possible. With all precincts reporting, Clinton held a 1,923 vote lead over Bernie Sanders, the office of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told CNN. The state\u2019s results don\u2019t become official until May 31. Sanders has a week to request in writing a re-canvass that would involve Kentucky officials manually checking voting machines to make sure that the totals are correct. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told CNN that the campaign will \u201ctake a close look at the numbers\u201d and decide Wednesday whether to challenge Kentucky\u2019s results. What may bother Sanders\u2019 supporters: Lundergan Grimes went on CNN before all the votes were in and called Clinton the \u201cunofficial\u201d winner of Kentucky. Lundergan Grimes is a big Clinton supporter. Her father, an influential Democrat in Kentucky, is a long-time Clinton ally, too. Would she have made the same \u201cunofficial\u201d declaration for Sanders? While the Democratic race rolls on, the GOP contest \u2014 the one with Donald Trump, 17 candidates and personal insults that everyone was exercised about \u2013 is officially over, done and boring. The best political experts could do was muse about mail-in ballots in Oregon. It\u2019s a vote-by-mail state, and ballots were sent out three weeks before the primary. Trump had just won on the East Coast, and Ted Cruz and John Kasich were just about to strike a deal that would\u2019ve theoretically given Kasich a clean one-on-one shot at Trump in Oregon. Of course, both Cruz and Kasich dropped out after the Indiana primary. But Oregon voters still had the option of going with one as a protest vote. That didn\u2019t happen. With more than half the vote in, Trump was on course to take two-thirds of the state\u2019s GOP support. Outside the election-night spotlight, Trump\u2019s campaign did everything possible to stay in the news Tuesday night. First, he filed a personal financial disclosure claiming he earned at least $560 million last year. And he taunted Clinton via Twitter. I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on! Then, Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a joint fundraising agreement to form two committees that will allow individual donors to give up to $449,400 and will help state parties. Why that move matters: It\u2019s the latest demonstration of the reality that this is Trump\u2019s Republican Party now.",

            "article_content": "Sanders defeated Clinton in West Virginia, even though one-third of Dems there said they will vote for Trump in November Trump easily won Nebraska and West Virginia, with little sign of any protest vote Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia Tuesday night, keeping his long-shot bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination alive for now. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, captured two states \u2013 West Virginia and Nebraska \u2013 as voters continue to flock to the New York billionaire. Exit polls in both states painted a picture of conservative voters eager for outsiders in Washington. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday night\u2019s primaries: Clinton defeated Barack Obama here in 2008, but didn\u2019t come close to a victory on Tuesday, losing to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders won handily in nearly every demographic, according to exit polls. He fared strongly among the many voters concerned with the economy and won big margins in coal industry households. Clinton has tried to clean up her comments from a CNN town hall in March that she wanted to \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\u201d but the damage had already set in. The Democratic electorate in West Virginia was easily more conservative than most states thus so far, according to exit polls. But that didn\u2019t help Clinton, the more moderate of the two candidates. Nearly 40% of Democratic voters said they want the next president to be \u201cless liberal\u201d than Obama. Of those voters, 62% went with Sanders \u2013 the self-described democratic socialist. Overall, neither candidate has much to tout here \u2013 about one-third of Democratic primary voters said they\u2019d support Trump in November. The always-running-late Clinton stuck to the schedule on Tuesday night, delivering a speech in Kentucky early and then making a beeline to the airport in order to not be on stage by the time West Virginia polls closed and results showing her substantial loss poured in. Her disappointing finish hinges on more than her hit on coal \u2013 it also shows the challenges of winning a general election while essentially running for Obama\u2019s third term. The voters of West Virginia are more conservative than the broader Democratic base, but Clinton will still need to run strong with moderate-to-conservative voters in Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio to beat Trump in November. Her advisers are carefully studying the opinions of white working-class voters like those in West Virginia. She doesn\u2019t need to win them and she won\u2019t, but her advisers want to see her improve her standing with them. Clinton also has wanted to focus her attention on exciting the Democratic base and uniting the party heading into the fall \u2013 a task that seems near-impossible before the convention as she continues to lose primaries to Sanders\u2019 improbable campaign. The loss of momentum makes it more difficult for her to make the case she can close the deal with the broad liberal base. West Virginia only had 29 Democratic delegates at stake Tuesday night, a small fraction of the more than 900 left through June. Even with his win there, Sanders did little to move the needle substantially against Clinton. Going into Tuesday, Sanders needed more pledged delegates than remain in upcoming primaries to clinch the nomination. At best, Sanders can still pick up enough pledged delegates going into the convention to hold a slim majority over Clinton, but would need to win roughly two-thirds in order to do so. And he would still need superdelegates to switch away from Clinton to his candidacy in order to actually secure the nomination. West Virginia\u2019s demographics helped him as well \u2013 91% of voters were white, according to exit polls. That won\u2019t be the case in delegate-rich states like California and New Jersey on June 7. \u201cWe now have won primaries and caucuses in 19 states,\u201d Sanders said at a rally in Salem, Oregon, Tuesday evening. \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be. We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination.\u201d Trump easily won West Virginia and Nebraska without a protest vote to rally the anti-Trump forces still out there in the Republican Party. Although Ted Cruz won nearly roughly 19% in Nebraska, Trump\u2019s strong wins come despite some high-profile GOP naysayers about his candidacy and prospects of winning in November, including Nebraska\u2019s own Sen. Ben Sasse. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Republican Party is unified. Exit polls showed a GOP electorate still smarting from the wounds of a contentious primary, with 58% of Republicans in West Virginia saying they feel the party is divided now but can come together in November. Only 30% believed the GOP will remain divided. In Nebraska, however, voters were split, with about half saying the party will unite and half saying it won\u2019t before November. And while the vast majority of GOP voters expect Trump to beat Clinton in a general election, nearly 1 in 5 Republican voters in Nebraska said they wouldn\u2019t vote for either one in the fall. Exit polls on both sides of the race showed an electorate hungry for a shake-up in Washington. Among Democrats in West Virginia, only 27% said they want a candidate who continues Obama\u2019s policies. In both states, more than 90% of Republican voters said they were \u201cangry\u201d or \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the federal government. And more than 6 in 10 Republicans in Nebraska said they felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by GOP politicians. It continues a trend seen in primaries all year \u2014 voters are hungry for change. Even if the parties don\u2019t agree on what change they seek, voters have responded strongly to candidates promising to remake Washington, which could pose a challenge to Clinton in a general election as she seeks to build on Obama\u2019s legacy.

            "article_content": "Republicans vote in West Virginia and Nebraska It will be for the first time since Donald Trump won the nomination Hillary Clinton might be on the way to the Democratic presidential nomination but she enters territory that could be considered more favorable to Bernie Sanders on Tuesday with the West Virginia primary. And for the first time on the Republican side, there\u2019s only one candidate in the race \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s consensus. Republicans in West Virginia and Nebraska will offer the first glimpse at whether the GOP can rally behind Donald Trump in a general election. GOP voters stand against Trump Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker For Democrats, only West Virginia offers binding results. In Nebraska, Democrats caucused in early March, favoring Sanders by nearly 15 points. Though Democrats will still be voting in a primary on Tuesday, the results for the presidential race will have no binding effect on delegate allocation. Here\u2019s what to watch in Tuesday\u2019s contests: Though Clinton won West Virginia over Barack Obama in 2008, she has been in far more hostile territory this time around after comments she made about putting coal miners \u201cout of business.\u201d Clinton apologizes for coal comments In a March town hall on CNN, Clinton said her policies would \u201cput a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business,\u201d continuing to say she was putting forth plans to help those people. Clinton claims she misspoke when talking about coal jobs But her critics on the left and right have seized on the remarks, with Sanders campaigning in West Virginia on taking care of coal workers and Donald Trump bringing up her remarks in rallies in the state. Clinton has tried to walk back the comments, answering emotional questions from voters as she campaigns through the Mountain State. And she has the support of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who told West Virginia MetroNews last week that he\u2019s been talking to her about improving on President Barack Obama\u2019s policies in regards to coal. But in the heavily coal-reliant West Virginia, the damage may have been done. West Virginia is considered favorable territory for Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders in the spotlight The electorate in the last presidential Democratic primary was overwhelmingly white and working class. The state also has a primary that allows unaffiliated voters to cast ballots in either contest, meaning Sanders can turn out independents. Both of those factors have tended to favor him in past contests. How Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party Though Nebraska\u2019s results are non-binding, if the electorate resembles the pro-Sanders crowd in March, he\u2019ll have another result to tout on what could be a rough night for Clinton. Based on CNN\u2019s current delegate estimate, Sanders can\u2019t overtake Clinton for the nomination with the remaining pledged delegates up for grabs. He would need superdelegates to switch their allegiance to him from Clinton and pick up pledged delegates in remaining primaries in droves. The proportional allocation rules in the Democratic primary won\u2019t help Sanders catch Clinton \u2013 but he could spend the next month delivering some embarrassing losses to Clinton in states favorable to his campaign. Why Clinton isn\u2019t pushing Sanders to exit race Trump may be the only GOP candidate with an active campaign, but he won\u2019t be the only candidate on the ballot in either state on Tuesday. Both West Virginia and Nebraska will have candidates who have dropped out of the race on the ballot, giving voters a chance to cast protest ballots against Trump should they choose. Opinion: Don\u2019t let \u2018Never Trump\u2019 become \u2018Ready for Hillary\u2019 Candidates with suspended campaigns have picked up a handful of votes in states after they left the race, but never in large margins. Tuesday will test whether the discomfort with Trump as the GOP nominee can drive voters to the polls to vote against the mogul. Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Nebraska will be an especially interesting test case. It\u2019s the home to Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, who wrote a lengthy Facebook post last week arguing for an alternative to Trump for Republicans who don\u2019t want to vote for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sasse won his Senate seat in 2014 with 65% of the vote. The GOP resistance to Donald Trump But Trump also picked up the endorsement of Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts last week even as the rest of the Ricketts family continues to donate to anti-Trump efforts. In West Virginia, in addition to casting ballots for Trump, voters will also select individual delegates to go to the convention. Delegate hopefuls will be marked with their chosen candidate or as uncommitted when voters make up their minds. To be sure, the Trump campaign in West Virginia sent supporters on Monday a guide to which delegates to select. One key statistic Donald Trump\u2019s campaign will be watching in exit polling is his standing with women. By the Numbers: Donald Trump and women voters Trump has been viewed unfavorably by upwards of two-thirds of women in general election polling, but has done marginally better with women in the Republican electorate. He won 47% of women in the Indiana primary last week, according to exit polls. But he won 59% of men. His chances in November will improve should he be able to close that gender gap. Nightcap: Paul Ryan gives Donald Trump an out on convention | Sign up Democrats have been hammering Trump with some of his comments about women, trying to continue to keep those unfavorables high among the key voting demographic. Without alternative Republicans in the race, Trump\u2019s returns among women could be telling. Both sides are hoping that a Trump-Clinton matchup could dramatically shift the electoral map as it has been known since 2000. Republicans hope that Trump could put Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan in play for the party. What 2012's electoral map shows us about 2016 Democrats, on the other hand, hope that rising demographic trends in states like Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia coupled with Trump\u2019s inflammatory statements about minorities could give Democrats an edge in states they have traditionally lost. With Trump and Clinton holding tight grips on their party\u2019s nominations, Tuesday will begin to show signs of what the general electorate could look like, and what issues are motivating them to the polls.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are not publicly pushing Bernie Sanders to quit Democrats want to make sure Clinton can unite the party for the general election Hillary Clinton is itching to take on Donald Trump in a one-on-one contest for the White House \u2013 but she isn\u2019t pushing Bernie Sanders off the stage yet. Democrats close to Clinton and the man who could become a top surrogate \u2013 President Barack Obama \u2013 insist they won\u2019t pressure the Vermont senator to leave. That reluctance is based on fear inside the Democratic establishment that such a move would make it more difficult to unite the party later this year. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Clinton needs the excited supporters that have rallied around Sanders and hopes treating the senator\u2019s campaign respectfully will make them more likely to back her against Trump. Clinton has already started to make overtures to Sanders\u2019 supporters \u2013 pledging to support them even if they don\u2019t support her \u2013 and campaign aides have said those will continue in the coming weeks. Donald Trump\u2019s new target: Bernie Sanders supporters Clinton on Wednesday told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper said she isn\u2019t pushing Sanders to hurry up. \u201cI\u2019m not calling myself that (the presumptive nominee),\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI know there are some contests ahead and I respect Sen. Sanders and whatever choices he\u2019s making. And I have a lot of empathy about this, Anderson. You know, I ran to the very end in 2008.\u201d Sanders can\u2019t win with pledged delegates, but aides hope he can push Clinton out Obama\u2019s White House agrees there\u2019s no rush. \u201cThe key here is unifying the party,\u201d said one Democrat familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking. \u201cSo with that in mind, we are being careful to let the process play through and provide the space for there to be a unifying moment for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\u201d Clinton: America can\u2019t take a chance on \u201cloose cannon\u201d Trump Bernie Sanders in the spotlight The Democratic contest may march on but the party\u2019s infrastructure is already preparing for a Clinton nomination and the former secretary of state is starting to put general election plans into place. While Sanders will continue to campaign across the country \u2013 including planned stops in West Virginia on Thursday \u2013 pledging to fight until the convention, Clinton\u2019s aides said this week that she will pursue a two-prong strategy for the coming weeks: Campaign in every upcoming primary while also making trips to general election battleground states. That strategy, though, has not quelled the nerves of Democrats across the country, who are worried that without any GOP rivals, Trump will now turn his entire focus to Clinton, possibly defining her early and hurting efforts to rehabilitate her already dinged image. After Trump all but locked up the nomination on Tuesday night, Clinton surrogates and supporters asked the campaign\u2019s top aides whether they can use their TV and online platforms to start asking for the Vermont senator to get out of the way. The answer they got back was a resounding no. \u201cThe campaign won\u2019t give us the green light to tee off on him,\u201d said one supporter who asked. \u201cIt was all good to say \u2018Bernie should stay in\u2019 when Trump was running against other people but now that she has to take on his attacks and Trump\u2019s attacks, things have changed.\u201d The supporter added, \u201cTo Secretary Clinton\u2019s credit, she won\u2019t let anybody start pushing him out.\u201d The Democratic figure who could provide her campaign a unifying boost \u2013 Obama \u2013 remains on the sidelines of his own party\u2019s contest. The White House on Wednesday wasn\u2019t offering any major shifts in its strategy to elect another Democrat to the Oval Office, aside from predicting that Obama\u2019s now-regular attacks on Trump would only ramp up. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Can President Obama stop Donald Trump? Obama has taken to dinging Trump on an almost weekly basis, even as his administration begins preparing for the intelligence and defense briefings to which all nominees are entitled. The latest example came Monday, when Obama told WMUR that Trump wasn\u2019t \u201cequipped to deal with the problems of this office.\u201d Aides say he enjoys those opportunities, even if he outwardly seems dismissive of the political circus. For Obama, ensuring the Democratic Party emerges from its nominating process intact has meant saying or doing little that would appear to favor Clinton, even as it remains obvious he sees his former secretary of state as a more predictable caretaker of his legacy. Obama gets candid about Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy The coalition that helped bring Obama into office has largely split between the two Democratic candidates: young people for Sanders, minorities for Clinton, and college-educated whites divided between the two. Even Obama has acknowledged that convincing those groups to vote could pose a challenge. Hillary Clinton turns her attention to Trump Democratic officials say Obama will likely target those audiences when he eventually does hit the campaign trail later this year. Without revealing any firm plans, they say stops on college campuses are likely, as are visits to swing states where his presence could boost turnout, like North Carolina and Nevada. \u201cThere is no denying the President will have an active role in the general election,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Wednesday. \u201cThere are six months until Election Day. I\u2019m confident the President will spend many of those days between now and Election Day making a strong case about the progress our country has made over the last eight years.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, will reprise the role he\u2019s played in past contests, campaigning in places where his connection to working-class voters could provide a lift to a Democratic candidate. One official identified Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan as likely stops for the Vice President in the general election. Hillary Clinton: I'm not the presumptive nominee yet Both Obama and Biden have endorsed Democratic Senate candidates, and will likely continue eyeing down-ballot races. The President also remains a draw for deep-pocketed Democratic donors, and his fundraising schedule will continue apace in the coming months. With entire chapters of his presidential legacy riding on who succeeds him, no one has more stake in the party coming together than Obama. And as the Democrat that both Clinton and Sanders supporters can love, he stands the best shot at keeping the warring factions from inflicting mortal wounds. To that end, Democratic officials aligned with Obama say they\u2019re closely watching Sanders\u2019 tone as the race moves toward its final stages. But there\u2019s zero effort to push the Vermont senator from the race \u2013 either explicitly or behind the scenes. The Clinton campaign has so far been effective at stopping high level surrogates and supporters from telling Sanders to get out of the way, and the White House has helped in the effort. Proof of that success: Even Priorities USA, the pro-Clinton super PAC that will spend millions to hit Trump and defend Clinton in the general, said Wednesday that they will not call on Sanders to get out. \u201cSince the results in Arizona, our focus has been solely on the general election and preparing for the general election,\u201d said Justin Barasky, the super PAC\u2019s spokesman. \u201cNothing that happens in the coming weeks will change our focus from stopping Donald Trump. We expect Hillary to be the nominee.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is going for the knockout blow against Ted Cruz Hillary Clinton wants to show she can win white, working-class voters Donald Trump has defeated his Republican rivals in six straight contests. In Indiana, he could demoralize them. Trump will try to win a primary Tuesday that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has set up as do-or-die for his own campaign. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, will attempt to reclaim the momentum that Hillary Clinton has firmly seized. Here are five things to watch in Indiana\u2019s primary: Cruz began his campaign in Indiana at the gym in Knightstown where the movie \u201cHoosiers\u201d \u2013 about an underdog team that overcame much bigger rivals to win a high school championship \u2013 was filmed. The Texas senator\u2019s chances of winning the state could prove to be \u2013 just like the movie\u2019s Hickory High School \u2013 fiction. Last week, Cruz was hyping Indiana\u2019s role in the Republican nominating contest every chance he got. In Greenwood, he declared that \u201cwe are focusing our resources intently on the state of Indiana.\u201d In Indianapolis, he said the state\u2019s voters will decide \u201cwhich path we should go down.\u201d He even deployed one of the biggest tools a presidential candidate has \u2013 his vice presidential choice \u2013 ahead of the Indiana primary. Americans agree: Clinton, Trump likely nominees Trump already has 1,002 of the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination, according to CNN estimates. Another 57 are up for grabs in Indiana: 30 go to the statewide winner, while three each go to the winner of each of Indiana\u2019s nine congressional districts. Cruz\u2019s expectations-setting has given Trump a chance to deliver a knockout blow. Ted Cruz spars with Trump supporter in Indiana \u201cIf we win Indiana, it\u2019s over.\u00a0It\u2019s over. It\u2019s finished.\u00a0They\u2019re gone,\u201d Trump said of his rivals Monday in Carmel. There\u2019s good reason for Trump to pump up Indiana\u2019s importance: An NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist University poll released Sunday showed him with a 15-point lead over Cruz, 49% to 34%, with Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 13%. Poll: Trump way ahead in Indiana Cruz, meanwhile, spent the weekend laying out a rationale for the continuation of his campaign. He made a trip to California for the state\u2019s GOP convention, and said that it\u2019s now the Golden State, which votes June 7, that will \u201cdecide this Republican primary.\u201d In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Monday, Cruz wouldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d support Trump in the general election. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get to slap an R on your jersey and lead the Republican Party. The reason the media wants Donald Trump to be our nominee is it represents a repudiation of conservative principles of the Constitution,\u201d he said. Cruz is likely to win \u2013 potentially by a big margin \u2013 in Indiana\u2019s heavily Evangelical Northeast, in the counties around Fort Wayne. Trump, meanwhile, should fare well in manufacturing-heavy regions like Evansville, Indianapolis and Lake County. If Cruz is going to win the state, it will be in the suburban \u201cdonut counties\u201d that surround Indianapolis. The result will also be the real test of the alliance between Cruz and Kasich, who agreed not to compete in Indiana. Particularly telling will be Hamilton County, the burgeoning home of the wealthy conservative cities Fishers, Noblesville and Carmel \u2013 where Mayor Jim Brainard is Kasich\u2019s Indiana chairman. When Cruz and Kasich struck their deal, Cruz\u2019s campaign hoped the more moderate, establishment-type Kasich supporters would easily tip the Texas senator\u2019s way. Carrier workers in viral video have hard time believing in candidates But Cruz is a poor ideological fit for many of these voters, who were largely supportive of Indiana\u2019s former governor, the economics-focused Mitch Daniels, and tend to dislike current Cruz-endorsing Gov. Mike Pence. The Cruz campaign\u2019s biggest strategic error in Indiana could prove to be its decision to keep vice presidential pick Carly Fiorina \u2013 who stood a much better chance of appealing to suburban women who make up a huge chunk of that doughnut county electorate \u2013 with Cruz in urban and rural areas, rather than sending her to Hamilton, Boone and Hendricks counties, where she could have helped solidify Cruz\u2019s support. Clinton visited Hammond and Mishawaka last week, and Indianapolis on Sunday, but make no mistake: Her campaign is trying as hard as possible to look like one that\u2019s about to lose Tuesday\u2019s primary. Clinton\u2019s camp didn\u2019t air a television ad in Indiana. It opened only five offices. And she held just one rally and two invite-only events. Bernie Sanders: Not \u2018impossible\u2019 to topple Clinton in Democratic race Spokesman Brian Fallon sought to portray Indiana as a must-win for Bernie Sanders on Monday, and pointed out that it is a largely-white state, saying: \u201cHe has spent millions of dollars in Indiana. We haven\u2019t been up at all here in Indiana. Indiana is also a state, in terms of tomorrow, where, demographically and the fact it is an open primary, it resembles very closely a lot of the states where he has had his biggest wins.\u201d Clinton outraises Sanders for the first time in 2016 The NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll has Clinton up four points. Fallon said it doesn\u2019t track with the campaign\u2019s internals, saying even a four-point lead \u201cprobably overstates it from our perspective in terms of our standing there.\u201d Why is Clinton\u2019s camp so dour in public? The Michigan loss taught her aides something about expectations management. Still, she defeated Barack Obama in Indiana in 2008. A loss in Indiana could suggest that Clinton hasn\u2019t yet turned the corner with white, working-class voters. On the verge of being mathematically eliminated from the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders is hoping a win in Indiana will boost his rationale for continuing on in the race. The Vermont senator made clear in a news conference Sunday that he isn\u2019t exiting the race before California votes on June 7. He said he faces \u201ca tough road to climb, but not an impossible road to climb\u201d to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Still, his fundraising is slowing. Sanders brought in $26 million in April \u2013 an impressive haul, but far short of the $44 million he\u2019d collected in both February and March, and slightly less than Clinton raised. Bernie Sanders in the spotlight Opinion: Bernie Sanders is this year\u2019s biggest story Clinton just went five-for-six in East Coast primaries. A loss in Indiana \u2013 the type of largely-white state Sanders should win \u2013 would be more evidence that the momentum might have left Sanders for good. Especially important at this stage is whether Sanders will keep up his sharp critiques of Clinton, or ease up on the attacks, focusing them on differences of policy on issues like trade and banking. Bernie Sanders focuses on \u2018strongest progressive agenda\u2019 for convention party platform Sanders campaign turns focus to superdelegates Clinton\u2019s campaign has repeatedly warned that Sanders runs the risk of damaging the Democrats\u2019 general election hopes \u2013 a possibility Trump underscored on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d saying of Sanders\u2019 attacks that Clinton is \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the presidency: \u201cI\u2019m going to use that. We\u2019ll have that teed up.\u201d Sanders, for his part, pushed back, saying his remarks won\u2019t have an impact in November. Clinton takes her foot off the gas on Sanders after New York win \u201cThe Republican Party and Trump have the resources to do all the opposition research they want on Secretary Clinton. They don\u2019t need Bernie Sanders\u2019 critiques of the secretary,\u201d Sanders said. Trump and Sanders may have made 2016 the ultimate year of the outsider. But the Republican establishment is getting its revenge down-ballot \u2013 and a hot Indiana Senate primary between two up-and-coming congressmen could provide the latest evidence. Rep. Todd Young is expected to defeat Rep. Marlin Stutzman in the race to fill the seat occupied by retiring Sen. Dan Coats. That\u2019s significant for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. His super PAC, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have pumped money into the Indiana race in a bid to defeat Stutzman \u2013 who McConnell fears is a second coming of Cruz, and another threat to his authority. Congressional Republicans look to distance themselves from Donald Trump Conservative outsiders have largely failed in efforts to unseat incumbents, or knock off establishment favorites, lower on Republican ballots so far in 2016. A Young win would provide the latest evidence of a shift away from the dynamics that dominated GOP races in 2012 and 2014. There are also competitive House primaries to replace both Young and Stutzman, with several state lawmakers and an attorney general battling for their seats in safely Republican districts. Since the presidential race normally doesn\u2019t matter much by the time Indiana comes around, much of the state\u2019s political class has been working on down-ballot contests, including the Senate race and Pence\u2019s re-election battle against Democratic former Indiana House speaker John Gregg, who came within three points of defeating Pence in 2012. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re looking for a race that\u2019s likely to leave devoted Republicans\u2019 mouths agape, look no further than Indiana\u2019s 9th congressional district. Trey Hollingsworth, a 32-year-old multimillionaire with political ambitions, went district-shopping. He moved from Tennessee to Indiana in September and almost immediately announced his bid for Congress. And polls show the hard-line conservative is actually leading a jam-packed primary going into Tuesday\u2019s election. How has Hollingsworth done it? Cash. He\u2019s spent more than $1.5 million of his own wealth, while his father has pumped more than $500,000 into a super PAC that has hit his opponents.

But on Monday, Cruz is racing to reverse polls that showed him trailing. \u201cI trust the people of Indiana to differentiate \u2026 We are not a bitter, angry, petty, bigoted people. That is not America.

READ: Poll: Trump way ahead of Cruz in Indiana Trump, meanwhile, has scheduled two more large rallies after casting Indiana as his chance to deliver Cruz a knock-out blow on Sunday. \u201cIndiana is so important and we have to win it,\u201d Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater in Terre Haute, Indiana. \u201cIf we win Indiana, it\u2019s over.\u201d The contest comes as Americans are increasingly convinced that Trump and Hillary Clinton will square off in the general election. A CNN/ORC poll found that 84% of voters nationwide think  Trump will lead the Republican ticket in November, while 85% say the same about Clinton on the Democratic side. Trump is backed by 49% of Republicans nationally, compared to 25% for Cruz and 19% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Among Democrats, 51% back Clinton, while 43% support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Cruz\u2019s jam-packed schedule reflects the do-or-die nature of Indiana\u2019s primary. He has five events on his schedule for Monday: The breakfast stop in rural Osceola; a visit alongside Pence in Marion; a rally with Pence in the heavily evangelical Fort Wayne; a stop in Bloomington, home of Indiana University; and a nighttime rally in Indianapolis. He has also dispatched Fiorina, who would become his vice presidential running-mate if he won the GOP nomination, to five events of her own in the counties surrounding Indianapolis. Donald Trump zeroes in on Indiana Those suburban counties are favorable to Republicans, but tend to be more moderate than Cruz. They could be more ideologically inclined to support Kasich, and therefore perhaps the most important pool of voters in Indiana\u2019s primary. Cruz has called in the cavalry, as well: Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, radio host Glenn Beck and the candidate\u2019s wife, Heidi Cruz, are all hitting the trail. Cruz told reporters in Osceola that even with a loss in Indiana, he\u2019d continue his campaign. \u201cI am in for the distance,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we have a viable path to victory, I am competing to the end.\u201d Cruz encountered a handful of hecklers in Marion, Indiana, during a stop at The Mill restaurant. One particularly aggressive protester told Cruz he\u2019d been mathematically eliminated from the GOP race and repeatedly yelled Trump\u2019s nickname for the Texas senator \u2013 \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d \u2013 at Cruz. Cruz went toe-to-toe with the man, asking him to name one thing that he liked about Trump. When the man named \u201cthe wall,\u201d Cruz cited Trump\u2019s meeting with The New York Times\u2019 editorial board. \u201cHold on,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe told the New York Times editorial board he\u2019s not going to build the wall or deport anyone.\u201d The man shouted his response: \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted!\u201d \u201cCivilized people don\u2019t yell,\u201d Cruz responded. \u201cWith respect, Trump is deceiving you. Playing you for a chump. Ask yourself, why is it that the mainstream media wants Donald Trump to be the nominee?\u201d Trump: An Indiana win will seal the nomination Trump has two big rallies planned for Monday: One in Carmel, a wealthy suburb of Indianapolis in   voter-rich Hamilton County, and one in South Bend, a working-class, union-heavy city where his criticism of free trade deals could attract independent voters. Before those events, Trump had lunch at Shapiro\u2019s, a downtown Indianapolis deli, where he at a reuben with his campaign team. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, is holding rallies in each of Indiana\u2019s three biggest cities: Evansville in the morning, Fort Wayne in the early afternoon and Indianapolis in the evening. Two candidates aren\u2019t in Indiana at all on Monday. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who struck a deal with Cruz to skip Indiana in exchange for Cruz ignoring Oregon and New Mexico, is already campaigning on the West Coast. And Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, has instead embarked on a tour of Appalachia, with stops in West Virginia and Kentucky \u2013 two states that will vote in the Democratic primary this month \u2013 and Ohio. She held a rally in Indianapolis on Sunday before jetting to Detroit for an NAACP dinner. CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders' campaign raised nearly $26 million in April, it announced Sunday That's a dip from Sanders' torrid fundraising pace in February and March Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, for the first time in 2016, out-raised rival Bernie Sander\u2019s campaign last month, according to their self-reported fundraising numbers. Sanders raised $25.8 million in April \u2013 short of his campaign\u2019s hauls of $44 million in March and $43.5 million in February, his campaign said Sunday. Clinton\u2019s campaign said Monday that they brought in $26.4 million in primary funds in April. Clinton, who is slowly starting to turn her focus to the general election, starts May with $30 million in the bank. The Sanders campaign did not release that number. But Sanders\u2019 dip from the previous month comes as the contest approaches its last states to vote, with the Vermont senator increasingly trailing Clinton in votes, pledged delegates and overall delegates, and suffering defeats in five out of six recent East Coast primaries, including New York. Sanders: Not \u201cimpossible\u201d to topple Clinton in Democratic race Clinton\u2019s operation, through a joint fundraising venture, also raised $9.5 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties in April. Much of that money was raised at two fundraisers with George and Amal Clooney in California, events that Sanders\u2019 campaign sought to turn into a liability for Clinton. Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said Monday that Clinton \u201chas always made it a priority to help Democrats up and down the ballot which is why we are proud to be helping to fund the coordinated campaign that will make up the heart of the Democratic organizing efforts for local, state and federal candidates this fall.\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign raised money off Clinton\u2019s fundraisers with Clooney, knocking the former secretary of state for headlining an event where the top ticket cost around $350,000. And Sanders supporters protested outside the event, including showering Clinton\u2019s motorcade in 1,000 single dollar bills. To date, according to the Clinton campaign, Hillary for America has raised $213.5 million in primary funds and more than $46 million for the DNC and state parties. A defiant Sanders has insisted he\u2019ll continue through California\u2019s June 7 primary in a bid to win \u2013 or at least carry as much influence as possible into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. His campaign said after April, it has received 7.4 million total contributions from 2.4 million individual donors, totaling $210 million. Donald Trump\u2019s new target: Bernie Sanders supporters It pointed out that his nearly $26 million April haul topped Clinton\u2019s $21 million in March. Clinton has not yet released her April numbers. \u201cWhat our campaign is doing is bringing millions of Americans into the political process,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, in a statement accompanying a news release announcing the April numbers. \u201cSanders is the candidate with the most energy and excitement,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cHe is the candidate with the best chance of winning in November. He is the candidate who is in the best position to bring a new generation of voters into the democratic process and restore the faith of working-class voters that we can have a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.\u201d There are 14 Democratic contests left in states and territories. Next up is Indiana on Tuesday. Last is the District of Columbia on June 14.",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump will fight it out in Indiana Trump will campaign with Indiana University basketball legend Bobby Knight It is fitting that Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich all find themselves at a crossroad in the primaries, with Indiana \u2013 The Crossroads of America \u2013 voting in just a week. The state\u2019s 57 delegates could decide whether Trump stomps to the 1,237 delegates he needs to secure the nomination. A Cruz victory here could send the nomination to a convention battle in July. And even Kasich, who has pulled out of the state, finds his long-shot bid hanging in the balance as he courts Indiana delegates behind the scenes. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Hoosier State: Indiana\u2019s rural and agricultural bent is undeniable. But the power of the Republican Party has long resided in the \u201cdoughnut counties\u201d that ring Indianapolis. Chief among them is Hamilton County, with the wealthy enclave of Carmel (whose mayor, Jim Brainard, is a state co-chair for Kasich.) But key populations in Boone, Hancock, Hendricks and Johnson counties make the center of the state the base of power. \u201cThe Region\u201d \u2013 the suburbs of Chicago in Northwest Indiana \u2013 are packed with well-heeled Republicans who commute into Chicago, some rural pockets and disaffected former Democrats. Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties embody the area, which is sometimes seen as an island unto itself, with Chicagoans barely recognizing it and Hoosiers considering it more Chicago than Indiana. The area itself is heavily Democratic, but two of the state\u2019s most powerful Republicans behind the scenes \u2013 Dan Dumezich and Bob Grand \u2013 hail from there. It is an essential stop for Republicans who want to raise any money. Fort Wayne and Allen and Huntington counties have a rich history in the conservative movement. The Dan Quayle Vice Presidential Museum is housed in Huntington, Indiana. Before he became a national punchline for misspelling \u201cpotato,\u201d Quayle was a rising star in Republican politics as a young,  conservative U.S. senator. His 1988 vice-presidential campaign was managed behind the scenes by then-Reagan aide Mitch Daniels and the remainder of Quayle\u2019s Senate term was filled a by a young congressman representing the area: Dan Coats. Exit polls: Wealth colors viewpoints in primary voters Northeast Indiana remains a home of stalwart Christian conservatives \u2013 including Rep. Marlin Stutzman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and the state lawmakers running to succeed him. This is very likely to be Cruz country. Just like the national party, Indiana\u2019s Republicans have been at a crossroads for more than four years, with members struggling to decide whether this is the party of former Gov. Mitch Daniels and former Sen. Dick Lugar or the party of Gov. Mike Pence and impassioned same-sex marriage battles. Daniels was even talked about as a GOP presidential nominee in 2011. Now the president of Purdue University, he had a strong influence on the 2016 field \u2013 Jeb Bush was a mentor, ally and friend, Scott Walker touted his talks with Daniels and Kasich was viewed as a like-minded executive. But with Kasich pulling out of Indiana, these \u201cDaniels Republicans\u201d \u2013 staunch on fiscal issues and lukewarm on social hot-buttons \u2013 appear to be left without a home heading into Tuesday. Cruz will hope to consolidate this group\u2019s support, but ideologically, they don\u2019t have much in common. For instance, Daniels famously called for a \u201ctruce\u201d on the social issues that Cruz makes a focal point of his campaign. The awkwardness of that fit was palpable at a state GOP dinner a week ago, where Cruz got a lukewarm reception. \u201cI think for Daniels Republicans the mood and temperament of the party over the last few years has been very frustrating,\u201d said Jennifer Hallowell, a veteran Indiana Republican consultant. \u201cIt can appear to be less solutions-oriented. Mitch Daniels\u2019 brand and his legacy was really built on solutions and focusing on priorities and working to unite us.\u201d Cruz\u2019s world of supporters is much more akin to Gov. Mike Pence, who represents the social and religious conservatives that placed Indiana at the center of a damaging firestorm last spring. First, they sought to place a gay marriage ban in the state constitution, drawing out that fight over four years before it was made moot by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Ted Cruz \u2018narrowing\u2019 vice-presidential shortlist Then, Pence signed a measure allowing businesses to turn away some LGBT customers if they cite religious concerns. But the backlash from businesses was intense. Comic Con threatened to leave the city, Salesforce threatened to pull its employees from Indiana and finally rumors surfaced the NCAA may pull the Final Four out of Indianapolis that year. Pence quietly backtracked, undoing the law. And this year, the state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature approved a law that restricts the reasons women can have abortions and mandates the burial or cremation of aborted fetuses. As if to underscore his allegiance with the cause, Cruz selected a top player in the religious conservative fights, Curt Smith, to be his chief delegate wrangler in Indiana. Indiana is speckled with manufacturing centers, which plays to one of Trump\u2019s great strengths: working class white voters. According to the latest U.S. Census figures, 23.6% of Indiana residents had earned a college degree or higher and the median income was almost $49,000. Auto manufacturing has long been a staple of the Indiana economy, but took a toll in the recession \u2013 the 2009 auto bailout has figured heavily in political contests since then. And Elkhart, Indiana, the center of the American RV industry, figured prominently in President Barack Obama\u2019s tour of the hardest hit areas across the nation in 2009. On the trail, and in his Super Tuesday victory speech, Trump has mentioned the video of workers being laid off at an Indianapolis Carrier air conditioning plant, an incident that has come to embody much of the raw anger of this election. Expect to hear more about these employees \u2013 members of the United Steelworkers \u2013 who could swing almost as easily from Bernie Sanders to Trump on issues where both have dominated: the economy and trade. Thirty of the 57 delegates will be given to the winner of the May 3 primary \u2013 committed to vote for that candidate for the first ballot. But the other 27 delegates will be awarded to the winner of each congressional district, three per district. This leaves the door open for someone like Kasich, who is highly unlikely to win the statewide ballot to sneak in a victory in the Indianapolis-centric 5th and 7th Districts. But because Indiana is not strictly proportional \u2013 handing out delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of votes \u2013 this makes the stakes for actually winning the primary outright much higher. More than half of the delegates are given to the winner, and winning a plurality or more virtually guarantees big wins in the congressional districts. Indiana isn\u2019t Wisconsin, the last Midwestern state where Cruz delivered a major blow to Trump. Local talk radio isn\u2019t as dominant, or resistant to Trump, and many of the state\u2019s influential Republicans are staying out of the presidential race. Locally, GOP insiders have been focused on a white-hot Senate race featuring Reps. Todd Young and Marlin Stutzman. Those races, plus Pence\u2019s tough rematch with Democrat John Gregg, has drained the deep pool of Republican talent in the state. Kasich nailed down the help of Anne Hathaway, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff, and Pete Seat, a former George W. Bush press hand. But then he dropped his bid to win the state. Cruz picked Smith \u2013 a prominent social conservative leader who is at times at odds with local Republican leaders \u2013 as his Indiana delegate wrangler. But he was forced to call in a state director from out of state. Trump\u2019s efforts are being led by a veteran Indiana lobbyist, Tony Samuel, and a former Republican Party chairman, Rex Early, an almost universally-liked figure among Indiana Republicans, but not an active player in more than two decades. Cruz has been quoting the movie \u201cHoosiers\u201d at stops periodically, and re-enacted a famous scene from the film at a rally Tuesday night. But Trump has one-upped him, enlisting iconic former Indiana University Basketball coach Bobby Knight to appear for him at a rally Wednesday. Hoosiers love basketball and Knight is an absolute legend in Indiana. He led the Indiana University Hoosiers to an undefeated season and NCAA championship 1976. They won two more national championships under his leadership in the 1980s. But his temper is as legendary as his coaching. In 1985 he threw a chair across the court in the middle of a game, and a former player alleged Knight choked him in 1997. He was eventually fired in 2000 after a student alleged he yanked his arm forcefully while lecturing him. Asked about any similarities between the two men, Republican consultant Jennifer Hallowell would only say, \u201cThey\u2019re winners.\u201d CNN\u2019s Robert Yoon contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "CNN spent a week visiting three Rust Belt cities Voters are fed up with the status quo and hungry for change The voters of the Rust Belt have shaken up the 2016 presidential campaign: Hoping to jolt a political system they see as ineffective and out of touch, they have repeatedly revolted by supporting unlikely, anti-establishment candidates. In both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, these voters see a potential for change they haven\u2019t felt in generations. They say they are willing to shed party allegiances and reimagine their priorities this year, even voting for a self-described democratic socialist, or for a flame-throwing real estate developer who has never served in government. In doing so, they have become the engine of one of the most extraordinary elections in modern U.S. history. CNN spent a week visiting three Rust Belt cities: Buffalo, New York; Youngstown, Ohio; and Erie, Pennsylvania. In nearly 30 in-depth interviews, voters in these economically depressed areas shared an unmistakable fascination with Trump and Sanders and their offbeat candidacies. They were willing to break out of their long-held voting patterns to back an unconventional choice. And Trump supporters expressed a raw anger at the idea that party leaders might try to deny him the nomination \u2014 a warning for establishment Republicans publicly challenging their front-runner. \u201cThe politicians that are going out of their way to destroy him \u2013 it\u2019s a very bad move,\u201d says Tim Wiles of Buffalo. \u201cThis is America; this is not Russia.\u201d Frustration with the economic and political system is especially strong in the Rust Belt, a section of the country in the Northeast and Midwest once at the heart of the United States\u2019 manufacturing boom. Decades after the decline of heavy industries like steel production and coal mining, the region continues to struggle with decaying infrastructure, population decline and high unemployment. Voters there are worried about economic stagnation and crime plaguing their communities. They are disappointed in Washington\u2019s elected officials. They are calling out for swift, radical change. But even among fans of Trump and Sanders, there are serious reservations \u2013 that Sanders may be too old and his ideas too \u201cout there,\u201d and that Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric turns off too many people. Among Democrats, there is a widely shared belief that Clinton, more than anyone else in the entire field, is best prepared to handle the immense responsibilities of the presidency. She notched a decisive win in New York and enjoys a commanding lead in Pennsylvania, which will hold its primary Tuesday. But passionate enthusiasm for the former secretary of state was difficult to come by during CNN\u2019s trip. There is also a pervasive mood of impatience and exhaustion with a political system the voters say is failing them. For every voter who is hopeful that 2016 could be the year of a political revolution, there is another who feels deeply pessimistic that anyone, including the populist outsiders on the right and left, can fix the broken system. Even as a new spate of attacks in Europe have heightened concerns about ISIS, many voters in the Rust Belt say they desperately want the next president to prioritize local issues like unemployment, crime and infrastructure over international concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s enough going on in the United States,\u201d is how one undecided Ohio voter, Carolyn Halverstadt, put it. Above all, many of these voters say they are still undecided \u2013 and willing to be persuaded. Overlooking Canada from the northeast corner of Lake Erie sits Buffalo, a former home to industrial heavyweights like Bethlehem Steel and a city of 258,703 now in the midst of a long fight for an economic comeback. Buffalo demonstrates Trump\u2019s remarkable appeal across the country to non-traditional Republican voters. Here, there are working- and middle-class voters, former supporters of President Barack Obama and individuals who have supported Democrats in the past now drawn to Trump\u2019s promise of dramatic change. In the First Ward of South Buffalo on the corner of Ohio and Michigan Avenues, there is a favorite spot among locals called the Swannie House. Wiles has owned the place for 33 years and sits on a stool in the corner of the bar every day, his feet elevated on the window sill because of a bad back. It\u2019s \u201cthe perfect corner because you hear everything,\u201d he says. These days, it seems everyone wants to talk about one thing: Donald Trump. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re black, you\u2019re green, you\u2019re white, you\u2019re a Martian with tentacles. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Wiles, 60, says. \u201cThey\u2019re all talking about Trump.\u201d Wiles is disgusted by how the election has unfolded so far, and is especially offended by Republican efforts to stop Trump from winning the nomination. \u201cIf the Republicans don\u2019t lay off this man, I will never vote Republican.\u201d Trump\u2019s broad appeal in places like Buffalo has helped make the New York real estate mogul and first-time political candidate into a presidential front-runner. Trump dominated the New York GOP primary last week, sweeping the entire state with the exception of Manhattan. In Erie County, where Buffalo is located, Trump won with 66% of the vote. Dan Ivancic is a 32-year-old born and raised in Tonawanda, a suburb north of Buffalo. Ivancic is a college dropout who says he has made a good living working at a lumber company located off the Buffalo River for nine years. He is old enough to remember what a ghost town Buffalo was after steel and grain mills closed all along the river. But over the last five years or so, the city\u2019s skyline has begun to change. New buildings are being constructed along the waterfront, an area Ivancic says he wasn\u2019t allowed to visit as a kid because it was unsafe. And with major investments in the University of Buffalo\u2019s medical school and SolarCity \u2013 the largest solar panel production facility in the Western Hemisphere \u2013 the city is aiming to attract tens of thousands of college-educated and younger workers. Ivancic, who backed Obama in 2008 and didn\u2019t participate in the 2012 election, voted for Trump last Tuesday. \u201cI know a lot of people think Trump\u2019s crazy,\u201d he says, \u201cbut he\u2019s different.\u201d \u201cI can respect what he\u2019s built and what he\u2019s achieved. He\u2019s a businessman and if you run our country like a business, it should run successfully,\u201d Ivancic adds. \u201cAnd I think he stands for change. He\u2019s tired of the same old, same old \u2013 just like everyone else.\u201d In East Buffalo, home to a sizeable Polish community, the Broadway Market is bustling ahead of Easter weekend. There are kiosks selling all kinds of treats: Italian pastries, freshly made Polish pierogis, jars of horse radish and pickles, and barrels filled with colorful Easter eggs. Here, Tony Krupski, who was born and raised in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga, represents a segment of the population that is less preoccupied with the economy. He and his wife were largely untouched by the manufacturing decline and the recent financial crisis. These days, he plays the accordion in his free time, performing in places like the Broadway Market and senior homes. The grandson of Polish immigrants, Krupski\u2019s overwhelming concern is national security. Just that morning, terrorist attacks in Belgium had killed dozens at the Brussels airport and a train station. Krupski, a registered Democrat who twice voted for Obama, is turning his back on the party this year. He plans to vote for Trump in November. \u201cIt seems like Donald Trump has a better idea of trying to tighten things up so this ISIS thing doesn\u2019t hurt people,\u201d Krupski says. But in last week\u2019s New York primary, Krupski voted for Sanders. For one, he didn\u2019t want to change his party affiliation: \u201cI vote for the person and not the party.\u201d Plus, Krupski doesn\u2019t want Clinton to get the Democratic nomination. \u201cWe have to go in another direction with the leadership for this country,\u201d he says. Still, there are grave concerns about Trump outside his white, working-class base, and fears that his election would unwind Buffalo\u2019s economic gains. Greg Carter, a Buffalo native who works in construction at the University of Buffalo\u2019s medical school, says he considered Trump \u201ca joke\u201d with dangerous ideas. \u201cIf he wins, we\u2019re done,\u201d says Carter, 57, who is black and voted for Clinton last week. Of black voters, Carter says, \u201cNone of them will vote for Trump.\u201d Downtown Youngstown looks like a booming college town. The streets are filled with Youngstown State University students, lined with restaurants and coffee shops that boast craft beers and fresh-squeezed juices sold in mini mason jars. Obama recently praised the Youngstown Business Incubator as a \u201cstate-of-the art\u201d lab helping to drive the country\u2019s high-tech boom. But away from the center of downtown, things get bleak \u2013 fast. Along the former industrial corridor of Steel Valley, giant structures that used to be steel mills are now rusting and vacant. There are abandoned homes all across the city, a reminder of the thousands of residents who fled the area in the 1970s and \u201980s when the mills shut down. Although Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate mirrors the national figure of 5%, it is much higher in Youngstown: 8.2%. Many residents here share a familiar complaint: the city\u2019s unemployed youth are restless because they don\u2019t have jobs, so they wander the streets and act out. Youngstown, with a population of around 65,000, saw a 28% increase in robbery during the second quarter of 2015 from the previous year, according to the Ohio Department of Public Safety. For Youngstown native Darlene Hood, the plight of the city overwhelms all other issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of killing going around. Lots. They\u2019re just about everywhere now,\u201d Hood says. She is one of the state\u2019s many undecided voters. Although Hood likes the idea of Clinton becoming the country\u2019s first woman president, she feels certain that none of the candidates can do much to help communities like hers. \u201cIt don\u2019t really matter to me because ain\u2019t nobody gonna help me no way, I help myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI gotta help myself. They ain\u2019t gonna get me no job, they ain\u2019t gonna feed me, they ain\u2019t gonna clothe me, they ain\u2019t gonna do anything for me.\u201d Hood, 61, has a small, wiry frame and moves quickly around the kitchen of a group home where she works on the north side of the city, making spaghetti on a recent Thursday afternoon. Here, she takes care of eight men with mental disabilities, whom she refers to as her \u201cclients\u201d with obvious affection. Like others born in the area in the middle of the 20th century, Hood is nostalgic for the city\u2019s glory days. The youngest of four kids \u2013 and the only girl \u2013 she says she had a happy childhood. Life had felt easy for her family when jobs were plentiful. But in 1965, her father died. In 1968, her family picked up and left Youngstown, after the murder of her uncle distressed her mother so badly that she couldn\u2019t bear to stay. In 1978, her mother died. In 1985, her brother was stabbed to death. Though haunted by these tragedies, Hood returned to Youngstown in the 1990s, a move she now says she regrets. \u201cI should have got out of here and never came back.\u201d As she takes a cigarette break on the front porch, Hood points out four houses across the street that she says are empty. Residents here constantly fret about the vacant homes, eyesores that reinforce the city\u2019s troubles. Ahead of the 2016 election, Youngstown\u2019s residents overwhelmingly say they want presidential candidates to focus on policies that can help cities like theirs. Youngstown Mayor John McNally, a Democrat, says plenty of his constituents are intrigued by Trump, particularly the candidate\u2019s forceful message on national security. But he feels strongly that those issues are second to Mahoning County\u2019s infrastructure problems, like deteriorating roads and the high price of water bills. \u201cThose are the things that I hear about the most,\u201d says McNally, who has not endorsed in the presidential election. Leroy Halverstadt, 68, is one of those residents. Recently laid off from a manufacturing company, Halverstadt says he\u2019s far more concerned about troubles at home than what is happening overseas, including ISIS\u2019 recent attacks in Europe. \u201cThere\u2019s enough going on in the United States,\u201d says Halverstadt. \u201cAll you have to look is Youngstown with the crime and the dope.\u201d His wife, Carolyn, is a likely Trump supporter. Although Ohio Gov. John Kasich won his state by double digits, Trump won Mahoning County by 13 points and Columbiana County, where the Halverstadts live, by nine points. Halverstadt did not vote in the primary and says he will likely vote for Clinton in the general election \u2013 somewhat grudgingly. He quips that he\u2019s bothered by \u201cBenghazi, emails, and all that stuff.\u201d \u201cEven though she lied and all that stuff, I think she knows more than (Trump) does,\u201d Halverstadt says. Going by the map, Mahoning County is Clinton country. She defeated Obama here in Ohio\u2019s 2008 primary, and Sanders in this year\u2019s March 15 primary. But even voters who are supporting Clinton here say they have their doubts. This lack of enthusiasm was a recurring theme among the Clinton supporters that CNN interviewed along the Rust Belt. Democrats largely view the former secretary of state as deeply qualified to serve in the White House. But her handling of Benghazi and her use of a private email server at the State Department have clearly affected how voters view her character. Mabel Neail, a 63-year-old African-American Youngstown native who twice voted for Obama, is a prime demographic target for the Clinton campaign. But Neail, sitting on her front porch on the south side of Youngstown on a street that is dotted with boarded-up homes, is one of the many voters toying with unconventional choices this year. \u201cI think she\u2019s a nice lady and everything. That\u2019s all I can say. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Neail, who didn\u2019t vote the primary, says about Clinton. Then her face brightens: \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you who I do like \u2013 what\u2019s his name \u2013 Barney?\u201d She is talking about Bernie Sanders. Neail is captivated by Sanders\u2019 promise of free college. Not all of her six children went to school, and she feels easier access to higher education is exactly what\u2019s needed to help steer the youth in a place like Youngstown away from crime. Neail says she\u2019s even willing to consider voting for a Republican for the first time this year. \u201cWe need a big change around here, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d she says. Spend a day talking to the residents of Erie \u2014 some 90 miles southwest of Buffalo \u2013 and you\u2019re likely to learn two things. First, the General Electric plant in Lawrence Park is laying off 1,500 workers. Second, Presque Isle was recently voted in USA Today as the number one freshwater beach in the country. Erie bled thousands of jobs over the years as manufacturing-based companies left the area, moving to the South or overseas in search of cheaper labor. Some of the city\u2019s residents are haunted by Erie\u2019s \u201cRust Belt\u201d label, and eager to leave that in the past. And they are increasingly turning their attention to areas around Presque Isle State Park and the bay front, pouring resources into the growing tourism and service sectors there. It\u2019s clear that the populist messages of Trump and Sanders have struck a chord here, as they have elsewhere in the region. But even among the residents who badly want to see change, there is a nagging sense that no candidate in the field is capable of anything beyond promises and lofty rhetoric. For all the appeal of the fire-breathing outsider candidates, there\u2019s still deep skepticism that either of them \u2013 Trump or Sanders \u2013 can actually deliver. Terri Eddy, a 45-year-old widow who works at a Fuel-n-Food next to a Shell gas station on Greengarden Boulevard, belongs to a segment of the city that feels hopeless and left behind. She is tired of having her bikes stolen and the chain in her yard cut, fed up with feeling scared to walk alone at night, and alarmed by what she says is a growing heroin epidemic in the area. Erie County had Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th highest rate of drug-related deaths in 2014, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. With a population of 278,000, it had 59 drug overdose-related deaths that year, according to the county coroner\u2019s office, and heroin was the leading cause. Eddy says she is unlikely to participate in the Pennsylvania primary because she is uninspired by the field of candidates. She questions whether any of them will address her hometown\u2019s plight. \u201cI believe when they get in, they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d she says. After saving up enough money to finally buy a car, Eddy is now just looking for the right opportunity to get out of town. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend nobody live here,\u201d she says. Sean Candela, also born and raised in Erie, runs a camping ground and restaurants at the entrance of Presque Isle. The 62-year-old says it\u2019s clear that both Trump and Sanders are giving voice to those in this community who feel disenfranchised \u2013 \u201cthe ones that feel like their voices aren\u2019t being heard.\u201d But Candela, who prefers not to share which candidate he is supporting to avoid upsetting customers, also doesn\u2019t totally buy it. \u201cThere\u2019s appeal, and there\u2019s reality. Can anybody in the system get a lot accomplished anymore?\u201d Over the past ten months, the residents of Erie have watched Trump with fascination. His rapid political rise, his colorful language and propensity to offend, along with his promises to build a wall and keep Muslims out of the country, are frequent topics of conversation at hair salons, gas stations and diners. As they take in the media\u2019s around-the-clock coverage of Trump, there is also mounting frustration for some residents here who feel Trump has turned the 2016 election into a political spectacle devoid of authentic policy prescriptions that can help communities like Erie. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the circus to quiet down and the real conversations to start happening,\u201d said Beth Zimmer, a 51-year-old Erie native who founded the non-profit Innovation Collaborative to foster start-ups in the area. \u201cAnd it\u2019s getting to be late for that, it seems.\u201d Barry Rider has worked at Liberty Iron and Metal Co. since 1976, overseeing a plant where metal scraps are collected, sorted, compressed and sent out to be recycled. The 65-year-old Erie native has watched the city\u2019s transformation, and remembers when industries like plastics, locomotive, and recycling thrived and fueled the city\u2019s economy. The last year has been particularly tough for his business. When things are good, his company has about 75 full-time workers and 10 temps. These days, he\u2019s down to about 45 workers \u2013 no temps, and no overtime pay. Rider is fiercely defensive of his city, citing its low cost of living and its proximity to several major urban centers. For all its flaws, it\u2019s a great place, he says, to raise a family. But Rider, who says he has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, sees no candidate with a convincing message on the most important issues: jobs and the economy. In Erie, he says, \u201cPeople need to work.\u201d Trump\u2019s promises to \u201cdo this and that\u201d ring hollow for Rider: \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do half the things he wants to do if he\u2019s elected.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The DNC chair said the suit aims to counter \"voter disenfranchisement\" Democratic lawmakers have claimed there were some primarily Latino neighborhoods that had no polling places The Democratic National Committee, along with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaigns, are suing the state of Arizona following complaints of voter suppression during the Arizona primary last month. Voters endured long waits to use one of Maricopa County\u2019s 60 polling stations last month. There were at least 200 polling stations in 2012, but Republican officials said they decreased the number to save money. Even after waiting in line for hours, some people were not allowed to vote. At least 20 Democratic voters contacted the Arizona Democratic Party to say that when they arrived at the polls, they were told that they were registered as Independents and therefore unable to vote in the closed primary. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Thursday that the lawsuit is \u201cto reverse Arizona\u2019s culture of voter disenfranchisement prior to the 2016 election.\u201d \u201cAs Democrats, we believe the right to vote is our most fundamental right \u2013 the right that defends all of our other rights. Democrats also know that when we see injustice, we must act,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. She added that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Ann Kirkpatrick\u2019s Senate campaign and the Arizona Democratic Party are parties in the lawsuit. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told CNN that the campaign also is joining the DNC in the lawsuit, and the Sanders campaign Thursday afternoon added its support. Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell are among the defendants. A spokeswoman for the state\u2019s attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But a spokeswoman for Purcell, a Republican, told CNN last week that there were no intentional efforts to keep people from voting. \u201cHelen\u2019s career has been focused on trying to make voting easier and more accessible. There was absolutely no way she tried to make it harder for voters to vote or to suppress anyone from voting,\u201d Elizabeth Bartholomew said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was just a huge miscalculation and a mistake. And we\u2019re moving forward and making changes to make sure that that never happens again.\u201d Democratic lawmakers have claimed there were some working-class and primarily Latino neighborhoods that had no polling places. \u201cThe Republican election officials who decided to reduce polling locations by 70% in order to cut costs later admitted they never considered the impact these actions would have on black, Hispanic or Native American communities. We know that actions like this \u2013 disregarding and disenfranchising thousands of voters \u2013 were easier because the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act,\u201d Schultz wrote. Historically, the Department of Justice had to approve any changes in voting procedure in Arizona because of the state\u2019s history of discrimination against minorities in voting. But a Supreme Court decision in 2013 allowed Arizona to begin making changes without federal oversight. Democratic officials have said if federal scrutiny had been required before making changes, the situation never would have happened. The Department of Justice requested additional information earlier this month from Purcell regarding the matter. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost Arizona to Clinton, called the situation \u201ca disgrace\u201d soon after the primary. \u201cIn the United States of America, democracy is the foundation of our way of life,\u201d the Democratic presidential hopeful said. \u201cAnd what happened in Arizona is a disgrace. I hope that every state in this country learns from that and learns how to put together a proper election where people can come in and vote in a timely manner and go back to work.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Frates contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama is vowing to do all he can to make sure a Democrat replaces him at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue So far, he has headlined 35 fundraisers since the 2014 midterm elections and he has already endorsed 10 candidates at the state level Expect to see a whole lot of President Barack Obama this campaign season as he works to spell out what he sees as the stakes in the 2016 election and tries to defend his legacy. As he approaches the end of his term in the midst of an election year that has been defined by heated, often controversial rhetoric coming from the leading Republican candidates, like GOP front-runner Donald Trump, the President is vowing to do all he can to make sure a Democrat replaces him at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He also wants to retake the Senate and win more seats in the House of Representatives. So far, he has headlined 35 fundraisers since the 2014 midterm elections and he has already endorsed 10 candidates at the state level, according to the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe President has been clear that as we get closer to the general election, it will become even more important that the American people understand what is at stake,\u201d said White House Deputy Press Secretary Jennifer Friedman. \u201cDo we continue to build on the policies that reward hard-working American families, advance our economic and national security, and address challenges for future generations, or do we stop in our tracks, reverse our progress and move in the wrong direction? This is a choice that the President does not take lightly, and is something he will lay out for the American people with increased frequency in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Obama has telegraphed his desire to play an active role both at home in Washington and on the stump, telling the crowd at an Dallas fundraiser last week he could not be prouder of what he has accomplished and, \u201cWe\u2019re going to run through the tape.\u201d He is eager to protect and defend his legacy, pointing to policies like the Affordable Care Act, his biggest domestic achievement, which he boasts has provided 20 million Americans with insurance coverage and which congressional Republicans have voted some 60 times to repeal. Republicans also fought vigorously against the Iran nuclear deal and many oppose his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, a move that will get a big boost when he becomes the first president to visit the island in almost 90 years this weekend. Trade deals, environmental and financial regulations are other accomplishments the President wants to protect. The fight over his Supreme Court nomination, with Senate Republicans vowing to block Merrick Garland, highlights the significance of regaining control, Obama said. \u201cWe got to have not just a Democratic president who can continue the legacy that we built together over the last 7\u00bd years, but we\u2019ve got to have a Senate that is a partner in this process,\u201d he told supporters in Dallas last weekend. \u201cAnd I can list a whole bunch of reasons for why that\u2019s so important. It turns out that because of the untimely death of Justice Scalia \u2013 and obviously we grieve for his family \u2013 but the behavior of the Senate since then, I think, gives you a pretty good reason of why we think the Senate is so important.\u201d Whomever the Democratic nominee is, they will need the backing of the broad coalition of young voters, blacks, Hispanics and women that then-Sen. Obama brought out in 2008. Democrats are banking on Obama\u2019s popularity: He has long polled well within his own party, and a recent Gallup Poll shows his approval rating nationwide has ticked up to 50%, far higher than his predecessor George W. Bush (32%) at the same time in his presidency. In fact, while Bush endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008, he did no campaign rallies that year, according to longtime CBS White House Correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps extensive records of presidential activities from golf outings to stump speeches. The move to use Obama frequently on the stump comes as data from the states that have held primaries and caucuses so far indicate a huge enthusiasm gap. Democratic turnout has fallen in several key states compared to 2008 \u2013 from low single digits in Illinois (2%) and Florida (3%) to even more troubling double-digit heights in Missouri (24%), North Carolina (30%) and Ohio (49%). Meanwhile, Republican voter turnout has jumped double digits in each of those states, rising some 75% in the must-win state of Ohio. Obama is already working to boost enthusiasm among Democrats, calling on them to \u201cget to work\u201d alongside him to ensure victory in November. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced that we will have a Democratic successor as president,\u201d the President said at a DNC fundraiser in Austin, Texas, last week. \u201cI believe we will take back the United States Senate. I think we will make real progress with respect to the House. But it depends on people feeling as if that can happen, and being engaged and working just as hard and just as full of hope as they did in 2008. And that\u2019s going to depend on me, but it\u2019s also going to depend on you. It\u2019s going to depend on each of us.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden will also stump for the Democratic nominee in states where he can be helpful, reprising the role he played in 2008 when he was dispatched to help woo white working-class voters in states like Pennsylvania, and he hopes to help Democrats retake the Senate, too, planning to attend events in Ohio and Washington state next week, according to his aides. The President has already been vocal about the tone of the presidential race so far, particularly on the Republican side, touting the need for inclusiveness rather than divisiveness in politics. \u201cThe longer that we allow the political rhetoric of late to continue and the longer that we tacitly accept it, we create a permission structure that allows the animosity in one corner of our politics to infect our broader society,\u201d he said on Capitol Hill this week. \u201cAnd animosity breeds animosity.\u201d And while Trump gets much of the attention, Obama has not limited his criticism to the bombastic billionaire, blasting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for saying he would carpet-bomb ISIS. READ: Is the GOP\u2019s stop Trump campaign too late? The President and first lady Michelle Obama voted absentee in the Illinois primary, but the White House declined to say for whom they cast their ballots. But officials have weighed in on a report in The New York Times that said the President privately told donors it was nearing the time when Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign would end and that the party must soon come together behind Hillary Clinton \u2013 a line seen as him putting his finger on the scale for Clinton. Press Secretary Josh Earnest vehemently denied the report. \u201cI was there for the fundraiser and I was there for the part where this conversation occurred,\u201d Earnest said Thursday. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll just say in general is that President Obama made a case that would be familiar to all of you, which is that as Democrats move through this competitive primary process, we need to be mindful of the fact that our success in November in electing a Democratic president will depend on the commitment and ability of the Democratic Party to come together behind our nominee. And the President did not indicate or specify a preference in the race.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d Earnest continued, \u201cthe President pointed out something that he\u2019s pointed out to all of you, which is that both of the Democrats who are running, because they have demonstrated an understanding and a commitment to building on the progress that we\u2019ve made thus far, would be far better presidents than anybody that\u2019s been put up on the Republican side.\u201d",

            "article_content": "TAPPER: Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate. For our viewers in the United States and around the world, welcome to Miami Florida, I\u2019m Jake Tapper. TAPPER: In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically. Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They\u2019re a winner-take-all state. So that\u2019s the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting. We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America. So now let\u2019s welcome the candidates. Ohio Governor John Kasich. (APPLAUSE) Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. (APPLAUSE) Real estate developer and businessman Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) Before we begin this evening, we want to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan, who passed away this week. Her funeral will be held tomorrow and we would like to take a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan. (MOMENT OF SILENCE) Now, please rise for our national anthem performed by the Frost Singers from the University of Miami. (STAR SPANGLED BANNER) (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thanks to the Frost Singers from the University of Miami. Candidates, you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules. As moderator, I will attempt to guide the discussion, asking questions and followups. Joining me in the questioning this evening will be Washington Times reporter Stephen Dinan, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, and Salem Radio\u2019s Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. That\u2019s longer than you\u2019ve had in previous debates. Timing lights will be visible. Those lights will warn you when time is up. And as you requested, a bell will also sound, like this. (BELL SOUND) We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another. These are the rules to which all of you agreed. Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues. It\u2019s time now for opening statements. You\u2019ll each have 30 seconds. Governor Kasich, we will start with you. KASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states. And I believe it\u2019s a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we\u2019ve ever had. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio? RUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what\u2019s at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What\u2019s at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people. RUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth. This election, this debate is not about insults. It\u2019s not about attacks. It\u2019s not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It\u2019s about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they\u2019re voting. They\u2019re voting out of enthusiasm. They\u2019re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before. We\u2019re taking people from the Democrat Party. We\u2019re taking people as independents, and they\u2019re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It\u2019s very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we\u2019re going to beat them soundly. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you. Let\u2019s begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s, the front runner\u2019s, signature issues is ending what he calls \u201cdisastrous trade deals\u201d in order to bring jobs back to America. Governor Kasich, I\u2019d like to start with you. You\u2019ve been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America\u2019s bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you\u2019ve been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class? KASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we\u2019re sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it. But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I\u2019ve been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don\u2019t turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \u201cOh, America was right,\u201d and people are out of work. The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker. But we don\u2019t want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don\u2019t want to see that happen. Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they\u2019re a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up. And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you\u2019ve brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico. Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I\u2019m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\u2019re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it\u2019s very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they\u2019re the laws. But I\u2019m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you\u2019re, quote, \u201cgenerally very much in favor of free trade.\u201d More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs? RUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We\u2019re 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. The problem is we\u2019re a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can\u2019t export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world. There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It\u2019s allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it\u2019s created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia. On the other hand, you\u2019ve seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don\u2019t like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years? CRUZ: Actually that\u2019s incorrect. There are two different agreements. There\u2019s TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we\u2019re getting killed in international trade right now. And we\u2019re getting killed because we have an administration that\u2019s doesn\u2019t look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We\u2019re driving jobs overseas. And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I\u2019ll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well. And you\u2019ve got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what\u2019s the solution? It\u2019s easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things. Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I\u2019ve introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Let\u2019s talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let\u2019s go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen. DINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn\u2019t this program take jobs away from Americans? RUBIO: If it\u2019s being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you\u2019re not replacing Americans, but that you\u2019ve tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again. The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don\u2019t understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company. What they\u2019re basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they\u2019re employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it. It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future. DINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this. (APPLAUSE) You\u2019ve - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you\u2019ve called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured. RUBIO: Correct. DINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you\u2019ve talked about are solved. RUBIO: Well first, I think - well, I\u2019d be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don\u2019t think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American. If there\u2019s an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that\u2019s in violation of the law. And what I\u2019m explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job. They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn\u2019t replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they\u2019re hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It\u2019s a loophole they\u2019ve figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \u201clower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\u201d. He\u2019s calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn\u2019t that help workers in the U.S.? KAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn\u2019t be standing here. I\u2019d be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn\u2019t have immigration. Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can\u2019t have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration. I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can\u2019t continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home. And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget. We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we\u2019ll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I\u2019ve used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I\u2019ve been governor DINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like. TRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it\u2019s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it\u2019s very important to say, well, I\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it\u2019s sitting there waiting for you, but it\u2019s very bad. It\u2019s very bad for business in terms of - and it\u2019s very bad for our workers and it\u2019s unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read. And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what\u2019s going on. We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we\u2019re rushing into things, and we\u2019re just - we\u2019re leading with the chin. (BELL RINGS) We\u2019re leading with people that don\u2019t know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I\u2019d say a minimum of one year, maybe two years. DINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be? CRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we\u2019re bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn\u2019t working. And then on top of that, we\u2019ve got a system that\u2019s allowing in millions of people to be here illegally. And the answer to that, I\u2019ve laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We\u2019re going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We\u2019re going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we\u2019re going to do that. We\u2019re going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: We\u2019re going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how to do it. It\u2019s that we\u2019re lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this. The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor. CRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in? RUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren\u2019t actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system. The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don\u2019t have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I\u2019m grateful every day that America welcomed them. But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don\u2019t have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading. Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core? TRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don\u2019t want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great. And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is\u2026 (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well. So there are a lot of things. But I\u2019m going to have Ben very involved with education, something that\u2019s an expertise of his. TAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say \u201ceducation by Washington, D.C.,\u201d what do you mean? TRUMP: You\u2019re right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what\u2019s happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases. Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you? KASICH: Well, look, all I\u2019m in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I\u2019ve been working on this for many, many years. Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs. Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be. So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That\u2019s what it is in the state of Ohio. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it\u2019s local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What\u2019s wrong with that? CRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it\u2019s easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core. Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that. (APPLAUSE) Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments. And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Let\u2019s move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they\u2019re very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations. Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash. BASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut? RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you\u2019re right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I\u2019m against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don\u2019t have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\u201d they\u2019re not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I\u2019m supposed to retire, I\u2019d have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I\u2019d be one of the youngest people there. (LAUGHTER) If I\u2019ve made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now. These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits? RUBIO: Well, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer that part. So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time. But again I\u2019m talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We\u2019re years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don\u2019t have to change it at all. If we don\u2019t do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It\u2019s not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt. That\u2019s - all of it will be eaten up by that. That\u2019s a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, you don\u2019t want to raise the retirement age, and you also don\u2019t want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening? TRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I\u2019ve watched them very intensely, even though it\u2019s a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They\u2019re leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we\u2019re up against. I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant. TRUMP: And it\u2019s my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is. You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It\u2019s not long in terms of what we\u2019re talking about, but it\u2019s still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP\u2026 I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody\u2019s ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it\u2019s a - it\u2019s a national tragedy. We\u2019re at zero, we\u2019re not doing anything. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost everything. We\u2019re losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We\u2019re going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You\u2019re talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you\u2019re talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million? TRUMP: Because they don\u2019t cover most of the subjects. We\u2019re the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We\u2019re going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We\u2019re going to negotiate real deals now, and we\u2019re going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We\u2019re going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security? RUBIO: No. And I - and I think you\u2019ve outlined why. The numbers don\u2019t add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we\u2019re going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that\u2019s the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can\u2019t talk about that, but people know that it\u2019s the truth here in Florida. Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let\u2019s wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won\u2019t add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I\u2019m against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it\u2019s less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don\u2019t add up. The bottom line is we can\u2019t just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I\u2019m going to get at fraud and abuse. Let\u2019s get rid of fraud, let\u2019s get rid of abuse, let\u2019s be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you\u2019re going to have to make up. And here\u2019s the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It\u2019s barely been asked in any of these debates. And we\u2019d better deal with or we\u2019re going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don\u2019t add up. What\u2019s your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don\u2019t add up. What\u2019s your response, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s saying that. Look, I\u2019m just saying very simply we have a country that I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I\u2019ve been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don\u2019t bid things out. We don\u2019t bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don\u2019t go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That\u2019s what they\u2019re paying. And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don\u2019t bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it\u2019s not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don\u2019t want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK? I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don\u2019t want anybody\u2019s money. I will tell you something. We\u2019re going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We\u2019re going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal? CRUZ: Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it\u2019s irresponsible. And any politician that doesn\u2019t step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we\u2019ve got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can\u2019t just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions. It\u2019s like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she\u2019ll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn\u2019t understand government is the problem. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Here\u2019s my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 Washington right now who are killing jobs and I\u2019ll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them. BASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue? CRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there\u2019s a reason, in my campaign I\u2019ve laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I\u2019ve specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don\u2019t do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let\u2019s talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can\u2019t take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn\u2019t do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare. (BELL RINGS) If we\u2019re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you\u2019ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I\u2019ll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump, would you like to respond? TRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and - at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change. BASH: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It\u2019s easy to have language, I\u2019m fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it\u2019s very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington. When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: When I led the fight against amnesty, it\u2019s because I was standing with the people\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 against Washington. And if you want to tell people you\u2019re going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington? BASH: OK. Mr. Trump, I\u2019ll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I\u2019m going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead. TRUMP: Well, that\u2019s fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there\u2019s no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there\u2019s nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me. And there\u2019s nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re going to come up with solutions. We\u2019re going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it\u2019s been up here. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Governor Kasich, let\u2019s get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, \u201cGet over cuts to Social Security benefits\u201d because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution? KASICH: Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous. KASICH: I have a plan to fix it that doesn\u2019t even require raising the retirement age. If you\u2019ve had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you\u2019ll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they\u2019ll get their full benefit. That\u2019s the way it will work. And we don\u2019t have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I\u2019ve done all this before. This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century. So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we\u2019re $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again. And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Let\u2019s take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition. How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016? TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it\u2019s, again, the biggest story. You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that\u2019s trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs. You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that\u2019s that. But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don\u2019t do it because we don\u2019t play the game. and the only way we\u2019re going to be able to do it is we\u2019re going to have to do taxes unless they behave. If you don\u2019t tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we\u2019re going to continue to lose businesses and we\u2019re going to continue to lose jobs. And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that\u2019s why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I\u2019m saying. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz\u2026 (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: \u2026 Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision? CRUZ: Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He\u2019s right about the problems. But his solutions don\u2019t work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019ll be tonight. But I\u2019ll tell you what happens. You know, we\u2019ve seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression. And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs. A much better solution that works is the tax plan I\u2019ve laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that\u2019s what\u2019s missing from what Donald says. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump, we\u2019ll give you a chance to respond. TRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don\u2019t behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can\u2019t. China won\u2019t let them. We talk about free trade. It\u2019s not tree free trade, it\u2019s stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can\u2019t get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can\u2019t get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax. The 45 percent is a threat that if they don\u2019t behave, if they don\u2019t follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn\u2019t have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It\u2019s not China that pays the tax. It\u2019s you, the working men and women. So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can\u2019t pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to jack - I\u2019m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.\u201d That hurts you. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America. TAPPER: OK. TRUMP: Jake, I have to say - honestly, it\u2019s just the opposite. What will happen if they don\u2019t behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we\u2019ll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we\u2019re being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now. So we\u2019ll build our factories here and we\u2019ll make our own products. And that\u2019s the way it should be done. And the way we\u2019ve been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble. It\u2019s a bubble and it\u2019s going to explode, believe me. TAPPER: All right. We\u2019re going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we\u2019ll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, \u201cIslam hates us?\u201d Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims. TRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them. DINAN: Do you want to clarify the comment at all? TRUMP: Well, you know, I\u2019ve been watching the debate today. And they\u2019re talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There\u2019s something going on that maybe you don\u2019t know about, maybe a lot of other people don\u2019t know about, but there\u2019s tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s comment last night, I\u2019m sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree? RUBIO: Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can\u2019t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It\u2019s a very tough place to be a missionary. It\u2019s Muslim. And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn\u2019t like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There\u2019s no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world. I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you\u2019re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you\u2019re going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be. DINAN: Mr. Trump? (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we\u2019ve had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems. Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don\u2019t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad. (BELL RINGS) Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn\u2019t that wonderful. DINAN: Mr. Trump, thank you. TRUMP: We better solve the problem before it\u2019s too late. DINAN: Senator Rubio? (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Well, here we go. See, I\u2019m not interested in being politically correct. I\u2019m not interested in being politically correct. I\u2019m interested in being correct. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And in order to be correct on this issue, here\u2019s the bottom line. We do work. There is - Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people. There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with Muslims, who do not - who are not radicals. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Saudis. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We\u2019re going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS. (BELL RING) RUBIO: It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them. And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization. TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us? KASICH: No, I don\u2019t. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn\u2019t any question. And that\u2019s why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don\u2019t have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we\u2019re going to defeat ISIS, we\u2019re going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states. And we\u2019re going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just - they can\u2019t believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith. Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we\u2019re about and other Muslims who don\u2019t share their view. But at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you\u2019ve said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, \u201ctake out\u201d the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, \u201cSo they can kill us, but we can\u2019t kill them?\u201d It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law? TRUMP: Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting \u201cdeath to the USA.\u201d Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me. As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law - this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn\u2019t allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we\u2019re working on a different set of parameters. Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad. We better expand our laws or we\u2019re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists? RUBIO: No, of course not. And we don\u2019t have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I\u2019m president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They\u2019re going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists. And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because - because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He\u2019s going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we\u2019ve ever had. We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they\u2019re not going to have the right to remain silent. And they\u2019re not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They\u2019re going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we\u2019ll do so legally. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists? CRUZ: No, of course not. We\u2019ve never targeted innocent civilians and we\u2019re not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we\u2019ve faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening. But the answer is not simply to yell, \u201cChina bad, Muslims bad.\u201d You\u2019ve got to understand the nature of the threats we\u2019re facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them. CRUZ: And I\u2019ll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that\u2019s a mistake. The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I\u2019ll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don\u2019t think we need a commander in chief\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. we\u2019re going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, \u201csort of a neutral guy\u201d. He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student. He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks. TRUMP: First of all, there\u2019s nobody on this stage that\u2019s more pro Israel than I am. OK. There\u2019s nobody. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I am pro-Israel. (BOOING) TRUMP: I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I\u2019ve made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of - I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: But I will tell you, I think if we\u2019re going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I\u2019ve spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is - I\u2019m a negotiator. If I go in, I\u2019ll say I\u2019m pro-Israel and I\u2019ve told that to everybody and anybody that would listen. But I would like to at least have the other side think I\u2019m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it\u2019s probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done. HEWITT: Senator Trump\u2026 (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it\u2019s maybe the world deal I\u2019ve ever seen. I think it\u2019s the worst deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they\u2019ve ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken. HEWITT: Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio. CRUZ: You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they\u2019re our strongest ally in the region. We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization. They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad. Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio. CRUZ: He\u2019s hunting them down and stomping them. HEWITT: Thank you. CRUZ: Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe. HEWITT: I want to go back to the Israeli government\u2019s assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree. RUBIO: Well, that\u2019s undeniable. First of all, they\u2019ve said, they\u2019ve encouraged people to do so. And you\u2019ve seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they\u2019re doing these sorts of things. But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don\u2019t know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that\u2019s not your intent but here\u2019s why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn\u2019t. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Because there\u2019s no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that\u2019s what will happen again. These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory. (BELL RINGS) So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, and then I\u2019ll come to you Senator Kasich. RUBIO: And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel\u2019s enemies. HEWITT: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump a response and then we\u2019ll go to Governor Kasich. TRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look. But I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it\u2019s tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel. And some believe it\u2019s possible. It may not be, in which case we\u2019ll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do. HEWITT: Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence? KASICH: Well, there\u2019s no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in? Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you\u2019re familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They\u2019re coming at them from above, they\u2019re trying to come at them under the ground. And I just have to tell you this, I don\u2019t believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it\u2019s going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix - to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq. From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here\u2019s the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war? CRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that\u2019s needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we\u2019re not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We\u2019re not using our overwhelming air power. We\u2019re not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out. But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I\u2019m glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back. They\u2019re not able to fight. They\u2019re not able to defend themselves. They\u2019re not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that\u2019s what needs to be done, will you follow their advice? KASICH: Hugh, I\u2019ve said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I\u2019m going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years. We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer - is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground. And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be \u201cshock and awe\u201d in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that\u2019s what it takes. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, more troops? TRUMP: We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice. HEWITT: How many\u2026 (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I\u2019m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we\u2019re not allowed to fight. We can\u2019t fight. We\u2019re not knocking out the oil because they don\u2019t want to create environmental pollution up in the air. I mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we\u2019re kidding. They didn\u2019t want to knock out the oil because of what it\u2019s going to do to the carbon footprint. We don\u2019t fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re doing. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts. Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate. What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need? RUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that\u2019s struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He\u2019s struggling with the V.A. The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, \u201cCalls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.\u201d Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen - one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died. People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I\u2019ll give him credit - Bernie Sanders was a part of this - we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren\u2019t doing a good job. Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn\u2019t working. The problem is no one\u2019s being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one\u2019s been fired for no outreach. No one\u2019s been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one\u2019s been disciplined. No one\u2019s been demoted. When I\u2019m president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill. Should veterans\u2019 benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit? KASICH: I don\u2019t - I haven\u2019t seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one. Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans. And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans\u2019 service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job. And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they\u2019re our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. (APPLAUSE) Let\u2019s turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba. Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let\u2019s go back to my colleague Dana Bash. BASH: Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong? RUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime. It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They\u2019ll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people. There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that\u2019s changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently. And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body. He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It\u2019s harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said? TRUMP: Well, I don\u2019t really agree with President Obama. I think I\u2019m somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don\u2019t make good deal. We don\u2019t have our right people negotiating, we have people that don\u2019t have a clue. As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody\u2019s talking about it and they\u2019ll end up signing a deal and then we\u2019ll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion. All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don\u2019t want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don\u2019t agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place. After 50 years, it\u2019s enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that\u2019s going to happen. This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it\u2019s got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal. BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them? TRUMP: I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba\u2019s favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba\u2019s favor. It the same way as the Iran deal. We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give. BASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana. TRUMP: I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It\u2019s the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don\u2019t have to close it that way. Second of all, I don\u2019t know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they\u2019re going to lose. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I\u2019ll tell you what the good deal now, it\u2019s already codified. Here\u2019s a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That\u2019s a good deal. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba? CRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. There\u2019s a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they\u2019re doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn\u2019t be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. (APPLAUSE) CUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it\u2019s got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it\u2019s a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated. So don\u2019t try to put it on me like it\u2019s wonderful, like I love it. BASH: Senator Cruz, your response? CRUZ: Well, look. I\u2019ll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry. CRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don\u2019t just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us. We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 understands and doesn\u2019t give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don\u2019t negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don\u2019t come back early - three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I\u2019ve ever seen, by the way. If they don\u2019t come back early, I was saying don\u2019t negotiate. They come back early. What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster. Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States. BASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let\u2019s refocus this back on Cuba. Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama\u2019s policy in Cuba that we\u2019ve been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba? KASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don\u2019t support us, we can\u2019t figure out where you are. You won\u2019t arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile. And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there\u2019s a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake. You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here\u2026 (APPLAUSE) KASICH: \u2026 and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don\u2019t own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we\u2019ll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid. We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us. We\u2019re not rattling a sword. You\u2019re not our enemy but we\u2019re not going to put up with this nonsense any longer. And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world. (BELL RINGS) When I\u2019m president, they\u2019re going to know exactly where we are because we\u2019re coming back. TAPPER: Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we\u2019re discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening. Mayor Regalado told me, quote, \u201cClimate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It\u2019s an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?\u201d Unquote. Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it? RUBIO: Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: There\u2019s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it? So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it\u2019s caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation. And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there\u2019s no such thing. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he\u2019s forcing down our throats on the war on coal. Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living. RUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it\u2019s more expensive to do business here than anywhere else. And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy. TAPPER: So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he\u2019s saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change. When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he\u2019s wrong? RUBIO: I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons. One, because America is not a planet. It\u2019s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here\u2019s what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here\u2019s what he\u2019s going to immediately going to start hearing from. He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami? KASICH: Well, I - I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don\u2019t think it has to be a, you know, either you\u2019re for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you\u2019re not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both. In our state, we\u2019ve reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we\u2019re trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power. And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don\u2019t know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world. So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, \u201cforeigners of the world looking at this are distressed.\u201d Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States? CRUZ: Of course it does. And we\u2019ve seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks. Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I\u2019ll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, \u201cit is hard to be friends with America; we can\u2019t count on America; America doesn\u2019t stand with us.\u201d And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we\u2019ve seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight. It\u2019s worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. (APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That\u2019s why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. TAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China\u2019s massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you\u2019ve said: \u201cWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\u201d How do you respond\u2026 TRUMP: That doesn\u2019t mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn\u2019t mean at all I was endorsing it. As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m endorsing Putin. TAPPER: But the word strong obviously is a compliment\u2026 (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: \u2026 and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities. TRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And strong doesn\u2019t mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don\u2019t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact. TAPPER: Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think? KASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. (APPLAUSE) KASICH: Now I will tell you, I don\u2019t believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he\u2019s doing, number one. Number two, they need to realize they don\u2019t own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we\u2019re going to have to beef up the cyber command. And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will. And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can\u2019t manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. We\u2019re going to take another quick break. When we come back, we\u2019ll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies. Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, \u201cthis kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.\u201d Do you believe that you\u2019ve done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged? TRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people - you\u2019ve seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest - in some cases - you know, you\u2019re mentioning one case, which I haven\u2019t seen, I heard about it, which I don\u2019t like. But when they see what\u2019s going on in this country, they have anger that\u2019s unbelievable. They have anger. They love this country. They don\u2019t like seeing bad trade deals, they don\u2019t like seeing higher taxes, they don\u2019t like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know - I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There\u2019s also great love for the country. It\u2019s a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake. TAPPER: Some of your critics point to quotes you\u2019ve made at these debates - at these rallies including February 23rd, \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d referring to a protesters. February 27th, \u201cin the good ol\u2019 days, they\u2019d have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\u201d February 1st, \u201cknock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\u201d (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don\u2019t mind. But doing serious damage. And if they\u2019ve got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something. And it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s usually the municipal government, the police because I don\u2019t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It\u2019s usually the police - and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. (APPLAUSE) So we should pay - we should truly give our police. They\u2019re incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election? CRUZ: Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we\u2019re working for. You know, we\u2019ve seen for seven years a president who believes he\u2019s above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he\u2019s working for the American people. And let me - let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y\u2019all feel disrespected by Washington? (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Washington isn\u2019t listening to the people. And that\u2019s the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald\u2019s rallies recently, he\u2019s taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him. Now, I got to say to me, I think that\u2019s exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And the only hand raising I\u2019m interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the\u2026 (BELL RINGS) \u2026 bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States. TAPPER: Thank you senator. Mr. Trump, if you\u2019d like to respond. TRUMP: It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having - on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we\u2019re talking and I\u2019m saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you\u2019re going to vote for Donald Trump? Everyone\u2019s laughing, we\u2019re all having a good time. That\u2019s why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: But we\u2019re all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many. Because when you look at it, everyone\u2019s smiling, laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany. (BELL RINGS) It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I\u2019ve had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that - what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party\u2019s chances in November? KASICH: Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean, it\u2019s - you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters. Jake, here\u2019s what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They\u2019re worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they\u2019re out of work and they\u2019re 54 years old and they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get another job, a man and a woman. Maybe they\u2019re worried about a trade deal. They\u2019re worried about the fact that their wages haven\u2019t gone up. They\u2019re worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great. They went to college, they rang up debt and they\u2019re still living in their parents\u2019 basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they\u2019re going to lose their Social Security. There\u2019s two ways to treat it. You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we\u2019re Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems. We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy. (BELL RINGS) And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I\u2019ll give them the power to do it. TAPPER: Thank you governor. Senator Rubio? I know you want to say something. RUBIO: I do. A couple of points. The first is, I\u2019m concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us. On the issue of anger. Yes, people are angry. Of course they\u2019re angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history. My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon. (BELL RINGS) You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation. TAPPER: Thank you senator. RUBIO: And embrace all of the principles that made us great. TAPPER: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention. Let\u2019s go back to Salem Radio\u2019s Hugh Hewitt. HEWITT: Thank you Jake. Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention. If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates. Why shouldn\u2019t the person with the most delegates, even if it\u2019s not a majority of delegates, be the nominee? KASICH: Well, first of all, let\u2019s not - you know, math doesn\u2019t tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what\u2019s true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK. KASICH: If you got an 86, you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn\u2019t mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee. And frankly, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get a convention like that. But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first. And we were healed as a party. So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee? And if so, would you support that person? TRUMP: I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever - first of all, I think I\u2019m going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let\u2019s see what happens. (APPLAUSE) But if somebody doesn\u2019t have the delegates, and I guess there\u2019s two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if - no, that\u2019s just - by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism. That\u2019s just a mathematical fact. OK? If two of us get up there, I would say this, if - if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That\u2019s what I think. HEWITT: Senator Cruz, if you - if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election? CRUZ: Well, look, there are some folks in Washington\u2026 TRUMP: Make me president. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. (APPLAUSE) You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. (APPLAUSE) It\u2019s one of the reasons why in the course of this election - listen, everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself. At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him. And so for the people at home, if you\u2019re one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins. That\u2019s why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you\u2019ve supported other candidates, come and join us. We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It\u2019s why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It\u2019s why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let\u2019s stand together and let\u2019s beat Hillary Clinton in November. HEWITT: All right. Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio. TRUMP: You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he\u2019s always saying, \u201cI\u2019m the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him.\u201d But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. (APPLAUSE) And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted. The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week, I get better and better. And believe me, I haven\u2019t even started on her yet. HEWITT: Senator Rubio? RUBIO: Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what\u2019s about for me. On Tuesday night, I didn\u2019t do as well, obviously, as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home. And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There\u2019s a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says \u201cMarco Rubio.\u201d RUBIO: Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves (APPLAUSE) That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day - (APPLAUSE) \u2026 because this election is too important. What\u2019s at stake is the future of this country. And I believe - I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I\u2019ve always believed that God has blessed America, that God\u2019s hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Let\u2019s send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen? DINAN: Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors. Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election? TRUMP: I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I\u2019m turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don\u2019t know if I get any credit for it but I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. And other than - and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it\u2019s not a large amount. No, I\u2019m self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I\u2019ve been in this business a long time and I was on the other side - until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing. I will say this - people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don\u2019t want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I\u2019m going to do the right thing. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to come to you. The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns. Do you deny that those big donors do have influence? CRUZ: Well look, absolutely. And one of the things we\u2019re so frustrated about is the corruption, what I\u2019ve called the Washington cartel. It\u2019s career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he\u2019s been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change. But the interesting point is tonight he hasn\u2019t pointed to a single special interest he\u2019s willing to take on. He didn\u2019t take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won\u2019t take on ethanol. And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country. DINAN: Thank you, Senator. I want to go to Mr. Trump\u2026 CRUZ: $62 at tedcruz.org. DINAN: \u2026 for a response. Thank you, Senator. CRUZ: That\u2019s who you\u2019ve got to be accountable to, the people. TRUMP: Ted was given to PACs. I mean, PACs - you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks. Very corrupt. It\u2019s going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one. It\u2019s very important to do that. There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I\u2019m the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I\u2019ve always made large contributions. And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I\u2019m the only one up here that\u2019s going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong. DINAN: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question. At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible. With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren\u2019t willing to show flexibility? RUBIO: Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn\u2019t be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that. Listen, on the issue of higher education, I\u2019m the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan. The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a - on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped - that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis. RUBIO: But I also want to be frank. There are issues we\u2019re going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that\u2019s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that\u2019s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that\u2019s probably not going to be bipartisan. There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: All right. Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence. What are some of the other issues on which you\u2019re willing to show flexibility? TRUMP: It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O\u2019Neill, speaker. And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully. Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O\u2019Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint. And I\u2019ll tell you this, it can be done. We don\u2019t want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there\u2019s total, absolute gridlock. DINAN: Thank you. I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir. KASICH: Well, look, my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I\u2019ve done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare, I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor. My problem isn\u2019t that people don\u2019t know this. They say, well, what does that mean? Does that mean you\u2019re too easy? Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government. In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side. One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I\u2019ve done it and I\u2019ll do it again. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. We have time for one last break. We\u2019ll be right back after this. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: And we\u2019re back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections. It is time now for closing statements. Candidates, you will each have one minute. And we\u2019ll start with Governor Kasich. KASICH: Well, I\u2019d like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision. And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States. Sometimes being positive isn\u2019t all that interesting, but it\u2019s very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign. I can fix the problems in Washington, I\u2019ve done it before. And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together. Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That\u2019s where the spirit and strength of America is. But ask the people - my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote. God bless. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: It\u2019s great to be here, back at home in Miami. It\u2019s hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country. But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off. And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I\u2019m telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I\u2019m elected president, this generation will do it\u2019s part. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz. CRUZ: What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support. CRUZ: In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you? I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, \u201cMadam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future.\u201d We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe. That\u2019s the choice I will put to her this fall. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Thank you very much. The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it\u2019s never known before. They\u2019re coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again. These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you\u2019re going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover. It will take centuries to recover. So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate. We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching. I\u2019m Jake Tapper. Our coverage continues right now with Anderson Cooper. Anderson? END ###",

            "article_content": "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's strength with conservative voters will match up against Donald Trump's edge among working-class whites and Bible Belt Evangelicals Democrats, meanwhile, also caucus in Nebraska and hold a primary in Louisiana -- plus another caucus in Kansas Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s strength with conservative voters will match up against Donald Trump\u2019s edge among working-class whites and Bible Belt Evangelicals as four states hold their Republican contests on Saturday. The two could get more distance on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Republicans have four contests on tap: Caucuses in Kansas, Kentucky and Maine, and a primary in Louisiana. FULL ELECTION RESULTS Democrats, meanwhile, also caucus in Nebraska and hold a primary in Louisiana \u2013 plus another caucus in Kansas. The results could shape the debate Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are set to have Sunday night on CNN. Here\u2019s what to watch on what\u2019s sure to be a Super Saturday \u2013 with a few notes on the Maine Democratic caucuses and the Puerto Rico Republican primary that follow on Sunday, as well: Saturday\u2019s contests offer Cruz one major tactical advantage. A crucial component of Trump\u2019s strength has been his ability to expand the Republican electorate \u2013 shattering turnout records in states like Virginia and bringing into the fold \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d in northern states. But those contests were open. To participate, registered voters don\u2019t have to be registered members of the GOP \u2013 they could just walk in on election day. Did Ted Cruz wait too long to oppose Donald Trump? Republicans have held four contests that were closed: Iowa, Nevada, Oklahoma and Alaska. And Cruz, not Trump, won three of the four. The most important factor to keep in mind Saturday: Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Maine\u2019s contests are all closed. That makes Saturday an immediate test of Cruz\u2019s long-term viability. If he can win as many states as Trump, it\u2019ll bolster his argument that he is the logical alternative to the front-runner \u2013 particularly if those two are the day\u2019s only winners. She\u2019s already won South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. Super Tuesday: Clinton, Trump win big Now, Clinton is looking at Louisiana \u2013 followed by Mississippi on Tuesday \u2013 to close out the Deep South. Her strength among African-American voters has helped her run up huge margins of victory across the South so far, and Saturday should be no different. Opinion: Get out the black vote? Show us the jobs Her campaign isn\u2019t conceding Kansas and Nebraska, either. Wins there would show she can expand the map, shutting Sanders out of states with whiter electorates and caucuses, rather than primaries \u2013 events that tend to favor well-organized activists further to the party\u2019s left. Can Sanders stop Clinton's momentum? Saturday\u2019s results might not shake up the delegate count in the Democratic race. But they will set the tone for three intense days in Michigan, where Clinton and Sanders will meet for a debate Sunday night in Flint and follow it up with campaigning through Tuesday\u2019s primary. The Bayou battle pits Trump\u2019s strength among Southern Evangelicals against Cruz\u2019s ability to win with rock-ribbed conservatives in a state that neighbors Texas \u2013 just like he did in Oklahoma on Super Tuesday. Rubio joins #NeverTrump movement So Rubio is staring at a likely third place finish in a state with 46 total delegates at stake. But what he\u2019s really seeking is to reach 20% support \u2013 no matter where he finishes. It\u2019s the latest challenge for a Rubio campaign that has to fight to keep from dying from 1,000 tactical cuts. In Louisiana, candidates must win at least 20% of the vote statewide to qualify for any of its at-large delegates. \\ Jindal: More voters realizing Trump not conservative Rubio wants to avoid the problem he faced in Texas and Alabama on Super Tuesday: Because he didn\u2019t reach that same 20% threshold that those two states also require, he was nearly shut out of the delegate race \u2013 a big part of why Cruz has nearly double the delegates Rubio has accumulated so far. Presidential contests aren\u2019t just about racking up the most state wins and the strongest finishes. They\u2019re a long slog through complicated delegate apportionment rules. And right now, those rules are working against Rubio. He\u2019ll have an opportunity to win a bunch back on March 15, when Florida holds its 99-delegate winner-take-all contest. But if he\u2019s shut out between now and then, his path to the 1,237 delegates it takes to win the nomination might disappear. The next two Tuesdays will be tough for Sanders. First, Michigan and Mississippi vote. Then, on March 15, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio hold their primaries. Sanders will put up a fight, particularly in the Great Lakes states. But his real opportunity to rack up wins and delegates comes when the race moves west in late March and early April, with states like Arizona, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming on the calendar. Bernie Sanders in the spotlight How will he fare there? Keep a close eye on Kansas and Nebraska on Saturday for the first hint. Sanders is likely to fall further behind in the delegate count over the next two weeks, so he\u2019ll need to show he can not only win western states, but run up big margins, to keep up his argument that he should stick it out until late April, when New York and then a swath of liberal, east coast states vote. Sanders could also celebrate Sunday, when Maine holds its Democratic caucuses. He\u2019s already won next-door New Hampshire and Vermont. After 10 wins in 15 contests, Trump looks increasingly difficult to catch. He expects another strong showing in Maine, where he could replicate northern wins in New Hampshire and Vermont and possibly even surpass 50% \u2013 which would give him all of the state\u2019s 23 delegates. Being Moody: Donald Trump puts conservatives in crisis mode And he could also win Kentucky, Kansas and Louisiana. He\u2019ll face a stiff challenge from Cruz in states like Louisiana and Kansas, and Rubio could best him on Sunday, when Puerto Rico holds its 23-delegate Republican primary. But national polls show Trump is blowing out his opponents \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll need to keep doing. Increasingly, Republicans like Mitt Romney who are determined to stop Trump are pushing to support his strongest foe in each state \u2013 no matter who that foe is. So he needs victories big enough to keep anyone from stopping him, even at the Republican National Convention. Saturday \u2013 just like Super Tuesday \u2013 gives him opportunities to win all over the map.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump headed to Maine on Thursday to campaign Maine Gov. Paul LePage is also a businessman-turned-candidate Maine Gov. Paul LePage was Donald Trump before Trump was \u2013 or so he likes to say. The two shared the stage when Trump headed to Portland, Maine, to campaign Thursday ahead of the Pine Tree State\u2019s Saturday contest. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit like I am, but he says what needs to be said,\u201d LePage said before a raucus crowd. \u201cHe is not afraid of the political establishment, he\u2019s not afraid of lobbyists, special interests and most of all, folks, he\u2019s not afraid of the United States liberal media!\u201d The successful businessman-turned-governor notorious for making national headlines for his outspokenness has obvious similarities to the Republican presidential front-runner. LePage endorsed Trump soon after his preferred candidate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, dropped out of the race and threw his support to the real estate mogul. And while their biographies are anything but identical \u2013 LePage grew up poor and at times homeless in central Maine, while Trump was the heir to a multimillion-dollar real estate company in New York City \u2013 some of the parallels between their political careers are uncanny. \u201cIn a certain way, Maine was really ahead of the curve on this new right-wing populism that\u2019s emerging that everyone\u2019s taking note of with Trump,\u201d said Lance Dutson, a Republican political consultant who served as an adviser to Maine\u2019s House speaker when LePage took office. READ: Maine Gov: Bring back the guillotine for drug dealers Like Trump, LePage was one of a crowded primary field in his first major political campaign and was not taken seriously by establishment Republicans. \u201cEverybody early on, when they heard the crazy things LePage was saying at caucuses and speeches, everybody laughed,\u201d said a longtime Maine Republican operative, speaking on background so as not to jeopardize his employment. \u201cThen the next thing you know, the guy wins the primary.\u201d LePage catapulted to the top of primary pack in 2010 \u2013 though like Trump, he spent relatively little on his campaign \u2013 on the backs of new voters drawn into the process by his resentment of government and the political class. \u201cMaine was a bit of a petri dish,\u201d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who served as communications director for Gov. John Baldacci, LePage\u2019s Democratic predecessor. \u201cYou\u2019ve got rural communities that have lost their major employers and nobody has really been able to solve that problem. Then they latch onto this guy who just wants to blow it all up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you see that with LePage and you certainly see it with Trump.\u201d READ: Top quotes from Maine\u2019s Paul LePage Those voters were working-class people who felt equally disaffected by their government, their unions and big companies, the GOP operative said. \u201cThey were trained to work in an economy that has changed dramatically over the last decade and they feel lost and angry and that nobody cares and nobody is listening,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s the same profile of Trump voters today. And in LePage, and now Trump, those voters have found their champions. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a simmering rage in Maine and across the country \u2026 and LePage upended that. I think what Trump is doing on a national scale is similar except obviously it has broader implications,\u201d Dutson said. But there\u2019s another side to that loyalty. \u201cThe governor has demonstrated he has a penchant for talking off the cuff, not being concerned with the facts of his statements and saying things that simply are hurtful and inappropriate,\u201d said Farmer, the Democrat. \u201cLike Mr. Trump, the governor has said things that are racist, things I believe were intended to incite violence, and he has been extremely bombastic and aggressive with friends and foes.\u201d READ: Chris Christie defends LePage, says Maine governor apologized In Maine, it\u2019s not uncommon for the governor to be at odds with members of his own party, be it over language he\u2019s used or an unwillingness to compromise on legislation. On the national scale, the Republican establishment is flailing to do whatever it can to prevent Trump from wresting their party\u2019s nomination. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential candidate, is scheduled to give a speech Thursday that will take direct aim at Trump and implore voters to coalesce around a rival. Discomfort with Trump\u2019s unwillingness during an interview with CNN to disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke is just the latest example of the mogul drawing rebuke from party leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. Dutson says Maine Republicans learned the hard way it\u2019s better to speak up sooner rather than later if a candidate does things that don\u2019t align with your values. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the guts to push back on your own party when you see people doing something wrong, then you\u2019re going to end up owning it. And that\u2019s where Republicans are at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a weird place in American politics right now and LePage was definitely on the cutting edge of that.\u201d And Farmer has some sobering words for Democrats who see Trump as an easy general election target. \u201cI just don\u2019t take that for granted. I\u2019ve seen it a little bit too close. You just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in an election,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "With wins in 10 of the first 15 states to vote, Clinton has built a clear lead Sanders insists he's sticking it out through the convention Hillary Clinton faces an awkward task in the coming weeks: icing Bernie Sanders without also freezing out his supporters. With wins in 10 of the first 15 states to vote, Clinton has built a clear lead in the Democratic nominating contest \u2013 and with several large, favorable states on deck in the next two weeks, she could soon make it nearly impossible for Sanders to catch her. So Clinton, increasingly confident that she\u2019ll be the Democratic nominee, is turning her attention more and more to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. There\u2019s just one problem. Sanders isn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cAll the pundits are calling the race for Clinton. That means we\u2019re probably going to win in a landslide,\u201d Sanders said at a rally Wednesday in Portland, Maine. Clinton is looking for ways to bridge her party\u2019s divide and bring Sanders\u2019 supporters into her fold ahead of a general election in which she\u2019ll need young voters and liberals to turn out in force. \u201cI congratulate Senator Sanders on his strong showing and campaigning and I am grateful to all of you who have voted for me,\u201d she said in her Super Tuesday night speech, extending an olive branch to the Vermont senator\u2019s supporters. Hillary Clinton's entire Super Tuesday speech But dropping her criticism of Sanders could amount to unilaterally disarming. Democrats have two debates on the docket within the next week \u2013 Sunday night in Flint, Michigan, and Wednesday in Miami. Sanders has previewed his line of attack on the campaign trail in recent days by pressing publicly for Clinton to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave to Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs. Then there\u2019s the map. The Michigan primary on March 8 is a key Sanders target, but Clinton\u2019s allies hope he enters the killing fields on March 15. That\u2019s when Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri vote \u2013 five states with sizeable minority populations, which have largely backed the former secretary of state. Clinton could win most, or even all, of them. However, if Sanders survives and wakes up March 16 still within striking distance, he\u2019ll have no reason to bow out anytime soon. The race then shifts west to states that look more like Colorado, where he won handily on Super Tuesday. And finally, there\u2019s his well-oiled online fundraising machine, which with free air time from scheduled debates and his ability to continue to rack up delegates is likely to keep operating, allowing him to stay in the race. Sanders outraised Clinton $42 million to $30 million in February. And though his path to the Democratic nomination has narrowed, the money still appears to be flowing. Sanders insists he\u2019s sticking it out through the convention. With huge delegate blocs to be awarded in New York in April and California in June, he\u2019ll be tough to mathematically eliminate. READ: Voter turnout shows Trump, not Sanders, leading a revolution \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go. Our plan is to win and win consistently between now and June. If we do, we believe Bernie Sanders will have more pledged delegates,\u201d Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine said Wednesday. And Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver argued that his Super Tuesday victories \u2013 Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Vermont \u2013 demonstrate Sanders can win among Latino voters and in rural areas. \u201cThere was a great diversity among the states that we won last night,\u201d Weaver said. In the next week, the Sanders campaign is focusing on Maine, Kansas, Michigan and Nebraska. Weaver expects Maine\u2019s caucus to go favorably for them. He called the Michigan primary a \u201ccritical showdown\u201d on working-class issues. He acknowledged Sanders\u2019 biggest weakness as well, saying: \u201cWe have to do better with African-American voters between now and the end of the process. Clinton has done really well. But we think we can do a lot better.\u201d Clinton\u2019s top aides are well aware that given Sanders\u2019 fundraising prowess and deep liberal support, he isn\u2019t going to drop out anytime soon. But Clinton\u2019s large operation now hopes to make it nearly impossible for him to win the presidency. \u201cThe scenarios in terms of the margins he would have [needed] to win the remaining states will become less and less likely and that is probably true after March 15 or so,\u201d Brian Fallon, Clinton\u2019s press secretary, said on Tuesday. \u201cHe is going to have some victories tonight and he is going to have some victories in the week ahead. So he is going to have some state wins to point to, but we will continue to remind folks that the race is determined by delegates.\u201d Gabbard: Clinton too interventionist to be President Clinton\u2019s operation feels it has invested wisely in key states, knowing that the nominating contest is a race for delegates, not individual victories. And, when asked, Clinton aides are more than happy to note that Sanders has been unable to win African-American and Latino voters, the buzzsaw that his campaign has known was coming for months but was unable to avoid \u2013 with losses in South Carolina followed by a swath of Southern states on Super Tuesday: Texas, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. \u201cYou can\u2019t win the nomination writing off the most diverse states,\u201d Fallon said Tuesday night. \u201cThat is a big message from tonight. For better or worse, they only contested five of the 11 states and the ones they effectively ceded happen to be the most diverse.\u201d That said, aides are eyeing the rest of the calendar cautiously, aware that Sanders could pick up wins in the coming week, with contests in Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska on March 5, Maine on March 6 and Michigan and Mississippi on March 8. But don\u2019t expect Clinton to step up her rhetoric against Sanders. She will draw contrasts with him on college spending, health care and guns \u2013 especially at the two upcoming debates \u2013 but she will primarily lead with a positive message on the stump, aides said. \u201cShe talked the other day how we are taking this campaign national. I think a lot of the markers have been laid on a lot of what the core contrasts are on this campaign. There will be a couple debates in the next 10 days and I am sure some of those differences they have will manifest themselves and surface again,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cBut in a phase of the campaign where we are not truly running a national campaign and in some of these states she has the opportunity to be there only for a brief period, we are going to lead with our affirmative message,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump won seven states; Ted Cruz won Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska; Marco Rubio won Minnesota Hillary Clinton won seven states, Bernie Sanders won four John Kasich played spoiler as Trump, Cruz say Rubio has no path to the nomination Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t win their parties\u2019 nominations on Super Tuesday \u2013 but they both became much harder to beat. READ: Chris Christie steals Trump\u2019s show Trump racked up wins in seven states to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s three and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s one. And Clinton defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in seven of the 11 Democratic contests. Here are six takeaways from the biggest day in the 2016 presidential race so far: Donald Trump: We have expanded the GOP Party He proved it in the early states and now he has proven it on Super Tuesday: Donald Trump is leading a coalition. New Hampshire and Massachusetts showed he wins white, working-class moderates \u2013 the Reagan Democrats. South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia showed he wins evangelicals in the Bible Belt. And record-shattering Republican turnout in Virginia showed he expands the party\u2019s base of voters. READ: Trump\u2019s lead is tearing the Republicans apart \u201cI\u2019m a unifier \u2014 I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me,\u201d Trump said. Trump is running away with the GOP nomination, as his rivals continue their never-ending fight about who\u2019s the best alternative. He survived the latest controversy, this one over whether he\u2019d given a subtle wink to white supremacists by deflecting questions about whether he\u2019d disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. READ: What a President Trump could mean for the world And he bested two opponents who\u2019d devoted an entire two-hour debate Thursday night to dumping their opposition research books on his head. After an introduction by former rival and new campaign surrogate New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Trump congratulated Cruz on an \u201cexcellent win\u201d in Texas before turning his attention to Hillary Clinton. \u201cMake America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again,\u201d he said, referencing her new attack line. READ: What the world thinks of Trump It\u2019s the polar opposite of where Clinton found herself eight years ago. This time, she\u2019s ahead in the delegate race and has won a majority of the Democratic contests. Hillary Clinton's entire Super Tuesday speech Clinton won a swath of delegate-rich Southern states with large minority populations, easily besting Sanders in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. And she won the night\u2019s biggest toss-up, narrowly defeating Sanders in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts win, in particular, showed that it\u2019s not just a minority firewall for Clinton \u2013 she can win states that are predominantly white. The Democratic nominating contest allocates delegates proportionally, so Clinton hasn\u2019t knocked Sanders out of the race. But she has a date in mind to do just that: March 15. With all of the momentum, Clinton is aiming for wins in a series of big states \u2013 Michigan on March 8 and then Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri on March 15. At that point, the scenarios for a Sanders comeback become \u201cless and less likely,\u201d Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said \u2013 even though he said the campaign expects Sanders is \u201cgoing to have some victories in the week ahead. So he is going to have some state wins to point to, but we will continue to remind folks that the race is determined by delegates.\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Sanders\u2019 big targets between now and March 8 are Kansas, Nebraska, Maine, and the biggest prize, Michigan. Did Ted Cruz wait too long to oppose Donald Trump? Cruz did exactly what he needed to do: He won his home state of Texas by a resounding margin, and he tacked on Oklahoma and Alaska \u2013 allowing him to continue his argument that he is the only Republican who can beat Trump. In fact, Cruz called on the rest of the GOP field to \u201cprayerfully\u201d consider dropping out of the race during his election-night speech. READ: Donald Trump stumbles on David Duke, KKK \u201cTonight, this campaign enters a new phase,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cTomorrow morning we have a choice. So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trump\u2019s path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives and for the nation. And after tonight, we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten, that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump.\u201d Cruz\u2019s comments came before the results were finalized in Minnesota, Rubio\u2019s best state. And he ignored the reality that there are no real signs the Republican establishment likes him any more than Trump. READ: America\u2019s crazy voting system explained But in the GOP primary right now, when Cruz or Rubio rises, the other falls \u2013 and Cruz had the better night Tuesday. On the other hand: Cruz had pegged his entire campaign to Super Tuesday, calling it the most important date in the race. He once used the word \u201cfirewall\u201d to describe it \u2013 a fact Rubio\u2019s campaign has gleefully trumpeted. Yet he only won two states, and many of the Southern states he banked on previously have now already voted. Rubio has defended his string of second and third-place finishes by arguing he has a path to victory that focuses on the post-Super Tuesday states, including his native Florida. He finally got on the board Tuesday, winning the Minnesota caucuses. But overall, the night was another disappointment for Rubio, who spent much of the past week unleashing a barrage of Trump-like attacks against the billionaire businessman. Is Rubio in denial about the GOP race? Now, Rubio has to explain, again, to donors and power brokers why he\u2019s worth a major investment. His argument: The race now goes to Michigan, and then five bigger states with more moderate, suburban, highly educated Republicans \u2013 places he can win. Florida is one of them, and it\u2019s winner-take-all. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re really going to catch fire,\u201d Rubio told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in a Tuesday night interview. READ: How Muslim women are winning the 2016 campaign Trump and Cruz, meanwhile, are happy to tell Rubio that he\u2019s finished. \u201cHe had a tough night. He is a lightweight,\u201d Trump said. And he\u2019s ready to put Rubio away, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna spend a lot of time in Florida.\u201d Bernie Sanders' entire Super Tuesday speech The Democratic night largely followed expectations, with Sanders picking up wins in Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Vermont. The only other state where he stood a real chance was Massachusetts, a liberal stronghold bordering his native Vermont. But he was unable to win there, or dent Clinton\u2019s momentum elsewhere on the map. Speaking early in the night, Sanders made the argument that he\u2019s racking up nearly as many delegates as Clinton \u2013 so there\u2019s no reason for him to consider looking for the exits any time soon. \u201cThis is not a general election; it\u2019s not winner-take-all,\u201d Sanders told his adoring crowd. \u201cIf you get 52%, you get 48%, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates.\u201d There\u2019s no reason Sanders can\u2019t stay competitive: He raised $42 million in February alone, giving him plenty of cash to match or outspend Clinton on the airwaves. Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Sanders has another particularly useful tool in his pocket: More Democratic debates, starting Sunday night in Flint, Michigan. Clinton agreed to them as Sanders was gaining momentum nationally. Now, though, they serve to extend the life of a race that Clinton\u2019s campaign would prefer to bring to an effective end as soon as possible. Michigan votes next Tuesday \u2013 and it\u2019ll be a precursor for the following week\u2019s Ohio primary. Those now look like states Sanders needs to win. There\u2019s a reason John Kasich is facing calls from Republicans to get out of the race: he\u2019s a spoiler to candidates trying to topple Trump. In Virginia, for instance, Kasich took 9.4%, and Rubio lost to Trump by 2.8%. \u201cWe basically fought Donald Trump to a draw. And had it been a narrower field, we would have won Virginia,\u201d Rubio said on CNN Tuesday night. Expect a chorus of party brass to press Kasich to depart before Ohio\u2019s March 15 winner-take-all primary. If Rubio could win both Florida and Ohio on that day, he\u2019d gain 165 delegates in one fell swoop. But with Kasich in the race, that won\u2019t happen. Kasich isn\u2019t inclined to help Rubio. His campaign argues that it\u2019s Rubio who is underperforming expectations \u2013 spoiling, for example, what would\u2019ve been a Kasich win in Vermont. Dr. Ben Carson, too, is refusing to exit the race \u2013 and while he\u2019s hardly racking up any delegates, he\u2019s a thorn in the side of Cruz. Carson performs best among evangelical voters. That\u2019s Cruz\u2019s strong suit, too. While it\u2019s not clear where Carson\u2019s support would go, Cruz could have figured to pick up the largest share of it \u2013 giving him a boost in Southern states.

            "article_content": "The Democratic candidates for president gathered in Columbia, South Carolina, for CNN's Democratic Town Hall on Tuesday CNN's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gathered in Columbia, South Carolina, for CNN\u2019s Democratic Town Hall on Tuesday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the town hall, selected key statements and then rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality check: Sanders on obstructionism against Obama By Kevin Liptak, CNN Sanders claimed that President Barack Obama has faced previously-unseen levels of resistance from Congress during his time in office. \u201cWe have been dealing, in the last seven years, with an unprecedented level of obstructionism against President Obama,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLiterally \u2013 literally it turns out on the day that Obama was inaugurated, Republicans came together and said \u2018What are we going to do?\u2019 And what they concluded is we\u2019re going to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct, make it as difficult as he could to do anything.\u201d He used the current battle to replace Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia as an example of Republicans\u2019 obstructionism. While there are a multitude of ways to measure Congressional obstructionism, the number of filibusters provides a clear picture of lawmakers blocking action from moving forward to a final vote. When he entered office, Obama enjoyed Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate, allowing him to pass his biggest legislative win to date, the Affordable Care Act. But as the minority party, Republicans were nonetheless were able to utilize filibusters to block action on many of Obama\u2019s items, including judicial nominations. According to U.S. Senate records, attempts to break filibusters reached a historic high in the 113th Congress, in place during the years 2013 and 2014. In those years, senators took 218 votes on cloture, compared to a previous high of 112 in the years 2007 and 2008, when Democrats controlled the Senate and George W. Bush was president. Because it requires 60 votes to break a filibuster, much of the action Obama pushed for required a higher threshold than would ordinarily be needed. That led to longer waits for judicial nominees. Congressional Research Service data show that the median number of days between a judicial nomination and confirmation rose steadily from 41 days during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration to 218 days during Obama\u2019s administration. Democrats, when they have served in the minority in the Senate, haven\u2019t been shy about using filibusters to block action preferred by Republicans. But historic data indicates the tactic increased during Obama\u2019s term. By that measure, Sanders is correct. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Koch brothers \u2018second wealthiest\u2019 in U.S. By Eve Bower, CNN Sanders said that Charles and David Koch, commonly referred to as \u201cthe Koch brothers,\u201d are the \u201csecond wealthiest family in this country. They and a few of their billionaire friends are going to spend $900 million dollars on this campaign in order to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful.\u201d Forbes magazine researched and ranked the 10 wealthiest families in the United States in 2015. According to their findings, Charles and David Koch, along with their brothers Frederick and Bill, are worth an estimated total of $86 billion. And they do indeed rank second behind the Walton family \u2013 the six heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton \u2013 who are worth a collective $149 billion. We rate this part of Sander\u2019s claim true. But the second half of Sanders\u2019 claim is less straightforward. In January 2015, The New York Times reported that the Koch brothers had recruited a network of about 300 wealthy donors who planned to form a political organization that would spend $889 million on presidential and congressional campaigns in 2016. But a June newsletter from Koch Industries refuted this claim, saying the fundraising efforts were still underway, and that only about one-third of the sum would be spent on \u201cpresidential, congressional, state, and local races.\u201d The remaining two-thirds was to be spent on \u201cresearch and educational programs.\u201d In an October interview with American Public Media\u2019s \u201cMarketplace,\u201d Charles Koch estimated that the amount his donor network would spend on politics during 2015 and 2016 would be $250 million \u2013 less than one-third of Sanders\u2019 claim. On the spending by Koch\u2019s friends, our verdict is false. Reality Check: Sanders on voter turnout By Sonam Vashi, CNN In response to a question about what his revolution would look like, Sanders said, \u201cWhat does it look like? Last election, November 2014, Republicans won a landslide victory, all over the country. Sixty-three percent of the American people didn\u2019t vote. Eighty percent of young people didn\u2019t vote.\u201d Was voter turnout really that low in 2014? According to the widely cited U.S. Election Project, run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald, just 36.7% of voting-eligible Americans turned out to vote in the 2014 election, the lowest in 70 years. The term \u201cvoting-eligible\u201d excludes people who are above 18 but are legally barred from voting, such as those convicted of felonies, those deemed mentally incapacited, or non-citizens. The Census Bureau found a similar turnout rate of 41.9% for that election, but Sanders number is correct according to at least one legitimate estimation. In 2014, the youth voter turnout rate was 21.5%, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civil Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), a Tufts University organization. CIRCLE defines \u201cyouth\u201d as those aged 18 to 29, and uses demographic data that takes into account all voting-aged citizes (as opposed to sifting out felons and other citizens who are legally barred to vote). Again, the Census Bureau found similar numbers \u2013 23.1% of voting-aged young citizens turned out to vote in 2014. But the Census defines \u201cyouth\u201d as those aged 18 to 34, which may account for the variation. Again, Sanders is correct here. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Sanders on doubling of share of wealth of top 0.1% By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Sanders often ticks off a list of ways that income inequality has grown in recent decades. During CNN\u2019s Democratic Town Hall on Tuesday, he talked about the \u201cmassive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families to the top one tenth of 1%\u201d over the past 30 years. \u201cMiddle class shrinking, people living in poverty, top one tenth of 1% saw a doubling, a doubling of the percentage of wealth they own,\u201d he said. Sanders is citing data from the well-known inequality researchers Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of University of California, Berkeley. They found that the share of wealth of the top 0.1% has grown from 7% in 1978 to 22% in 2012. A chart in their report shows that in 1983, the share of wealth of the top 0.1% was about 9%. So Sanders is correct. The top 0.1% has seen their share more than double over 30 years. In case anyone is curious \u2026 there were about 160,700 taxpayers in this group, with an average wealth of $72.8 million, in 2012. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Sanders on unaffordable prescriptions By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN Sanders went after Big Pharma\u2019s \u201chuge profits\u201d in talking about the need for cost-effective health care system for everyone. \u201cOne out of five Americans can\u2019t even fill their prescriptions,\u201d he said, referring to soaring pharmaceutical prices. This is not the first time Sanders has made this point before, including last month at a CNN Democratic Town Hall in Iowa and again a couple of weeks ago at a CNN Democratic Town Hall in Milwaukee. Nearly one in 10 American adults (7.8%) did not take their prescriptions as prescribed to save money, according to the 2013 National Health Information Survey, which was published last year. The government report also found 15.1% of those surveyed asked their doctor for a less costly medication, 1.6% shopped outside of the U.S. for their medications and 4.2% reported using alternative treatments. The survey did not include the one in five claim made by Sanders, but given that there are a number of strategies cited for Americans trying to reduce their prescription bills, we find this claim to be mostly true. Reality Check: Sanders on Big Tobacco vs. Uruguay By Chip Grabow, CNN Sanders was asked by voter Dave Sprung \u2013 who said his dad had died of lung cancer \u2013 what reforms he would put in place on cigarette smoking. Sanders sympathized with Sprung, saying his father too died young and that cigarette smoking contributed to that. Among other things, Sanders said he would take on the tobacco companies who, he said, \u201cpeddle cigarettes to kids in other parts of the world.\u201d Sanders went on to talk about a trade issue over which Philip Morris International, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world, sued Uruguay. \u201cAnd you know why they sued Uruguay?\u201d Sanders asked, \u201cBecause their President was an oncologist, felt very strongly about this issue, worked very hard for tobacco prevention. And Phillip Morris said you are denying our company future profits.\u201d So, did Philip Morris actually sue the government of Uruguay? Indeed it did, indirectly. It filed with the international trade arbitration branch of the World Bank. The tobacco company took issue with Uruguay\u2019s policy of implementing prominent health warnings that covered half a pack of cigarettes. In 2006, President Tabare Vazquez, a physician, had begun new public health initiatives to reduce smoking. He banned smoking in enclosed places, and then in 2008, introduced a new law calling for the larger health warnings on packs of cigarettes. In 2009, the Uruguayan government further increased the size of those warning labels. It also limited tobacco companies from selling more than one brand. And in 2010, Uruguay raised cigarette taxes to 70% of the pack\u2019s price. In 2010, Philip Morris started legal action appearing before the World Bank\u2019s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Suing for $25 million in damages, Philip Morris argued Uruguay\u2019s tobacco measures caused the cigarette maker to suffer \u201csubstantial losses\u201d by restricting sales to just one brand and imposing larger warning labels preventing its trademarks being displayed properly. According to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, the status of the case is still pending. But we have a verdict on Sanders\u2019 claim: True. Reality Check: Clinton on Guantanamo Bay detention center By Eve Bower, CNN Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on record in favor of closing (the detention center at Guantanamo Bay) for a long time, since 2008.\u201d Speaking about where detainees would be transferred, she further said, \u201cI remember back in the \u201908 election, President Obama, Senator (John) McCain and I all had the same position.\u201d In 2008, Obama, McCain and Clinton all campaigned on the position that the prison camp at Guantanamo, also known as Gitmo, should be closed. Therefore, we rate her first claim true. Clinton was indeed on the record throughout her 2008 run in favor of closing the facility. Her second claim, however, that they \u201call had the same position\u201d about prisoners\u2019 fates beyond Guantanamo\u2019s walls is false. There was significant disagreement between them while all three were in the Senate. In 2006, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act, which, among other measures, denied access to civilian courts for Guantanamo detainees. The Supreme Court later struck down that part of the act. But McCain, an Arizona Republican, had been a primary backer of the bill, and even after the Supreme Court struck down a portion of it, he expressed his concern over the ruling. Both Obama and Clinton had voted against the bill. Clinton said at the time, \u201cin the process of accomplishing what is essential for our security, we must hold onto our values and set an example we can point to with pride and not shame.\u201d The three were united in their support of closing the prison at Guantanamo, but that obscures their significant disagreements on prisoner rights beyond those walls. Reality Check: Clinton on NATO-Arab coalition in Libya By Ryan Browne and Amy Gallagher, CNN When Cuomo followed up on a voter\u2019s question to Clinton by asking her about Libya, Clinton highlighted the fact that European and Arab nations had joined the U.S. during the 2011 intervention in the country. \u201cWe formed the first coalition between NATO and Arab nations,\u201d she asserted. In the course of this campaign, many of the presidential candidates have said that such a coalition will be key to fighting ISIS, so being a part of the team assembling the first such coalition would be important experience for Clinton to tout in her quest for the presidency. Clinton is correct in saying that the NATO-led Operation Unified Protector in Libya involved a coalition that included the Arab nations of Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. However, this was not the first time NATO led a coalition with Arab participants. In Afghanistan in 2003, NATO took the lead of the International Security Assistance Force, which included the Arab states of Bahrain, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Prior to Afghanistan, there was military cooperation between many of the same nations during the first Gulf War in 1991. At that time, 14 of the 16 NATO member nations joined forces with nine Arab states, including Bahrain, Qatar, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. While Clinton was correct that the coalition in Libya included NATO and Arab nations working together, it was not the first time. Therefore, we rate her claim false. Reality Check: Clinton on CEO pay By Kate Grise, CNN Clinton touted her record of consistently attacking Wall Street, despite receiving nearly $2 million in speaking fees from various banks and Wall Street groups over recent years. \u201cI went to Wall Street before the Great Recession. I called them out. I said what they were doing in the mortgage market was going to cause serious problems. I called for reining in CEO pay. I called for ending the loophole that lets hedge fund managers get a lower tax rate. I have been on record for a really long time,\u201d she said. At the beginning of the financial crisis, Clinton was running for president, and she did speak out about the issues the mortgage market may cause as early as March 2007. \u201cThe subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,\u201d Clinton said during a speech on subprime lending. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families.\u201d During the same March 2007 speech, Clinton called for expanding the role of Federal Housing Administration to insure more mortgages at better rates, providing consumers with more information and counseling, and allowing more breathing room for foreclosure. As a senator from New York, Clinton did sponsor a bill in 2007 that aimed to implement these reforms, but it did not pass. Clinton also released a plan to increase financial regulation and address the housing and credit crises in March 2008, just before the worst of the financial crisis hit in the fall of 2008. Looking back on the crisis in October, Clinton wrote, \u201cBefore the crisis hit, as a senator from New York, I was alarmed by this gathering storm, and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on abusive subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.\u201d She went on to lay out similar reforms to prevent the next crash in an op-ed written for Bloomberg View. Clinton has put the issue of CEO pay at the forefront of her campaign this time around, speaking on the issue during her speech kicking off her 2016 presidential run, saying that American families are still struggling \u201cwhen the average CEO makes about 300 times what the average worker makes.\u201d During a January 2008 interview with The New York Times, Clinton called executive-pay packages \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d On the loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay lower taxes than most, Clinton has also been consistent. While campaigning for president in 2007, Clinton spoke out against the carried interest tax break that allows these managers to have their income taxed at the lower capital gains rate. \u201cIt offends our values as a nation when an investment manager making $50 million can pay a lower tax rate on her earned income than a teacher making $50,000 pays on her income,\u201d she said during a campaign speech back then. Clinton has consistently repeated this claim, saying that the carried interest tax loophole is a \u201cglaring inequity.\u201d During this presidential campaign cycle, she has pledged to close the loophole. We rate Clinton\u2019s claim as true because she does indeed have a consistent position on these three issues. Reality Check: Clinton says Obama took the most money from Wall Street but made the toughest regulations By Sonam Vashi, CNN Clinton said, \u201cPresident Obama took an enormous amount of money, more than anybody ever had from Wall Street in 2008 when he was successful in his election, and then he turned around and pushed through the toughest regulations that we\u2019ve seen since the Great Depression.\u201d During the 2008 election cycle, the Obama campaign raked in $747.8 million, including $43.7 million from the finance, insurance and real estate sector. That\u2019s more than the $31 million John McCain received from those industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which compiles Federal Election Commission data. Obama\u2019s amount is also slightly more than what George W. Bush took in from those industries in 2004, but Obama\u2019s $43.7 million would later be eclipsed by the $61 million raised by Mitt Romney in 2012, according to CRP (Clinton, for comparison, has raised about $21.7 million from the sector). Additionally, the CRP found that individuals or PACs representing Goldman Sachs were the second highest contributors to Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. As campaign contributions have grown over time, 2008 represented the most amount of money that the finance, insurance and real estate sector had given in the past 20 years. Therefore, in raw numbers not adjusted for inflation, Clinton\u2019s claim that the Obama campaign received the most money from Wall Street in 2008 is true. Obama touted the 2010 Wall Street regulations as being the toughest financial reforms since the Great Depression. Many think tanks, including the Council on Foreign Relations and Bankrate, agreed. The Dodd-Frank regulations aimed to stop bailouts, enforce consumer protection and created a council that would warn the country before companies could provoke financial crises. We\u2019re also rating that claim true.",

            "article_content": "Following campaign volunteers canvassing precincts in New Hampshire for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton There are some things you might never know if you\u2019ve never gone door knocking for a political campaign, in January, in New Hampshire. For example, how to scale a steep driveway covered in ice and talk to a woman about voting for Hillary Clinton who doesn\u2019t want to talk you because she has a burning pancake on the stove. \u201cI\u2019m going to mark her down as undecided, because the first thing she said was \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d\u2026 obviously today she does not want to talk to us,\u201d Sumathi Madhure, a Clinton canvasser in Nashua, said as she turned away from the closed door. Madhure is one of thousands of door knockers that have spread across New Hampshire in the past months with one very important focus \u2014 get supporters out to vote on February 9 for the first-in-the-nation primary. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders clash at CNN town hall Clinton has tried to lower expectations for New Hampshire after scraping by Bernie Sanders in Iowa. According to the latest CNN/WMUR poll here, Sanders leads Clinton by 23 points. And around 60% of Democratic voters say they have definitely decided who they will support. CNN spent a Sunday with volunteers from both campaigns canvassing neighborhoods in Nashua to see how it\u2019s done. Being a good door knocker is often not entirely about face-to-face interactions. When volunteers set out to canvass a neighborhood they may be given a list of more than 40 houses, and only talk to a handful of people. Much of the time is spent on less stimulating exercises \u2013 navigating confusing addresses, deciding how to handle \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs, or how to tuck a piece of literature into a door frame. For example, Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire literature is a thin pamphlet, easy to tuck into a door with Clinton\u2019s face peaking out. Sanders\u2019 lit is cut in a way that makes it impossible to show the picture of his face \u2013 the geometric cut-out looks nice but the format doesn\u2019t work as well in doorways. And there was also the added danger of approaching someone\u2019s door too close to a Patriots game \u2013 the jerseys come out and you know its time take a break. New Hampshire is notorious for voters who make up their minds in the finals weeks and days before the primary. Voters like Sue Lambright, a 47-year-old Nashua resident who is registered as \u201cundeclared,\u201d although she usually votes Democrat. Madhure says the issues that matter most to her are Wall Street reform and keeping the U.S. out of needless wars \u2013 however, when she makes her pitch to undecided voters,  she focuses on electability. \u201cI will probably end up swinging to her in the end,\u201d Lambright said as she leaned against her doorway. \u201cI hope you do because we need a winnable candidate,\u201d Madhure said, holding her clipboard and campaign literature as she stood on Lambright\u2019s doorstep making her pitch. \u201cBernie is great\u2026\u201d \u201cI know, I love them both,\u201d Lambright smiled. \u201cBut we don\u2019t live in the world where there\u2019s a realistic chance for Bernie to win,\u201d Madhure said, closing her argument. \u201cUnfortunately I think you\u2019re right,\u201d Lambright agreed. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t win the primary you can hand over the keys, White House keys, to the Republicans,\u201d Madhure added for emphasis. \u201cOh god, that can\u2019t happen,\u201d Lambright said. She put Lambright down as \u201cleaning Clinton,\u201d meaning that another volunteer will likely make a visit to her house again before the primary. Madhure is a 52-year-old physical therapist, she started getting involved in politics after her two children left for college and she was impressed with a man running for mayor who came knocking on her door. pr \u201cIf that motivated me to get out and vote, I\u2019m sure there are people out there to whom its important to know that people are taking the time to come out and knock on their door,\u201d Madhure told CNN. Though she has a full time job, she has been spending January weekends, and one night a week, volunteering for Clinton. In the past she volunteered on President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, and the midterm 2014 race for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Madhure is the team leader for ward 8 in Nashua, where she makes sure volunteers show up for shifts, and takes the lead on door knocking. Other work is divided up with three other volunteers: one who enters data after volunteers canvas, another who handles social media postings for the group, and one dedicated phone banker. One aspect of the Clinton strategy Madhure emphasized was \u201cendorsement cards.\u201d When she finds voters who say they will vote for Clinton, she has them fill out a card that will be sent back to them before the primary, reminding them to vote. They also keep part of the card that lists an organizer\u2019s name and phone number, in case they have questions about Clinton\u2019s policies or events nearby. The follow-up to the endorsement card is to ask about interest in volunteering for the campaign. On this particular Sunday she didn\u2019t find any takers but one young woman said her dad might be interested. One of the surprising things Madhure has found, she said, are voters who say they will be voting in the Republican primary but would vote for Clinton in the general if their candidate loses. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t be Hillary in the primary, now if its against Trump then it will be Hillary,\u201d one undecided voter told her before closing the door. \u201cWill you be voting for the senator?\u201d \u201cNo sorry, can\u2019t vote for him. I own a business, his tax plan would pretty much kill me. I\u2019m voting for Donald Trump, business owners got to stick together. He\u2019s better than Clinton though.\u201d The voter was firm, but polite, as he closed his door. Mark King, a 53-year-old library worker, and Partha Porika, a 16-year-old student, say it\u2019s not unusual to find some overlap between Trump and Sanders supporters while door knocking. \u201cWhat they say about Donald Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to say what needs to be said, which, I\u2019m not too sure what that really means,\u201d Porika told CNN. \u201cThey say he\u2019s not beholden to any company, he\u2019s his own person, and a lot of that applies to Sen. Sanders as well.\u201d King and Porika say they don\u2019t know the \u201csecret sauce\u201d that goes into the voter lists they work off of while door knocking, but it is often undeclared voters who have voted for Democrats in the past. They have become a regular team on the weekends, with King driving while Porika takes over the navigating and records voter data. For Porika, it\u2019s a new experience. He said he didn\u2019t know anything about politics 6 or 7 months ago, but got involved in a local mayoral campaign through a friend and when he turned his attention to the national race for president, \u201cBernie just stuck out as this amazing guy, his policies, his voting history from the past 30 years, its solid.\u201d King, on the other hand, has been working on campaigns for years, and says he told Sanders himself at an organizing meeting why he had to run for president back before there was no campaign, \u201cSometimes we\u2019re organizing around, \u2018this person is less bad than that person,\u2019 and that\u2019s not good. With you we can organize around your record, your progressive values and your fact based analysis,\u201d King said. They both find that one of their biggest obstacles with Sanders is still name recognition. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t know who Bernie Sanders is you have to find something that they care about, an issue that they care about,\u201d Porika told CNN. \u201cHaving them realize that this guy could actually be someone they should really be interested in that could help them out a lot.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t really have a consciousness of who Bernie Sanders is, a lot of folks don\u2019t like Hillary,\u201d King said, adding that the Democrat candidate debates on TV helped increase recognition. When Porika and King found voters who said they were supporting Sanders they diligently noted it down, but said they didn\u2019t know of using \u201cendorsement cards\u201d like the Clinton campaign. They described four other volunteers involved in their team in Nashua who all share roles under the paid organizer in charge of the office. \u201cWith our team we can just about be autonomous, and make stuff happen, touch base with people, get conversations going, phone banking with minimal supervision so it gives the campaign more reach,\u201d King told CNN. That means making sure voters like Rick Bibeau get out to vote for Sanders. Bibeau wasn\u2019t on their list but answered the door at the address on their list, he said he liked Sanders\u2019 stance on the middle class. \u201cI\u2019m basically an independent and going to go with who I think is the strongest person,\u201d Bibeau told them. \u201cI used to be a Republican but I would kind of go with the best person, and I like him a lot.\u201d",

What a night here in the nation\u2019s first presidential primary state, one town hall (INAUDIBLE) on the two remaining Democrats and the questions voters want answered before making their choice. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Tonight, the presidential race is more competitive than ever.  And the Democrats are here, in New Hampshire, to face the voters again. HILLARY CLINTON (D-NY), FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am so thrilled that I\u2019m coming to New Hampshire after winning Iowa. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe we have a path toward victory. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   It\u2019s down to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2013 just two candidates on one stage, taking questions from the people of this battleground state on issues that hit close to home. CLINTON:  I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Their differences are real and the stakes are soaring just days before the second crucial contest of 2016. SANDERS:  Millions of people come together and say loudly and clearly, enough is enough. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   This is a CNN Democratic town hall event, a chance for voters to try to debate with decision day around the corner. SANDERS:  Democracy is not a spectator sport. CLINTON:  New Hampshire, the eyes of the world are going to be on you again. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  New Hampshire is choosing.  The Democrats are in the spotlight.  And they\u2019re making their pitches to voters right now. (APPLAUSE) ANDERSON COOPER, HOST:  And good evening from the historic Derry Opera House in downtown Derry, New Hampshire. Welcome. We are here tonight with just six days to go until primary day.  Just six days left to decide, yet many voters remain undecided. So tonight, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are here with the people of the state and the country for a conversation. I want to welcome our viewers in the United States, in New Hampshire, around the world.  We\u2019re being seen on CNN, CNN En Espanol, CNN International. I also want to extend a warm welcome to our service men and women who are watching on the American Forces network and to those who are listening on the Westwood One Radio Network and on CNN Channel 116 on Sirius XM. In the audience here in Derry, New Hampshire, people who tell us they will be participating in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary, which means registered Democrats or Independents.  Some have already made up their minds.  Others still trying to decide whom to vote for. The clock is ticking, guys. We asked audience members to come up with their own questions, which we \u2013 we\u2019ve reviewed to make sure they don\u2019t overlap.  I\u2019ll ask some questions, as well.  But tonight is really about the voters getting to know the candidates. So, let\u2019s get started. Up first tonight, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Thanks for joining us. SANDERS:  Good to see you. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Welcome. SANDERS:  Good to be with you. COOPER:  So\u2026 (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  \u2013 you have had, obviously, quite a few days.  It\u2019s been quite a \u2013 quite a whirlwind for you.  I understand your campaigned \u2013 the campaign says you\u2019ve raised at least $3 million since \u2013 since Iowa. I\u2019m wondering out there, in New Hampshire today, what are you feeling? What sort of momentum? Are you feeling the Bern? (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  We\u2019re feeling great. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  Yes, I am, now that you ask.  We\u2019re feeling really great.  I think the message that we are bringing forth is resonating with the American people.  And you talked about money.  One of the things that has happened in our campaign, Anderson, which has blown me away, it really has, is we have received three and a half million individual contributions.  That is more than any candidate in the history of the United States up until this point. And you know what the average contribution is? COOPER:  Twenty-seven dollars. SANDERS:  Hey, you heard. COOPER:  Ah, good. SANDERS:  And that\u2019s pretty \u2013 and in a day of super PACs, where people are raising huge amounts of money from Wall Street and the drug companies, the fact that millions of individual contributions from working people and the middle class, who want us to go forward and to transform this country in very significant ways is very moving to me. COOPER:  I\u2019m just going to ask a couple of questions then we\u2019re really going to get it over to \u2013 to the audience. There is an expectations game being played.  And we\u2019ve been seeing this from both campaigns in New Hampshire. Hillary Clinton keeps \u2013 campaign keeps pointing to the fact that you\u2019re from a neighboring state\u2026 SANDERS:  Right. COOPER:  \u2013 that you\u2019re way up in the polls. Are you still an underdog? SANDERS:  Of course we\u2019re an underdog.  We are taking on the most powerful political organization in the country.  And that\u2019s, you know, the Clinton organization.  Secretary Clinton obviously ran here in 2008 and she won.  Her husband ran here several times before that. So this is her fourth campaign in that family here in New Hampshire. It is clear that many people in New Hampshire do know me, because I come from a neighboring state.  And SANDERS:  Her husband ran here several times before that.  So this is her fourth campaign in that family here in New Hampshire. It is clear that many people in New Hampshire do know me because I come from a neighboring state.  And I think we have support because people over the years have seen the work that I am doing in standing up for working families and the middle class. But in general, we started this campaign nationally, as you well know, 40-50 points behind Sec. Clinton.  We had no money.  We had no organization.  And we had relatively little name recognition.  I think it\u2019s fair to say we have come a pretty long way in the last nine months. COOPER:  You are \u2013 I mean according to the latest I think CNN poll you\u2019re up some 23 points some people say or believe here in New Hampshire.  Obviously we know polls can get it wrong.  How do you not underperform here?  Because there is an expectation\u2026 SANDERS:  That\u2019s the media game.  That\u2019s what media talks about.  Who cares? The point is underperform \u2013 the point is we are going to work as hard as we can to win.  And after we do hopefully well here we\u2019re going to go onto Nevada and then South Carolina and do as well as we can all over this country. I got to say, all due respect, that\u2019s media stuff.  Over \u2013 you know I think some of these polls\u2026 COOPER:  You don\u2019t look at polls, your campaign? SANDERS:  Sure we do.  But some of these polls are off the charts.  We\u2019re not \u2013 I mean I think this is going to be a very close election here in New Hampshire. COOPER:  There\u2019s been some back and forth on the campaign trail today about is Hillary Clinton a progressive.  We\u2019re going to get to that later on because we\u2019ve got some questions from the audience about that, and some other questions. But Sen. Barbara Boxer, a supporter of Clinton, came back, fired back basically at your campaign today, at you, saying of course Hillary Clinton is progressive and asked you know \u2013 said that Bernie Sanders is a Democrat on some days.  You had said that Hillary Clinton is a progressive on some days.  Is that fair?  Because there are some Democrats who \u2013 I mean in your heart are you a Democrat? SANDERS:  Sure.  I have made a decision to run for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States.  I was for 16 years in the House Democratic Caucus, for nine years in the Senate Democratic Caucus. Right now I am the ranking member of the Budget Committee, appointed by the Democratic leadership and membership.  A couple of years ago I was very proudly the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee.  So of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination. In terms of Sec. Clinton, I know the media is kind of making a big deal about this. All that I said, which is simply true, is I think it was in November in Ohio. You may recall this. COOPER:  Yes. SANDERS:  I don\u2019t know the context of it, but Sec. Clinton said some people call me a \u2013 paraphrasing, some people call me a moderate.  And I proudly say that I am a moderate.  That\u2019s what she said. So all I said you can\u2019t go and say you\u2019re a moderate on one day and be a progressive on the other day.  Some of my best friends are moderates.  I love moderates. But you can\u2019t be a moderate and a progressive.  They are different. COOPER:  We\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that.  But I want to go to our audience.  Our first guest Chris Brunel (ph), he\u2019s an office administrator in Nashua.  He said he\u2019s leading toward supporting you, but he\u2019s got some questions about your tax policies. SANDERS:  Sure. QUESTION:  Sen. Sanders, the first thing I hear about you is that you\u2019re going to raise taxes on the middle class.  I support my family on a salary of $41,000 a year.  I\u2019m wondering if you raise my taxes, how does that help me? SANDERS:  Could I stand up? COOPER:  You can do whatever you want. SANDERS:  OK. Chris, thanks very much for that good question.  This is what we are going to do. The United States is the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people.  And we end up spending far, far more per capita on health care as do the people of any other country: Canada, U.K., France, whatever. What we are going to fight for is a Medicare for All single payer program, which would provide comprehensive health care to your family and every family in America. So let me tell you what we do. We raise your taxes if you\u2019re somewhere in the middle of the economy about $500. But you know what we\u2019re going to do for health care?  We\u2019re going to reduce your health care costs by $5,000. So you\u2019re going to pay a little bit more in taxes.  But you\u2019re no longer going to have to pay private health insurance premiums. Now, I\u2019ve been criticized for this.  But I believe that health care is a right of all people, that we should not have these deductibles and copayments.  We should not be paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  And our Medicare for All program will guarantee comprehensive care to all people, and save middle class families some thousands of dollars a year. COOPER:  Chris, let me just ask you.  Does that math work for you? QUESTION:  I mean if it saves me on health insurance premiums I will gladly pay more taxes. SANDERS:  See.  And, Chris, what happens in politics \u2013 I don\u2019t want to shock anybody in the office.  Sometimes people distort things.  I mean I\u2019ve had 30-second ads run against me.  \u201cBernie is going to raise your taxes.\u201d  But they forget to say we\u2019re going to do away with your private health insurance premiums. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She attacks us.  But they forget to say we\u2019re going to do away with your private health insurance premiums.  Bottom line here is we spend almost three times more per person than the British, 50 percent more than the French.  We can save substantial sums of money, and my Medicare for all system is funded in a very progressive way.  Yes, you\u2019ll pay a little bit more, but your health premiums will disappear. ANDERSON COOPER:  That\u2019s assuming you can get that through, though. SANDERS:  Well, that\u2019s \u2013 you know, that\u2019s true.  But all of what I am trying to do assumes something.  When I talk about making public colleges and universities tuition free, and doing that and paying for that through a tax on Wall Street speculation.  When I talk about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, which as you know is in disrepair all over this country, and talk about doing away with huge loopholes that major corporations now enjoy \u2013 so that in a given year you have these large corporations making billions, not paying a nickel in taxes because they\u2019re putting their money in the Cayman Islands.  Now how do we get these things through?  What this campaign is about is, not just electing a President, it is creating a political revolution where millions of people, many of whom have not been involved in the political process, stand up and demand a government which represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.  That\u2019s how we make change. COOPER:  Let me ask you\u2026  When you, when you use the term revolution, makes some people nervous.  What\u2019s wrong with evolution? SANDERS:  Well, I think what we \u2013 you know, we had the, remember the Reagan revolution, and the Gingrich revolution, well, my revolution\u2019s a little bit different.  But it is a process.  Look, let\u2019s be clear.  We have one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth.  In the last election where Republicans won a huge victory, 63 percent of the American people didn\u2019t vote, 80 percent of young people didn\u2019t vote.  Now, when people don\u2019t vote, there\u2019s a political vacuum that\u2019s created.  And I will tell you how it\u2019s filled.  It\u2019s filled by lobbyists and campaign contributors who could care less about the middle class, who are there to protect the wealthiest people in this country.  So what we are trying to do \u2013 and I would tell you, Anderson, with some success \u2013 is bring working people and young people and lower income people into the political process.  And when that happens, you know what, we will raise the minimum raise, we will have health care for all people, we will make public colleges and universities tuition free. COOPER:  I want to \u2013 want you meet Jason Telerski, he\u2019s in IT management, he\u2019s in IT management.  He says you are his dream candidate, but he does have some\u2026 SANDERS:  Oh.  Buts always make me nervous.  All right, Jason, fire away. JASON TELERSKI:  So you are my dream candidate in a lot of ways.  The message of your campaign really speaks to me and on some issues I feel that you actually speak for me.  But I also know that most people don\u2019t have the same class-based view of the world that, that I do and that I think you do as well.  I\u2019ve seen all of your debates, and I just don\u2019t see you connecting with the people that view, view the world through a religious or racial lens, people that see those as the powerful forces in our society.  I\u2019m wondering what you can do to better engage with the broader electorate to understand, and understand their points of view, demonstrate that you can be an effective leader for them. SANDERS:  Very good question and I thank you for it.  We are reaching out, as strongly as we can, for example to the African-American community, and to the Latino community. And I think we are gaining more and more support in those communities, for a couple of reasons.  Number one, within the African-American community, it\u2019s not only an economic issue, raising the minimum wage and providing jobs.  Youth unemployment for African-American kids now is 51 percent.  So those are important issues, but I\u2019ll tell you what else is an important issue, and that is the criminal justice issue.  The fact that we have more people in jail in American than any other country, disproportionately African-American and Latino.  The fact that blacks and whites do marijuana at about an equal level, and yet four times more blacks get arrests.  The fact that blacks are more likely to be stopped by police in a, in a vehicle and get arrested than whites.  Those are huge issues.  And what I have said and repeat through a virtually all-white state, but I\u2019ll say this all over the country.  There will be no President who will fight harder to end institutional racism than I will, and we have got to reform a very, very broken criminal justice system.  It breaks my heart, and I know that it breaks the hearts of millions of people in this country to see videos on television of unarmed people, often African-American, shot by police.  That has got to end, and these are issues that I take very seriously, Jason. COOPER:  You know, I want to follow up because Jason also mentioned faith, which is something you\u2019ve spoke a little bit about.  You\u2019re Jewish but you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re not active\u2026. \u2026 African-Americans, shot by police.  That has got to end.  And these are issues that I take very seriously, Jason. COOPER:  You know, I want to follow up, because Jason also mentioned faith, which is something you\u2019ve spoken a little bit about.  You\u2019re Jewish, but you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re not actively involved with organized religion. What do you say to a voter out there who says \u2013 and that who sees faith as a guiding principle in their lives, and wants it to be a guiding principle for this country? SANDERS:  It\u2019s a guiding principle in my life, absolutely, it is.  You know, everybody practices religion in a different way.  To me, I would not be here tonight, I would not be running for president of the United States if I did not have very strong religious and spiritual feelings. I believe that, as a human being, the pain that one person feels, if we have children who are hungry in America, if we have elderly people who can\u2019t afford their prescription drugs, you know what, that impacts you, that impacts me. And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say, it doesn\u2019t matter to me, I got it, I don\u2019t care about other people. So my spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.  That\u2019s my very strong spiritual feeling. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Senator, I want you to meet Denise Spenard.  She was wounded in the Boston Marathon bombing.  She says she\u2019s undecided.  She has got a question about terrorism. DENISE SPENARD, BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING SURVIVOR:  Yes, I am a fortunate survivor from the Boston bombing.  And it has changed my life.  And one of the biggest things is participating in events, large events.  And I\u2019m running the marathon again\u2026 SANDERS:  Good for you. SPENARD:  \u2026 this year with my husband.  But my kids are going\u2026 (APPLAUSE) SPENARD:  Thank you.  Thank you. So, my kids are going to be out there spectating.  And I can only think about their safety while they\u2019re out there.  So my question to you is, what are your plans for keeping us safe from terrorism? SANDERS:  OK.  For a start, in my view, we have got to crush ISIS, all right, for a start.  And as somebody who voted against the war in Iraq, what I believe is we\u2019ve got to learn the lessons of that war. So we have to destroy ISIS, but we have to be not just tough, we have to be smart.  And that means we work with a large coalition, led by on-the-ground Muslim troops.  King Abdullah of Jordan made the point, it will be Muslim troops who destroy ISIS, because ISIS has hijacked their religion. The United States, the U.K., France, Germany, Russia provide support, in my view, to the troops on the ground.  So we\u2019ve got to crush them. Internally, what we have got to do is significantly improve intelligence.  And I think we are not as strong as we can be in communicating with intelligence agencies all over this country. If people come into this country, say, I\u2019ve got to be screened although I happen to believe that we should accept refugees from the Middle East, from Syria and Afghanistan. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  But I also appreciate the concern that others have, that we have got to screen those people, absolutely, thoroughly.  There needs to be better coordination between federal, state, and local police. We have to work, which is very hard, making sure that we are tracking Internet transmission of information, where ISIS has been successful in getting information out and recruiting people. But your concerns \u2013 and again, thank you, you\u2019re a symbol of courage, that you went through that horror in Boston and you\u2019re going back and you\u2019re running again.  Thank you for your courage. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want to just follow up, just briefly on that.  There is a disconnect.  Democrats in Iowa who said that terrorism was the most important issue for them, they back Secretary Clinton over you by 37 points. Why do you think that is?  Why do you think they see her as more ready to handle that? SANDERS:  Well, I think because she has a great deal of experience.  She was secretary of state of our country for four years. But I would say, Anderson, that the key foreign policy vote in modern American history was whether or not we should go into Iraq.  And Secretary Clinton was in the Senate then, I was in the House then. We both listened to the same evidence.  I made the decision, which I think history will conclude was the right decision, not to go to war.  And if people want to go to my Web site, berniesanders.com, check out what I said in 2002. And it gives me no \u2013 no joy at all to say that much of what I feared would happen did, in fact, happen in terms of the destabilization of the region. So I think in terms of foreign policy, I have the judgment.  We\u2019ve been all over this world, met with foreign leaders.  And I am confident that we can assemble a team that would do a great job. COOPER:  I want you to meet Gabriel Grave (ph). She\u2019s a student here in New Hampshire.  She\u2019s an Independent voter, but she\u2019s supporting you. GABRIEL GRAVE:  Hi. So I\u2019m from Brooklyn, New York, like you are.  And my question is that I\u2019ve experienced and I\u2019ve witnessed a lot of police brutality and racial unjustice. And I want to know like I think and I do believe that it is neighborhoods primarily of people of color or lower income neighborhoods that are disproportionately affected by unjust policing. And I want to know if you are to be elected as president of the United States, what would you do to enact change and combat this racial injustice? SANDERS:  Right. GRAVE:  Thank you. SANDERS:  Gabriel, you have asked a \u2013 an important question that is on the minds of millions of people, not just African-Americans, but \u2013 but all people. Here\u2019s what I would do. For a start \u2013 and I speak as a former mayor.  I was the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, as many know, who worked very closely with our police department and believe that the vast majority of police officers in this country are hardworking, honest and are trying to do their best, doing very, very difficult work. But if a police officer breaks the law like any other public official, that police officer must be held accountable.  That\u2019s number one. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  Number two, you have seen on television, as I have, local police departments that look like occupying armies.  We have got to demilitarize local police departments, make them part of the community, not invading armies. Third\u2026 (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  \u2013 third, and very importantly, we have got to make police departments look like the communities that they serve.  So if there\u2019s a diverse community, the police department should reflect that diversity. Fourthly, in terms of police action, the federal \u2013 you know, police departments are run by local governments.  But the federal government can play an important role in helping to fund model type programs. For example, I think we have to rethink the use of lethal force.  I think too often, lethal force goes first rather than last.  Obviously, there are times when policemen must use their guns and use them as quickly as possible. But I think what we need to do is figure out ways to train police departments so that police officers \u2013 so that lethal force is the last resort, not the first resort. So that\u2019s some of the things that I would do. COOPER:  I want to ask you \u2013 because I think a lot of people don\u2019t know much about your background on this subject.  And it\u2019s interesting, 54 years ago, you were in the front lines of trying to desegregate school housing at the University of Chicago.  You were even arrested. SANDERS:  Don\u2019t tell anybody that. COOPER:  What was it that motivated a 20-year-old white kid from Brooklyn to do that? SANDERS:  You know, it\u2019s hard to say what motivates anybody.  I think as a kid, I did \u2013 my parents weren\u2019t political.  My brother was a little bit.  My parents were not. But, you know, it \u2013 you know, like in any school you see big kids picking on little kids, you know.  And I resented that.  I always did. And, you know, injustice bothered me very, very much.  And when I went to the University of Chicago, I had the opportunity to \u2013 I wasn\u2019t a great student, I have to \u2013 I have to admit it.  In fact, I learned more off campus \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say this to other students, though. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  Do your homework, study, but\u2026 COOPER:  You\u2019ve got a lot of teachers in this room. SANDERS:  But I learned a lot off \u2013 off of campus and I got involved in a group some may know, some not, called the Congress on Racial Equality.  And it was a great group and we got involved in trying to desegregate the housing owned by the University of Chicago, segregated housing.  And we also got involved in efforts to desegregate the school system there and I got arrested. But I think, you know, as far back as I can remember \u2013 and, Anderson, I can\u2019t tell you why, but injustice is something that I have always fought throughout my life. COOPER:  I want you to meet Keith Howard. He\u2019s a veteran.  He was harmless after serving in the Army.  He\u2019s now the executive director of Liberty House, which is a transitional facility for former homeless vets.  He says he\u2019s undecided. Keith, welcome. KEITH HOWARD:  Yes.  Senator Sanders, throughout this election cycle, we\u2019ve been contacted \u2013 we at Liberty House have been contacted by a number of Republican presidential candidates.  To date, we\u2019ve not heard from any Democrats. Have you ceded the support of veterans to the Republicans? And if your answer is no, what is your evidence? SANDERS:  What is my evidence? My evidence is that I am the former chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs.  That I introduced, along with the support of the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam vets of virtually every major veterans organization, the most comprehensive veterans health care legislation in the modern history of the United States of America. And sadly enough, you know it\u2019s one thing, Paul, Republicans talk about how much they love veterans.  I got two Republican votes on a comprehensive bill supported by virtually the entire Veterans Committee. But I didn\u2019t give up.  What I did then is work with people like John McCain, Jeff Miller over in the House.  And we passed \u2013 wasn\u2019t my ideal bill, I compromised.  But it was the most significant piece of veterans health care legislation passed in modern history.  We put some $16 billion in to veterans\u2019 health care, as well as in taking care of veterans in a number of areas. So it\u2019s easy for politicians to give speeches.  But what my work in the Senate has been involved is to making sure that veterans in this country get the best quality health care possible, get their benefits when they need them, not wait years and years.  And we\u2019ve made some progress on that. Do our best to end veterans\u2019 homelessness.  President Obama put a lot of money into that.  And we have had some success.  Still have a way to go. So I think if you check my record it will tell you that I received the award, the highest award from the American Legion and the VFW for my work on veterans\u2019 issues.  So I\u2019m proud of that. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Let me follow up on that.  You were on the Veterans Affairs Committee for eight years.  You headed it for two years. SANDERS:  Yes. COOPER:  There were 18 inspector general reports talking about problems plaguing the VA.  Why did it take so long?  And did it take you too long to act? SANDERS:  Well, a fair question.  And I think you know the answer is that we have worked on many, many issues, Anderson.  And your point is fair that we should\u2019ve acted sooner.  We should\u2019ve known what was going on in Phoenix, those long waiting lines and the lies that some administrators were telling us. On the other hand, what we also did, though, is make significant progress in terms of dealing with homelessness.  We passed a post 9/11 GI bill, which provides college education for the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.   We passed a Caregivers Act, which for the first time will provide support for those folks, mostly women, who are staying home with disabled vets. So I think in recent years we have made some progress.  Your point is a good one.  We should have done better. COOPER:  All right.  I want you to meet Marjorie Smith.  She served nine terms in the state house here.  She says she\u2019s currently undecided.  Welcome. QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Senator, you and I have a lot in common.  I was born in Brooklyn in 1941. SANDERS:  There we go. QUESTION:  So\u2026 SANDERS:  You look younger than I do.  Why is that? (LAUGHTER) QUESTION:  That\u2019s very kind of you to say.  But I\u2019m not running for president. (LAUGHTER) Senator, many of us see how deeply held your philosophy, and that matters a lot to us.  We share those goals. At the same time, you have worked for many years to say it\u2019s my way or the highway.  You talked tonight about wanting to have a revolution in the House and Senate in order to get people there who share your views. There might be some new members of the House and Senate.  But they\u2019re not going to be all that many.  How are you going to be able to work with a Congress that might not share our deeply held goals in order to achieve a more perfect union? SANDERS:  Well, Marjorie, thank you for your question.  It is just not accurate to say \u2013 you know sometimes people may portray me in this respect.  It is not accurate to say that it\u2019s my way or the highway.  Let me give you some examples. I just mentioned that I compromised significantly with people like John McCain and Republicans in the House to pass what is regarded as the most significant piece of veterans\u2019 legislation passed in many, many years. Second of all, when I was in the House of Representatives, there were years, Marjorie, where I received more votes.  I won more amendments than any other member of the House of Representatives because I reached out where there was common ground with Republicans. So I think I have a history of being able to work with Republicans when there is common ground. But here is the major point that I want to make.  And I will continue to do that.  But here is the truth, and it\u2019s an unpleasant truth, and I know that not everybody here will agree with me. In my view, we have a Congress today that is much more interested in doing the bidding of the wealthy and the powerful, Wall Street and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industries, rather than the needs of the American people. And I believe we\u2019re not going to make the real changes that we need, dealing with the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, reforming a corrupt campaign finance system which allows billionaires to buy elections, dealing with climate change, making sure we don\u2019t continue to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs when last year the three major drug companies made $45 billion in profit. Now, how do we change all of that?  Well, where we can, we work with our Republican friends.  But change, in my view, and what history tells us, has always come from the bottom on up. That\u2019s what the Civil Rights movement was about.  That\u2019s what the women\u2019s movement was about.  That\u2019s what the gay movement was about.  That\u2019s what the environmental movement is about. And what we need right now is a very profound and deep movement this country, where millions of people, in fact, get involved and say, I\u2019m sorry, my kid is not going to have to graduate college $100,000 in debt.  That\u2019s wrong. My mom is entitled to decent health care and prescription drugs that she can afford.  Those are the kinds of movements that we need, and that\u2019s how we will bring about real change in this country. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want you to meet Mark Viens.  He\u2019s a graphic artist.  He\u2019s a Boy Scout master.  He says he decided to support you in the primary. Your question. MARK VIENS, GRAPHIC ARTIST:  Good evening, Senator. SANDERS:  That\u2019s because I was a Boy Scout too. (LAUGHTER) VIENS:  Good evening, Senator.  Four of our last five presidents were elected and served two terms.  Do you see any limitations for yourself in the ability to serve two terms to enact these sweeping changes that you envision for our country? SANDERS:  I don\u2019t, Mark.  You know, we\u2019ll take one term at a time. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  Got to get to the first term first. COOPER:  You would be 83 at the end of your second term. SANDERS:  Well, you know, thank goodness. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  Let\u2019s not be ageist, Anderson. COOPER:  I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  You know, I am, thank God, in good health.  And one can\u2019t predict the future, one never knows what happens tomorrow.  But, thank God, I have \u2013 when I was a kid, I was a long-distance runner.  I was not quite the marathon runner, but I was a cross-country runner. And I\u2019ve had good endurance and good strength my whole life.  So, you know, if I am fortunate enough to win the general election, and we do well, yes, I would like to run for re-election. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  You\u2019ve got a lot more energy than I do, certainly. (LAUGHTER) COOPER:  We\u2019re going to take a quick break.  We\u2019re going to be right back with more audience questions for Senator Sanders.  You\u2019re watching the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall, live from New Hampshire. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER:  And welcome back to CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall in the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. We\u2019re here with Senator Bernie Sanders. We continue the questions. I want to play for Senator Sanders a clip from Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech Monday night after the Iowa Caucuses. Let\u2019s listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON:  Here\u2019s what I want you to know. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  It is rare\u2026 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE). CLINTON:  \u2013 it is rare that we have the opportunity we do now\u2026 UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Yes. CLINTON:  \u2013 to have a real contest of ideas. (CROSSTALK) CLINTON:  To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it. I am a progressive who gets things done for people. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER:  There were a lot of your supporters who, when they heard that, didn\u2019t think or expressed their belief that she\u2019s not a progressive.  We talked about this a little bit at the beginning. But just so we\u2019re clear, do you believe Hillary Clinton is a progressive? SANDERS:  Let me just say this.  I have, um, enormous respect for Hillary Clinton.  I\u2019ve known her for 25 years.  And it\u2019s unfortunate, you know, in politics \u2013 and everybody should know this.  What media often wants you to do and you\u2019re asked this question, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for Secretary Clinton, beat her up.  Tell me something terrible about her.  Attack her, because that will make the news. I have tried my best not to do that.  You\u2019re looking at a guy who has been in politics a long time. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  And I have never run a negative ad in my life and I look forward to never running a negative ad in my life, OK.  I don\u2019t think people deserve that.  We have to \u2013 as Secretary Clinton just said, that\u2019s what politics is about.  It\u2019s a debate on the issues. Secretary Clinton has a long and distinguished public career.  She has worked with children when she began, and God only knows that we need a lot of work, given the fact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth. So I respect it.  I thought she did a good job as secretary of State.  I served with her in the Senate.  We worked together on some issues. But there are other issues, Anderson, where I think she is just not progressive.  I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15 million from Wall Street.  That\u2019s just not progressive. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  As I mentioned earlier, the key foreign policy vote of modern American history was the war in Iraq.  The progressive community was pretty united in saying don\u2019t listen to Bush.  Don\u2019t go to war. Secretary Clinton voted to go to war. Virtually all of the trade unions and millions of working people understand that our trade policies \u2013 NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, etc.  \u2013 have been written by corporate America and the goal of it is to be able to throw American workers\u2026 millions of working people understand that our trade policies, NAFTA, CAFTA, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, et cetera, have been written by corporate America. And the goal of it is to be able to throw American workers out on the street, move to China and other low-wage countries, and bring their products back into this country.  And that\u2019s one of the reasons why the middle class of this country and the working class is struggling so hard. Secretary Clinton has been a supporter in the past of various trade policies, NAFTA and PNTR with China.  Reluctantly, and after a lot of pressure on her, she came out against the TPP, and I\u2019m glad that she did. Every sensible person understands that climate change is real.  It is caused by human activity.  And we have got to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. For a long time, Secretary Clinton was talking about the benefits of the Keystone pipeline.  Well, there are no benefits to excavating and transporting some of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world. I was in the lead in opposition to the Keystone pipeline.  I\u2019m in opposition to the pipeline right here in New Hampshire and the pipeline in Vermont.  I think we have got to move aggressively away from fossil fuel if we\u2019re going to leave this planet in a way that\u2019s healthy and habitable for our kids. So those are just some of the areas\u2026 (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Just one quick follow-up to that.  There\u2019s a new book called \u201cBuyer\u2019s Remorse: How Obama Led Progressives Down,\u201d you gave it a ringing endorsement\u2026 SANDERS:  No, I didn\u2019t give it a ringing endorsement. COOPER:  But you blurbed it. SANDERS:  No, not true. COOPER:  OK.  You tell me what you did. SANDERS:  I wrote a blurb for it.  You may have the blurb there.  And what the blurb said is that I think the next president should be very aggressive in bringing people into the political process. And that, I believe, from the bottom of my heart.  And if elected president, that will be a top priority of mine. COOPER:  Did President Obama let progressives down? SANDERS:  I think in some areas, progressive \u2013 for example, in the trade area.  Right now, I think they signed today the TPP in New Zealand.  I think it is a continuation of bad trade policies.  The president supports it, I strongly disagree with it. On the other hand, let\u2019s be very clear.  And I got a little bit upset that our Republicans friends suffer from a very serious illness called amnesia. (LAUGHTER) SANDERS:  They forgot what the economy of this country was like seven years ago when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, when we were running up a $1.4 trillion deficit, and by the way, the world\u2019s financial system was on the verge of collapse. President Obama and Vice President Biden have taken us a very, very long way from those dismal days.  Are we where we want to be today?  No.  But we have come a long way and President Obama deserves an enormous amount of credit for that. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Senator, as you know, in a recent poll, I\u2019m sure, 88 percent of adults in New Hampshire said heroin abuse is a very serious problem in the state.  I want you to meet David Cote. He\u2019s a recovery coach who\u2019s in long-term recovery himself.  He says he\u2019s undecided, leaning towards you. David, thanks for being here.  What\u2019s your question? DAVID COTE, RECOVERY COACH:  Thank you. Thank you, Senator, for hearing me.  I come to you tonight as the father of a teenager.  I have a young teenage daughter.  And my biggest concern these days is the availability of opiates and other drugs, substances on the street, and the effects that they have on our youth and on our citizens. My question to you is, we\u2019re losing 129 people a day in this country.  In the city of Manchester, we\u2019re losing one person a week at \u2013 you know\u2026 SANDERS:  Unbelievable. COTE:  \u2026 minimally.  And my question to you is, if \u2013 what would you do in order to secure recovery services for those that have slipped through the cracks of prevention and moved on to treatment? SANDERS:  Thank you very much for your question.  It is a crisis here in New Hampshire.  And by the way, there\u2019s a crisis in Vermont.  You may recall our governor gave his state of the union speech a year ago on this issue. Because, you know, people think, well, New Hampshire and Vermont, these are rural states, not a problem.  You\u2019re right, it is a terrible problem.  What do we do? For a start, we understand that substance abuse and addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  And when I talk about moving toward universal health care, what I understand that to be, and it is absolutely imperative that it be, is understanding that mental health and addiction is part of health care. And what that means is that when people need treatment they shouldn\u2019t have to wait three months.  When they need it, they should be able to get it.  So that means we need a revolution in this country in mental health care to address the causes of addiction and provide treatment. And I was to a treatment center in Manchester, which is kind of peer-oriented.  Former people who had addiction work with other people.  That\u2019s one approach.  There are many other approaches. But the bottom line is we have a very, very serious crisis in this country.  And we have got to make sure that when people need the help, they get the help. And the other question that we have to ask is, and it\u2019s a tough question.  Nobody I know knows the answer.  Why is it?  Why is it? One of the reasons, by the way, is I think that doctors are prescribing opiates in a way that they have got to cut back a little bit on.  They\u2019re giving out a whole lot of pills.  A friend of mine got a molar removed.  They got 50 very strong painkilling drugs. And these drugs are rampant.  Kids are using them, getting addicted then getting into heroin.  So I think we got to talk to the pharmaceutical industry about what they\u2019re producing, doctors what they\u2019re prescribing.  And then we have to make treatment available to people when they need it. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want you to meet Raul Bernal (ph).  He\u2019s a Democrat.  He says he\u2019s undecided. Raul? SANDERS:  First name is? QUESTION:  Raul. SANDERS:  Raul. QUESTION:  Right.  Sen. Sanders, thank you very much for a great campaign that you\u2019ve run.  Voters in Iowa, voters in New Hampshire have had an opportunity to get to know you, to understand the details of your platform in forums just like this.  And while I\u2019m inspired by your passion on the issues, one of the concerns I have is your electability in a general election when there\u2019s less opportunity to really connect with voters. SANDERS:  Good. QUESTION:  And you know, can you win\u2026 SANDERS:  Good. QUESTION:  \u2026 in other parts of the country? SANDERS:  Excellent question. Look, in the real world there are people \u2013 I hesitate to say this in this room, but there are people who like Donald Trump.  I know.  Not in this room, but there are.  And you know that\u2019s the world. We are a diverse political nation.  And there are people who like and respect Hillary Clinton and people who like me and so forth and so on.  And I don\u2019t object.  Somebody will stand up and say I support Hillary Clinton.  That\u2019s fine you know. But what I don\u2019t \u2013 I object to is people say well Bernie, I really like you.  I like your ideas.  I like your record.  But I\u2019m not going to vote for you because you can\u2019t win.  OK.  So let me address that issue. Number one, I\u2019m not a great fan of polls, not even CNN polls. (LAUGHTER) But CNN had a poll, as I recall.  And what that poll said is that Bernie Sanders ran significantly better against Donald Trump than did Hillary Clinton.  OK.  There was another poll said the same thing because among other things I do very well with Independents.  And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are doing well against Republicans. So number one, some of these polls have me way, way ahead of Donald Trump, further so than Sec. Clinton. Number two, look at battleground states like New Hampshire.  The last poll that I saw in New Hampshire had me 19 points ahead of Trump, Sec. Clinton 1 point.  OK.  Similar results, not quite so strong, in Iowa and Wisconsin. OK.  Polls, forget polls.  They go up and down.  What else? Democrats win elections when there is a large voter turnout.  That\u2019s what Obama did in 2008.  Republicans win elections when people are demoralized and give up on the political process. I believe, and I think an objective assessment of my campaign and Sec. Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2013 she\u2019s running a good campaign.  But I think an objective assessment would say that there is more excitement and energy in our campaign.  We are bringing out working class people who have previously given up on politics.  We are bringing out large numbers of young people. So if you want to win in November.  And I want us to defeat Republicans.  Sec. Clinton wants us to defeat Republicans. Everybody in this room understands that we don\u2019t want some right-wing Republican in the Oval Office.  But I believe, quite honestly that I am the strongest candidate to do that because I think I can drive a large voter turnout, bring in new energy into the Democratic Party. COOPER:  Let me ask you because\u2026 (APPLAUSE) \u2026 as you know\u2026 (APPLAUSE) As you know in this state an Independent, and there are a lot of Independents in this state, they can vote in the Republican primary.  They can vote in the Democratic primary.  So there are some voters out there, Independent voters, who are trying to decide between you or Donald Trump.  What would you say to them? SANDERS:  This is what I would say.  I would say that examine Trump\u2019s record carefully.  And it is not only his bigoted remarks against Latinos ANDERSON COOPER:  \u2026you or Donald Trump.  What would you say to them? SANDERS:  This is what I would say.  I would say that examine Trump\u2019s record carefully.  And it is not only his bigoted remarks against Latinos, suggesting that Mexicans coming into this country are rapists, or criminals, or drug dealers, or his absurd remark that we should not allow Muslims into this country \u2013 even above and beyond those outrageous bigoted statements, take a look at what he stand for economically.  This country has millions of people struggling economically.  I believe we should raise the minimum wage to $15 over the next couple of years.  Trumps says, no, $7.25, we should not raise the minimum wage.  Most workers don\u2019t agree with that.  Trump in a Republican debated said wage are too high in America.  Really?  Too high in America?  That\u2019s what he said in a Republican debate.  And here\u2019s the other one that kind of blows me away.  Trump is, as you know, a well-know, a well-known scientist, brilliant scientist.  And he has concluded, after years of studying the issue, that climate change is a hoax brought to us by the Chinese.  Now that shocked me, Anderson, because I thought that he would have thought it was a hoax brought to us by the Mexicans or the Muslims.  Chinese I didn\u2019t quite get.  But the point is, if you examine his agenda, it is not an agenda for working Americans.  He wants to give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of one percent.  So I think \u2013 and I would love the opportunity, frankly I\u2019m prejudiced, I want Trump to win the Republican nomination \u2013 and I would love the opportunity to run against him.  I think we would win by a (lot). COOPER:  I just have a few more.  Actually it (looks like it seems)\u2026  So we just have time for a few more questions.  We\u2019ve covered a lot of, a lot of foreign policy issues.  There\u2019s a lot of folks out who really don\u2019t know much about you, so I thought we\u2019d just ask a couple of sort of lighter questions just to kind get to know you.  I read one of daughters say that, if you had a car, or if they sold cars with manual locks on windows, that\u2019s the kind of car you would get.  So what kind of car do you actually have. SANDERS:  I have a small Chevrolet.  It is one of the smallest Chevys that they make. COOPER:  Do you know what year it\u2019s from? SANDERS:  Yeh, it\u2019s about five years old. COOPER:  OK, not bad. SANDERS:  A red car. COOPER:  Is it true you chop your own wood?  It\u2019s a red car. SANDERS:  Pretty good on mileage, but yeh. COOPER:  Is it true you chop your own wood. SANDERS:  I wouldn\u2019t go that far.  People in Vermont and New Hampshire would laugh at me.  What I do do is, you know, we have a wood stove and I, you know. COOPER:  You also in 1987, when you were Mayor of Burlington, you recorded an album on folk classics.  How are those pipes doing?  We\u2019re in an opera house, how are they?  Any more albums in your future? SANDERS:  Let me just say this.  If you\u2019re looking at a President who can carry a tune, I\u2019m not the guy.  I hope I have other attributes, but singing is not one of them.  It\u2019s the worst album.  Actually it\u2019s selling very well because people are buying it.  It\u2019s the worst album ever recorded.  People can\u2019t believe how bad it is. COOPER:  Along, along those same lines, I understand Larry David is hosting SNL this weekend.  He does a pretty good imitation of you.  Do you do a Larry David imitation? SANDERS:  Anderson, I\u2019m going to\u2026  I know you\u2019ve been in journalism for a long time. COOPER:  Are you doing your Larry David right now? SANDERS:  It\u2019s true.  I am Larry David.  And you didn\u2019t get it. COOPER:  What\u2019s you, what\u2019s your proudest moment?  Either professionally or personally. SANDERS:  I think my proudest general moment is being married for 27 years, having four great kids, some of whom are here tonight, and seven very beautiful grandchildren.  That\u2019s my proudest (inaudible). COOPER:  If we ask\u2026  Your wife, Jane, is here.  If we asked her to describe you in one word, what word do you think she\u2019d use? SANDERS:  Tell \u2018em, Jane. JANE SANDERS:  (inaudible). COOPER:  Anti\u2026? SANDERS:  Integrity. COOPER:  Integrity, OK.  I thought you said anti-greed.  Integrity, all right.  I want to give you, I want to, this final one, I want to give you 30 seconds to make a closing argument to the people in New Hampshire. SANDERS:  OK.  Thank you very much, and thanks for hosting this (event).  I\u2019ve enjoyed it.  This is called democracy and I love this.  Our country faces enormous problems.  And if I believe that establishment politics and establishment economics could solve the problems, I would not be running for President. The sad truth is that we have a rigged economic system.  People are working longer hours for lower wages.  Almost all new wealth and income is going to the top 1 percent and we have a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining democracy and allowing billionaires to buy elections. If elected president, I will do my best, working with the American people, as we revitalize our democracy, to take those issues on, to rebuild the American middle class and become the country that all of us know that we have the potential to be. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Senator Sanders, thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) SANDERS:  Thanks, Anderson. COOPER:  When we come back, Hillary Clinton takes the stage, taking questions from the audience. We\u2019ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) ANDERSON COOPER:  And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire. Thanks very much for being with us. You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. Please welcome the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Please. CLINTON:  Hello. Please welcome former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Have a seat. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Hello. COOPER:  Welcome. CLINTON:  Thank you very much. COOPER:  So you\u2019ve obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days.  Congratulations on winning in Iowa.  New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons.  How does it feel out there? CLINTON:  It feels great.  I\u2019ve had just an amazing time.  We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there, and then got to work the next day. And I\u2019m seeing a lot of old friends, meeting a lot of new people.  I have an uphill climb and I\u2019m going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire. As you said, they\u2019re people that I feel very close to.  They\u2019ve been good to my husband, to me, my family. But what\u2019s most important is the first in the nation primary.  It truly is a great opportunity to get out there, explain what you want to do as president, present your ideas, and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire. COOPER:  Bernie Sanders, just a short time ago, said he is the underdog here.  Your campaign has said, you know, he comes from neighboring Vermont, you guys are down in the polls. Do you feel you do better when you\u2019re fighting from behind? CLINTON:  You know, I don\u2019t know.  I\u2026 COOPER:  Does it bring out something in you? CLINTON:  Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what\u2019s at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary. But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  And so I \u2013 I\u2019m very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running.  I mean, we really have focused on issues.  We share a lot of the same big progressive goals, but we have different ways of going about them.  We bring different experiences. But we are contrasting on issues, compared to the Republicans who, I think, are contrasting on insults.  And I think it\u2019s a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire, get questions, have people vet them, and then let the voters make up their minds. COOPER:  You\u2019ve talked about progressive values.  Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive.  He said some days.  Are you really a progressive?  In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate. CLINTON:  Well, you know, you asked me this question in the first debate, right? COOPER:  I did.  And it\u2019s coming up again today. CLINTON:  And I said that I\u2019m a progressive who likes to get things done.  And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive. So I\u2019m not going to let that bother me.  I know where I stand.  I know who stands with me.  I know what I\u2019ve done.  But I don\u2019t think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate that, you know, if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me, you know, they\u2019re thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment. That\u2019s just not anything we need to do.  Let\u2019s have a good contest of ideas.  Let\u2019s contrast where we stand.  And that\u2019s what I intend to do for the next couple of days. COOPER:  It would obviously be historic if you were elected president, first female president. CLINTON:  You think so? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I\u2019ve studied a little bit of history.  But it seems like young women aren\u2019t rallying to this potentially historic moment.  And I say this in Iowa, among women under 30, Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points.  Why do you think that is? CLINTON:  That\u2019s amazing.  Yes.  Look, you know, I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people, men and women, supporting me.  But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for, what I\u2019ve accomplished, what I want to do for young people in our country. COOPER:  Why do you think it is?  That they\u2019re\u2026 CLINTON:  But I \u2013 well, you know, I don\u2019t really know, Anderson.  I think \u2013 here\u2019s what I want young people to know.  They don\u2019t have to be for me, I\u2019m going to be for them.  It doesn\u2019t really matter. (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  If they are not supporting me, I will be their president, I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve. As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere, I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American\u2026 CLINTON:  people across the country in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere.  I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged, put on the wrong side of American opportunity.  And I understand that. I mean the student debt problems, the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get.  But at the same time I\u2019m so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change. So I\u2019m impressed with them.  And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important.  But you\u2019ve got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people. I have a lot experience doing that.  I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country.  And I hope to have the chance to win their support. COOPER:  What\u2019s wrong with a revolution? CLINTON:  Well, that\u2019s for Sen. Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people.  I have a different take on it.  I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended. So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act.  It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman. (APPLAUSE) The Republicans are\u2026 (APPLAUSE) You know, the Republicans are determined to repeal it.  And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies. Sen. Sanders and I share the same goal.  We want to get to universal health care coverage.  Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare, as you remember. COOPER:  I remember. CLINTON:  I fought really hard.  The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me.  I know what it\u2019s like to go up against the status quo and special interests. So when President Obama succeeded, I was thrilled.  I don\u2019t agree with Sen. Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again.  We\u2019re at 90 percent coverage.  I\u2019m going to fix what needs to be fixed.  We\u2019re going to move from 90 to 100, which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100. So we have a difference.  And I think that\u2026 (APPLAUSE) \u2026 is the difference. COOPER:  I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience. CLINTON:  Sure. COOPER:  This is Dave Skinell (ph).  He\u2019s a high school English teacher from Manchester.  He says he\u2019s undecided. David? CLINTON:  Hi, David. QUESTION:  Hi, Sec. Clinton.  You \u2013 the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make. CLINTON:  Right. QUESTION:  I\u2019m wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test.  And if your answer is no, aren\u2019t certain critical issues like marriage equality, campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination? CLINTON:  Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, Dave.  I do have a litmus test.  I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you.  The next president could get as many as three appointments.  You know one of the many reasons why we can\u2019t turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court. I\u2019m looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don\u2019t have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act. I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate.  It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research.  Supreme Court comes along.  They substitute their judgment for the Congress, signed by George W. Bush. That is one of our problems.  They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is. So they have given way too much power to corporations.  They have given Citizens United, the biggest gift to the Koch brothers, Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I don\u2019t share, and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back. We have to preserve marriage equality.  We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community\u2026 (APPLAUSE) We\u2019ve got to make sure\u2026 (APPLAUSE) We\u2019ve got to make sure to preserve Roe v. Wade, not let it be nibbled away or repealed.  We\u2019ve got work to do\u2026 (APPLAUSE) And here\u2019s how I CLINTON:  \u2013 to make sure\u2026 (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make sure to preserve \u201cRoe v. Wade,\u201d not let it be nibbled away or repealed.  We\u2019ve got work to do and\u2026 (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  \u2013 here\u2019s how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices. I\u2019m looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power.  If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it. So I have very strong feelings about what I\u2019ll be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  OK. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want you to meet Mr. Jim Kinhan (ph). He\u2019s a Democrat who says he is supporting you. JIM KINHAN:  Hello, Madam Secretary. CLINTON:  Thank you. KINHAN:  I\u2019m very pleased to see you. This may come a little bit from right field, this may seem, but it\u2019s very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues. The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer.  And I\u2019m walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary, comfortably and spiritually. But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make, as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people, to help enhance and \u2013 their end of life with dignity. CLINTON:  Well, first of all, thank you  for being here. Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support.  And I really appreciate your asking the question.  And I have to tell you, this is the first time I\u2019ve been asked that question. KINHAN:  I \u2013 I figured that. CLINTON:  Yes.  I \u2013 I really \u2013 I really\u2026 KINHAN:  Maybe any candidate. CLINTON:  And I thank you  for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country. There are states, as you know\u2026 KINHAN:  Yes. CLINTON:  \u2013 that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision, in consultation by their families, even, in some cases, with medical professionals.  But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors. So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective. So here\u2019s how I think about it. I want \u2013 I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I \u2013 I believe you\u2019re right, this is going to become an issue more and more\u2026 KINHAN:  Exactly. CLINTON:  \u2013 often.  We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don\u2019t want to continue with the challenges that poses. So I don\u2019t have any easy or glib answer for you.  I think I would want to really immerse myself in the \u2013 the \u2013 the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings.  I know some other countries, the Netherlands and others, have a quite open approach.  I\u2019d like to know what their experience has been. Because we \u2013 we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress.  And that is a difficult line to draw. So I thank you \u2013 I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that we\u2019re all going to have to do some thinking about. KINHAN:  Thank you  (INAUDIBLE). (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I think this is Michael Feel (ph).  Michael is a married father of one.  He says he\u2019s undecided.  He\u2019s learning \u2013 leaning toward Senator Sanders. Michael? CLINTON:  Hi, Michael. MICHAEL FEEL:  Hi, Secretary Clinton. As senator and as secretary of State, you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters, including myself. As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the world\u2019s policeman, can you assure me that as president, you would not expand our military involvement abroad? CLINTON:  No, I can\u2019t, Michael.  I mean I \u2013 I\u2019d like to be able to say I could, but here\u2019s what I can say.  I have learned and have been, you know, really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years. And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice.  That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans. I worked very hard as secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON:  \u2026decisions over the last years.  And military force must always be a last resort, not a first choice.  That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans.  I worked very hard as Secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict.  That\u2019s why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran, so that we could get them to the negotiating table, in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place.  I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region, and maybe even led to conflict.  I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts.  But I can\u2019t in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America\u2019s best vital national security interest.  So I want to be honest with you.  I will do what I can, I will stand against adventurism, ill thought out missions.  I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria.  That is off the table.  That would be a terrible mistake.  We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face.  You know, the network of terrorist organizations \u2013 not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia \u2013 pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves.  And we\u2019ve got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS, to end that terrorist threat.  So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what\u2019s at stake.  And I know you can understand why there can\u2019t be from me anyway a blanket statement.  But I want to assure you I will be transparent, I will be open, and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners. COOPER:  I want to follow up the \u2013 yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks, and I quote, all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft, talking about Selective Service.  Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service, like men? CLINTON:  You know the first time I heard that yesterday and here\u2019s the reasoning, as best I, I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts.  That, if we\u2019re going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers, they can compete to be Navy Seals, they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines, then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military.  I, I have to think about whether I think it\u2019s necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending.  You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country.  The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where that\u2019s going to come out.  Where I want people to register, I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically, and I think if \u2013 if we had, you know, if we had a system like that I would, I would be very, very pleased about it.  I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system.  So I just have to be better informed about why they\u2019re making this recommendation. COOPER:  I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson.  She\u2019s a former State Representative in New Hampshire.  She says she\u2019s undecided and she\u2019s got a question for you. CLINTON:  Hi, Rebecca. REBECCA HUTCHINSON, FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Thank you.  I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question.  You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience, and I\u2019ve heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State.  But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war, which you now say was a mistake.  What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn\u2019t make a mistake of that magnitude again? CLINTON:  Oh, I think that\u2019s a very fair question.  You know, I did\u2026QUESTION:  was a mistake.  What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldn\u2019t make a mistake of that magnitude again? CLINTON:  Oh, I think that\u2019s a very fair question. You know I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake.  And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration\u2019s approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq. The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections.  And he made that comment. And the U.N. Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out.  Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD.  And the Bush administration didn\u2019t give them the time.  And that was a breach of faith, in my view. But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion.  Turned out not to be.  And I really regret that that\u2019s the way President Bush proceeded. That would not be something you would have to worry about with me.  If I tell you we\u2019re going to do diplomacy, we\u2019re going to hang tough, we\u2019re going to get answers, that\u2019s exactly what we will do. COOPER:  I want you to meet Sean Burke (ph).  He\u2019s a Democrat from Derry, says he is a supporter of yours. Sean (ph)? CLINTON:  Hi, Sean (ph). QUESTION:  Hey.  Once you become the nominee and got elected, how are you going to defend yourself against right-wing attacks? CLINTON:  Well, Sean (ph), I had a lot of practice. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) So I could laugh up here, but it\u2019s not easy.  It is a brutal experience.  And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care.  And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself.  What talk radio was saying, what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying.  I was just stunned.  I could not understand how they got away with it. And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally.  And by that I mean this.  The very fair question from Rebecca.  People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously.  There are lessons to be learned, often from people who don\u2019t agree with you.  But don\u2019t take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks. And so now that I\u2019ve been through this for so many years, Sean (ph), my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed.  They play to keep.  They play to destroy.  They are constantly doing whatever they can to win.  And they have a history now going back, you know, 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they can\u2019t otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack. So right now, for example, a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me.  Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me.  I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say.  And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy, bad for our economy, bad for our societies. So I know I have to keep defending against them.  But I\u2019m the one who has the experience to do that.  It\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue, terrible attacks. And now the Koch brothers say they\u2019re going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee.  I\u2019m still standing, and I will be standing.  So don\u2019t worry about that. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  Let me just simply follow up.  You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s. CLINTON:  Right. COOPER:  Do you still believe there\u2019s a vast right-wing conspiracy? CLINTON:  Don\u2019t you? (LAUGHTER) COOPER:  I\u2019m asking you. CLINTON:  Yes.  It\u2019s gotten even better funded.   You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in. And look, these guys play for keeps.  They want to control our country. (LAUGHTER) COOPER:  I\u2019m asking you. CLINTON:  Yes.  It has gotten even better funded.  You know, they brought in some new multi-billionaires to pump the money in. And, look, these guys play for keeps.  They want to control our country.  Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely.  They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality. They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to. But make no mistake, they want to destroy unions.  They want to go after any economic interests that they don\u2019t believe they can control.  They want to destroy our balance of power.  They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding. I said today in Dover, you know, I don\u2019t think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don\u2019t know because they\u2019re not scientists.  They\u2019re just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers. They\u2019re told don\u2019t you dare say climate change is real because we\u2019re in the fossil fuel business.  So this is exactly what they are up to.  And, yes\u2026 (APPLAUSE) CLINTON:  \u2026 it is probably \u2013 look, at this point it\u2019s probably not correct to say it\u2019s a conspiracy because it\u2019s out in the open.  You know, there is no doubt about what they\u2019re doing and who the players are and what they\u2019re trying to achieve. And they\u2019re shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding.  So just know what we\u2019re up against because it\u2019s real and we\u2019re going to beat it. But it\u2019s going to take everybody working together. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want you to meet Alison Pyott.  She\u2019s an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders. CLINTON:  Hi, Alison. ALISON PYOTT, PARTNER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT FIRM:  I\u2019m sensing a theme here.  First, thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done for our country and for women. CLINTON:  Thank you. PYOTT:  My question is the number of factors, some you have just described, have eroded trust in you.  What will you do to regain that trust, engender trust in Americans and me? CLINTON:  Well, thank you for starting by saying it\u2019s related to what I just said.  And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is. When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it\u2019s just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that. And, you know, I testify for 11 hours, there\u2019s nothing to Benghazi, they don\u2019t give it up, they keep coming after it. So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am, what I stand for, and what I\u2019ve always done.  I\u2019ve always been guided by the same values.  I have always listened to people.  And I\u2019ve always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people. So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and, you know, people were barraging, I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that.  And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here\u2019s who I am, here\u2019s what I do, I want to do this with you.  And I won. And then since years later when I ran, I got a higher percentage.  And then I did have, as you all remember, a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama.  We saw each other very up close and personal. And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience. So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it\u2019s on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be. And I trust the American people.  I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you. And that\u2019s what I hope you will understand. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett.  He\u2019s an independent, says he\u2019s undecided about his vote. Rabbi? CLINTON:  Hello, Rabbi. RABBI JONATHAN SPIRA-SAVETT, TEMPLE BETH ABRAHAM:  Hello.  Another rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note.  And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me.  And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes. And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets.  How do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you\u2026    UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   The note says I am just dust and ashes.  And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets. How do you cultivate the ego, the ego that we all know you must have, a person must have to be the leader of the free world, and also the humility to recognize that we know that you can\u2019t be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for? CLINTON:  Another absolutely wonderful question. Thank you, Rabbi. I think about this a lot.  Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon you to be as self-conscious as possible. This is hard for me.  You know, I never thought I\u2019d be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president.  I always wanted to be of service.  I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do.  I was happy to support him while I worked in the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and legal services and taught law, and, you know, had our daughter. I never thought I would do this.  And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people, or to tell stories about, you know, the man I met in Rochester who \u2013 whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable.  And that \u2013 that can grip me and make me feel like there\u2019s something I can do about that. So I\u2019m constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least, you know, once a day in some setting or another.  And I don\u2019t know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s just overwhelming, I have to retreat. It\u2019s that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country.  And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a \u2013 you know, with a group of faith advisers who are close to me. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with.  And, you know, it just gets me grounded.  He gets up really early to send it to me.  So, you know, there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m.. I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services.  So I really appreciate all that incoming. And the final thing I would say, because again, it\u2019s not anything I\u2019ve ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I \u2013 I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years.  And so I\u2019ve had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues, political, public issues.  And I read a, um, a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen, who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns.  And I \u2013 I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me.  And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude. So regardless of how hard the days are, how difficult the decisions are, be grateful.  Be grateful for being a human being, being part of the universe.  Be grateful for your limitations.  Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you, to support you, to advise you, listen to your critics, answer the questions. But at the end, be grateful.  Practice the discipline of gratitude.  And that has helped me enormously. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  We\u2019re going to have more questions from the audience for Secretary Clinton when we come back. We\u2019ll take a short break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) COOPER:  Welcome back to CNN\u2019s Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire.  We are here with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  I want to play a piece of video\u2026 CLINTON:  OK. COOPER:  \u2026from Senator Sanders the other night in Iowa after the votes came in, and get you to respond. CLINTON:  OK. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANDERS:  We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class, Wall Street, or corporate America.  We don\u2019t want their money.  We will\u2026  And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a Super PAC.  And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa, the reason I believe we\u2019re going to do so well in New Hampshire, and in the other states that follow, the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy. (END VIDEO CLIP) COOPER:  We got a number of questions, even from people who support your policies, who say they do believe that you represent the interests of Wall Street and corporate America.  How do you respond? CLINTON:  Well, look, that\u2019s just not the case.  And I did represent New York, obviously.  There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issue\u2026 CLINTON:  And I did represent New York, obviously.  There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street, including calling them out on the mortgage issues, calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created, calling for changes in CEO pay. But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at what\u2019s happening in this campaign sees the same thing.  The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me.  So I just find it kind of a strange argument. I happen to agree with Sen. Sanders.  I\u2019m not just going after Wall Street though.  I think that\u2019s too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe.  It\u2019s a perversion.  It should be stopped. I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies, you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Turing Pharmaceuticals, taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price. So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again\u2026 (APPLAUSE) And but I just have to \u2013 I have to respectfully say, I think Sen. Sanders\u2019 target is too small, I really do.  You know I respect him going after the big banks.  I agree with him.  No bank is too big to fail.  No executive to powerful to jail. But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank.  So let\u2019s know the next president has to implement, but doesn\u2019t have to achieve that. Here\u2019s what I want to do.  I want to go after all the other culprits.  It wasn\u2019t just the big banks.  It was the insurance company AIG.  It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers.  It was Countrywide Mortgage.  It was Wachovia. There were a lot of bad actors.  And if all you do is look over here, I\u2019m telling you, they\u2019re going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk. So I\u2019ve got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests.  I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after, from pharmaceuticals\u2026 (APPLAUSE) \u2026 insurance companies, shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy.  And frankly they are undermining our democracy. This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me.  We bailed them out.  The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail.  They didn\u2019t care about the millions of jobs. Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout.  It turned out to be a good deal.  All of us paid for it.  They paid back the Treasury.  So we didn\u2019t lose any money and we saved millions of jobs.  And the auto industry just had a great year. Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout.  And now they\u2019re not going to pay their taxes?  We\u2019re going to go right after that.  That is absolutely wrong. (APPLAUSE) And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  One of the things\u2026 (APPLAUSE) One of the things that Sen. Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs.  You were paid $675,000 for three speeches.  Was that a mistake?  I mean was that a bad error in judgment? CLINTON:  Look. I made speeches to lots of groups.  I told them what I thought.  I answered questions. COOPER:  But did you have to be paid $675,000? CLINTON:  Well, I don\u2019t know.  That\u2019s what they offered, so\u2026 (LAUGHER) You know every secretary of State that I know has done that. COOPER:  But (inaudible) for office they\u2019re not running for an office\u2026 CLINTON:  Well, I didn\u2019t know\u2026 COOPER:  \u2026 have known. CLINTON:  To be honest I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t committed to running.  I didn\u2019t know whether I would or not. COOPER:  You didn\u2019t think you were going to run for president again? CLINTON:  I didn\u2019t.  You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think I\u2019m done.  And you know, so many people came to me, started talking to me. The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody.  I did not want to see that happen again.  I want to defend President Obama\u2019s accomplishments and the progress we\u2019ve made.  I want to go further. So yes, I was convinced.  But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they\u2019ve influenced me on.  Just name one thing.  I\u2019m out here every day saying I\u2019m going to shut them down, I\u2019m going after them.  I\u2019m going to jail them if they should be jailed.  I\u2019m going to break them up. I mean they\u2019re not giving me very much money now.  I can tell you that much. (LAUGHTER) Fine with me.  I\u2019m proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I\u2019m really, really proud of. (APPLAUSE) \u2026 break them up. I mean, they\u2019re not giving me very much money now.  I can tell you that much. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON:  Fine with me.  I\u2019m proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent, the highest ever, from women, which I\u2019m really, really glad about. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  So just to be clear, that\u2019s not something you regret, those three speeches, that money? CLINTON:  No, I don\u2019t, because, you know, I don\u2019t feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they\u2019re on notice. COOPER:  I want to see if Chris Lopez is here. Chris, there you are. Chris is an independent with a question for Secretary Clinton.  She says she\u2019s undecided, I should point out. Chris? CLINTON:  Hi, Chris. CHRIS LOPEZ, WORKS FOR NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS:  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question. I see a lot of hypocrisy in this country when I have a really hard time getting the medicine I need and yet it\u2019s really easy to get alcohol.  What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people \u2013 so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need? CLINTON:  I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you\u2019ve just briefly described. I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research.  The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out.  Because I want you to know what we know from science. But I also want you to be able to use it while we\u2019re doing the research.  And so many states, as you know, have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana. I support that.  I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy.  We should be learning about what works, what doesn\u2019t work.  Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for.  Are they right?  We don\u2019t know.  That\u2019s why we have got to do the research. I also want you to know what dosage is right, what interacts with the other medication you\u2019re taking.  I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people. We know in chemotherapy, we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana.  I just want to make sure it\u2019s the right amount and the right kind.  That\u2019s why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible. But you said something else which I think is really important.  We can\u2019t be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire.  Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state. Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed, the people that I meet, the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because they\u2019ve lost their children.  I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose. So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country, both alcohol and drugs.  There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people.  So we\u2019ve got to work on law enforcement. We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids, which is often the first step towards heroin.  We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone, which is the antidote to reverse overdose, save lives here in New Hampshire.  We\u2019ve got to put more money into this. So all of this to me fits together.  You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges.  So that\u2019s what I would like to do. (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want you to meet \u2013 this is Julie Carnigan, she\u2019s from Windham. Julie? CLINTON:  Hi. JULIE CARNIGAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIDENT:  Hi.  Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m the proud mother of five girls, two of my own, three step-daughters.  And unfortunately they are all \u201cfeeling the Bern.\u201d And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you. CLINTON:  How old are they? CARNIGAN:  They\u2019re in their \u2013 21, 22, and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON:  Well, first of all, tell them I\u2019m glad they\u2019re interested in politics, and I really mean that.  I want them to be involved.  I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age, some years ago, and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time. I also want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies\u2026 CLINTON:  I want them to take a look at my record, what I have done my entire life, starting as a young lawyer working for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina, trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South.  I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people\u2019s rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve. And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from, you know, starting the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system, with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady.  Getting healthcare for our National Guard.  Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons.  A long list.  And the reason I say that is I think it\u2019s very important that, as people move toward the primary on Tuesday, whatever your age, you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done.  And as I\u2019ve said and I mean it absolutely, I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders. But as the \u201cConcord Monitor\u201d said today in its writing about this, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.  So I don\u2019t want to over promise.  We\u2019ve got too much of that.  I want to tell people what I will do.  I want to be specific because I do want to \u2013 to go back to the question I was asked earlier \u2013 recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America.  We need to set big goals again.  I am all for that.  I have big, ambitious goals.  Affordable college, early childhood education, making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave, all of which will help your daughters. But I also want them to hold me accountable.  I want them to say, OK, how\u2019s that actually going to happen?  What do we have to do to make it?  We\u2019ve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate.  Nancy Pelosi has said, we\u2019re not going to revisit healthcare.  We\u2019re going to stick with the Affordable Care Act.  That\u2019s exactly where I am.  We\u2019re going to improve it.  Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in people\u2019s lives.  I am a progressive who gets results.  And I will be a progressive President who gets results.  And the final thing I would say is, it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young women\u2019s ambitions. And I\u2019m going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling.  I hope it splinters completely and, and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now, regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically.  But in their lives, their profession, how they\u2019re treated.  I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment.  That\u2019s what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter, and that\u2019s what I want for your daughters. COOPER:  (inaudible).  Just as we did with Senator Sanders, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of important policy issues.  I just want to ask kind of a couple of personal questions just for voters to get\u2026 CLINTON:  You don\u2019t think they know everything? COOPER:  Well, I don\u2019t know.  We\u2019ll see about that.  It\u2019s interesting to me, I mean you have \u2013 as you said, you have been one of the most famous women in the world now for, for decades.  You have no anonymity.  If you could be anonymous for just one day, what would you do? CLINTON:  I used to do this in the White House and, you know, I would, I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and, you know, sweat pants and a sweat shirt, and put my hair back, and I would go walk.  And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists.  I had the best time, you know.  I would, I would end up over on the Mall sometimes, walking around.  And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House.  I\u2019d be happy to.  Here, why don\u2019t you\u2026 So, you know, there\u2019s nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve.  So I would spend the day, you know, out in nature, talking a long walk, walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire, stopping in a cafe, stopping in a bookstore.  You know, maybe calling some of my friends, some of whom are here tonight, and say, don\u2019t tell anybody but meet me, you know, there.  That\u2019s what I, that\u2019s what I want to do, and it\u2019s what I get the great joy out of.  I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life.  And they keep me grounded, they keep me honest, they deflate my head, they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other.  So anytime\u2026. CLINTON:  that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life.  And they keep me grounded.  They keep me honest.  They deflate my head.  They deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other. (LAUGHTER) So any time I get to spend time with them.  And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because that\u2019s the cr\u00e8me de le resistance\u2026 COOPER:  What does she call you? CLINTON:  She calls me grandma.  Grandma.  Yes. She\u2019s working really hard on words.  And it was so thrilling.  They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously weren\u2019t going to leave. And so they got in late the night, Saturday night.  And Sunday morning I\u2019m getting ready.  And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything. So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me.  She goes \u201cgrandma\u201d.  And honest to goodness, the caucus could\u2019ve ended right there.  I would\u2019ve been perfectly happy\u2026 (APPLAUSE) \u2026 saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa.  So that\u2019s where I\u2019d end my day. COOPER:  You talked about the circle of friends you have.  Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away. CLINTON:  Right. COOPER:  In 2008 she was part of your campaign. CLINTON:  She was. COOPER:  And you wrote about how at the end of the day you would, you know, sit around the kitchen table with her, kick off your shoes and just talk about everything that had happened. CLINTON:  Right. COOPER:  What do you think \u2013 what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year? CLINTON:  You know, my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible, miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family, and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid.  And her resilience, her love, her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just, you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life. And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl.  You know you get knocked down.  Everybody gets knocked down.  What matters is whether you get up. And when you get up, what do you do?  How do you behave?  Are you going to be bitter?  Angry?  Upset?  Are you going to try to be positive, get something done, help somebody else?  And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d be saying now. She\u2019d be encouraging me.  She\u2019d be very proud, a little apprehensive because you know it\u2019s a brutal business being in politics. And people say things about those you love, whether it\u2019s your daughter or someone else.  So she was very supportive.  But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time. And so I would sit with her and I would say don\u2019t listen to that stuff, mom.  And she\u2019d say, well I have to know what they\u2019re saying about you.  And I\u2019d say you know don\u2019t put yourself through that.  And so that would be what she\u2019d be doing now I think too.  Yes. COOPER:  I want you to be able to make your closing argument\u2026 CLINTON:  Oh. COOPER:  \u2026 to the people in New Hampshire. CLINTON:  Well, thank you. Well, first of all, thanks again for being part of this process, this first in the nation primary.  You know I said earlier today some people said well you know Sen. Sanders is ahead.  And I respect that.  And so maybe you know I should go onto the next state.  And I said absolutely not. New Hampshire has been so good to me and my family.  And I love campaigning in New Hampshire.  I love this process. So, you\u2019re going to have to put up with me.  I\u2019m going to be going around the state, going to as many events as I can, answering as many questions, trying to talk about what I am offering.  I really believe that we have a chance to build on the progress we\u2019ve made and to get results for people. To get the economy producing more good jobs, to get incomes rising again, that\u2019s my goal.  I will not raise middle class taxes because the middle class hasn\u2019t even yet recovered from the Great Recession. We\u2019re going to stick with the Affordable Care Act.  We\u2019re going to make it work. We\u2019re going to get early childhood education, affordable college and pay down student debt, a lot of the agenda that is important to our country, particularly to young people. And we\u2019re going to defend our rights.  We\u2019re going to defend a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions. (APPLAUSE) We\u2019re going to defend Planned Parenthood.  We\u2019re going to defend marriage equality and end discrimination against LGBT Americans.  And we\u2019re going to take on the gun lobby because it is absolutely unconscionable to have\u2026 (APPLAUSE) \u2026 33,000 people a year die from gun violence. (APPLAUSE) So please, join me in this campaign.  I hope you will come out and vote for me on Tuesday.  And I will fight for you every single day in the White House.  Thank you all very much. (CHEERS) (APPLAUSE) COOPER:  I want to thank both candidates for coming tonight, the voters for being here and asking such amazing questions\u2026 (APPLAUSE) And the viewers at home.  I also want to thank everybody with the Derry Opera House for their hospitality\u2026 (CHEERS) With the New Hampshire primaries now just days away, a reminder we\u2019ll be here for it all with (inaudible) expert analysis\u2026 (APPLAUSE) Our coverage continues with Don Lemon right after this. (CHEERS) Thanks again. CLINTON:  Thank you all. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, guys. (APPLAUSE) END",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s Democratic town hall, airing live from Iowa on Monday, 9 p.m. ET The electability argument is likely to intensify ahead of Iowa and New Hampshire Many Republicans say they view Clinton as a tougher general election match-up than Sanders Now 61 and retired, Jan Marcotte feels thrown back to her days as a high school political volunteer when she hears Bernie Sanders speak. \u201cI feel like if I close my eyes, I\u2019d be back working for George McGovern,\u201d she said after a Sanders rally last week. That Sanders evokes memories of the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee, a pillar of American liberalism, helps explain his loyal following on the left. But while McGovern\u2019s long-shot, grassroots campaign managed to upset a favorite of the stodgy Democratic establishment, the then-South Dakota senator went on to be crushed by a Republican who previously promised to awaken the nation\u2019s working-class white \u201csilent majority.\u201d President Richard Nixon won 49 states. McGovern won one. It\u2019s what could be the biggest challenge for Sanders, 74, in overcoming Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 Democratic nomination: Electability. Despite his age, the self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d Sanders is a relatively fresh face on the national field, free from the years, even decades, of attacks that Hillary Clinton has experienced. That creates an opportunity for Republicans to try and define him \u2013 which causes some Democrats to worry about down ballot implications. \u201cRepublicans would much rather run against Bernie Sanders and have a chance to define him from the get-go as extreme and out of touch,\u201d Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a Mitt Romney campaign veteran, said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The \u201celectability\u201d argument is likely to burst into the open Monday night in Des Moines, where Clinton and Sanders will both participate in a town hall hosted by the Iowa Democratic Party and Drake University and broadcast on CNN. In recent days, Clinton has emphasized her experience across a broad set of issues and her history of taking on Republicans, while Sanders has pointed to polls that show him outperforming Clinton. Polls of hypothetical matchups between Democratic and Republican presidential contenders have shown Sanders doing better than Clinton against the GOP field. That gives the Vermont senator evidence to cite in swatting away concerns raised recently by Clinton and her allies that a Sanders nomination could wipe out President Barack Obama\u2019s gains. \u201cOne of the things that my opponent Secretary Clinton is saying is that Bernie is unelectable. He just cannot defeat a Republican candidate in a general election,\u201d Sanders said last week in New Hampshire. \u201cSo it gives me some pleasure to give you some facts that that might just not be the case.\u201d He pointed to a new CNN/ORC poll that showed him crushing all Republican contenders in New Hampshire, while Clinton falls within the margin of error against most of them. The Republican super PAC America Rising has assigned a tracker to follow Sanders on the campaign trail, and has submitted open-records requests for many of his documents. Still, while polls tell one story, Republican campaigns and operatives tell another: They view Clinton as a much tougher general election opponent than Sanders. A story by Yahoo\u2019s Hunter Walker was an example of what could come up: Sanders\u2019 one-time support for nationalizing industries like oil and electric utilities, the seizure of those industries without compensation and his desire to take the Rockefeller family\u2019s wealth and use it to help the poor. When CNN asked strategists working with Republican presidential campaigns how they might deploy those details against Sanders in a general election, none would discuss it on the record \u2013 another indication that the party is intent on letting Sanders remain unscathed while his opponent is Clinton. Even the few swings Republicans are willing to take at Sanders are designed to undercut him on the left, too. \u201cA candidate that\u2019s willing to shift to the middle as much as Hillary Clinton has proven she\u2019s willing to is probably tougher in a general election,\u201d Katie Packer, a veteran GOP operative who worked on Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d with Jake Tapper last week. It\u2019s not just the presidency at stake: Democrats are hoping to pick up enough seats to retake control of the Senate in November, and narrow the GOP advantage in the House, as well. The number two House Democrat said he is concerned about Sanders\u2019 impact on candidates down ballot in 2016, complaining that Sanders lacks broad-based appeal. \u201cHe calls himself a Socialist,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who backs Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good title to be running for president of the United States. I don\u2019t think that resonates well.\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a Clinton supporter, agreed. \u201cI think the Republicans would be very excited,\u201d McCaskill told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously helping him in every way they can. It tells everybody what they need to know.\u201d Sanders has pushed a major expansion of Medicare to cover all Americans as part of his platform, which he acknowledges would require tax increases. But Hoyer said the chances that Congress would approve such a plan are \u201cvery, very small.\u201d The same concerns are showing up on the campaign trail. This week in Iowa, Jane Nettleton went to see Sanders at a campaign stop in Fort Dodge. She said she believes in many of his ideas, but is alarmed at how Republicans would define him. \u201cThose same Republicans that have been bashing Obama are just going to utter the word \u2018communist\u2019 instead of \u2018socialist\u2019 and that\u2019s going to scare a lot of people,\u201d Nettleton, who plans to caucus for Clinton, told CNN. \u201cI think it would be political suicide, frankly.\u201d Stephanie Schulz, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student who supports Clinton, said she worries about what her Republican friends say about him. \u201cThey say they don\u2019t like Bernie Sanders because of his socialist policies,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like that kind of scares people.\u201d Olivia Miller, a 20-year-old University of Iowa sophomore who is leaning toward supporting Clinton, called Sanders \u201coverhyped a little bit because I think that some of the issues he has been talking about are too socialist.\u201d Among Sanders loyalists, though, the \u201csocialist\u201d tag is much ado about nothing. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the word socialism. I know what it means. It\u2019s not communism,\u201d said Susan Stanbury, 72, a retired town manager from Peterborough, New Hampshire. \u201cI believe that government has a role in taking care of its citizens.\u201d James Bragg, who was selling Sanders gear outside his campaign stop in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, said the old notion of \u201ccommunist behind a corner\u201d is dying \u2013 and won\u2019t concern Sanders\u2019 younger supporters at all. The socialist label, the 61-year-old Bragg said, is just \u201cwhat the old people are afraid of.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Elizabeth Landers, Dan Merica and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders had promised not to go negative in the race against Hillary Clinton But the race is getting nastier, and Sanders has a new ad highlighting differences between him and Clinton on Wall Street Bernie Sanders launched his presidential campaign in 2015 by promising not to go negative \u2013 either on the stump or in ads \u2013 against Hillary Clinton. But as the race for the Democratic nomination gets tighter and nastier, Sanders\u2019 campaign is confronting that promise when it considers how to respond to attacks from the Clinton campaign, walking the fine line between drawing contrasts with the former secretary of state and outright attacking her. \u201cI have never run a negative radio or television ad in my life. It is my very strong hope that I never will,\u201d Sanders said at a New Hampshire town hall Thursday night. \u201cAnd I believe, if people are distorting my record, as is the case right now, we are going to deal with it and I have dealt with it and we will continue to deal with it. RELATED: What\u2019s behind the Clinton-Sanders health care fight? Sanders\u2019 tightrope act was demonstrated Thursday when the his campaign released an ad that suggested Clinton\u2019s practice of taking money from big banks makes her unlikely to take on those same financial institutions as President. Titled \u201cTwo Visions,\u201d Sanders says in the ad that there are \u201ctwo Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street.\u201d One, Sanders says looking straight into the camera, \u201csays it is okay to take million from big banks and then tell him what to do,\u201d a not-very-subtle jab at Clinton. The second vision, of course, is Sanders\u2019 plan to break up big banks, close tax loopholes and make the wealthy \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d \u201cWill they like me? No,\u201d Sanders says in the ad, another jab at Clinton, who said at a debate in December that \u201ceveryone should\u201d like her. \u201cWill they begin to play by the rule if I am president, you better believe it.\u201d Sanders is still leading in New Hampshire and a new poll released Thursday shows Clinton up by only 2% in Iowa. His campaign has also done better than even it expected, and raised $73 million in 2015, well exceeding the goals it when the campaign launched. RELATED: Poll: Clinton lead narrows in Iowa Meantime, the tone of the Democratic race has grown more combative, with Clinton\u2019s campaign turning up the heat as well, running an ad that indirectly call out Sanders on gun control. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address, Clinton called indirectly challenged Sanders to \u201cpick a side\u201d on guns \u2013 either with the gun lobby or with President Barack Obama. \u201cI am with him,\u201d Clinton says in the ad of Obama. RELATED: Clinton: Sanders \u2018reliable vote for the gun lobby\u2019 And Clinton used the bulk of her stump speech Tuesday in Iowa to contrast herself with Sanders, knocking him on guns, taxes and health care. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers,\u201d Clinton said of Sanders in Ames. \u201cI\u2019ve got the scars to show for it and I am proud of every single one of them.\u201d But neither Clinton nor her campaign aides, however, ever expressly promised not to go negative in the Democratic race. In an interview with CBS in September, Clinton said she \u201chad no interest\u201d in attacking Sanders. Sanders and Clinton have long emphasized their differences with one another, but going to air with contrast ads was something Sanders\u2019 aides thought would be out of the question at the start of their campaign. \u201cIf we do that, we\u2019re done,\u201d Tad Devine, Sanders\u2019 senior strategist, told Mother Jones in June. \u201cIf we do a classic comparative ad, it\u2019s over. We\u2019ll have to be smarter.\u201d In New Hampshire, Sanders again said he doesn\u2019t want to go negative. \u201cI believe the American people deserve campaigns which are based on the issues that are impacting their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t wanna see candidates go around saying, I\u2019m great and everyone else is terrible and awful. That\u2019s not the type of campaign I\u2019ve run or will run.\u201d And Sanders\u2019 campaign rejects that idea that its latest ad, which will run in Iowa and New Hampshire, is directed at Clinton or breaks the candidate\u2019s pledge. \u201cIt makes contrasts that both drew on the Des Moines debate and he made in the New York City speech but this is not an ad directed at Secretary Clinton exclusively,\u201d Michael Briggs, Sanders\u2019 spokesman, said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about people in the Democratic establishment who believe you can take Wall Street\u2019s money and then somehow turn around and rein in the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior. Obviously she is part of the establishment that Wall Street has showered with financial support. Bernie is not.\u201d Clinton campaign aides said scoffed at the notion that the ad is not directed squarely at Clinton, with some feeling the Wall Street line is more of a personal critique of Clinton \u2013 questioning her commitment to her platform \u2013 than an attack on a policy position. RELATED: Bill Clinton: I\u2019m not surprised this race is tightening This tension between the different kind of campaign Sanders hoped to run and the realities of a presidential race have been building ever since Sanders used his speech at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson dinner to lambast Clinton\u2019s past positions, implying that the former secretary of state took poll-tested positions based on political expediency. \u201cI pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest, not the corporate interest. I will not abandon any segment of American society \u2013 whether you\u2019re gay or black or Latino or poor, or working class \u2013 just because it is politically expedient at a given time,\u201d he said. Ever since that speech \u2013 which saw some Sanders\u2019 aides get in on the Clinton bashing on social media \u2013 the tone of the Sanders campaign has been decidedly more negative than the operation he and his aides sketched early in 2015. Days later in an interview with Charlie Rose, Sanders listed his differences with Hillary Clinton and asked voters to consider who will champion those positions. \u201cAnd if people think Hillary Clinton is that candidate, go for it,\u201d he said sarcastically. RELATED: Bernie Sanders refutes Clinton attacks on guns, health care Sanders then started to turn his differences with Clinton, particularly on the consistency of the positions they have held, as a blunt object to hit her with. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Sanders said consistency on issues \u201cdoes speak to the character of a person,\u201d a comment that irked many in the Clinton campaign as Sanders questioning their candidate\u2019s character. Sanders aides have indicated that the candidate does not want to go negative in the race, pointing to his past races as proof positive that he does not enjoy that kind of campaigning. \u201cLook, I have worked for him off and on for 30 years, I managed his Senate mapping in 2006, a very vicious race where we were attacked on television and elsewhere,\u201d Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said. \u201cWe never went negative and I think voters appreciated that.\u201d But does that mean Sanders\u2019 campaign won\u2019t go after Clinton on issues they think she is weak on? No, said Weaver. \u201cWe do think it is fair for him to offer contrast on positions and issues between the two candidates,\u201d Weaver added. \u201cI mean, this ultimately is a selection, an election is a selection, right? And I think it is fair to highlight to voters what you think are the differences on policy between your candidacy and your opponents candidacy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In a surprise announcement, Rep. Steve Israel of New York, a member of House Democratic leadership, said Tuesday he won\u2019t run for re-election in 2016. \u201cI hope to continue to be involved in public service, but it is time for me to pursue new passions and develop new interests, mainly spend more time writing my second novel,\u201d Israel said in a statement that stunned many across the U.S. Capitol. Israel, who was elected to the House in 2000, became a close ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.  She tapped him to chair the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm for two election cycles. He currently heads the House Democrat\u2019s messaging shop, coordinating his party\u2019s strategy and response to the Republican agenda. Opinion: Guns: Thousands of Americans die, and yet we do nothing His Long Island district has always been competitive, and Israel conceded November\u2019s election would again prove to be a tough race. But he predicted it would remain in his party\u2019s control, saying, \u201cThe 2016 presidential turnout will help assure that. We\u2019ve fought too hard for everyday Americans and against special interests to risk it.\u201d Israel has been a loyal party messenger, but he broke publicly with President Barack Obama this summer over the Iran nuclear deal and voted against its implementation. His district includes many Jewish American voters skeptical of the agreement. Republicans were eager to pounce on the news that a top Democratic leader decided to retire. \u201cSteve Israel was in charge of electing House Democrats for years and even he sees the writing on the wall for 2016. The extremists of his party are slowly making House Democrats extinct,\u201d Chris Pack, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee told CNN in a statement, saying the GOP expected to pick up the seat this fall. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, the current chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, disagreed with the GOP\u2019s prediction. \u201cI am fully confident that Democrats will continue to hold this reliably Democratic district, particularly in a Presidential year,\u201d he said in a statement. Many viewed Israel as a potential candidate to move up in the leadership. Top members of his party like Pelosi, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn \u2013 all senior leaders in their seventies \u2013 have had long tenures in their positions. Israel\u2019s decision to retire will again raise questions about whether Pelosi will remain in the top spot. As her party\u2019s top fundraiser and one of their sharpest political strategist, the California Democrat has strong support inside her party, but some newer House Democrats have also expressed a desire to add younger voices to the leadership table. There\u2019s no indication Pelosi will retire, and she has argued that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy will help boost turnout and the Democrats\u2019 prospects in 2016. Pelosi praised Israel after his announcement. \u201cAmerica\u2019s working families have always had a champion in Steve Israel,\u201d she said. \u201cIn his service in Congress, Steve has brought clarity and leadership to the work of reigniting the American Dream for the middle class families who are the backbone of our democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Luongo is a lecturer at the University of Michigan, teaching in the English Department Writing Program and a 2016 UM Knight-Wallace Journalism Fellow. He is the author of 15 books, primarily on travel topics. The opinions expressed here are his own. Michael Luongo: 'Springsteen paradox' is why Trump won Rust Belt states like Michigan Coastal elites love his music but don't understand the figures who populate the Boss' ballads, he writes My first clue that something was up was the Bernie Sanders rally I attended at the University of Michigan. Several thousand people (compared to the much smaller number who showed up for Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally in nearby Detroit around the same time) filled the Crisler Center. Not all of them were students; in fact, many of the students hadn\u2019t even been born in 1994 when NAFTA, one of Sanders\u2019 immediate targets for criticism, was passed. But many of the people I saw that day had driven hours from the conservative western side of the state to hear Sanders\u2019 populist message. They had lived with economic devastation (much of it caused by NAFTA and the Great Recession) and for many of them, the memory of the first pink-slip remains vivid. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me that Sanders won the Democratic primary and despite fivethirtyeight.com\u2019s predictions, I wasn\u2019t shocked that Donald Trump won Michigan. I could see it coming. I knew this would happen, because the Boss told me so. Kellyanne Conway: Race would have been tougher if Sanders was VP pick Call it the \u201cSpringsteen paradox\u201d: Coastal elites (and their Midwestern contemporaries) who might pay hundreds of dollars to see the famous singer perform his songs of working-class life have lost touch with the very people whose lives populate his ballads. In fact, the disconnect cuts both ways. Many of the very people Springsteen immortalized have now tuned out the Boss, who campaigned hard for Clinton, because of his politics. For decades, Springsteen has rallied for Democratic candidates, railing against Republicans, including Donald Trump, who insist on playing his songs at their events. Yet the men and women in Springsteen songs, decades after the \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d album\u2019s debut during the Reagan Democrats era, continue to flip parties. I have a unique perspective on this paradox. The empty shell of a long-closed plant loomed large in the town I grew up in. The mill was on the edge of railroad tracks, the signs above its doorways and walkways peeling paint, the rebar in its docks rusting through flaked concrete. The factory was the Karagheusian Rug Mill, which at its peak in the 1930s employed 1,700 people. I didn\u2019t grow up in the Rust Belt, but in Freehold, New Jersey, in the suburbs of the New York metropolitan region, within 50 miles of Times Square. Freehold also happens to be Bruce Springsteen\u2019s hometown. (Though New Jersey went for Clinton, voters in Monmouth County, where Freehold is, chose Trump by a very comfortable 53% to 42% for Clinton.) Critical Counties: How Trump seized the map and Clinton lost it He memorialized the mill in his 1984 song \u201cMy Hometown.\u201d with the famous lines: \u201cThey\u2019re closing down the textile mill \u2018cross the railroad tracks. Foreman says these jobs are going, boys, and they ain\u2019t coming back.\u201d I was in high school when the song came out, sitting in class with the children of families who had devoted their working lives to making carpets that graced Radio City Music Hall, the United States Supreme Court and many other landmark buildings. I might have been middle class myself, the child of Harvard-educated parents, but the working class was not an abstraction to me; they were my friends and their families who were hit hard by the bad times that never seemed to end. Now 30 years after high school, I\u2019m based in Ann Arbor, one of the Midwest\u2019s most elite academic bubbles. Living down the road from Detroit, it\u2019s hard not to think of Bruce when listening to Rust Belt stories of economic struggle. Yet the students and wealthy locals I encounter in this liberal enclave seem entirely disconnected from the experience of the American worker so prevalent on the Sanders or Trump campaign trails. I see the Springsteen paradox here in Ann Arbor, which, according to a 2015 study published in the Atlantic\u2019s CityLab, is America\u2019s eighth most economically segregated city.  And it shows. In an undergraduate entrepreneur class I audited at the Ross Business School, I was struck that many students\u2019 imaginary business plans spoke of manufacturing in China. In their defense, they are surrounded by industrial ruin, so maybe they see no hope for America\u2019s manufacturing future. And though there are some University of Michigan programs looking at Detroit, still, I found myself asking, don\u2019t they feel any sense of desire to put their fellow Americans back to work? The messy truth about the gulf between Trump and Clinton voters I get a different view traveling around this blue bubble. I\u2019m living here without a car, which forces me to rely on buses and taxis, where I interact with people who have little or no access to Ann Arbor\u2019s academic economy. Waiting for the Greyhound bus, for example, I chat with the chain-smoking window clerk, who, while grateful for her job, listed for me her resume of well-paying industrial jobs that no longer exist.  At station stops throughout the Midwest, the same conversations would happen with other underemployed rural white workers, urban blacks and even young liberal first-generation university students who are not as well off as their wealthier classmates. Taxi drivers in Ann Abor and Detroit tell me about how apps popular with students \u2014 in fact with anyone with a smartphone \u2014 have decimated their work, which though never entirely secure did come with some protections. In the Internet age, it\u2019s easy for those of us who never interact with blue-collar workers to ignore how seemingly simple things we do harm them in ways invisible to us. Journalists are as culpable as anyone. Despite our own industry\u2019s instability, we celebrate the disruptions of Uber, Airbnb and other apps that can lead to the loss of thousands of jobs, replacing them with precarious piecemeal work and leapfrogging over decades of progressive worker-protection legislation hard won by unions and community planning regulations meant to keep neighborhoods affordable for the working class. And that\u2019s what the Boss\u2019 songs do so flawlessly. They take the plight of invisible Americans and make it impossible to turn away. No surrender: Springsteen says Trump won't go quietly if he loses It\u2019s easy now for journalists to engage in well-deserved self-flagellation for not having a better understanding of what happened in Michigan. But I wasn\u2019t the only one predicting Trump\u2019s strong performance here. The London Review of Books wrote on how Michigan\u2019s Democratic US Rep. Debbie Dingell had been warning Clinton she was bound to lose the state unless she did more to solidify her position. (She didn\u2019t, as we know now, declining to campaign in a \u201csafe\u201d state once she had won the nomination.) But this isn\u2019t just about failing to predict an election outcome. The Springsteen paradox speaks to an empathy gap that needs to be closed. We need to understand how the things we celebrate, or simply accept as economically inevitable\u2014 from apps to cheap clothes, imported food and toiletries \u2014 hurt American workers by shipping once seemingly untouchable jobs to Canada and Mexico. If you doubt me, take a look at the label of your Colgate toothpaste and your Oreo cookies the next time you\u2019re at the grocery store. Living on the coasts, far from the center of American manufacturing, we might be blissfully unaware of these things, but the laid-off workers in the Midwest certainly are not. White House releases star-studded list of Medal of Freedom recipients So I come back to the Boss. How can we have so completely absorbed his lyrics into the cultural fabric of modern America but still not be ready to understand and do something about the plight of American workers? It might not be particularly romantic, but how many of us choose to visit a restaurant instead of using Seamless or choose the checkout line with an actual person to ring up our drugstore purchase instead of the automated scanners? After the 2004 election, where despite the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and pending economic doom, George W. Bush won re-election, we said to ourselves we would listen more to the middle of the country. But instead both parties, with the leadership of President Barack Obama, pushed for job-damaging trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton was for it as well, until she was forced to disavow it when Sanders and Trump bashed it successfully on the trail. We grew complacent, secure in our own echo-chamber, convinced that global trade is a modern inevitability and not reckoning the human cost. The good news is that since the election, journalists are going to be more important than ever, and news consumers seem to be putting their money where their reading concerns are. Harvard\u2019s Nieman Lab reported that since the election, digital subscriptions increased at The New York Times and elsewhere, and donations are on the rise to ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative media site.  Journalism remains precarious, but perhaps re-engaging with the people we should be writing about can be the way we as journalists reassert our necessity to the democratic process. Otherwise, Springsteen, who recently received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, might be singing about us one day, except by then we won\u2019t be able to afford to hear the show.",

His new book \u201cThe Great Equalizer: How Main Street Capitalism Can Create an Economy for Everyone\u201d (PublicAffairs) will be released January 10, 2017. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. David M. Smick: There have been decades of political gridlock in Washington Trump, with a GOP-controlled Congress, likely will get significant policy changes on taxes and spending, he says After several decades of policy stalemate in Washington, cynics might conclude that the Trump era will be more of the same. Think again. Significant change is coming if only because the GOP controls both Houses of Congress, along with the White House. True, some analysts argue that serious divisions within the GOP will make it tough to achieve policy consensus. But Republican congressional leaders give three reasons why civil war is unlikely and big change is coming fast. First, the fact that the GOP lost so few House seats in last month\u2019s election gives House Speaker Paul Ryan a lot more ideological room to negotiate. Had some of the polls been correct and the GOP lost 20-22 seats, leaving the thinnest of majorities, the Republican House today would indeed be ungovernable. Second, Republicans are terrified that if they don\u2019t deliver, the same working-class voters who turned on Hillary Clinton will turn on them. And third, Republicans have a definite fear of Donald Trump himself, whose coattails in last month\u2019s election were surprisingly strong. Obstructionists will almost certainly be the subject of ridicule in a  Trump tweet. Here\u2019s how the next six months could unfold: Trump and the GOP House leadership have surprisingly similar tax reform plans. Both include reform of the corporate and individual tax codes. Both plans have identical reductions in individual tax rates (with brackets down to 12, 25, and 33%) and are fairly similar in what they propose for other provisions of the tax code. The tax plan agreed to by both Trump and the Congressional GOP will almost certainly be achieved through the legislative vehicle called reconciliation, which means only 51 votes are needed for passage (the GOP has a 52-48 Senate majority). Translation: Immune to being filibustered, their plan will likely become law very quickly. The greatest difference to be resolved centers on individual taxation at the highest tax bracket. Team Trump, while lowering the top tax rate for upper-income earners, would reduce deductions such that the net effect would be no change in total taxes paid by those at this bracket. Congressional GOP tax plans would bring the top tax rate down but leave enough deductions such that the upper-income taxpayers would receive a tax cut, as measured by total taxes paid. How this difference will be resolved,  and other details of the tax code (number and size of exemptions and deductions), will be determined depending in part on how Senate Republicans and the Trump administration respond to the House Republicans\u2019 decision more than a year ago to use \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d to determine the revenue implications from various tax policy changes. The move to dynamic scoring originated from the House Ways and Means Committee and suggests that tax policy can stimulate the economy, increasing tax revenues somewhat. No, tax rate cuts cannot pay for themselves, but they do generate some economic activity and thereby increase revenues, proponents argue. How GOP differences are resolved on dynamic scoring will determine the number and size of deductions left in the tax code. Depending on how Congress scores the revenue loss, for example, the top corporate tax rate, which is now 39%, could be reduced to as low as 15% or as high as 20%. On the issue of whether the final tax plan, while reducing the top tax rate, has no net tax cut (Trump Plan) or a net tax cut (House GOP Plan), watch for Trump to have the upper hand. The likely outcome is that high-income earners will receive a net tax cut, but not nearly as generous as congressional GOP tax writers propose, meaning a significantly larger net tax cut is in store for the middle class. Both approaches would entail significant revenue losses and the deficit would grow. Candidate Trump vowed to \u201ckill\u201d Obamacare. The GOP could accomplish that goal immediately using the vehicle of reconciliation, which again only requires 51 votes to eliminate the part of the legislation that finances the program. Republicans sense they need to send their core constituency the message that they took action to kill a plan that has allowed health care premiums and deductions to skyrocket. But the politics are tricky. The implementation of any legislative action will likely be delayed, probably until after the 2018 midterm elections. Here\u2019s why: Replacing Obamacare with some new health care system cannot be done through reconciliation, which is a special legislative approach limited to financial and budgetary matters. Instead, enacting an entirely new health care plan requires the legislative track called \u201cregular order\u201d which requires 60 votes for passage (by overcoming a certain filibuster) and therefore will need the support of a number of Democratic senators. That sounds like a recipe for legislative stalemate. But there may be a reason a number of Senate Democrats (25 out of 48 are up for re-election in 2018, with 10 coming from so-called \u201cred\u201d states) may be willing to compromise with Trump and the Republicans on a health care reform plan. GOP congressional leaders have been led to believe that by March of next year, every major insurance company now part of the Affordable Care Act will have opted out of the program, having suffered enormous financial losses. Whether Obamacare collapses under its own weight with this exodus remains to be seen. But the largest participant in the program, United Health, has already opted out. The GOP will delay implementation of any effort to kill Obamacare precisely because of the anticipation  the program will die its own death. So why take the blame for killing it? Both parties would then have no choice but to devise a bipartisan replacement. As one GOP congressional leader told me, \u201cThere are some things the Democrats want that we can live with. Compromise is not out of the question. We\u2019ll come up with a new plan. We have to.\u201d Finally, there is the issue of infrastructure spending. It is assumed that on the first day of the Trump administration, $1 trillion in infrastructure spending will be dropped from a helicopter onto the US economy. But such an approach is not practical. Instead, a lot of the upcoming infrastructure spending is likely to be stretched out over several years with decisions made in close coordination with state and local governments. The Republican leadership says it is determined to avoid the Obama administration\u2019s experience in 2009 when officials were desperate to find \u201cshovel ready\u201d projects to initiate as stimulus in response to the financial crisis. A lot of less-than-essential projects were funded. \u201cShovel ready\u201d in too many cases proved to be a euphemism for \u201cneedless but ready.\u201d But how will Congress finance this new spending? Think big corporations. In 2015, Sen. Chuck Schumer,  D-New York, and then-Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, were engaged in negotiations over the connection of an infrastructure spending plan to a plan for overseas corporate profit repatriation; currently $2.5 trillion in US corporate profits are parked overseas, where tax rates are lower, and could be put to work building the US economy. Senate leader Harry Reid (retiring this year) stepped in and killed any chance of compromise. Watch for the Schumer-Ryan negotiations to begin again. In their negotiations, any infrastructure spending plan should involve US corporations being asked to purchase a specified amount of low interest rate infrastructure bonds as part of any generous overseas profit repatriation exercise designed to bring the $2.5 trillion back home.  So, here\u2019s my crystal ball on what is about to quickly unfold. With upcoming changes to the tax code and replacement of Obamacare, Congress will take the lead. Change will happen relatively quickly, but Team Trump will have influence in keeping the bulk of the stimulus directed at the middle class. But here\u2019s the point: The rough outlines of the proposed reforms have already been debated and are on the shelf, waiting to be quickly enacted. On infrastructure spending, President Trump will likely take the lead. Throughout his first term, the new president will position himself as the hands-on, shirtsleeves-rolled-up \u201cbuilder.\u201d In other words, on domestic policy he will appear to be more like a big city Northeast mayor than a traditional conservative Republican president. Trump will regularly visit infrastructure construction sites, with press in tow.  As always, the question is whether the end result avoids a new round of Solyndras, \u201cbridges to nowhere\u201d and other nonsense associated with stimulus and infrastructure spending in the past. The smarter approach would be for the President-elect now to do something that Congress would hate: Establish a distinguished panel of independent experts to decide which projects are funded. This would be similar to the successful military base realignment and closing commission that worked so successfully between 1988 and 2005. But then again, when has Washington ever adopted the smarter approach? Meanwhile, get ready for takeoff.",

He is the co-author, with Carl Cederstrom, of \u201cThe Wellness Syndrome.\u201d Unless otherwise noted, facts here reflect the research published in that book. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Andre Spicer: Liberal Americans will turn to self-improvement because of the election of Trump Gym memberships and self-help books sales will go up, but empathy may go down, he writes Donald Trump\u2019s election, in addition to worrying many Americans, will usher in a new age of self-development in American life. Following what many liberals see as a profound political defeat, people are likely to see politics as a losing game and give up on it entirely. They will stop engaging with public issues like poverty, pollution or public violence. Instead, they will focus on private concerns like their own individual happiness and health. There will be big increases in gym attendance, consumption of self-help books, alternative health treatments and therapy. President-elect Trump\u2019s ascension will exacerbate this trend. He has promised a more protectionist agenda, which will have a big influence on the way Americans relate to the outside world. But what will be more profound is the impact it will have on how Americans relate to each other \u2013 and themselves. My research indicates that they will start a turn inward, to look more closely at their own lives. More Americans becoming self-development junkies means more money for the more-than $11 billion-a-year self-help industry, but perhaps counterintuitively, this surge in self-development won\u2019t be healthy for the country overall. We all know it is a good idea to look after your health by getting more exercise and not eating too much junk food. But as I have found in my research, stoking an overriding fascination with self-improvement can have some profoundly troubling consequences. Recently, Carl Cederstrom and I took a look at the impact that the cult of self-improvement has had on our society. Our findings, published in \u201cThe Wellness Syndrome,\u201d were not pretty. We found that focusing on self-development can make people narcissistic. It can make people more selfish, as they start to overlook wider commitments they have to family, friends and their wider community. Self-development devotees become more interested in their own exercise routines than the troubles of other people.  An obsession with self-development also make people anxious, as they start to constantly worry about the state of their personal development. It can increase their intolerance. This happens when self-help addicts start to blame individuals woes on people not having the \u201cright attitude.\u201d As a result, they overlook more basic structural or environmental causes of problems like poor health, poverty and depression. We were honestly surprised to find that becoming obsessed with our personal health and happiness makes us less healthy and less happy. We learned that when we constantly tell people to maximize their happiness, they start to find things in their daily lives that used to make them happy less fulfilling. And we found out that many attempts by people to improve their health through dieting often end up making the problem worse. This impending great turn inward also won\u2019t be the first time that a liberal\u2019s defeat forced Americans\u2019 thoughts toward self-development. When Richard Nixon came to power, many Americans shifted their efforts away from building progressive political movements and started to focus on themselves. Radicals stopped protesting and started to become fascinated with esoteric religion, alternative health treatments and social actualization. This created what Christopher Lasch memorably called a \u201cculture of narcissism,\u201d which took root in American life during the 1970s. Following Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory, many liberal Americans became angry, then depressed, then gave up on public life and started working out. This spurred a voracious demand for self-help books, therapy sessions and various fitness fads. It is no surprise that one of the enduring images I have of the 1980s is a yuppie drinking a Diet Coke after a particularly strenuous game of squash.  It may also surprise people to know that turning inward following political defeat is not just an American curse. The same thing happened in Egypt recently. After the Arab Spring was crushed, middle-class Egyptians abandoned public life. It was too dangerous to even talk about politics. Instead, many began forming running groups; Egypt has now seen a huge boom in jogging. By turning inward, Americans, particularly liberal Americans, will gain a sense of control over their own bodies in a context where they feel they have no control over their political institutions. This might mean they are little more buff, but it could also denude American political life of its people\u2019s compassion or willingness to engage substantively in public life for years to come.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Merrick: When politicians talk about Brexit and Trump voters feeling \"left behind\" by globalization, they tell only part of the story They felt the empowerment given to them by social media, which made the sense of feeling left behind in the real world all the worse How did the twin political earthquakes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory happen? There are many reasons, but one answer lies in the technological and social media revolution of the last decade. In 2006, Time magazine unveiled its Person of the Year as \u201cYou\u201d: \u201cYou control the Information Age,\u201d the headline ran. \u201cWelcome to your world.\u201d Some months later, David Miliband, then a member of Tony Blair\u2019s Cabinet, captured this zeitgeist by describing what he called the \u201cI can\u201d generation, who were coming of age at a time of unprecedented technological advance. The \u201cI can\u201d generation differed from the \u201cI need\u201d era of urgent public service provision after the Second World War, and the \u201cI want\u201d consumerist generation of the 1980s in Reagan\u2019s America and Thatcher\u2019s Britain. What is the alt-right movement? Miliband wrote: \u201cThe era of \u2018I can\u2019 is the culmination of the long decline of deference and automatic authority. It is the late flowering of individual autonomy and control \u2026 People want to be players, not just spectators. They want to be contributors, not just consumers. Technology is enabling these aspirations to be fulfilled. A generation is coming to political maturity that expects not just high standards of provision, delivered quickly to specification, but also real control.\u201d Miliband\u2019s article did not mention Twitter \u2013 which was not in widespread use at the time \u2013 but it was nevertheless visionary: in the past 10 years, social media has become the great democratic leveler. Twitter and Facebook have allowed anyone from small town America or working-class neighborhoods in the UK the same access to the political debate as the liberal elites of Washington or Westminster. Anyone can tweet at a politician \u2013 and quite often get a reply. Social media allows everyone to have a say and feel part of the debate. The Internet has brought people extraordinary consumer choice, but it has also given them an unprecedented sense of empowerment. And yet, there has been a mismatch between this feeling of empowerment and the material circumstances in which people find themselves. Since the global financial crash, wages have been flattened, living standards have been squeezed. Today\u2019s workers are facing the prospect of being worse off than their parents. While there is nothing new in generations feeling the pinch, this mismatch did not previously exist because social media did not exist: there is now a gulf between the control that is felt only virtually, via social media, and the real control people feel over their own lives to improve their job prospects and living standards. When politicians talk about Brexit and Trump voters feeling \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization, they tell only part of the story. They felt the empowerment given to them by social media, which made the sense of feeling left behind in the real world all the worse. When Miliband wrote that the \u201cI can\u201d generation wanted \u201creal control,\u201d he was right. But this generation suddenly found itself saying \u201cI cannot.\u201d Having only virtual power \u2013 glimpsed, fleeting, intangible \u2013 led to a frustration and, in turn, a demand for real change. Twitter and Facebook became echo chambers of \u201cfake news\u201d and anger as this frustration boiled over.  At the European Union referendum in Britain in June and the presidential election, voters were given the democratic power to transform that frustration into global order-shattering change. What matters now is how Washington and Westminster respond. President-elect Trump\u2019s wooing of blue collar voters is echoed by Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s pledge to help the low- to middle-income families who are \u201cjust about managing.\u201d But this has to go beyond campaign slogans and promises. There is a real danger that, if wages do not rise, or living standards improve, this generation will feel doubly let down.",

Donald Trump was elected president because he spoke to a working class upset with politics as usual, says Ed McCaffery McCaffery: So instead of the standard GOP trickle-down plan, why not vastly reduce the number of people who owe tax? Donald Trump was elected president because he spoke to a working class upset with elites, politics as usual, and its own lack of economic progress.  Fair enough. But now, in the critically important area of tax, we may be about to get a bait and switch. Trump appears ready to follow the as-usual Republican tax policy by proposing a massive trickle-down cut that will save the richest people lots of money.  Trump even bragged on this to diners at the fancy 21 Club in New York, as he sneaked out for a steak this week. Ronald Reagan wrote this script, at a time when tax rates were indeed too high even for most elites to stomach; the highest rate when Reagan took office was 70%.  George W. Bush went back to this playbook in 2001 and again in 2003, slashing tax rates again from the top down.  That worked well for a bit but helped to leave the economy in shambles by 2008, leading to the Great Recession and ushering in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Trickle down has been done. Trump wants his policies big and bold.  And, one would think, different, because Trump and his movement are different from the same-old same-old. So how about this? If Trump wants to be both really bold and to answer to his own base of loyal supporters, he could try something new \u2013 he could cut taxes from the bottom up.  That is, he could take all the trillions he is willing to spend on reducing the income tax and put them all into a single item \u2013 raising the threshold for even paying the tax. Right now, the top 25% of income-tax payers pay some 87% of the income tax. How about if we just set the rate bracket levels to get the other 75% \u2013 three out of four taxpayers \u2013 out of the need to pay anything? That\u2019s basically a 13% cut in income tax revenues, higher when one considers that the elimination of the lower brackets would also save taxes for the top quarter \u2013 every taxpayer would see some benefit, but three out of four of them would stop having to pay any income taxes at all.  Bush\u2019s tax cuts were 15% across the board; this would be huger. The bottom-up plan would save money for all individuals and families now paying income taxes.  It would get tens of millions of Americans \u2013 many in the core of Trump\u2019s base \u2013 out of the need to even complete tax returns or deal directly with the IRS.  And, perhaps most important of all,  it would leave the income tax applying to fewer Americans \u2013 because roughly half of all Americans pay no income taxes, the top 25% of taxpayers are just about 12.5% of the population.  If Trump pulled off such a big bold move, he could then begin what would have to be a longer term project of fixing the income tax \u2013 closing all those loopholes he talked about closing during the election, but which are curiously absent from his actual proposals. Hope springs eternal. Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman and now his nominee to serve as secretary of the treasury, made headlines Wednesday by claiming that there would be no \u201cabsolute\u201d tax cut for the wealthy.",

Julian Zelizer says the party should look within at the reasons why it lost the election The party forgot importance of the economy and got out-organized by the GOP, he says Democrats need to stop licking their wounds and blaming others for their defeat. In the shocking aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, many Democrats have been wallowing in the outcome as they try to understand how Hillary Clinton could possibly have lost. Too many have been focused on pointing to reasons other than themselves. They have blasted FBI Director James Comey for the effect that his letters had on the dynamics of the campaign. Others, energized by the protests in the streets, have lamented how the Electoral College allowed Trump to win without the popular vote, only the fifth time that this has happened in US history. Then there are the continued attacks on the media for giving Trump so much airtime and for, in their minds, fueling his victory. But Democrats need to stop going down this path. Unless there is some much more serious introspection about what went wrong, the party is looking at a long four to eight years ahead. While Republicans certainly spent a great deal of time casting blame after the 2008 election \u2013 often railing against one of their own, President George W. Bush \u2013 much of their energy from day one centered on how to rebuild the party. Congressional Republicans promised to obstruct and stick to the party line. National party operatives mobilized their resources to influence state elections so they could influence gerrymandering after 2010. Newer voices in the party from tea partyers to \u201cReformocons\u201d such as Marco Rubio offered alternative visions for their colleagues and supporters. What can Democrats learn from the 2016 campaign? What mistakes did they make that helped produce this outcome, one that many agree has put the nation in a very unstable place? Part of the answer goes back to the 1990s when President Bill Clinton made an aggressive push, along with many allies in the party, to move Democrats toward the center on economic policy. There were a series of policy areas \u2013 tax cuts, economic and financial deregulation, free trade and fiscal stringency \u2013 where Democrats made the decision that their party had to do more to emulate Ronald Reagan conservatives if they were going to survive politically. House Democrats face post-election shake up This did not come without pushback. Many House Democrats blasted Clinton when he moved forward with the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and when he conceded to the zeal for budgetary cuts that the GOP demanded in the late 1990s. This does not mean Clinton was just  Republican lite. He was not. On many issues, notably health care, Clinton fought tooth and nail to expand the social safety net. Nor was he willing to agree to the draconian spending cuts that congressional Republicans were eager to see enacted. But in agreeing to the overall direction of economic policy since that decade, he and many other Democrats were too hesitant to deal with the economic consequences inflicted on many working and middle-class Americans who found their future to be less stable, less secure and less vibrant. As American workers saw entire industries leave their towns and struggled to make sure that their children would have a decent future, they felt the nation\u2019s leaders were leaving them behind. The forces of globalization wreaked havoc on their families. Ironically, it was Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign that operated on the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d Yet as the 1990s moved along, Bill Clinton didn\u2019t concentrate on the long-term economic effects of his policies. And his wife, Hillary Clinton, didn\u2019t emphasize the economic message this year. In this campaign, Donald Trump appealed to them, partly through blanket attacks on free trade that didn\u2019t offer much of an alternative as well as rhetoric that played to their fears and anger about how \u201cother people\u201d were making them hurt. While many Democrats are in agreement that Trump\u2019s campaign was unacceptable, the party needs to do much more to address the economic problems of less educated and nonurban voters. Democrats need to be more responsive to the political needs of unions, which had been the base of Democratic power since the 1930s. During the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders tried to move the party in this direction and demonstrated how energizing such a progressive economic campaign could be. The party needs to look back at some of the work that he and allies in Congress, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have been undertaking for several years if they are to conceive of an economic agenda that will win back many voters who left them this time around.  Democrats also need to think more seriously about old-fashioned political organization. For all the talk about the machine that the Hillary Clinton campaign had built to ensure victory, they lost. As in the 2008 primaries when the Clinton campaign struggled to keep up with the organizational prowess of Barack Obama, this time it was the Republicans who had a better ground game to win the Electoral College. Democrats made the decision to push for a 50-state strategy, investing most of their resources and energy in battleground states and even states such as Arizona, where they hoped that a Republican backlash against Trump could win them some votes. They were wrong. As Ronald Brownstein has argued, the campaign left bluer states such as Michigan and Wisconsin wide open for Trump to go in and win enough votes to win. The impact of this decision became clear. Nor have Democrats matched the organizational fervor of Republicans in congressional and state politics. Nearly as notable as Trump\u2019s victory was the ability of the GOP to maintain control of the Senate and House, and to increase the number of Republican state legislatures by four, which will continue to give them an upper hand in battles over redistricting. Too often Democrats have just been focused on the short term while Republicans have been playing the long game. For all the talk about how Republicans are not taking seriously the long-term demographic changes that could turn their party into a permanent minority, journalists have documented how much more effort they have put into organizational battles to shore up their base in Congress and statehouses across the country. Even before the presidential election, the Republicans already had developed a strong foundation of political power. Now they have the White House, so the sweep is complete. The last area where Democrats need to do much more work is figuring out how to thrive in the modern news media. In this election, Trump showed he had mastered the 24-hour, click-bait news cycle. As I wrote in a previous column, Trump devised an effective campaign to feed the media constantly with new content, to shape compelling and dramatic narratives that framed the discussion among reporters and to use social media sites such as Twitter to reach voters directly.  The Clinton campaign often struggled to figure out how to operate in this environment. Too often it was slow to respond to news stories that seemed silly or outlandish. It regularly allowed Trump to dominate the media discussion with his bombast and incessant attacks. And frequently it played into the Republican campaign by accepting the unfavorable terms of the debate that emerged from the Republicans or from the media, rather than looking for ways to push the discussion in a different direction. There were several damaging hours after the release of the first Comey letter when Clinton concentrated on explaining and responding, rather than turning attention to Comey himself. The new media environment is a volatile and emotional battleground. While the media might have serious problems, Democrats will have to do a better job working with what they have or more losses will be on the way. While Monday morning quarterbacking won\u2019t do much to help Democrats, some serious political introspection about the overall strength of their party is now essential.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Sracic is professor and chairman of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University and a former Fulbright scholar in Japan. The views expressed are his own. Paul Sracic: Trump took Rust Belt union voters away from Clinton, partly because of trade and partly because he seemed to like being around them more than his opponent did Back in September, I wrote an article for CNN Opinion arguing that there was evidence that white, working class Democrats in places like Youngstown, Ohio, were switching their allegiance to the Republican Donald Trump, and that this could prove very dangerous to Hillary Clinton\u2019s aspirations for the White House. At the time, I was taken to task by columnists such as Connie Schultz, who argued that I had little data to back up my assertions, and that I was assuming that these working class voters could be duped into believing that Trump was not really a Republican. I had relied on the actual numbers from the Ohio primary in places like Mahoning (where Youngstown is the county seat) and Trumbull counties.  And to demonstrate just how important these voters might be to the Democrats, I also linked to a study that showed how important white working-class union voters were to President Obama\u2019s victory in Ohio and Wisconsin in 2012. Trump reads letter from Patriot's coach at rally Since so many working-class Democrats in northeast Ohio have a labor background, and since they had clearly crossed over to vote for Trump in the primary, it was clear to me that Clinton\u2019s only hope was to steal an equal number of Republican voters from Trump. Perhaps because of the open seat on the Supreme Court, or maybe because the revived Comey investigation reminded Republicans just how much they disliked the Clintons, she did not succeed in this task. Trump, however, exceeded even my expectations. According to exit polls from 2012, Obama had won the union vote in Ohio by 20 points. This year, those same exits show Trump ahead by 9 points with these same union households. Meanwhile the percentage of the vote that came from union households remained almost exactly the same. In Wisconsin, although Trump lost union households by about 10 points, Romney had lost these same households by a whopping 33 points four years earlier. So again there was a major net gain. In the end, it made all the difference. I think that there are two main reasons why these voters were willing to cross over both during the primaries and on Tuesday.  The first is obvious and can be summed up in one word:  trade. Trump \u201cran the table\u201d in the Rust Belt. He not only won Ohio and Wisconsin, but also Pennsylvania and Michigan. Why? Since 2000, the U.S. has shed more than 5 million manufacturing jobs. To be clear, this job loss was not caused by free trade agreements alone. Technology had a lot to do with it, requiring fewer workers to produce the same amount of goods. According to a study published by Yale University, however, the decision made late in the Clinton administration to grant permanent normal trade relations status to China \u2013 not technically a free trade agreement \u2013 may have contributed to more than a third of the net job loss. Although Hillary Clinton also took an anti-trade position, she wasn\u2019t nearly as convincing. She had, after all, championed the Trans-Pacific Partnership during her time as secretary of state.  There was something else, however, that attracted these voters and that wasn\u2019t picked up by many analysts. Trump seemed to honestly like being around working-class people. This was one of the key implications of the rallies that Mr. Trump clearly enjoyed. This was important to a group of voters who are used to being looked down upon. The term that we use to refer to these voters \u2013 working class \u2013 implies not only a lower socio-economic status, but nowadays also a lower cultural status.  A great example of what I am talking about occurred on the cold opening of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in early October, where they replayed the first presidential debate. Overall, the skit skewered, in a fairly even-handed manner, both Trump and Clinton. It was easy to overlook the opening comments of Michael Che, who played the moderator, Lester Holt. In character, Che reminded the audience not to clap or cheer, and then said \u201cto the Trump supporters, no shirt, no shoes, no service.\u201d Notice that only Trump supporters were singled out for derision. Everyone knew that white, working-class voters form the core of Trump\u2019s support. It was an inside joke. But imagine if the Che character had tried to stereotype any other group in society in a similar fashion. Notice, also, that the hip, New York audience didn\u2019t consider it a cruel putdown \u2013 there were no groans. Is it any wonder that these voters became, in Michael Moore\u2019s words, a \u201chuman Molotov Cocktail.\u201d The result was the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. What does this mean for the United States, the Republican Party, and our overall culture? That remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that no one can take these working-class voters for granted anymore. To me, that\u2019s not a bad thing.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Merrick: Having an unpredictable president is going to make the special relationship hard to nurture It is difficult to see any common ground between the British Prime Minister and Trump Over the weekend, Donald Trump described the momentum behind what would be his victorious campaign for the White House as \u201cBrexit plus plus plus.\u201d He was right: the same upsurge of populist support he enjoyed to win the presidency was reminiscent of the way millions of working-class voters in the UK ignored the warnings of the Westminster establishment and voted for Britain to leave the EU. It would be overdoing it to say Trump\u2019s victory had its roots in the UK\u2019s anti-elite referendum revolution of summer 2016 \u2013 the Republican candidate had long calibrated his pitch as an anti-establishment swipe at Washington. But there were similarities between the UK referendum and the US election, particularly the powerful force of voters in both countries who have lost their jobs because of globalization \u2013 and Trump recognized that. 47 state calls from election night in 90 seconds There will be people in Britain today who voted to leave the EU and who will now feel vindicated by Trump\u2019s victory. But in the long-term, what does a President Trump mean for Britain and its special relationship with the US? In recent years, that special relationship has been tough: Barack Obama made his opposite number David Cameron work hard at it, with the President making clear to Britain that it could not be taken for granted by symbolically moving a bust of Winston Churchill out of the Oval Office shortly after he entered the White House.  In the last year, that hard work had paid off: Obama threw his weight behind Cameron\u2019s campaign for Britain to stay in the EU,  warning that Brexit would mean Britain would be \u201cback of the queue\u201d in any trade talks with the US. Now that Trump is president-elect, that warning is no longer relevant as Britain suddenly looks set to be pushed closer to the front of the queue. Trump, who is opposed to TTIP \u2013 the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU \u2013 has said he is interested in an independent trade deal with the UK as it finds its feet outside Europe. Yet this post-Brexit life raft does not mean that Trump\u2019s victory is good news for Britain. Theresa May\u2019s government faces a huge diplomatic challenge with the new president. Britain is charting unpredictable waters outside Europe, with its future still undecided. Having an unpredictable president to deal with \u2013 rather than Hillary Clinton, who had strong links to Britain\u2019s political establishment \u2013 is going to make the special relationship incredibly hard to nurture. Trump is more sympathetic to Russia than his Democratic opponent, a stance which will jar with Britain, whose Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson takes a hardline stance against Putin. As world leaders continue to grapple with the problem of Syria and Russia\u2019s military presence there, it is difficult to see any common ground between the British Prime Minister and new US President.  As Cameron before her, May and her government have been frosty toward the prospect of a President Trump. It is notable that, despite the historically close links between the British Conservatives and the Republican Party, Trump\u2019s closest UK political ally is Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP who helped inspire the new President\u2019s cry of \u201cBrexit plus plus plus.\u201d The special relationship is going to be under strain for some time to come.",

He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Timothy Stanley: Trump has resonant line of attack in invoking failings of Obamacare to show government needs a new broom He says election may represent voters passing verdict on incumbent by punishing his chosen successor News headlines suggest this election is largely about sex and emails. These issues matter, they reflect on the character of the presidential rivals. But 48 hours on the campaign trail this week has convinced me that more substantive things are running through the minds of the voters. I had to encourage some Republicans at one Trump rally to talk about the FBI. But people need no encouragement to discuss Obamacare. And I\u2019m hearing it mentioned among nonpolitical Americans in bars and cabs. Open enrollment for the insurance exchanges began Tuesday and consumers who logged on were in for a shock: Monthly premiums are up by an average 25%. Why? Even though the vast majority of those enrolled in Obamacare get a tax credit, which creates a subsidy to reduce how much they have to pay, the President\u2019s signature health care reform offers a great example of his mixed record, of good intentions undermined by reality. Reality Check: Trump and Pence get a lot wrong about Obamacare The number of uninsured in the United States is down, which is surely good. But government interference in the market has had consequences. Compelling everyone to buy a product raised demand. But Obamacare\u2019s effect on insurers\u2019 costs and profitability prompted a number of them to flee certain state markets, reducing supply for consumers. For instance, in many Arizona counties there\u2019s only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. The premium for the benchmark plan has more than doubled across the state. In Oklahoma, for those not eligible for a subsidy, the premiums can go as high as 69%, and in Alaska, monthly premiums can reach $760. Trump, as you can imagine, is making a big play out of this. I saw him speak about it in Philadelphia on Tuesday, in a speech that was scripted, direct and effective, although it left out some key details, including the subsidies.  But even if there\u2019s more nuance than the Republicans admit, the Obamacare mess does help Trump in three critical ways. First, it\u2019s the kind of story of administrative failure that suggests the government doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing and needs a new broom. Those with memories of the Obamacare website\u2019s disastrous start will confirm that it\u2019s become a byword for incompetence. An embarrassment. Second, Obamacare\u2019s implementation is a story of half-truths. Americans were told they could all keep their doctor or their plan. This turned out to be untrue. Finally, when voters stop to think about Obamacare they are reflecting upon the President\u2019s record. For many Americans it\u2019s a legacy of slow growth in the economy and in their wages \u2013 of only just keeping their heads above the water. Crucially, that\u2019s a legacy Hillary Clinton has endorsed and promised to protect: She says she only wants to increase government\u2019s role in health care, not reduce it. The truth about those rising health insurance premiums Her strategy is part of the transactional relationship between the Obamas and the Clintons \u2013 couples who were never close and were even at loggerheads during the 2008 campaign. But thereafter they developed a political interdependence. The Clintons campaigned strongly for Obama in 2012; Obama is now touring the country to show his support for Clinton. And Clinton presumably hopes Obama\u2019s charisma will rub off and attract minority voters. \u201cSeriously,\u201d she famously asked, \u201cis there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\u201d \u2013 a tacit admission that she is personally about as inspiring as the color beige. Obamacare's woes are a winning issue for the Republicans A braver politician would not have tied herself to Obama\u2019s wider legacy. Bernie Sanders said it was insufficiently radical; there was plenty of scope to say that Obamacare was a good idea but deeply flawed. Clinton, perhaps because she has been so closely aligned with health care reform her whole public life, has chosen to defend and expand it. That means she now owns it. And if the voters decide on balance that they don\u2019t like it \u2013 which polls suggest is the case \u2013 then she\u2019s in trouble. If Obamacare ends up mattering, then maybe this election is more conventional than we think. The candidates offer standard partisan policies on health care: Democrats favor state regulation, Trump offers a free market approach by, say, allowing people to purchase health care across state lines. Moreover, a dynamic of people passing a verdict on an incumbent President by punishing his chosen successor is as old as the republic itself. As the polls even up \u2013 and they are definitely getting closer \u2013 one explanation to entertain is that this election is at some level both typical and mundane. People are voting against the incumbent and for change. No one can deny the role that working-class anger and cultural reaction has played in Trump\u2019s support. But it\u2019s likely that for millions who vote for him, the decision is a rational one that they calculate is best for their family.",

Draut is the author of the book, \u201cSleeping Giant: How America\u2019s New Working Class Will Transform America.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Tamara Draut: The notion of working class as male is obsolete. Women have poured into this group Draut: Candidates must show this critical voting bloc they grasp need for fair wages, fair work schedules, child care and more The working class has been getting a lot of attention about how it\u2019ll vote this election cycle. While it seems to be conventional wisdom that the working class supports Donald Trump, a deeper look reveals that this group is not as one-dimensional as many assume. Decades ago, the working class was largely white and male \u2014 those blue-collar workers who heaved and hoisted America to unprecedented prosperity. But today\u2019s working class no longer fits this archetype, though the image endures in the American imagination. More than one-third of today\u2019s working class are people of color, and among the young working class, those aged 25-34, nearly half are people of color. And today, a full 2 out of 3 working class women are in the labor force, up from just over half in 1980. Today\u2019s working class isn\u2019t shuttered away in factories. It is comprised in large part of women who earn their living in caring for and serving America \u2013 clocking into jobs in the retail, fast food, home health care, housekeeping and child care industries, to name a few. These working class women usually do not have four-year college degrees and they are paid by the hour, rather than drawing an annual salary. With just a few weeks left in this election cycle, the presidential candidates still have work to do to earn the trust and support of this critical voting bloc \u2013 something that can only be achieved by understanding what working-class women care about and finally engaging in a substantive conversation on the issues that affect their lives. I was raised in a working-class family in Ohio, and have witnessed firsthand the downward mobility and gripping insecurity of the working class.  The union paychecks, stable schedules and decent benefits of my dad\u2019s generation are gone. In their place is a labor market often characterized by low-pay and too-few hours \u2014 or ones that are constantly changing \u2013 few benefits such as paid sick days and little protection from wage theft or mercurial front-line managers. Women Worldwide Demand  Action on Gender Pay Gap So it\u2019s no surprise that what keeps working-class women up at night are pocketbook issues. Their earnings shape the family budget and they are often forced to make painful decisions about how to spend each and every dollar, such as foregoing groceries to pay the rent. They want dignity on the job and for their work to be seen as valued and valuable. Is Trump advancing women's rights? In my dozens of interviews with working class women across the country, a common refrain has echoed: They feel invisible in our politics, our economy and our culture. They feel that our political leaders don\u2019t care about their struggles or their aspirations \u2013 from the daily grind of balancing work and caregiving to the dream of giving their children a better future through college, without saddling them with crippling debt. We are at an exciting time for working women. Gone is the culture war about whether women with young children should work, as a new generation has grown up with the expectation that mothers can support their households, with positive benefits for their families and their children. A growing number of states and cities are passing innovative policies (or at least seriously debating them), such as fair scheduling, ending pregnancy discrimination, equal pay for equal work, paid family leave and affordable child care and college education. In January 2015, San Francisco passed the nation\u2019s first Retail Worker\u2019s Bill of Rights, which among other things requires schedules to be posted two weeks in advance and mandates workers be compensated fairly when sent home from a shift early. This year, 13 states and four localities have considered some form of predictable scheduling legislation, with Seattle passing a secure scheduling law, Washington, D.C. coming very close, and Mayor De Blasio throwing his support and leadership behind a New York City bill. Paid family leave is now a reality for workers in five states, with many more considering legislation. This spring, New York passed the most comprehensive paid family leave law in the country \u2014 offering nearly all workers in the state 12 weeks of paid leave. One way to close the pay gap for women In last week\u2019s presidential debate \u2013 the final and most substantive of this race \u2013 working-class women did have the chance to hear a little more about the issues motivating them in this election. They heard from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on her debt-free college plan, which would guarantee an affordable higher education option at our public colleges and universities for families with an income of less than $125,000. Obama advocates for paid family leave Raising the minimum wage, enacting equal pay for women and the importance of access to pre-kindergarten also secured brief but significant mentions by Secretary Clinton, while Donald Trump was silent on these topics. But there are many pocketbook concerns for working-class women \u2013 from fair scheduling to pregnancy discrimination to wage theft \u2013 that have yet to break through. These issues must be on the table of the new administration. The reality is that the largest source of jobs in our economy are working-class jobs, requiring little education, if any, beyond high school. This is the bargain-basement economy of our present and future \u2013 jobs disproportionately done by women. Can Donald Trump win over women voters? The next president can and should commit to making every job in the United States a good job \u2014 and this should be given same priority and urgency both candidates have given to reviving manufacturing jobs.  Why? Reality: In 2015 the service industry hit its peak, employing over 121.6 million workers, 10 times that of manufacturing, which has continued a steady shed of millions since the late seventies. Working-class women want and need to hear what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will have to say about the issues that will determine their future. In these final weeks until Election Day, let\u2019s hope that they get some answers.",

Asked about the years in which he didn't pay taxes, Donald Trump said, \"That makes me smart.\" Trump wants people to give him credit for not paying taxes, but it's a huge negative with swing voters, says Julian Zelizer During Monday\u2019s presidential debate, one of the most beneficial moments for Hillary Clinton came during the discussion about Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. When Trump was asked about his refusal to release his tax returns and Clinton cited several returns from the 1970s that showed he didn\u2019t pay taxes then, Trump did not retreat. Instead he doubled down, saying, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Avoiding taxes, according to Trump, is a virtue, not a vice. The comment could prove to be extremely damaging if Democrats capitalize on it. According to The Washington Post, a group of undecided voters watching the debate in North Carolina, a vital battleground state, gasped aloud when they heard Trump stay this. \u201cThat\u2019s offensive. I pay taxes,\u201d one 52-year old civil servant said. Election 2016: Should it really be about 'The Enabler' vs 'The Cheater'? The controversy over his argument brings back memories of the last presidential election. In the middle of the 2012 campaign, Republican Mitt Romney struggled when his opponents \u2013 first, Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries and then President Obama in the general election \u2013 hammered away at stories about the ways that Bain Capital wreaked havoc on entire communities when their investments did not go well. They also went after how relatively little Romney paid in income taxes. Romney \u201cpaid only 14 percent in taxes \u2013 probably less than you,\u201d one of Obama\u2019s ads stated. Those stories, combined with the infamous video clip of Romney complaining about Obama\u2019s supporters, who he characterized as being part of the 47% of Americans who are dependent on government, enabled the Democrats to create an image of the Republican nominee as a champion of wealth and privilege. That didn\u2019t sit well with many middle class Americans who struggle to get by. But when he appeared on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show on Tuesday, Trump didn\u2019t back down from his taxes comment. Many people, he claimed, say \u201cthat\u2019s the kind of thinking that I want running this nation.\u201d Trump's America: No fat chicks While some conservatives will praise Trump\u2019s well-documented efforts to avoid paying income taxes, his comments might prove to be harmful given the basic premise of his campaign. At the heart of the Trump candidacy has been the promise to help the millions of Americans who are not enjoying the fruits of the revived economy. Even as all the economic indicators point upward, their daily lives are fraught with uncertainty, insecurity, and constant struggle. Although much of the debate did not go well for Trump, many agree that his most effective moments came when he hammered away in the first half hour on economic issues and baited Clinton into defending free trade agreements. But the comment about taxes gets to a fundamental weakness in the Trump appeal. At this point there is no \u201cthere\u201d there. The actual policies on the economy that the GOP has promoted in recent years don\u2019t quite deliver on the promises he is making. There is little evidence that the Republican agenda of deregulation, supply-side tax cuts, and cutting the social safety net add up to an economic future that is better for most Americans. Trump has been less clear on where he stands with domestic programs, other than Social Security and Medicare (where he broke with Ryan\u2019s reform agenda), but his economic policies generally fit under the Republican tent. Who won the presidential debate? Democrats have gone to great lengths to argue that Republican economic policies are highly regressive and tend to support the kinds of economic forces that have undercut the security of the middle class. When Trump, a wealthy man, boasts that he doesn\u2019t pay taxes, he plays right into an image of greed and elitism that can be used to undercut the arguments he is making to working voters in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. This is an argument that Clinton needs to emphasize,  one that goes beyond the attacks on whether he is competent enough to hold office. The Trump appeal to disaffected Democrats is a two-part mix \u2013 one part anger against immigrants who he incorrectly claims are taking away American jobs, and the second an attack on the economic policies of his opponent. While the first part of the Trump agenda will be hard for Clinton to combat, given that those animosities are deeply imbedded, the other part can be debated more successfully with undecided voters. She will have to debate his conservative populism if she wants to reverse the kind of poll movement in Trump\u2019s direction that we saw over the past month.  The tax comment gets right to the heart of a fundamental problem with the Trump campaign. Conservatism populism does not have a strong policy foundation. Trump claims to be the candidate of average Americans and he claims to be the candidate who will help struggling workers, but there is so much about his background as a businessman and his actual economic policy proposals (which have not been as unorthodox as some claim) that don\u2019t support that argument. There is a reason that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have both been highly critical of Clinton in the past, are making it clear that they have no doubts about their preference in this general election. When Trump boasted in the debate that he was proud of not fulfilling one of the most basic obligations of all citizens \u2013 paying their taxes \u2013 particularly as someone who allegedly has so much wealth, he opened up a huge opportunity for Clinton. In the next few weeks we will see if she runs with this and can avoid getting sucked into a back and forth of character assassination that will become more tempting as Trump and his surrogates unload on her marital history, her emails and the Clinton Foundation. As Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign understood in 1992, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy stupid,\u201d and Democrats would do well to remember that lesson.",

Very strong night for @HillaryClinton.  I guess prep matters.#2016debates Trump had so many missed opportunities to nail HRC on a multitude of issues. Corruption, trustworthiness, Benghaz, totally unprepared for it Tomorrow I'm calling my accountants at McGregor in Orangeburg, SC. Me nor Donald Trump are billionaires, I need to pay no taxes too. Didn't love all of Lester Holt's questions, but he struck a good balance tonight. Tough job. If your assessment is that the American people is the loser, you are trying too hard to be balanced By the way, you know you've lost \u2013 badly \u2013 when you are walking through the spin room yourself. Someone get @KellyannePolls some advil. I'm sure she needs some after banging her head against the wall for 75% of that debate. #Debates2016 Trump was shaken. After the debate, Trump compliments himself for not talking about Bill. Hillary Clinton OWNED HIM LIKE A GIRL BOSS. Well, not gonna lie, I can't imagine any fair person not thinking Clinton did great while Trump was immature and defensive.#Debates Trump must do better in the next debate.  More focus on Hillary lies. Less defending every little attack from Hillary. #debatenight #debates .@HillaryClinton closed SO strongly. So much for Trump's accusation she lacks stamina. Trump just collapsed as debate worse on. Here is a question I expect to hear debated: Did Lester over-compensate for Matt?  #debatenight Trump is just talking & spewing words, phrases and free thoughts of disconnected loudness. He's not a leader, he's an entertainer #notready He doesn't know what \"first use\" doctrine is or the debate about it.  He just doesn't know.  #debatenight Trump says \"nuclear\" is the single greatest threat. Admits he agrees with Clinton then attacks Obama on climate change. Clinton pointing out Trump's \"cavalier attitude\" about nuclear weapons is effective. Getting to his lack of preparedness. And I said it, and I read it, and then they reported that I read it, and it's beautiful. Believe me.  #trumpdoctrine #debatenight #isis Hillary\u2019s campaign must be thrilled with the discussion of race.  Trump floundered around on the birther issue, which many Americans find racist.  Then, when Lester Holt tried to broaden the conversation, and asked Trump, \u201cWhat do you say to people of color?\u2026\u201d Trump interrupted and said, \u201cI say nothing.\u201d  Uggh. When Hillary was asked to respond to Trump\u2019s meandering mendacity on race, she said, \u201cJust listed to what you heard.\u201d  The audience loved it.  A little levity, a little ridicule.  Very effective. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House #Trump just missed a \"HUGEE\"  massive opportunity to attack Hillary's server on #cybersecurity issue! #Debates2016 #debatenight HRC is vulnerable on the cybersecurity issue given her \"extreme carelessness  w/her own emails. Trump also vulnerable on Russia.#Debates2016 Hey trump don't bring up ur alleged being nice to Muslims. Don't use as a prop.  Ur words have caused hate crimes vs us. #HofDebate16 Hillary, bad answer on police bias. Why say, \u201cimplicit bias\u201d is a problem for everyone, not just police. It\u2019s too much like \u201call lives matter.\u201d What a cop out, can\u2019t she just say: Yes, I believe some police officers do have an implicit bias against black & brown people. We see that every day not only in the percentages of black people who are shot and killed by police, but in arrest rates and incarceration rates. Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Trump says he's irritated about how Clinton is running nasty ads about him. \"And I'm not doing that to you, Crooked Hillary.\" #Debates2016 Are we seriously talking about #birtherism more than #ISIS using chemical weapons on our soldiers? #DebateNight #debates Hillary is holding back for fear of coming across as pushy. But she\u2019s letting Trump get away with lies and distortions. Needs to punch harder. Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. So President Obama has to produce his birth certificate which no president has ever done BUT Trump won't release his tax returns!?#Debates Civility went south fast in this debate. Trump lost composure quickly, talking over Clinton, ranting, and warning he will get to Pennsylvania Avenue no matter what, as though owning a hotel is the same as being POTUS. Holt doing great job under the circumstances. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. Hillary: Balancing policing and civil rights is complicated.Trump: Blame immigrants!!!!  And Obama!!!!#Debates2016 #debates While working at ESPN, the culture was the \u201cloudest person in the room was right.\u201d Of course, in a room full of men, women were often at a disadvantage. Like Trump, they yelled out cliches, slogans and sports talk that meant nothing. But it worked - at least for the short term. Hillary has to be a loudmouth, at times. Unfortunately, it works on TV Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Donald Trump is the man Black America has been waiting for to tell them about their communities There is a fundamental contrast that has driven this race \u2013 the insider vs. the outsider.  Trump has, so far, used that contrast to his advantage.  He has recognized that this electorate appears to be fed up with \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201cestablishment\u201d politicians.  He has repeatedly invoked the charge that Clinton is a typical politician who has accomplished nothing during her long career in politics and public service.  He has reminded people over and over again that she has been in the public eye for a long time (30 years, he says). This framing fundamentally advantages him in a race where people, according to recent polling, seem to be calling for change. Lanhee J. Chen is a CNN Political Commentator. He was the Policy Director on the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and served as Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s chief policy adviser. Hillary's wasting time with these stories of Trump stiffing employees, bankruptcies. Undecideds will be moved by fear that he is uninformed. A dial group sponsored by Women\u2019s Voices/Women\u2019s Votes is instructive.  The line representing unmarried women dropping precipitously when Donald Trump interrupts and talks over Hillary Clinton. Trump, at least at the beginning of the debate, seems intent upon showing strength.  But strength can cross a line into bullying.  Ronald Reagan showed strength, but never bullied like this on a debate stage.  This will not help Trump close the gender gap. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House Trump: \"You don't learn a lot from tax returns.\" Or from Trump University, amirite? #Debates2016 Hillary should not try to stand on the accomplishments of her husband. Mentioning NAFTA was a mistake. Stay in the future and tell us what she wants to do for the American. She also needs to interrupt more. Stop being so polite! Once he stops flapping his hands, Trump takes over the debate. Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Hillary has yet to plant in undecideds minds that Trump is unprepared. Instead arguing his vague platform on its merits. Tone matters. @HillaryClinton needs not to try to go toe to toe with @realDonaldTrump in sarcastic one liners. Because Trump clearly doesn't have a plan, his only options is to attack Hillary's.  Sad.#debates #debates2016 \u201cJobs are fleeing the country,\u201d Trump says. He is correct, but it\u2019s disingenuous to say that he also is shipping jobs overseas in his own companies (Trump ties, for example.) How can we believe him, when he doesn\u2019t acknowledge his own business practices. It would be more honest for him to admit that he doesn\u2019t want to do business in the US either because it\u2019s not profitable for him. Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Trump: \"I'm a great believer in all forms of energy.\" Lies and racism are RENEWABLE SORUCES OF ENERGY #Debates2016 This debate, so far, is playing to Hillary Clinton\u2019s strengths. The focus is on policy and the records of the candidates, which she has adeptly addressed in previous debates.  Clinton is drawing substantive contrasts so far, while targeting her rhetoric solidly at independent, middle-class voters. Lanhee J. Chen is a CNN Political Commentator. He was the Policy Director on the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and served as Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s chief policy adviser. She says he rooted for housing crisis.  3rd time she has confronted him.  Pushing his buttons.  Will he respond?  #debatenight I like that @HillaryClinton refers to her small-businessman dad, contrast with Trump being born on third base thinking he hit a triple Lester Holt is the third candidate on the stage. Many people watching him to see how the media handles Trump. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. When asked how he will FIX the economy, Trump complains about problem then says \"we have to stop it.\" ?!?!?!?!#debates #debates2016 This debate won\u2019t change a thing\u2026there are two types of voters in this election those that vote on facts and those that vote on feel.  I highly doubt this debate is going to sway anyone from the feel to the fact or the fact to the feel camp. Mel Robbins is a CNN legal analyst. The way I see it, Trump and Clinton have singular jobs tonight, and this is what I\u2019ll be looking for in terms of \u201cwho won\u201d: She has to make him look dumb. For undecideds, it will matter less that he\u2019s a bully or a liar. She has issues with trust, too. What will scare them is how unprepared he is. Every chance she gets to point this out will rack up her score. For him, he has to hammer one point home: she is more of the same. Undecideds know her character flaws. What will move them is concern that she won\u2019t bring any real change, because she just doesn\u2019t get it. He can score points by hammering this over and over. Everything else will be noise \u2013 entertaining noise \u2013 but unlikely to move voters. S.E. Cupp is a CNN political commentator, regularly appearing across the network\u2019s programming and special political coverage. I hate to be this guy, but debates as currently constructed are a terrible way to pick a president Aides say @realDonaldTrump is not one to \"dive into briefing books.\" This job he's running for kind of demands it, though. On @CNN with @lanheechen and @donlemon. Talkin' debate prep. Trump doesn't need prep; he needs tranquilizers. I expect a sedated Donald. Why, yes I will be live-tweeting tonight's #DebateNight.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Sally Kohn: Sanders' campaign was unexpectedly successful and impactful Sanders and his supporters need to support Clinton in order to win the election, she says And so it ends. Sort of. On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders is due to appear with Hillary Clinton at a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where many expect Sanders will endorse his former rival. It\u2019s worth reflecting on the Vermont senator\u2019s unlikely journey as a presidential candidate. Bear in mind that a year ago at this time, Clinton bested Sanders by a 48.5 point margin in national primary polls. By early April of this year, Sanders had come within a percentage point of Clinton \u2013 in other words, within the polling margin of error. By the effective end of the primary season, the day before California and New Jersey Democrats cast their votes, Clinton was back ahead, but only by 11 points. Sanders had literally come out of nowhere to mount a serious, sustained challenge against one of the most presumably presumptive front-runners in presidential campaign history. Who is Hillary Clinton? And Sanders was, to say the least, an improbable candidate. Though before she announced she was running, Clinton, now 68, was dogged by questions about whether she was too old for the job, Sanders, at 74, is even older. (And few have made an issue of Donald Trump\u2019s age, even though he turned 70 last month.) If Clinton risked seeming overly staid and unhip in the mass media-fueled era of politics, Sanders was a living caricature of the concern. That he literally couldn\u2019t seem to be concerned with combing his hair or buying a suit from this century \u2013 let alone smiling and glad-handling and seeming pleasant and not grouchy \u2013 belied the current orthodoxy of politics and zeitgeist of the moment. Yet somehow, to borrow from Huey Lewis and the News, Sanders was so square he was hip.  And his curmudgeonly, I-can\u2019t-be-bothered-with-anything-else persona lent a sense of raw urgency and conviction to his message about the disastrous level of economic inequality in America. Bernie Sanders was very much hip to the economic anxiety of poor and working class Americans \u2013 and he made their fears and concerns more politically popular. This has, by and large, been a fairly substance-free election \u2013 with Trump\u2019s tantrums leading the way in drawing all meaningful media and public attention away from matters of actual policy that affect our lives. Especially within this context, Bernie Sanders deserves immense credit for running a deeply substantive campaign that will indelibly shape American politics for the foreseeable future. In fact, Sanders\u2019 mark can already be seen in the draft of the Democratic Party platform that was finalized this weekend. The platform includes Sanders\u2019 call for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage indexed to inflation and a provision to reinstate the Glass-Steagall restrictions on banks\u2019 activities and declare that \u201cno bank can be too big to fail.\u201d Black skin: A uniform we can't take off The platform also includes strong planks on criminal justice reform and imposing a price on carbon. The Sanders team didn\u2019t get everything they wanted.  There\u2019s no plank calling for banning fracking, though there\u2019s language to regulate it.  And a Sanders-backed plank opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal was voted down.  But still, it is by far the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party. \u201cI think if you read the platform right now, you will understand that the political revolution is alive and kicking,\u201d Sanders\u2019 policy director Warren Gunnels told NBC News. Sanders groups, supporters begin to coalesce around Clinton Sanders and Clinton agree on far more than they disagree. It\u2019s time for Sanders \u2013 and his supporters \u2013 to acknowledge this and, hopefully, put their energy into turning out the vote this fall. In Orlando, some Sanders supporters shouted down an amendment to the party platform that would have named Clinton as the nominee. Some still want Sanders to keep campaigning and to contest the convention, though the Sanders campaign itself had actually endorsed the amendment. Coming at the end of a hard-fought primary campaign and a platform process that shows clear victories for Sanders and his supporters, the incident was a reminder of the bridges yet to be built \u2013 and the work still to be done by Bernie Sanders. In riven nation, the kind of people I'll vote for If Sanders endorses Clinton in New Hampshire, one might also expect that he will announce he is suspending his campaign \u2013 though I\u2019m not going to make the prediction, given that Sanders basically lost the primary on June 7 and even said on June 24 that he would \u201cin all likelihood\u201d vote for Clinton in the general election, and yet Sanders didn\u2019t officially end his campaign then.  So there\u2019s no guaranteeing he will now. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Bernie Sanders has pushed Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party solidly (and, in my mind, thankfully) to the left while engaging millions of young voters in the primary process. Now, having won more than frankly anyone ever imagined possible, will Sanders finally not only endorse Clinton but do so emphatically and enthusiastically while formally bowing out of the race?  Let\u2019s hope so. Donald Trump poses a serious and growing threat not only to Democratic prospects but the very principles and existence of our democracy. Hillary Clinton needs Bernie Sanders and every one of us to defeat Trump and build an America that upholds our shared values. It\u2019s time to move forward together.",

John McWhorter: 'Roots' remake prompts question of what does it mean to \"reckon\" with slavery? To have authentic national conversation about race we need to define our terms, he says As we take in the new version of \u201cRoots\u201d this week, we have heard, and will hear again, that both versions of this miniseries, as well as Alex Haley\u2019s novel which inspired it, challenge America to \u201ccome to terms with\u201d its history in slavery. The original \u201cRoots,\u201d which aired in 1977 to record audiences still flushed from America\u2019s bicentennial, seared slavery into the American consciousness in an unprecedented way. Never before had the whole nation seen slavery enacted so vividly and with such tragic pull. Staying up past my bedtime night after night to see the show with my parents remains one of the most arresting memories of my childhood. There was no home video yet, so I was never sure how I might ever see such a show again. There is a case to be made that in the 1970s, \u201cRoots\u201d did indeed push the U.S. to \u201ccome to terms\u201d with slavery. Certainly much recent cultural and public dialogue about slavery traces its way back to \u201cRoots\u201d: Consider the feature films \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cAmistad,\u201d the African Slave Burial Ground in New York City, the New-York Historical Society exhibit about slavery in New York, the discussion of reparations for slavery in the late 1990s, black Americans\u2019 interest in tracing their genetic ancestry, and even criticisms that the smash Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d is remiss in downplaying the role of slavery in its characters\u2019 lives. However, at this point we must ask a question. How do we define the \u201cterms,\u201d and at what point can we say that they have been met? Many will argue today \u2013 and with good reason \u2013 that we still haven\u2019t \u201ccome to terms\u201d with slavery. We haven\u2019t \u201creckoned with\u201d it. But in 2016, our discussion of such matters would be more constructive with a clearer sense of what those words \u2013 \u201cterms\u201d and \u201creckoning\u201d \u2013 actually mean. If the original \u201cRoots\u201d series, the current History Channel remake and the ample discussion of slavery across so many forums don\u2019t qualify as \u201ccoming to terms,\u201d then the meaning of the phrase is less clear than we may think. For example, will coming to terms with slavery require granting slavery\u2019s descendants reparations of some kind? This outcome seems unlikely, but if this is indeed the \u201creckoning\u201d intended (or needed), then we should be clear about that. Or, does \u201ccoming to terms\u201d instead mean more general awareness about the history and impact of slavery? If so, we still need to zero in a bit. America\u2019s intelligentsia and educated class are grievously dismayed about slavery. They would appear, that is, to be very much \u201creckoning\u201d with it in the conventional sense of that term, as grappling with and processing something difficult, contradictory, or irreconcilable. But if there are people who still feel that America hasn\u2019t \u201ccome to terms\u201d with slavery, then they are claiming that in an America in which Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d is a megahit best seller. 'Roots' is getting a remake If that America is one in which slavery is still not reckoned with, then I assume that the problem is that the rest of America \u2013 \u201cout there,\u201d as blue-state America likes to term such people \u2013 still hasn\u2019t come to the terms in question. That is, the logger in Washington state, the Indian immigrant shopkeeper in Queens, the small-town white grandmother in Kansas who works the voting tables at election time, that guy working in the toll booth \u2013 collectively, they don\u2019t care (or know) enough about America\u2019s roots in slavery. Is this why so many people think that America hasn\u2019t \u201ccome to terms\u201d with slavery? One might ask just what it would do for black people\u2019s everyday lives if, say, the TSA guy and the hairdresser truly \u201creckoned\u201d with slavery. One might also question how practical it is to expect that this reckoning could ever be so universally accomplished in as vast, heterogeneous, and troubled a society as ours. I might be accused of caricaturing people by calling for \u201creckoning\u201d here. \u201cNo one has said the guy who installs your cable has to \u2018reckon\u2019 with slavery,\u201d one might object. Many viewers who respond to this new version of \u201cRoots\u201d may say we still haven\u2019t \u201ccome to terms\u201d with it, despite how widely discussed the topic has been in this country in the past few decades. But if \u201ccoming to terms\u201d refers neither to reparations nor to all Americans understanding how slavery has shaped their nation, then the phrase must have lost what we would call meaning long ago. When we say \u201ccoming to terms\u201d in reference to slavery and race, or talk about America \u201creckoning with\u201d it, it seems more like a refrain than information, like singing \u201ctra la la\u201d or \u201cHey nonny nonny\u201d in antiquated song lyrics. But maybe it only seems that way. I sincerely hope that people talking about slavery do so with intention and a belief that change can happen in the world we live in. I hope that they aren\u2019t actually using a kind of liturgical language, in which the incantation that \u201cwe haven\u2019t come to terms\u201d is the end in itself, a generalized expression of anger about the past and dissatisfaction with the present, disconnected from any plan for the future. 7 shows that mattered in the '70s A real discussion about race needs clarity about, well, the terms of the conversation. The \u201cRoots\u201d remake is, of course, but one occasion that gets people talking about how America has yet to \u201ccome to terms with\u201d race, with an implication that a certain shoe has yet to drop, that some kind of judgment day is to come. But as with all long and hotly discussed issues, it has gotten to the point where people often use words more as rhetorical strategies than as vehicles of precise meaning. Back in the 1970s, I could sense that \u201cRoots\u201d had changed the conversation on race in America by burning slavery into the national mind in a newly urgent way. Here in 2016, I see the fact there is even a remake as evidence that a lesson was well learned and is being passed on. And I sincerely wonder: what more terms are there to come to?

Kennedy once said, \u201cThe great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie, deliberate, contrived and dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.\u201d It\u2019s quite an apt observation, considering the horrendous policy position on the issue of the Trans-Pacific Partnership now contained in the draft Democratic Party platform \u2013 a position that puts the party at electoral peril in November and, more important, leaves it at odds with the interests of working people, one of its most important constituencies. This past Friday, at the party\u2019s public hearings in St. Louis, representatives of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign attempted to insert a single line into the trade section of the platform: \u201cIt is the policy of the Democratic Party that the Trans-Pacific Partnership must not get a vote in this Congress or in future sessions of Congress.\u201d It failed on a straight \u201cparty line\u201d vote, with every one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s representatives giving the thumbs down on the amendment. This development is a gift to Donald Trump\u2019s jeremiad against bad trade deals. There is still time to adjust course. The full platform committee will meet in Orlando next week to consider the draft document. Elected labor delegates represent a significant percentage of delegates overall. Regardless of whom they will support when the roll call comes to determine the party\u2019s nominee, they could, and should, unite to support the Sanders\u2019 language on TPP. They would then stay true to labor\u2019s stated position \u2013 and strengthen the Democratic Party\u2019s potential for electoral victory against Donald Trump in November. Count me as one of those people who never believed in Clinton\u2019s newfound opposition to the TPP, which she previously had called the \u201cgold standard\u201d for trade pacts (as a recent video confirms). Even Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, publicly reassured his members that Clinton would be back in the fold if she became president. She has consistently supported so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d while Sanders has opposed every such deal dating back to Bill Clinton\u2019s NAFTA. But, her campaign wisely understood she could not hope to capture the party\u2019s nomination running as the true corporate-friendly Democrat she is. Regardless of whether Clinton is truly on board with the TPP, she and her delegates should embrace the inclusion of anti-TPP language in the Democratic Party platform. Whether they have supported Clinton or Sanders in the primary contests, virtually all unions oppose the TPP.  And trade is not some secondary topic that will fade away as we enter the general election. For a quarter of a century, the labor movement has wisely opposed NAFTA-style deals, which set up rules protecting corporate rights, with meaningless verbiage about labor and environmental safeguards slapped on as a microscopic Band-Aid to try to mollify critics. GOP seizes on recently surfaced video to hit Hillary Clinton on trade Since NAFTA\u2019s passage, hard-working Americans have watched millions of unionized jobs evaporate. Workers, who once made a living wage, now labor for substandard pay with no benefits, partly because they are afraid to demand more in the face of corporate threats to close up shop and move to another country with slave-like wages. The current low-demand economy, with its hiccupping anemic growth, can, in part, be traced to so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d \u2013 too many people have jobs that just don\u2019t pay enough money to meet expenses, not to mention save anything for retirement. To be clear, Barack Obama\u2019s trade agenda will only advance because it is supported by the bulk of the Republican members in Congress. The majority of the Democratic caucus in the House and Senate oppose the TPP, as do a majority of Democratic Party voters. So, effectively, to be in step with Hillary Clinton\u2019s true views on trade, the majority on the drafting committee is shilling for corporate America at a time when millions of people are clamoring for economic policies that support the people. Astonishing. The greater danger lies ahead. I have been warning for many months that Donald Trump\u2019s assault against NAFTA\u2013 a position contrary to his party\u2019s mainline orthodoxy \u2013 will give him traction in critical swing states like Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other communities hurt by NAFTA-style trade. It is beyond mystifying why Democrats would hand an unhinged, dangerous man, who is alienating people of all walks of life, a political lifeline that affords him a megaphone that we should own. Moreover, it would be a deep blow to Obama\u2019s legacy if his misguided pursuit of the TPP, in opposition to his own party\u2019s rank and file, paves the way for a Trump presidency. Failing a change in Orlando, this is an issue that is worth a knock-down, drag-out public fight on the convention floor. Sweeping the TPP under the rug in the name of some false unity would be a great disservice to our country. Where one stands on the TPP is not simply an item on some check list but a fundamental expression of values and what the party stands for. Politics often gives us great ironies. When I pulled up the AFL-CIO web page on its TPP opposition, up popped a web ad supporting Clinton. With her smiling face, it featured a quote from her: \u201cUnions helped build the great middle class in history.\u201d That is absolutely true. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone envisioned the jarring visual contrast between that quote casting a shadow over a policy that will eviscerate unions and the middle class.

Jay Parini: Donald Trump has drawn support from the Rust Belt, Appalachia Parini says many have been cast aside in the past few decades, as jobs have shifted abroad They have seen their world shredded, hollowed out and mocked It\u2019s time for all of us to listen, to hear the hopes and fears, the groans and angry riffs that arise among white working-class Americans in the so-called Rust Belt and Appalachia, many of whom support Donald Trump for the presidency (though Bernie Sanders also holds some appeal).  Not a single one of these people \u2013 on whom this critical election in November may turn \u2013 wants their children to live without economic  prospects, and many of them know that education is, as it has always been, the only way out. And education begins, as it always has, with acute listening. I don\u2019t take Trump seriously as a candidate \u2013 he\u2019s too wacky, inconsistent and immature \u2013 but I do take seriously the voters who put their money on him.  They have been woefully cast aside in the past few decades, as the industrial base has changed, as jobs have shifted abroad or transformed in unrecognizable ways.  They have seen their world shredded, hollowed out and mocked. Trump maxing out his 'man card' I grew up with these people, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where the anthracite mining industry left the people high and dry a very long time ago.  Nothing has replaced that industry, and I would not be surprised if many of them found something appealing in Donald Trump:  a return to yesterday, when life was perhaps simpler and certainly more prosperous. The brute fact is that we\u2019re never going back to the 1950s.  We live in a global marketplace, with information technology changing the way we do business and live our daily lives. Is Trump's past catching up with him? Despite the rhetoric of Trump or Bernie Sanders, it will never work simply to cut free-trade agreements, which make up an essential part of our economy.  And we benefit hugely from these agreements, with a big trade surplus in manufactured goods with 20 countries with which we have pacts. Anyway, you can\u2019t force an economy to change its colors and forget about market forces.  Like it or not, it\u2019s a commercial world, and commerce is necessary for our survival. Should Trump apologize? That's for voters to decide But Trump supporters rightly sense that their environment has changed in ways that leave them high and dry.  The rich only get richer.  When they see immigrants working, they assume (wrongly) that these people are taking their jobs.  More worryingly, they see their children without a future, as education has become far too expensive.  (It costs over $60,000 to send a child to the college where I teach for a single year!)  And so they regard upward mobility as part of the long lost \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d Why I am backing Donald Trump It gets worse and worse.  They feel culturally threatened on every front.  They like and probably need to drive their pickups (and probably don\u2019t believe in climate change).  They like to hunt \u2013 it\u2019s part of their culture \u2013  and they\u2019re afraid (the NRA is telling them, loudly) that someone in Washington wants to take away their guns. They know for sure they were taken for a ride in the Bush era by protracted and pointless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   What did Americans actually get for the thousands of lives lost, for billions and billions of taxpayer dollars spent on \u201cnation building,\u201d on propping up failed regimes in far-flung places? They got zip. Many of these white working-class people are deeply religious, and they feel that their practices are disrespected, even threatened, as a culture moves steadily away from organized religion, with more than a third of Americans under 30 professing no faith at all.   It may trouble them that Trump is far from religious \u2013 in fact, he pretty much embodies everything Jesus condemned.  Yet they worry that their religious views are threatened. But does the government listen to them? It doesn\u2019t, of course.  Instead, there is derision, and decisions from the top (such as the transgender directives, however well-meant) that are not only puzzling but annoying.  To put it simply, the cultural rug has been pulled out from under these people. Trump's devils could lurk in tax return details Trump knows this, and he knows how to talk to them.  Let\u2019s give him credit for that. But he doesn\u2019t have anything for them.  Only huge disappointment, as taxes are lowered on the wealthy.  Do you think Trump understands for a moment that their children need a good education to lift them out of the downward draft?  Despite his own Wharton education, he plays to the anti-intellectualism that has long been a defensive measure among poor white workers.  One suspects they don\u2019t really know much about his own proposals on loans for students, which seem destined to put higher education even further from their reach \u2013 at least judging by what Sam Clovis, his campaign co-chairman, has said. We must listen closely to Trump\u2019s voters.  They responded to the hate speech he has spewed on the campaign trail, but we need to understand why.  We need to hear them out, and address their deeply human wish to earn a good living, to live in a safe country, and to feel hopeful about the future for their children.

He challenged Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Senate primary in New York in 2006. He is the author of several books, president of the Economic Future Group and the publisher/editor of Working Life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jonathan Tasini: Bernie Sanders' story is powerful appeal to working class voters New polls show Sanders is a stronger candidate than Clinton against Trump, he says Many observers may scratch their heads wondering how a crass billionaire can make inroads with working-class voters, but their confusion misses a critical point: The political revolt that benefited Donald Trump is not limited to the Republican Party, but is also in full fury inside the Democratic Party. Democrats, by embracing in the 1990s a series of bipartisan policies geared toward corporations at the expense of American jobs, have since failed to adequately defend America\u2019s working class, and those voters are making their presence felt at the ballot box as a result. Recent polls show the frustrations they feel toward the Democrats pose a real danger in the race for the White House, depending on who ends up winning the nomination. Quinnipiac found a battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to be an essential tossup in three key swing states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Meanwhile, in West Virginia, 53% of Democratic voters said global trade deals take jobs away from American workers. Establishment Democrats are trying to wave off a recurring theme in poll after poll, including the Quinnipiac numbers and Tuesday night\u2019s primary results: Bernie Sanders is a much stronger general election candidate versus Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday even showed Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton running nearly neck-and-neck nationally. Leaving aside Florida (which has been closely contested in recent presidential elections), the three other states tell an important story. Since the mid-1990s, a broad swath of American workers has felt shut out of every debate over economic recession or recovery. Particularly for those workers who once had unionized, middle-class jobs with solid benefits, finding decent-paying jobs has been a bust. According to Public Citizen\u2019s analysis of official government statistics since 1994, both Ohio and Pennsylvania have lost over 300,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs each. That same time period coincides with the passage and implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the creation in 1995 of the World Trade Organization. Both were championed by Bill Clinton, and his Labor Secretary Robert Reich, and endorsed by both parties. These so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d deals have one common thread: They set up rules benefiting corporate rights, particularly the protection of capital and patents, at the expense of wages for workers. During the 1990s, President Clinton also urged many Democrats to support other corporate-friendly measures: deregulation of the financial industry (which arguably set the stage for the recent financial crisis), welfare reform (which ripped away a safety net for millions) and tax cuts for the wealthy that exacerbated the divide between rich and poor. Enjoy getting your high cable bills every month? You can thank the Clinton administration\u2019s 1996 deregulation of telecommunications, which ushered in a wave of anti-consumer mergers. Indeed, the much-ballyhooed Clinton economic \u201cmiracle\u201d was significantly built on a credit bubble, not robust or sustainable wage growth. Today\u2019s rejoinders to criticism of these policies from many establishment Democrats underscore how tone deaf the party elites have become. They claim that things would be a lot worse if Republicans had been running the show. Without a doubt, I believe that to some extent, that is true. However, \u201cHey, vote for us because we\u2019re not as bad as the other guys\u201d is a lackluster slogan \u2014 a wheezing plea that lacks credibility for many voters who have been ignored for decades. Democrats\u2019 longtime backing for corporate-friendly policies has, unsurprisingly, created fertile ground for the appeal of a huckster who pledges to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Many voters are flocking to Trump not based on a complete list of specific policies they dislike on the left or support on the right. They just see a tidal wave of mounting debt, no hopes for a good job and, by contrast, the game they\u2019re losing being rigged in favor of a tiny group of people. Working-class voters have a sometimes inchoate sense the political establishment \u2013 anyone with experience serving in public office \u2014 has abandoned them to suffer while aligning themselves with forces many people can describe only vaguely as \u201cWashington.\u201d Trump, who is schooled in the ability to sell anything and has a finely attuned ear to people\u2019s wounds and desires, can promise in grand terms to heal their hurt \u2014 even if he has no intention of doing so. With Hillary Clinton\u2019s record-high negatives in the area of trust and honesty \u2014 exceeded only, to her good luck, by Trump\u2019s even higher negatives on those attributes \u2014 she will struggle to convince these voters that she feels their pain. She\u2019ll gain some traction thanks to Trump\u2019s sexism and the Republicans\u2019 relentless assaults on her. But the fact remains that she, like her husband did, has advocated the bipartisan policies that have hurt working Americans and she represents the very establishment people are aching to kick to the curb. By contrast, Sanders\u2019 authenticity and his consistent opposition to the policies people feel, in their gut, have hurt them continues to resonate. Indeed, in the wake of Sanders\u2019 victory in West Virginia, even New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D\u2019Allesandro, a Clinton supporter, told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cEvery time [Mr. Sanders] presents himself and presents his story, more people start talking about him.\u201d 5 takeaways from West Virginia and Nebraska People talk \u2014 and voters turn out \u2014 because Bernie Sanders\u2019 story is powerful. It describes, truthfully, what has happened to the working class in America. As a result, he is winning the debate about what the party should stand for \u2014 forcing a moderate, corporate-funded Democrat like Hillary Clinton to mimic his rhetoric and agenda. As we move into the final phase of primary season, we will soon know whether the party will also field the stronger opponent to the snake oil Donald Trump is selling.

Elites dismissive of insurgencies, but leaders' failures have given them strength, Julian Zelizer says Wisconsin's GOP governor chose policies to favor donors instead of middle class, he says Key test of the future of the presidential race will be Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, he says The political establishment has been sounding pretty sanctimonious these days. In both parties the leadership has railed against the insurgent campaigns \u2013 Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump \u2013 not only raising concerns about the candidates but also expressing dismissive sentiments about the voters who are supporting these campaigns. How Donald Trump sees himself Among Democrats, the party leadership has looked down on Sanders voters who it believes are unrealistic about their goals and falling for simplistic analysis about how politics works. When one reporter said to former Congressman Barney Frank that it seemed he was saying Sanders voters \u201chave a slightly unrealistic sense about the political process,\u201d Frank responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t say slightly.\u201d What the MRI of Donald Trump's soul reveals On the Republican side, many party leaders and prominent conservative pundits describe Trump supporters as working and middle class Americans being duped into following the xenophobic and angry rhetoric of the frontrunner. But as voters go to the ballot box Tuesday in Wisconsin, it is a good time to take a closer look at what\u2019s been going on in the electorate. Though the terms usually used to characterize the voters who are shaking up the conventional wisdom are \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cfrustrated,\u201d there is much more going on. And much of it stems from the problems in the political system itself. For many years commentators have been warning about the way the connections between money, lobbying, and politics have been damaging the body politic. Could we trust Trump with U.S. foreign policy? Many of the voters in both parties have a fairly clear-eyed understanding of some of the basic problems that are afflicting the nation\u2019s political process and, regardless of what one thinks of the candidates, those problems are pretty substantial. Rather than simply think of ways to stifle these insurgencies, the parties should take a closer look at themselves and their approach to government. Sanders has talked a great deal about the corrupting influence of money on politics. While some Democrats dismiss this as merely a one-issue candidacy focused on inequality, Sanders has insisted that this issue is so big it pervades almost all aspects of the political system. The power of money within the party system, he has argued, rigs the rules of the game so that the constituencies whom Democrats have claimed to be championing \u2013 the middle class \u2013 keep losing out. Both parties have become too influenced by the world of lobbyists and campaign donors. Democrats, at a time that the party decided to focus more on appealing to suburban, professional voters, became more intertwined with the world of campaign contributors from the world of business, who are often less hospitable to policies that protect workers or help the disadvantaged. Dear women who love Trump: Ditch this guy Republicans, who were already starting from a position that social safety net programs are never a good thing, have moved even further away from middle- and working-class concerns as a result of the extremely tight alliance between wealthy donors and GOP officials. Liberal Democrats have seen the consequences of these changes firsthand in Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker, with the ongoing support of the Koch brothers, has conducted a systematic and vigorous campaign to undercut the power of unions in one of the most progressive states. He has also gone after the state\u2019s prestigious university system, historically a hotbed of progressive thought. And although his presidential campaign failed, Walker has been extraordinarily effective in his own state. Supported by big donors, Walker was able to emerge as one of the most powerful voices in state politics and undercut the power of the public unions. Donald Trump's bizarre war on women The Wisconsin chapter of Americans for Prosperity (the local affiliate of an organization founded by the Koch brothers) has poured resources into anti-union campaigns in the state. The corporate-funded Club for Growth paid for ads against labor unions during Walker\u2019s battles. He relied on the Koch brothers to help him in the fight against the liberal backlash to his policies. When he faced a recall election in 2012, Walker received substantial financial support from Americans for Prosperity. As the power of the union movement diminished, the influence of Democrats waned. A N.Y. debate with Sanders: What's risk for Clinton? Whereas 11.7% of the state\u2019s workforce belonged to unions in 2014, only 8.3% were members one year later as a result of numerous factors, including Walker\u2019s policies. Walker has adopted policies that favor the energy industry, in which the Koch brothers have major interests, by moving to dismantle key environmental regulations. While donors may be satisfied, the alliance between business and the Republican Party has led to policies that fundamentally disadvantage working-class Americans. Regressive tax policies, deregulation and diminished social services, all of which the GOP has gradually embraced, have left many Americans more vulnerable than ever before to the vagaries of the economy. Bernie Sanders is this year's biggest story Though many economic indicators are better in Wisconsin than other parts of the country, a large number of voters are feeling the pain of losing strong unionized jobs that have been replaced by positions  that are less secure and often don\u2019t cover the basic financial needs of their families. While Republicans since Ronald Reagan have tried to win over Democrats by promising they can offer a better deal, in Wisconsin many have learned that this is not the case. The party often used social and cultural issues as a way to win over these voters despite the disconnect between the party\u2019s economic agenda and their pocketbook concerns. A recent article in The New York Times by Nicholas Confessore recounted how the party became more closely allied to Wall Street at the expense of the growing number of blue-collar voters who were voting for the GOP. Confessore quotes a Republican public relations executive who worked for the Heritage Foundation in the 1980s and said: \u201cThirty years later, the same people are sitting in Washington that I worked with, making a million a year, going to fancy dinner parties, and they\u2019ve done nothing to move the ball. Therein lies the great chasm between the think tanks, the ideologues and the real world.\u201d Could Trump ticket cost Republicans Congress? So while Trump offers most of the wrong solutions, there are good reasons his appeal has hit home with many voters. It is unclear whether this will be enough to win the state. Recent polls show Ted Cruz doing extremely well, particularly after a series of controversies have raised yet more questions about the viability of Trump as a potential president. Trump\u2019s recent comments about punishing women who received abortions, a remark he soon retracted, raised even more concerns from women voters about his policies and generally about how prepared he is on key issues. Yet Trump still holds the delegate lead nationally, and it\u2019s clear that his campaign has resonated, in terms of its message, with a large number of voters. Rather than focus only on the messenger, both parties would do well to listen to what the voters are saying and to become more introspective about what role they have played in generating so much unrest. Both Democrats and Republicans are not simply blindly rebelling this year, they are using their voices to address some big and basic problems in American politics that have been ignored for far too long.

Julian Zelizer: Listen to Bernie Sanders' policy ideas and you can see how his views are mainstream They appeal to Americans worried by economic challenges, Zelizer says Bernie Sanders\u2019 stellar victory in New Hampshire showed that his campaign has some serious legs. He won 6 of 10 voters and led in virtually every demographic category, except for those over 65 and households earning more than $200,000. Slowly, Sanders has been undercutting Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral strength and putting together a campaign that could go all the way into the summer convention. The Clintons continue to dismiss the idea that Sanders is a serious candidate, painting him as someone who is too left of center and a politician who doesn\u2019t make the kind of serious, detailed arguments that most adult voters will demand. To be sure, there is a good deal of logic to the Clinton argument. It is extraordinarily difficult to imagine that a democratic socialist could win a general election in the post-Ronald Reagan era. Bernie Sanders' political career But Sanders\u2019 political appeal is based on much more than the thrill of an anti-establishment insurgent or some unexpected love affair of millennials with a Brooklyn socialist. Part of what has given Sanders his strength is how mainstream many of his standard political arguments are. If one listens to what he has been saying, it is possible to see that Sanders is not that radical at all. In many respects, his campaign directly addresses fundamental concerns that a wide range of Americans have about their future. The best known issue in Sanders\u2019 arsenal is the claim that there is too much money in politics. The government is constantly unable to respond to the concerns of many Americans, not because the parties don\u2019t like each other or because the mainstream media creates a destructive environment, but because big interest groups and lobbyists have disproportionate power in Washington as a result of their donations. In their landmark book, \u201cWinner Take All Politics,\u201d the political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson provided a powerful account of how the growth of corporate lobbies in the 1970s produced changes in public policy that greatly worsened inequality. Opinion: Donald Trump can win -- and he must be stopped The breakdown of the post-Watergate campaign finance system, culminating with the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, has produced a political process where there are almost no barriers to flooding politicians with dollars. Why Hillary Clinton's gender matters Without reforming this process, it is unrealistic to expect that any president or Congress will be able to enact substantive changes that challenge the status quo. It makes sense when he says that, \u201cAmerican democracy is not about billionaires being able to buy candidates and elections. It is not about the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and other incredibly wealthy individuals spending billions of dollars to elect candidates who will make the rich richer and everyone else poorer.\u201d One only has to read Jane Mayer\u2019s brilliant new history of the Koch brothers, \u201cDark Money,\u201d to understand why this argument is so important. When Sanders speaks about this issue with passion and principle, in way that is difficult for Hillary Clinton (given her ties to big money through fund raising, speech-making and the Clinton Foundation), his arguments ring true with many Americans, including centrists, who feel this is a fundamental issue. They watch the stories about Super PACs funding candidates and hear from retiring legislators who say that fund-raising now consumes much of their time in office, and sense that this issue is the one that the government really needs to deal with before anything else moves forward. Sanders also speaks to many middle-class Americans who don\u2019t feel that their future is secure and who are struggling every day to make sure that they don\u2019t fall on the wrong side of the growing economic divide. For many years now, social scientists have demonstrated how middle-class Americans have become much less secure as a result of cuts to the social safety net and the exodus of good, secure jobs overseas while the separation between the rich and poor becomes more extreme. Sanders, Trump stun America Americans tune in when Sanders says that \u201cIt is the tragic reality that for the last 40 years the great middle class of our country \u2013 once the envy of the world \u2013 has been disappearing.\u201d His campaign, Sanders argues, is about \u201ccreating an economy that works for all, and not just the 1 %.\u201d Sanders promises that as president he would double down on programs that benefit the middle class. He would fight for government policies that create incentives for job growth here in the United States and programs that help to elevate the economic health of working Americans, including progressive tax policies and a robust public works program to build the nation\u2019s infrastructure while giving people work. He has proposed raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is not radical at all. Republicans are also playing on these anxieties in the electorate, albeit with an agenda that has little room for government. Though Clinton has also attempted to tackle these concerns, her ties to controversial free trade policies and her being enmeshed in a campaign finance system that privileges wealthier Americans hurts her efforts. The record of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, whose White House pushed his party toward market oriented policies and courted big business, looms large over her rhetoric. While Bill Clinton did preside over an era of significant economic growth, the divide between the rich and poor accelerated in the 1990s. Americans in the lowest income brackets struggled. As Michelle Alexander argued in The Nation, African Americans confronted what was effectively a 42 percent unemployment rate and a social safety net that had been torn to shreds. The long-term cost of the deregulatory policies he supported, moreover would become clear when the risky business of Wall Street resulted in the devastating market crash of 2008. Although he is a democratic socialist, much of his rhetoric is really just that of an unrepentant New Deal liberal. Sanders thinks government is a good, he supports the expanded use of government to help social conditions, and he believes that much of what federal officials do helps society. Many Democrats, inside and outside the base, are happy to finally hear a Democrat actually enthusiastically support the core Democratic idea. For too long, Democrats have struggled to avoid the \u201cL\u201d word and mimic Republicans. Does Donald Trump represent us? For too long, the conventional wisdom has argued mistakenly that Americans reject government. We are children of Ronald Reagan, they say, seeing government as a problem not the solution. Many Democrats have agreed and have worked hard to push the party to the center. Bill Clinton famously said in 1996 that the era of big government was over. But the Sanders campaign is on to something. Polls have consistently shown that Americans like government much more than the pundits suspect. When asked generally about government, Americans can be negative. But when asked about specific programs like Social Security or the minimum wage they jump with approval. If you listen to Sanders\u2019 speeches they often include a long list of things that government has and continues to do well. Though conservatives will argue this is radical, in many states, including red states, polls show something different. Even on foreign policy, Sanders makes arguments that really resonate in the Democratic Party. Most important there is Iraq. Nothing looms larger in recent years that the decision to go into Iraq. For many Democrats, and Republicans as well, the war launched by the Bush administration was one of the most disastrous decisions of recent decades \u2013 and we\u2019re still dealing with the consequences in the Middle East: 51% of Americans, according to Pew, still view the decision to go to war as a mistake. The numbers are down from 2014, but still a majority. In 2008, Clinton learned that many Democrats were as angry with members of their own party who went along with this decision as they were with the administration. Barack Obama made this a theme. On this issue \u2013 while in Congress \u2013 Sanders decided at the most difficult moment to vote against the war. This decision will have considerable appeal when discussions turn to foreign policy, an area Hillary Clinton has believed to be one of her strengths. This is not just the left, but a large portion of the electorate who see this as a fundamental turning point, and mistake, after 9/11. Why moms and daughters split over Hillary Clinton None of this is to say that Clinton can\u2019t mount a vigorous and effective comeback. Nor is it to say that many elements of Sanders\u2019 record, including his work with socialist organizations won\u2019t be a huge stumbling block in more conservative states. But a strategy that simply relies on dismissing Sanders as left of center or quixotic won\u2019t work. His arguments don\u2019t match this image, and his ideas will continue to excite many Democratic voters. To come back, Clinton will need to develop a more coherent and more compelling set of ideas that she can call her own. Presidential campaigns are about inspiration.  Americans understand the limits of what a president can do and the problems of our gridlocked political system, but they want to hear from candidates who are going to at least try to push for big changes from the start. A campaign based on the promise of fighting and \u201cgetting things done\u201d will continue to have trouble against a campaign about a set of powerful ideas, a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d that makes sense to large portions of the American electorate. Presidential campaigns are about inspiration. Julian Zelizer Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "The lines for a train at the Suburban Station in Philadelphia snake through each other, seemingly with no end in sight. And rush hour isn\u2019t even at its peak. \u201cBack of the line!\u201d a woman shouts. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in line for hours!\u201d Someone is trying to jump the line, and patience is wearing thin among some of the hundreds who\u2019ve already waited an hour for the Regional Rail train, the only line open in America\u2019s fifth biggest city. \u201cThis is disgusting, what\u2019s going on,\u201d Wendy O\u2019Sullivan says, over an hour into her wait. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder people haven\u2019t spazzed out down here.\u201d The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, is on strike. It has shut down the city\u2019s subway, bus and trolley services, leaving the nearly 1 million passengers who rely on them daily waiting on alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d Angel Smith, 45, says, sighing as she stands next to a yellow-chain divider keeping waiting riders in line. She can usually commute from work in the Center City business district after 15 minutes on the L train. But 45 minutes after standing in line at the rail station, she\u2019s still far from even the train\u2019s platform. She is incredulous, and struggling to figure out how she will get to work on the days she works her second job at Ross. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m gonna do,\u201d Smith says. \u201cExcept maybe just be late.\u201d Nafis Mumin, 38, stands tall atop his 9-year-old son\u2019s bicycle. It only makes it up to his knees. Mumin hasn\u2019t been on a bike since he taught his son to ride one three years ago. But with his regular SEPTA train offline, he has no choice but to get creative. \u201cThis is the commute for the next week,\u201d says Mumin, a restaurant chef and supervisor. He\u2019s frustrated, but he understands why workers are striking. The strike began at midnight on Monday after the Transit Workers Union Local 234 and SEPTA officials failed to negotiate a new contract for the city\u2019s nearly 4,700 rail workers. Among the sticking points for union leaders: pension plans and extended break times. SEPTA\u2019s break policies for vehicle operators left them little time to use the bathroom between routes, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cYou feel for them but your world\u2019s turned upside-down,\u201d Mumin says. The last strike, in 2009, lasted six days. But with a presidential election less than a week away, Philadelphians are hoping for a quicker resolution. SEPTA says it will seek a court order to bring workers back if an agreement is not reached by Election Day. Meanwhile, city leaders urged patience. Transit riders had no choice but to look to nearly any other form of transportation to traverse the city. They drove cars to places with little parking. They went to the nearest racks where the city\u2019s bike-sharing program added more to meet demand. They rode them farther than usual. They walked long blocks. They used Uber, which expanded its coverage area, and flagged down cabs in the middle of the street. Syed Badshah, who\u2019s been driving a cab in the city for a year, says the traffic this week was the worst he\u2019s ever seen it. \u201cIt\u2019s so stressful,\u201d he says, driving through the city. \u201cPassengers, they are becoming angry.\u201d Badshah knows many are just stretched financially, and the cab fares in heavy traffic can add up. At least two customers have asked to pull the car over early. Badshah, 44, says he was willing to turn off the meter and take them where they needed to go.

Normally, her daughter takes the trolley home by herself. Now, \u201cit\u2019s an hour and a half out of the middle of the day\u201d to pick her up and take her to school. The mother barely has time to talk, shouts that her name is Stephanie, and says she has to go. Local news trucks line the street outside the Sheraton Hotel, where the union\u2019s president is reportedly holed up, papers strewn out over a makeshift war table. In a statement at the start of the strike, SEPTA said \u201cthe decision by TWU President Willie Brown leaves thousands of SEPTA customers without the transit services they rely on for travel to and from work, school and medical appointments.\u201d It\u2019s why nearly half of Devin Morrison\u2019s chemistry class at the Community College of Philadelphia didn\u2019t show up on Tuesday. Her teacher filmed herself teaching the lesson on her cell phone for the students who couldn\u2019t make it in. Morrison, an engineering student, is lucky: She lives a 15-minute walk from the school. For her classmate, 24-year-old Katherine Robertson, it\u2019s a hike. She points toward a line of cars honking at the corner of campus as a reason she prefers public transit. For now, she\u2019ll begrudgingly drive. \u201cMy usual commute here is 20 minutes, [but] because SEPTA isn\u2019t running it takes me a solid hour because of traffic,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cThe highways are just so congested and clogged.\u201d With a job, school and three hours of homework a day, a commute behind the wheel is not something she can afford. Still, Robertson says she sides with the workers. \u201cIt sucks but you gotta support it,\u201d she says. \u201cFor them to not pay their workers right because they want to make that extra push that\u2019s going to make them super rich, no one wants that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The nomination would exacerbate concerns about foreign policy experience in Trump's administration Tillerson was a driving force behind ExxonMobil's partnership with Russian oil giant Rosneft Donald Trump won\u2019t get Rex Tillerson as secretary of state without a fight. The President-elect is leaning towards entrusting the ExxonMobil tycoon with the stewardship of US diplomacy, a move that could ignite the first showdown between the pugilistic President-elect and senators in his own party. The nomination \u2013 which Trump tweeted will be announced Tuesday \u2013 would be provocative, given Tillerson\u2019s personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin amid an uproar over CIA assessments that Russia likely intervened in the presidential election to help Trump. I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning. The potential selection of a millionaire oil titan also offers insights into Trump\u2019s vision of diplomacy as akin to the wheeler-dealer world of big business \u2013 and his disdain for concerns that the web of business connections surrounding him and future members of his Cabinet pose unacceptable conflicts of interest. Who\u2019s in Trump\u2019s Cabinet? A Tillerson nomination would also exacerbate concerns about the level of formal foreign policy experience in Trump\u2019s outsider administration. On the other hand, he\u2019s arguably better acquainted with world leaders than a potential pick for the secretary of state job who has spent decades toiling in traditional, lower-level diplomatic posts. Any attempt to block Tillerson would ally Democrats critical of his Big Oil worldview and potential conflicts of interests with Republican Russia hawks with the stature to defy the nascent administration. For John McCain, who branded the Russian leader a \u201cthug and a murderer\u201d in a CNN interview Saturday, Tillerson\u2019s cordial ties with Putin, whom the Arizona Senator considers a US enemy, are a red flag. \u201cIt is a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin,\u201d said the 2008 Republican presidential nominee on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cAnd, obviously, they have done enormous deals together, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\u201d Trump: Rex Tillerson is a 'world-class player' Tillerson, 64, was a driving force behind ExxonMobil\u2019s partnership with Russian oil giant Rosneft and drilling projects in the Arctic, Black Sea and Siberia. In 2014, Putin awarded the ExxonMobil CEO the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia grants to foreign citizens. McCain said that Tillerson would get a fair confirmation process if he were nominated. But he is not the only Republican senator to register alarm at the prospect of Tillerson at Foggy Bottom. \u201cBeing a \u2018friend of Vladimir\u2019 is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState,\u201d Marco Rubio said in a tweet signed with his initials on Sunday. Rubio railed against Putin\u2019s Russia during his own presidential campaign and an intervention in a Tillerson confirmation battle could help the Florida senator rehabilitate his reputation as a foreign policy heavyweight following his losing primary campaign. Another key Republican in a Tillerson confirmation process could be South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who warned Sunday Russia was trying to \u201cbreak the backs\u201d of the world\u2019s democracies. Bipartisan group of senators calls for probe of Russian role in 2016 US elections Given the 52-48 GOP advantage in the Senate, it would not take many Republican defections to doom Tillerson \u2013 though the math would be complicated if Trump names a Democrat like Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota or Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to his Cabinet. The swift umbrage expressed by some Republicans about Tillerson raises the possibility that the Trump team floated his possible nomination to gauge his chances of confirmation. On the other hand, it is also possible that an assured performance in the hearing room could placate concerned Republicans. But the ExxonMobil boss would complete a foreign policy triumvirate along with Trump and designated national security advisor retired Gen. Michael Flynn with no formal diplomatic pedigree. Flynn, however, is a veteran of military intelligence and played a key role in combating the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. While such a set up is faithful to Trump\u2019s vows to blow up the Washington establishment, it could leave the administration exposed in the event of an international crisis, particularly early in the administration. But Tillerson would be any easy fit with Trump\u2019s growing club of millionaires and billionaires around the Cabinet table, along with another detachment of retired military brass and a strong core of authentic movement conservatives. The President-elect explained on Fox News Sunday why Tillerson has moved to the top of the list for secretary of state, ahead of such candidates as former GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker. \u201cHe\u2019s much more than a business executive. I mean, he\u2019s a world-class player. He\u2019s in charge of, I guess, the largest company in the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well.\u201d Sources: Tillerson leading choice for state Trump has a point that Tillerson, as the face of ExxonMobil\u2019s global business, has expertise in negotiating at the highest levels. His contacts run deep in the Gulf and elsewhere in the Middle East, and ExxonMobil also has operations throughout Asia, which could witness a confrontation between the Trump administration and China. ExxonMobil is sometimes compared to a de facto state in terms of its power and reach, and the head of such an influential energy firm would quickly founder without in depth knowledge of geopolitics and acquaintance with the domestic politics weighing on key world leaders. And yet, Tillerson, if nominated, will have to satisfy senators that there is more to him than a businessman eyeing a new challenge in statesmanship. Not much is known, for instance, about his personal views on international relations as distinct from the positions of his company. Tillerson\u2019s attitude to the national security architecture the US has sponsored since the end of World War II will come in for scrutiny, as well as his views on alliances in Asia and Europe on which Trump has cast uncertainty. He will have to explain why his own lack of formal foreign policy experience is not a disqualifying feature of his resume. After all, negotiating is just one aspect of the job of secretary of state. The top US diplomat must also frame a coherent foreign policy doctrine for the United States, exemplify its values, have a deep grounding in history and understand the complicated motivations of its international partners and adversaries. McConnell, senators unite behind investigation into Russian hacking It\u2019s one thing to negotiate with an autocratic leader over an oil contract. It\u2019s another to do so on a contentious foreign policy issue in a way that is consistent with bedrock US values, like support for human rights. A confirmation hearing would also force Tillerson to develop positions on issues ranging from global warming to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and US humanitarian aid in the developing world. Environmentalists, already alarmed by Trump\u2019s nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt \u2013 a fierce opponent of climate change regulation of power plants \u2013 to head the Environmental Protection Agency, are mobilizing against a potential Tillerson nomination. \u201cBy naming Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, Trump would truly be turning over several key Cabinet positions to Big Oil,\u201d said League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski in a statement. \u201cHis appointment would cause a massive conflict of interest, giving ExxonMobil \u2013 a company that investigative reports have shown covered up their own climate research and misled the public for decades \u2013 an unprecedented ability to sway foreign policy to protect their own interests,\u201d he charged. While ExxonMobil, like other energy firms, has incurred the wrath of environmental groups, it did back the Paris climate accord concluded by the Obama administration this year. Cardin 'concerned' about Tillerson and Russia Tillerson\u2019s personal views on the agreement are unclear, though he has said there is a human contribution towards climate change and backed a carbon tax. Trump has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d and suggested he could pull out of theinternational Paris agreement outlining individual emission limits for member countries. If nominated, Tillerson would also have to confront claims that his position atop the State Department would represent an unresolvable conflict of interest given his past business dealings. Even if he were to sever all links and investments related to ExxonMobil, action he took as secretary of state \u2013 for instance, advocating the lifting of sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine \u2013 could clearly benefit the firm. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez laid out the terms of the brewing confirmation battle in a Facebook post on Saturday, calling reports of Tillerson\u2019s possible nomination \u201calarming and absurd.\u201d \u201cWith Rex Tillerson as our Secretary of State, the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President\u2019s Cabinet guiding our nation\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Menendez wrote. He continued, \u201cThe role of Secretary of State should not be bestowed upon someone whose only notable experience with foreign governments involve multimillion dollar deals with Russia and whose experience with the federal government seems to be limited to campaigns against the effects of climate change.\u201d Gap on Russia hacking conclusions between intelligence, FBI Tillerson might not be the only State Department confirmation battle percolating for Trump. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Sunday he would seek to block Trump\u2019s widely rumored pick for deputy secretary of state, former US ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his worldview is naive,\u201d Paul said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War,\u201d Paul added. \u201cHe\u2019s promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN connected with five voters who previously said they were undecided Three voted for Trump, one for Clinton and another for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. In the heat of a dramatic and bitter presidential campaign, CNN reporters met hundreds of voters across the country who had strong allegiances to Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. But many others were torn right up until the final days of the race, unhappy with their options and frustrated with candidates they viewed as deeply flawed. These undecided voters consistently expressed alarm at Trump\u2019s temperament and penchant for controversy, and wondered whether someone with no government experience could really assume the highest office of the land. And in Clinton, they saw a candidate who appeared to constantly blur the truth and whose election would represent more of the status quo in Washington. This week, CNN connected with five of those individuals and asked who they ultimately voted for \u2013 and why. Trump, Clinton aides clash over 2016 campaign We learned that three of them ended up voting for Trump; one for Clinton; and another for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Of the three who backed Trump, one was a Democrat and another was a Democrat-turned-independent. Both of them voted for President Barack Obama twice, but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to support the Democratic nominee this year. In extended conversations, this small group of previously undecided voters said many of the nagging concerns they had about Trump and Clinton early on in the campaign prevailed through Election Day: Trump\u2019s lack of governing experience and volatile temper; Clinton\u2019s perceived lack of honesty and struggle to do away with the email scandal. They explained what led them to cast their ballots for the person they ultimately supported and reacted to Trump\u2019s upset victory. The following are edited transcripts of those interviews. CNN met Krupski in March in Buffalo, New York. He was one of the many people we interviewed for a project about the Rust Belt. At the time, Krupski, a 74-year-old Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, said national security was one of his top concerns. Why did you vote for Trump? I was undecided at the time but I think one of the biggest things is that we thought that it would \u2013 the way things are going with the government, it would be the same old, same old. And some of Trump\u2019s ideas \u2013 sometimes he didn\u2019t express himself the best but some of the ideas I think might be good for the country and the future. The one thing that my wife had mentioned is how this Medicare program has really made things quite costly for us that are in the middle class. I don\u2019t understand that stuff too much because she takes care of the finances but if she mentioned that then I\u2019m going on with that theory. When did you decide? It came pretty close to \u2013 shortly before the actual voting. Trump with some of the things \u2013 the way he expressed himself \u2013 you were wondering, maybe this guy wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to have him as my leader. But as we got closer, it seemed like maybe he calmed down a little bit. Did you ever consider voting third party? No, I myself \u2013 I could never understand these third party candidates \u2014 you hardly hear about them. Why are they even there? Could you tell me why? What was the reason that you decided not to vote for Clinton? We don\u2019t feel that she was \u2013 doesn\u2019t have that real sincere honesty when she speaks. Was it something she said? Something specific? It\u2019s not like she was a completely bad candidate and shouldn\u2019t even be there. That\u2019s not true because she has her trail and work that she has done through the years. She\u2019s done many positive things but it came down to \u2013 as we were getting closer \u2013 and picking who you think might be the best I guess at the time and it wound up being that Trump I think would be the better for us. Who did your wife vote for? She voted for Trump, also. How about your friends and your neighbors? Actually a lot of people don\u2019t talk about it because they don\u2019t know who they\u2019re talking to and they don\u2019t want to get into a conversation. But surprisingly some people that I thought were going to voting Democrat voted for the Republican. Apparently they were swayed as the election got closer, too. How do you think your life will change with Trump as president? I know things take time. Everything isn\u2019t done right away. CNN met Wazzan several months ago during a project about the Muslim Americans and the 2016 election. His family is from Lebanon and Wazzan, 41, owns a halal grocery store and restaurant on Staten Island, New York. He is a Democrat who supported Obama twice. When we last spoke, you were leaning Libertarian. Who did you vote for? I did vote Libertarian. I just really didn\u2019t want to vote for Hillary at all and Donald Trump is not an option. You see what\u2019s happening right now after he became President-elect, you\u2019re seeing a lot of hatred and stuff. When did you decide? The day before the election, I sat down by myself to think about it and I didn\u2019t have it in me to go vote for Hillary. No way, I really hate her. She\u2019s not good for the Middle East. So I couldn\u2019t vote for her. Was foreign policy the main reason you didn\u2019t want to vote for Clinton? Yeah, being Lebanese, yeah, foreign policy was the main reason\u2026 She was really active in the Middle East and caused a lot of problems. You said this was a shocker election? It was a shocker. You know what? (Trump) read it right, everybody else read it wrong. He saw that there is a lot of hatred and all you have to do is fuel it up in the country and that would get you 85% of the white men. That\u2019s amazing. Would you have preferred Trump or Clinton? Clinton. Again, because she has experience. Look at him \u2013 he\u2019s trying to build his Cabinet and he\u2019s all over the place. Did you ever feel guilty for voting third party? The numbers are very low anyway, still. For third party, right? Absolutely not, no regrets. It\u2019s not like you made a difference. Who did most people you know vote for? Clinton. Wiles is a bar owner from Buffalo, New York. When we met him earlier this year, he said he planned to write someone in rather than vote for Clinton or Trump. Back then, Wiles predicted: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is ever going to make it because they\u2019re going to destroy him.\u201d Who did you vote for? I voted for Trump. I was really undecided because I was going to write in the guy from Roswell\u2026  I looked at it, I looked at it, I looked at it and I said you know what, Tim? You need to make a decision. You can\u2019t be that weak\u2026 Take a stance. So I took a stance and I voted Trump. When did you decide? Two days before. Although I will say this \u2013 I would never (have) voted for Hillary Clinton. Why did you vote for Trump? I voted for him primarily because I thought he was right in a lot of circumstances. But the bottom line is, the whole big picture is he\u2019s going to be entertaining. You liked that? What was the alternative? Hillary Clinton? Here\u2019s the bottom line. He\u2019s a billionaire who\u2019s got nothing to lose. Why would he even take the job? Think about that. Think about that. He wants his portrait on the wall of the White House\u2026 As crazy as you may think I am, that he\u2019s going to be there for about maybe two or three months, maybe four month, maybe five months, maybe a year, and he\u2019s going to quit and when he\u2019s done, which I think is f\u2014ing brilliant, what I think he\u2019s done is he\u2019s decided who\u2019s going to be next president which is his vice president, and he\u2019s going to resign. Did most people you know vote for Trump? Are you kidding me? You couldn\u2019t even talk about Hillary Clinton in the Swannie House (Wiles\u2019 bar). They were besides themselves\u2026 I really think the Democratic Party took a position against the regular people\u2019s intelligence. Because \u2013 you sit in the Swannie House and maybe you should even talk to everybody \u2013 the intelligence level is incredible and they actually insulted a lot of people\u2019s intelligence. They went to the level that was lowest. Are you talking about Clinton\u2019s \u201cbasket of deplorable\u201d comment? It was very insulting. It was absolutely insulting. It was horrible. And these people are like \u2013 I see it daily. Because my customers are very, very bright. Do you think your life will change in any way? He\u2019s going to get rid of the illegal immigrants \u2013 he\u2019s adamant about that. I think he\u2019s going to make businesses better. I really think he\u2019s going to get rid of NAFTA, which was wrong. I want him to get rid of NAFTA for sure. I want him to get rid of illegal immigrants. If you\u2019re an illegal immigrant, you\u2019re not here doing good things. I really think he\u2019s right here. Those are the two big things that he\u2019s going to go after and I think he\u2019s going to win. Mohamud works at her sister\u2019s store at the Karmel mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She was born in Somalia and came to the United States as a refugee in 2000. She used to be a Democrat, but when we spoke to her several months ago, she said she was undecided. Still, she definitely did not want to support Trump. Who did you vote for? I did decide who to vote for and it was Hillary. Oh well, she didn\u2019t win. I thought she would be the better candidate than Trump\u2026 The main thing was to go out there and vote\u2026 There\u2019s nothing to do about it. I always used to for Democrat and \u2026  I thought that maybe a Republican might be better this time but seeing what Trump was saying, I decided to vote for her. Why did you vote for Clinton? It\u2019s because of what Donald Trump was saying about the Muslims and other races \u2026  I was always a Democrat and this time I was thinking of changing and seeing what else is out there. But I guess that didn\u2019t happen and I ended up voting for a Democrat. What was your reaction to Trump winning? Disappointed. Surprised\u2026 In the morning, I got up and found out that he was the President-elect. So, more power to him. Do you think as president, Trump will affect your life? I really liked the speech that he did when he was President-elect. He sounded better than when he was campaigning. Right now we just have to sit back and see what is happening and how he thinks. But as of now \u2013 maybe you don\u2019t know how to feel. He hasn\u2019t done any action. Why do you think Clinton lost? I have no idea. I don\u2019t know\u2026 I have no idea. Now they are saying they have to recount some states, that something was happening\u2026 I was really, really surprised because everybody said that she would be the president of the United States of America. Do you think there was there anything Clinton could have done better? She did everything, everything that she could do. It\u2019s just my luck, that\u2019s it. Are you worried for the Muslim community? As I said \u2013 if (Trump says) he\u2019s going to do all those horrible things \u2026 then I would be worried. But right now, we don\u2019t know yet what\u2019s happening. So we\u2019re just sitting down and see what happening and what\u2019s going on. CNN met Ziller, a 48-year-old farmer from Belmond, Iowa, in January, when he was deciding between Trump and Ted Cruz during the primaries. He voted for Cruz. Then, in the general election, Ziller was torn between Trump and Clinton until the second he cast his ballot. He is a Democrat-turned independent who twice voted for Obama. Why did you decide to vote for Trump? The emails of Clintons scared me a little bit. I just didn\u2019t \u2013 I guess it was more of a trust thing than anything. I don\u2019t know. I wish we had a third choice \u2013 a better third choice. I had to go with Trump because I thought he was a businessman. He\u2019s got some flaws. So the emails was your biggest problem with Clinton? I thought the debates were fairly even. I watched all three of them\u2026 The emails, I just \u2013 it just didn\u2019t \u2013 made me a little nervous I guess. Like she was hiding something. Just going by what I see on TV. Was it a close call between Trump or Clinton? You said you hesitated? It was down to the wire. When I was in the voting booth, I still didn\u2019t know. I walked in. When I sat there, I kind of thought for a minute and then I went with Trump. What pushed you in that split second to vote for Trump? It seemed like he was in Iowa more than Hillary. It didn\u2019t seem like she came to Iowa very much after the primary\u2026 To answer the question, I guess the trust \u2013 who I trusted more. And it wasn\u2019t by much. It was by a hair. How do you think Trump being president will affect your life? Depends on if he can get China to quit buying our corn. Corn prices have dropped by half in the last couple of years and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s really going to do that or not. Do you have any concerns or worries about a Trump presidency? I\u2019m a little nervous, to be honest. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll have bombings \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m nervous. I personally \u2013 my gut feeling is, he might not go four years. I golf. I golf with some of my friends. We were golfing after the election. Trump owns quite a bit of golf courses. I wonder if he realizes that he can\u2019t just golf now \u2013 his lifestyle is totally, totally different. He just can\u2019t play 18 holes and do whatever he wants.",

Sean Duffy said Wednesday there is no need for Donald Trump to prosecute Hillary Clinton because the American public already has already made its decision about her. \u201cI think that the American people, in regard to the email server \u2013 we had a big American jury trial in this election and Mrs. Clinton lost,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican and Trump supporter told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been called out for her bad acts with the server.\u201d During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary of state after the FBI and Justice Department decided against prosecuting Clinton for her use of a private email server while serving in the Obama administration. Trump supporters embraced this plan often chanting \u201clock her up!\u201d at his rallies and Trump interrupted Clinton during the second presidential debate to say if he were president, \u201cYou\u2019d be in jail.\u201d But now the President-elect said he won\u2019t push for prosecution of his former rival, telling The New York Times that she has \u201csuffered greatly.\u201d Duffy agreed that Clinton has been through enough. \u201cAt what point, we can say is that enough. Did we get our pound of flesh on her? I think so,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s set this one aside. The investigation has already taken place. Let\u2019s move forward in making America great again.\u201d If the Trump administration is going to effectively accomplish the President-elect\u2019s agenda, he can\u2019t be tied up with prosecuting Clinton, Duffy argued. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to actually get the big things done that are going to help grow our economy and put these middle (class) Americans that have been left behind back to work, you can\u2019t have a big massive big fight with Mrs. Clinton,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "The 200-day plan is built around five main principles The draft memo reveals what the transition team has developed as a blueprint for Trump's administration President-elect Donald Trump will begin the process of reshaping America\u2019s trade policy on Day 1 of his administration, according to a memo drafted by his transition team obtained by CNN. The document lays out the skeleton of Trump\u2019s trade policy for the first 200 days of his presidency, focusing on a set of principles including renegotiating or withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 a frequent promise Trump made on the campaign trail. Who would be in Trump\u2019s Cabinet? The memo itself notes that plenty could change before Trump starts his presidency on January 20, 2017, calling the contents \u201cfor discussion purposes only.\u201d But the draft memo reveals what the Trump transition team has developed as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s administration based on its pre-election work and Trump\u2019s own campaign promises. \u201cThe Trump trade plan breaks with the globalist wings of both the Republican and Democratic parties,\u201d the document notes. \u201cThe Trump administration will reverse decades of conciliatory trade policy. New trade agreements will be negotiated that provide for the interests of US workers and companies first.\u201d What would happen if the US left NAFTA? The 200-day plan is built around five main principles, plus an extra plank on manufacturing jobs. First is renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA, second is stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, third is stopping \u201cunfair imports,\u201d fourth is ending \u201cunfair trade practices,\u201d and fifth is pursuing bilateral trade deals. The final focus, to \u201cretain and return manufacturing jobs,\u201d focuses on lowering the business tax rate and eliminating regulations on businesses and restrictions on domestic energy. The provisions on TPP are almost certainly moot, as congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle say the deal will not come up for ratification in the lame duck congressional session. Trump would then not need to take any action to kill it, because the deal would be effectively dead. Congressional leaders say TPP is dead The plan also gives benchmarks for Days 1, 100 and 200 of the Trump administration. On Day 1, Trump would begin reforming NAFTA, including ordering the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to begin a study on what the ramifications of withdrawing from the treaty would be, and what would be required legislatively to do so. He would also have the US Trade Representative notify Mexico and Canada that the US intends to propose some amendments to the treaty, which could include measures on currency manipulation, lumber, country of origin labeling and environmental and safety standards. A draft presidential memorandum at the end of the document that could be used to order the review of NAFTA orders the report to pay \u201cextra consideration to the effects such a policy change may have on the middle class, manufacturing and service sector workers, and foreign direct investment into the United States.\u201d Trump would also submit legislation on currency manipulation, review whether our trading partners engage in \u201charmful\u201d practices, and would order the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US to review food security in trade and reciprocity in international corporate takeovers (i.e. whether a US company would be able to buy a Chinese company like a Chinese company would be able to be buy a US company). By Day 100, the plan says, Trump would continue NAFTA renegotiations, would pursue cracking down on China by seeing if they could be labeled a currency manipulator and through bilateral trade negotiations. He would also bring the intelligence community into the trade world. By Day 200, Trump would be considering formally withdrawing from NAFTA and continuing to pursue bilateral trade agreements. The document notes that Congress has granted the President Trade Promotion Authority \u2013 power for the President to get trade deals through Congress more swiftly \u2013 until 2018 and it could be extended until 2021. The memo notes caveats, including that there could be negative consequences of withdrawing from NAFTA. But the document also notes those impacts could be mitigated if the US were to pursue bilateral trade agreements with Canada and Mexico. The Trump transition didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about if Trump had reviewed the document and what his thoughts were.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison announces candidacy Ellison enters contest with broad backing on Capitol Hill A new storm is brewing inside the Democratic Party as competing factions begin to grapple for its leadership as the party reels in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s stunning victory. The emerging favorite to fill the job, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, made formal his candidacy for the chairmanship on Monday, saying the party must \u201cbegin the rebuilding process now.\u201d In what might be perceived as a jab at the broader Democratic strategy in 2016, he said the party \u201cdid not motivate enough people to the ballot box\u201d in the past election and, given the Democrats\u2019 struggles up and down the ballot, that he would seek to \u201cbuild a bench not just for federal candidates, but for state and local candidates across the nation.\u201d Ellison, the first black Muslim elected to Congress, enters the contest with the backing from across the left. He\u2019s won endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders, the fiery independent and former Democratic primary candidate, along with outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is set to replace Reid in 2017, all pledging their support. But other politicos have expressed interest in the position. Howard Dean, who ran the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009, and announced last week he would again seek its top role, and is expected to be among Ellison\u2019s most formidable challengers. Another former presidential candidate, Martin O\u2019Malley, has also announced that he is throwing his hat in the ring. \u201cSince the election, I have been approached by many Democrats who believe our party needs new leadership,\u201d said the former Maryland Governor. \u201cI\u2019m taking a hard look at DNC Chair because I know how badly we need to reform our nominating process, articulate a bold progressive vision, recommit ourselves to higher wages and a stronger middle class, and return to our roots as a nationwide, grassroots party.\u201d New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman and DNC Vice Chair Ray Buckley is exploring a run, according to the Boston Globe. \u201d.@ChairmanBuckley on DNC chair, not officially running yet, but \u201cI am definitely being strongly encouraged to consider it by DNC members,\u201d reporter James Pindell tweeted. In an interview with CNN affiliate NH1, Buckley said he had received a number of calls and emails from people \u201call over the country\u201d encouraging him to run. \u201cIn the last few days there have been a lot of people calling in from all over the country, either emailing me or picking up the phone, that have expressed great interest in being able to essentially flip the DNC upside down and restructure how it operates, how it works making it much more grassroots friendly organization and less of a top to bottom organization,\u201d Buckley said. And Labor Secretary Tom Perez, an outspoken surrogate of Hillary Clinton, is eyeing a run, according to Democrats with knowledge of his plans. A number of Democrats \u2013 especially those interested in someone who can rally the party together after Tuesday\u2019s crushing loss \u2013 are floating his name and Perez is said to be receptive, according to people close to him. One upside to Perez, according to people close to him, is that he has limited experience in elected office, something a number of DNC members have raised as red flags for other contenders. But Sanders \u2013 a registered independent who caucuses with Democrats and fought a lengthy primary battle for the party\u2019s nomination this year \u2013 and top allies are touting Ellison for the job. The Minnesota congressman currently co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. In an email to supporters late Thursday, the Vermont senator said Ellison was uniquely qualified to take on \u201cthe political establishment and billionaire class,\u201d and that \u201chis experience and perspective would be key to leading the fight against Trump.\u201d Sanders also made the case for the institutional value of the DNC, an organization he and his backers clashed with repeatedly during the primaries. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of you have some feelings about the Democratic National Committee,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that it is an important entity to build, support, and maintain if we are to have the chance to organize and win in the coming elections while Trump is president.\u201d Ellison supported Sanders in the primary, but emerged as a vocal Clinton supporter after she clinched the nomination. Sanders named Ellison to the Democratic convention\u2019s platform drafting committee this summer, filling an influential slot given to the Vermont senator as a concession from the party after an unexpectedly tense nominating contest. On Sunday Ellison also won the backing from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who is retiring from Congress after the turn of the year. \u201cMy friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done,\u201d Reid said in a statement. \u201cNow is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith.\u201d Ellison\u2019s office refused to comment to CNN on the record, but he said on a Democracy For America call late Thursday that he would make an announcement about his intentions on Monday. A former governor of Vermont, Dean served as head of the DNC following his own insurgent, though ultimately unsuccessful bid for the party\u2019s 2004 nomination. As part of his leadership, Dean championed a \u201c50-state strategy,\u201d a plan intended to broaden the electoral map for Democrats. \u201cThe dems need organization and focus on the young,\u201d Dean tweeted on Thursday, proposing to renew the strategy. \u201cNeed a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.\u201d On Friday, Dean stepped down from his special adviser role at Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee he founded in 2004. But Dean, despite his considerable ties to the more liberal wing of the party, looks to be in for a struggle against a progressive left emboldened by Sanders\u2019 primary bid. On Thursday night, People for Bernie, a tech-savvy progressive group with ties to Sanders, told CNN it was backing Ellison as a first step in displacing Clinton loyalists with \u201ca leadership untainted by cozy relationships to Wall St. moneymen, corporate behemoths, dictators, or monarchs.\u201d In a jab at Dean, People for Bernie co-founder Charles Lenchner added, \u201cAny 50-state strategy must begin with a 50-state accountability project; we reject any effort to unite the party behind the agents of a failed leadership.\u201d The current head of the DNC is Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative and former CNN contributor, who is leading in an interim capacity after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on the eve of the convention. Hacked emails appeared to show Wasserman Schultz and other since-departed DNC officials discussing ways to undermine Sanders\u2019 effort to oust Clinton in the primary. Brazile has come under increasing scrutiny after another trove of hacked emails showed her forwarding questions from a town hall jointly hosted by CNN to the Clinton campaign. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett, Dan Merica, Deirdre Walsh, Tom LoBianco and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.",

My dad calls again. It\u2019s not an infection. It\u2019s acute leukemia. I start crying and people look up from their coffee at me. The doctors are waiting on a bed at UC Irvine Medical Center, which has a renowned cancer center. As soon as one opens up, they\u2019ll transfer her. She\u2019ll get the best treatment possible. Balancing motherhood and the 2016 campaign My dad says I should wait for more information before I come\u00a0home,\u00a0but Pallavi books us flights back to DC that night so I can have more flight options to California. We head to the rally for our live shot and leave before Clinton speaks, taking pictures as we go in front of the Transylvania University sign. My mom is a big Rocky Horror Picture Show fan so I know it will give her a laugh, which I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll need. As we drive to the airport I google acute leukemia. There are two major kinds and her chances of surviving either are not good. I steel myself for her long cancer battle. I thought the hardest thing I would deal with in 2016 was covering the election. It was a reasonable assumption. I have no idea that by noon tomorrow she will be gone. The day after my mom died I fly back to California and spend the three weeks before the California primary making arrangements for her cremation, planning and getting the house ready for a memorial service and covering political rallies in Southern California. The normalcy of work helps. So does wine and spending time with my sister, dad and boyfriend. We talk a lot about my mom. I think about the year and the moments that stand out to me. They\u2019re not the ones that stood out before she\u00a0died: interviewing Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump\u00a0\u2013\u00a0on his plane, no less. The moment I treasure most was the worst travel day of the entire election. Pallavi and I were trying to get from Boston \u2013 we\u2019d been in nearby New Hampshire \u2013 to Las Vegas, ahead of the Nevada caucuses. Our connecting flight from LAX to Vegas was cancelled due to weather, rebooked, then cancelled again. Pallavi and I rented a car and drove to Orange County, where I grew up, to catch the last flight to Vegas out of John Wayne Airport. We had time to kill so I called my mom. She met us at In-N-Out for double-doubles. Shortly after we dropped off our rental car and cleared security at John Wayne our third flight was cancelled. My mom made up the twin beds in my childhood bedroom as Pallavi and I headed south on the 405. That night I sat on the couch with my parents, just talking and laughing. In the morning, Pallavi and I got up around 4 a.m. and my dad, decked out in a Broncos robe and matching slippers, made us tea. I hugged my mom goodbye and drove to Las Vegas for a\u00a0Clinton\u00a0event. It was the last time I saw her.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s note: This is the first of two stories on the religious beliefs of the presidential nominees. Read about the faith of Hillary Clinton here. Donald Trump was ashamed \u2013 contrite even \u2013 as he spoke to Paula White hours after the video of him bragging about groping women was released. \u201cI heard it in his voice,\u201d said White, a Florida pastor who, outside of Trump\u2019s family, is his closest spiritual confidant. \u201cHe was embarrassed.\u201d In the video from 2005, Trump admits to hitting on a married woman and boasts that he can wantonly kiss women and grope their genitals because he is a \u201cstar.\u201d During his phone call with White, the GOP nominee said he regretted his remarks and was grateful for the evangelicals still supporting him. Later that evening, he publicly apologized in a video that was remarkably free from the usual rituals enacted by disgraced politicians. Trump didn\u2019t stand beside his wife, Melania. He didn\u2019t ask for forgiveness. He didn\u2019t lament that he had fallen under sin\u2019s sway but that by God\u2019s grace and with his family\u2019s support he hoped to earn a second chance. In fact, Trump didn\u2019t mention faith, family or reconciliation at all. Spiritual adviser: Trump more devout than you'd think \u201cIf he suddenly came out all religious, that would seem staged to me,\u201d said White, who has known Trump for 14 years. \u201cDonald has never been public about his faith, and when he has tried, it has been futile. It\u2019s not his language, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not his heart.\u201d For much of the 2016 presidential campaign, religion has receded into the background, mainly because the two major party nominees \u2013 Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2013  rarely talk about their faith. Trump is a professed Presbyterian; Clinton a Methodist. But two-thirds of Americans have said it\u2019s important for the president of the United States to have strong religious convictions, according to the Pew Research Center. And nearly 40% say discussion of religion has been lacking in this election cycle. Beyond the policy discussions and ad hominem attacks, it seems, Americans want to know where candidates\u2019 moral compasses point. Trump\u2019s attempts at public religion have been awkward, at best. He said he does not ask for forgiveness and \u201cdoes not bring God into that picture\u201d when he makes mistakes. He has tried to put money in the Communion plate and referred to the sacrament as \u201cmy little wine\u201d and \u201cmy little cracker.\u201d He mispronounced a book of the Bible, and when asked about his favorite verse, has either deferred or, in one case, cited \u201can eye for an eye,\u201d an Old Testament revenge scheme specifically condemned by Christ. (Turn the other cheek, Jesus said.) Trump tussled with the Pope and was shushed by a minister in Detroit. He often looks uneasy when pastors lay their hands on him and pray. He says he is proud of his evangelical support but not sure he deserves it. When asked theological questions, Trump often speaks in terms so vague they approach opacity. Asked \u201cWho is God to you?\u201d by the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump answered \u201cGod is the ultimate,\u201d  then began a brief spiel about how he got a great deal on a golf course before circling back to his original definition. \u201cSo nobody, no thing, no there\u2019s nothing like God.\u201d Trump\u2019s broad language often serves a purpose, says Michael D\u2019Antonio, author of \u201cThe Truth About Trump,\u201d a biography. \u201cDonald keeps his options open. He make things mysterious and unclear so that he can say anything else at another time.\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters have a different explanation. Trump is a businessman, not a pastor. He doesn\u2019t have practiced answers about religious questions, nor should he be expected to, they say. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s irreligious. (Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to several interview requests.) \u201cI think people are shocked when they find out that I am Christian, that I am a religious person,\u201d Trump writes in \u201cGreat Again,\u201d a book published during the presidential campaign. \u201cThey see me with all the surroundings of wealth, so they sometimes don\u2019t associate that with being religious. That\u2019s not accurate.\u201d Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, embodied the Protestant work ethic to an extreme. The real estate developer took his children to construction sites, even on Sundays. Life is a competition between killers and losers, he taught them, and you had to be ruthless to survive. Mary Trump, Donald\u2019s mother, tried to instill traditional Christian values in her children, her son has said. She shooed them to Sunday school at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. Trump proudly displays his confirmation photo from the church, pulling it out to demonstrate his Christian bona fides. #TBT My confirmation picture at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, NY. In the mid-1960s, like many upper-middle class families, the Trumps, including teenaged Donald, became attracted to a popular preacher named Norman Vincent Peale. Peale was the pastor at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, whose steeple has soared above 5th Avenue since the 1600s. Peale was far more famous, though, as the multimedia juggernaut who preached the \u201cpower of positive thinking.\u201d In his books and lectures, Peale married pop psychology with hopeful insights gleaned from the gospel. Sin and guilt were jettisoned in favor of \u201cspirit-lifters,\u201d \u201cenergy-producing thoughts\u201d and \u201c7 simple steps\u201d to happy living. \u201cAttitudes are more important than facts,\u201d Peale said, and he exhorted his followers to bend the world to their will through mental exertion. \u201cFormulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding,\u201d Peale writes in \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking.\u201d \u201cHold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade.\u201d Published in 1952, Peale\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\u201d has sold millions of copies and spent 186 weeks atop The New York Times\u2019 bestseller list. The famous and affluent flocked to Marble Collegiate. \u201cIt was a celebrity church, and its members, in those days, were generally wealthy New Yorkers of the Protestant executive class,\u201d said D\u2019Antonio, the Trump biographer. \u201cIt was a place to see and be seen.\u201d It was also a place to buy Peale\u2019s many promotional materials. Long before entrepreneurial pastors like Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes marketed their sermons as spiritual self-help, Peale sold record albums and pamphlets with titles like \u201cHow to Stop Being Tense\u201d and \u201cNo More Gloomy Thoughts.\u201d He was also an enthusiastic champion of the free market, writing columns such as, \u201cLet the Church Speak Up for Capitalism.\u201d His parables were often about businessmen who had bulldozed their way to the top, not Samaritans who crossed the street to help a stranger. The Rev. Michael Brown, senior minister of Marble Collegiate, said there were two Norman Vincent Peales: One was the motivational speaker who tried to reach all Americans. The other was a pastor who preached the redemptive message of Jesus. 7 types of evangelicals -- and how they'll affect the presidential race \u201cOut there in civic centers he would say, over and over, \u2018You can, if you think you can,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn the pulpit of our church he would quote Philippians 4, \u2018You can do all things through Christ.\u2019 \u201d But other Christians accused Peale of peddling jingles, not the gospel, worldly success instead of salvation, and simplistic solutions at a time of increasing complexity. \u201cHe promises quick, painless, and complete \u2018solutions\u2019 to problems which may be deep and complex, and which may require real discipline and professional treatment,\u201d wrote religious studies professor and journalist William Lee Miller in 1955. Nevertheless, Donald Trump loved Peale\u2019s preaching, especially his stories about businessmen surmounting obstacles. \u201cHe would instill a very positive feeling about God that also made me feel positive about myself,\u201d Trump writes in \u201cGreat Again.\u201d \u201cI would literally leave that church feeling like I could listen to another three sermons.\u201d Trump and Peale became close. Peale officiated at Trump\u2019s first marriage, to Ivana, and at the funeral services for his parents. \u201cHe thought I was his greatest student of all time,\u201d Trump said. The businessman credited \u201cthe power of positive thinking\u201d for helping him rebound in the 1990s, when his casinos were tanking and he owed creditors billions of dollars. \u201cI refused to be sucked into negative thinking on any level, even when the indications weren\u2019t great.\u201d Trump\u2019s book titles evoke Peale\u2019s brand of pop psychology. There\u2019s \u201cThink Big,\u201d \u201cThink Like a Champion\u201d and \u201cThink Like a Billionaire.\u201d In another book, \u201cNever Give Up,\u201d Trump gives an example of how he put the power of positive thinking into practice. Scouring the newspapers for real estate deals, he found a rundown property in Cincinnati, which he bought from the Federal Housing Administration. The complex had a reputation for \u201crent runners,\u201d Trump writes, so he hired 24-hour patrols, spruced up the place and hired a \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d project manager. When the surrounding area got \u201crough,\u201d Trump sold the complex, reaping a $6 million profit. \u201cCreative, positive thinking can be a powerful source of success,\u201d he wrote. Some years ago, after services at her Florida megachurch, Paula White received a call from Donald Trump. At the time, White\u2019s star was rising. She co-pastored a Tampa megachurch with 25,000 members and hosted a show broadcast on Christian television. White says Trump told her he was a fan from afar and quoted three of her recent sermons back to her. He asked the pastor if she ever traveled to New York. In fact, she led a Bible study for players on the New York Yankees. The pastor and businessman met at Trump Tower and began what White calls a \u201c14-year conversation about God and love and a plethora of things.\u201d White hesitates to reveal much about her relationship with Trump, citing the expectation of privacy between clergy and their congregants. She won\u2019t, for instance, say whether she \u201cled Trump to Christ,\u201d a claim made this summer by some evangelical activists. \u201cThis is an ongoing walk in his life,\u201d White said. \u201cBut he is a Christian, and he is born again.\u201d For his part, Trump has called White \u201ca beautiful person both inside and out.\u201d \u201cShe has a significant message to offer anyone who will tune in and pay attention. She has amazing insight and the ability to deliver that message clearly as well as powerfully.\u201d In some ways, Trump\u2019s attraction to White seems unsurprising, said Kate Bowler, a historian at Duke Divinity School and author of \u201cBlessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s blonde and cute and perky and endlessly optimistic.\u201d Like many prosperity gospel preachers, appearance is part of White\u2019s appeal. She favors form-fitting, fashionable attire, often stalking the stage in stiletto heels. In the many glamor shots on her social media accounts, she is perfectly coiffed and impeccably made up. Like Norman Vincent Peale, White preaches a message of boundless optimism and has a strong entrepreneurial streak. She encourages adherents to \u201cpartner\u201d with her ministry for a monthly fee and sells DVDs of her sermons for $50 a pop. Such endeavors can be lucrative. According to an audit made public by a Senate committee investigating televangelists, White\u2019s former church, Without Walls International, took in $150 million between 2004-2006.  At one time, White and her then-husband owned an airplane and several multimillion dollar properties, including a condo in Trump Tower. In 2008, Trump appeared on her television show, where he said his secret of success was the work ethic instilled by his father. \u201cThat\u2019s the principle I teach,\u201d White answered. \u201cFind your passion and figure out a way to make money.\u201d Like Trump, White has seen her share of personal and financial troubles. She has been married three times. (Her current husband is rocker Jonathan Cain, the keyboard player for Journey and a co-writer of the epic hit \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019.\u201d) After White\u2019s divorce from her second husband in 2007, the church they led together faltered and plunged into bankruptcy. Still, White\u2019s sermons remain relentlessly upbeat. Though she rejects the prosperity gospel label, White preaches many of its central tenets on her show \u201cPaula Today\u201d and at her new megachurch in Orlando. White believes the world abides by spiritual laws, Bowler said, one of which is called \u201cseed faith.\u201d The idea: By pledging money to a minister, believers sow a seed, and God will reward them with a bountiful harvest, usually in the form of health and wealth. \u201cEvery time we give, something supernatural happens,\u201d White says in one sermon. Other Christians call this heresy. Faith is not a spiritual investment that guarantees automatic returns, and there is no evidence, anyway, that God wants people to become millionaires. In fact, the gospel famously said it\u2019s hard for rich men to enter heaven. Many of the Christians who have criticized White also question Trump\u2019s religious commitments. In his personal life, he has owned casinos, been married three times and boasted about extramarital affairs. During the presidential campaign, he has denigrated Muslims, Mexicans and women. Christianity Today, the flagship magazine for evangelicals, called Trump \u201can idolater\u201d and \u201cthe very embodiment of what the Bible calls a fool.\u201d A Christian columnist said Trump\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with wealth and power \u201cembodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one.\u201d The Pope himself said that anyone who talks about building walls instead of bridges \u201cis not Christian.\u201d Even Richard Land, a member of Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory board, says the candidate he\u2019s backing may not be a Christian. \u201cWhen a person says that they have never felt the need to ask for forgiveness, they have defined themselves out of the Christian faith as I understand it,\u201d Land said. White says those criticisms miss the mark. Trump isn\u2019t perfect, but nobody is, and he is on the right path, she said. \u201cI have seen change in him over the 14 years I have known him. He is a growing Christian.\u201d White also said she sees a side of Trump obscured from outsiders. \u201cI remember him calling me up one morning and saying, \u2018Paula, I know God says to forgive. But how do we know when to turn the other cheek and when to fight?\u2019\u201d \u201cIf he was coldhearted and had no desire or hunger for God, he would not have asked a question like that,\u201d White says. Several years ago, White brought a friend, Debra George, to Trump Tower. George runs a ministry for prostitutes and children in impoverished inner cities. \u201cAren\u2019t you scared to go into those areas?\u201d George recalled Trump asking. She said no, most people are happy to see her, since she comes bearing gifts and asks for nothing in return. George said Trump immediately cut her a check for $10,000 and followed with two more donations of $5,000 each. The two have kept in touch, she said, with Trump asking George to send him her sermons, and George responding with updates on her ministry. \u201cHe has shared with me how much he loves God and loves Jesus,\u201d George said. On a conference call with his campaign\u2019s evangelical advisory board earlier this summer, Trump earned a trip to the theological woodshed. He joked that repealing an IRS rule that prohibits pastors from endorsing political candidates might be his only route to heaven. It\u2019s a line he has repeated often on the trail, but on this occasion he was immediately rebuked, said Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary. (Another member of the board confirmed his account.) \u201cMr. Trump, with all due respect, the only way to get into heaven is by accepting Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice for your sins, and accepting him as your personal savior,\u201d a pastor interjected. Trump quietly agreed and quickly moved on, according to people on the line. Perhaps without knowing it, Trump had stepped into one of Christianity\u2019s oldest fault lines: faith versus works. Protestants like the evangelicals on Trump\u2019s board stand firmly on the \u201cfaith\u201d side. No amount of good deeds will save your soul, they say, if you don\u2019t assent to the proper Christian beliefs. Catholics and other Christians mostly agree, but also say that faith without works is dead. Even some evangelicals now say the pendulum has swung too far in the \u201cfaith\u201d direction, with many Americans claiming to be Christians while refusing to demonstrate Christian behavior. The Book of Bernie: Inside Sanders' unorthodox faith In the new book \u201cYou Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit,\u201d James K.A. Smith, a Christian philosopher, tries to rescue the ancient notion that we are defined by our daily dispositions, routines and disciplines. Rather than sequester \u201creligion\u201d as something we do on Sunday, Smith argues that our habits \u2013 he calls them \u201cliturgies\u201d \u2013 form \u201cgrooves in our soul.\u201d \u201cThe patterns of your life tell you a lot about your priorities,\u201d Smith said. The late writer David Foster Wallace sounded a similar theme in \u201cThis is Water,\u201d a commencement address he gave in 2005. \u201cEverybody worships,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cThe only choice we get is what to worship.\u201d Smith was reluctant to pass judgment on Trump\u2019s Christianity. He suggested, instead, taking a look at Trump\u2019s daily routines, something Smith calls a \u201cliturgical audit.\u201d As it happens, Trump\u2019s book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d published in 1987, opens with a \u201cWeek in the Life\u201d of its author. Back then, Trump was 41, mildly famous and unconsumed by the crazy fire of a presidential campaign. Trump writes that he wakes around 6 each day, reads the papers and arrives at his office around 9. From then until midnight he is on the phone or in meetings, mainly making business deals. \u201cIt never stops, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d It isn\u2019t all business, though. Trump offers a friend political advice, takes calls from his children and helps raise money to save a farm from foreclosure \u2013 a generous gesture that lands him on the evening news, he notes with satisfaction. In the book, Trump\u2019s week ends at 4:45 on Friday afternoon with a visit from David Letterman. Other than a dinner with the late Cardinal John O\u2019Connor of New York, there is no religion, no mention of God nor any hint of introspection. \u201cI don\u2019t like to analyze myself,\u201d Trump told biographer D\u2019Antonio, \u201cbecause I might not like what I see.\u201d In recent years, Trump has said that he attends church occasionally, on Christmas, Easter and \u201cspecial occasions,\u201d but that he is too busy on most Sundays. He is no longer a member of Marble Collegiate or First Presbyterian in Queens, and it\u2019s hard to picture him sitting through a service, or confessing his sins before a congregation, or listening, in quiet hours of Trump Tower, for the still, small voice of God. Trump puts his faith in work, and waits upon the whirlwind.",

            "article_content": "The tour will aim to hammer home both President Barack Obama's legacy as well as Clinton's vision The number of well-known officials backing Clinton has given her an important advantage over Trump The Democratic National Committee will blitz the swing states with prominent Democrats to help Hillary Clinton make her case in the final month of the 2016 campaign, according to a preview of the plan shared with CNN. To deliver what the DNC is billing its \u201cclosing argument\u201d of the 2016 election, it will launch a surrogate-led bus tour through more than 20 states. It will begin Sunday in St. Louis, the site of the highly anticipated second debate between Clinton and Donald Trump. The tour will aim to hammer home both President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy as well as Clinton\u2019s vision. Borrowing from the campaign slogans of both Obama and Clinton, the bus tour will be billed \u201cForward Together.\u201d While the DNC is still developing its full lineup of surrogates, celebrities and activists, civil rights leader and former presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill will hit the road on Sunday with DNC interim chair Donna Brazile. The sheer number of well-known officials backing Clinton has given the Democratic nominee an important advantage over Trump, whom few of his party\u2019s well-known politicians have fully embraced. This summer, the lineup of speakers and attendees at the Republican convention \u2013 and the decision by many prominent GOP officials to skip the event altogether \u2013 was in stark contrast to the Democratic gathering. The DNC tour will feature two buses. One will travel around Midwestern states before driving to the West Coast, while the second bus will kick off in Ohio next week and eventually end up in Florida (the final number of states and trajectory of the buses are subject to change). The Forward Together tour will focus its efforts on voter registration and early-voting, mirroring the Clinton campaign\u2019s strategy in the homestretch of the election. Its primary targets will include middle-class families, women, millennial voters and minorities. \u201cWe\u2019re hitting the road and taking our message to as many cities and towns as we can, helping Democrats win up and down the ballot from the White House to the courthouse,\u201d Brazile said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "The records are the first publicly reported detailed tax documents about Trump's financial empire Clinton has made Trump's refusal to release his tax returns a major issue of the campaign Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign Saturday night seized on a New York Times report about Donald Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, in which the Times showed he declared a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to legally skip paying federal income taxes for years. The revelations threatened to put the controversy over Trump\u2019s refusal to follow recent precedent and release his tax returns at the center of the presidential campaign less than 40 days before the election, after a week in which the Republican nominee has struggled to bounce back from a debate in which most analysts and scientifically conducted polls scored Clinton as the winner. His campaign vehemently pushed back on the Clinton campaign\u2019s effort to turn the report into an \u201cOctober surprise\u201d moment, saying Trump has a \u201cfiduciary responsibility\u201d as a businessman to pay no more tax than legally required. It also charged that the report proved that the Times and the \u201cestablishment media\u201d are merely an arm of the Clinton campaign. The report contains some of the most detail of Trump\u2019s financial empire that has been publicly reported. It was immediately picked up by Clinton\u2019s campaign, which has sought to make Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns a major issue of the campaign. Calling it a \u201cbombshell report,\u201d the Clinton campaign said the Times\u2019 article \u201creveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump\u2019s past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever.\u201d Trump \"apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades\u2014while tens of millions of working families paid theirs.\" pic.twitter.com/g62jB9fKr5 The Times\u2019 report shows Trump that year declared a $916 million loss and lists tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period for him in the early 1990s. The paper, citing tax experts, said Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades. The paper says it obtained the three pages of documents when they were mailed to a reporter last month. A postmark indicated the documents were mailed from New York City, and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower. The paper did not look at his federal return. It obtained one page of his New York State resident income tax return as well as the first page of New Jersey and Connecticut nonresident returns. CNN has not independently verified the documents\u2019 authenticity. Trump himself responded via Twitter on Sunday morning, saying: \u201cI know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes.\u201d I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes \u201cI have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!\u201d he added. I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ! In its statement issued Saturday night, the Trump campaign said the GOP nominee has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in other taxes, including property and real estate taxes. \u201cThe only news here is that the more than 20-year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained, a further demonstration that The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\u201d the statement said. The Trump campaign statement was notable because it did not directly deny the allegations in the Times report. It also noted that though Trump had paid some taxes, it did not specifically say he had paid income tax. Trump has maintained that his tax returns in recent years are under audit and that he has been advised by his lawyers that it would be unwise to release them while that process is going on. However, there is no legal reason why someone under audit cannot make their tax records public while they are running for office. Candidates for president have released their tax returns for decades. But by refusing to release his tax returns, Trump, who has broken every other rule of politics during his stunning outsider campaign, has been, in effect, betting that he can outlast the demands of opponents who want to make his tax history a pivotal issue in the end game of the campaign. The impact of the revelations in the Times story were difficult to gauge in their immediate aftermath. But they seem certain to keep the issue of Trump\u2019s tax returns and questions about his business prowess \u2013 which are at the center of his public image and rationale for running for president \u2013 at the center of the campaign over the next week. Trump has just endured a rough week after scientifically conducted polls and most analysts agreed that he lost the crucial first presidential debate to Clinton. Early polling after the debate also appears to indicate Clinton is getting a modest boost from her performance. The Republican nominee has also spent the week in a war of words with Venezuelan-born former beauty queen Alicia Machado, who was mentioned in the debate as a woman who had been the victim of unflattering rhetoric by Trump. The feud plays into Clinton campaign charges that Trump harbors prejudice against women and Hispanics \u2013 two crucial demographics that could help decide November\u2019s election. The issue could be next scrutinized at the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, forcing Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence \u2013 who has released his tax returns \u2013 on the defensive. Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have also released their returns. The extent to which Trump\u2019s tax controversies will damage him could also take time to play out. But there is evidence that a majority of voters believe it is important that candidates for president release their tax records. In a Monmouth University poll last month for instance, 62% of those asked thought it was very important or somewhat important for candidates to show their tax records. Trump\u2019s decision not to release his tax returns is a complicated issue politically, and the controversy shows the complications of someone like Trump, with a vast business empire, running for president. On the one hand, conservatives have long viewed the Internal Revenue Service with disdain and it has long been a plank of the Republican Party\u2019s orthodoxy that taxes should be lowered across the board. The GOP also sought to make political capital out of claims that the Obama administration used the IRS to target the tax-exempted status of conservative grassroots and Tea Party groups. So it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Trump\u2019s core voters, who harbor deep suspicion of the federal government, would applaud his efforts to avoid some tax liability \u2013 as long as he acted within the law. But Trump\u2019s appeal in Rust Belt swing states has been aimed directly at voters who feel they have been left behind by the uneven economic recovery \u2013 and who see Wall Street figures with vast means as able to use legal maneuvers to escape the kind of tax burden that ordinary middle-class voters must bear. So far, Trump has been able to position himself as the scourge of high finance and the New York financial elite \u2013 despite having moved in proximity to such circles for decades. Saturday\u2019s Times report is likely to make it more complicated for him to pull off that feat. It may also undermine Trump\u2019s self image as a consummate dealmaker and businessman. He repeatedly argues that he has created a \u201cgreat company\u201d worth billions of dollars and implicitly argued that expertise equips him to manage the US economy and renegotiate what he has styled as global trade deals that disadvantage the United States. Anything that contradicts that image could be politically damaging. And the story of those financial losses could be a humbling one for a candidate who has incessantly bragged about his wealth and referred to a $1 million loan he received from his father as \u201csmall.\u201d Trump and his campaign have sought to redraw the battle lines in their fight against the Clinton campaign by defining the race as one between an elitist insider and a change-making outsider. But the possibility that Trump may not have paid any income tax for 18 years will undermine Trump\u2019s message that Clinton abides by a different set of rules than most Americans by putting Trump at that very level. Saturday\u2019s developments come less than a week after Trump appeared to indicate that he had not paid federal income tax over an unspecified period during a debate with Clinton. The Democratic nominee accused the billionaire of refusing to release his returns because he wanted to hide how little tax he had paid. \u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Trump replied, and also said that any tax money he had paid would have been wasted by the federal government. Later, however, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Trump said that he hadn\u2019t made such a comment. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all,\u201d Trump said in the spin room after the debate. \u201cIf they said I didn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t matter. I will say this: I hate the way our government spends our taxes because they are wasting our money. They don\u2019t know what they are doing, they are running it so poorly.\u201d Trump is also playing with fire in refusing to release his tax returns. In the last presidential campaign in 2012, for example, Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s resistance to releasing his tax returns was exploited by President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. Romney\u2019s eventual decision to release tax returns also hurt him when it emerged that because most of his income as a former venture capitalist came from carried income and capital gains, he paid an effective tax rate of only around 14%. Although he was compliant with the law, it was easy for the Obama campaign to portray him as out of touch with the struggles of everyday Americans who have to pay higher tax rates on lower levels of income. It would not be hard for the Clinton campaign \u2013 under pressure from Trump\u2019s appeal in Rust Belt swing states left behind by globalization and a transforming economy \u2013 to make a similar argument.

            "article_content": "Democrats had expected to take the Senate this fall, but are struggling Georgia candidate Jim Barksdale is trailing badly and not attacking Donald Trump Rev. Raphael Warnock crouched forward in a back pew here at Ebenezer Baptist Church and wondered what could have been. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of Johnny Isakson,\u201d said Warnock of his Republican senator, at times distracted by the decades-old, muffled recordings of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s sermons that echoed in this historic sanctuary. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a symbolic candidacy. I would\u2019ve run to win.\u201d A few hours later, the Democrat who is challenging Isakson instead of him, Jim Barksdale, tried to evince that same optimism speaking to a group of supporters at a Tex-Mex restaurant in Gwinnett County. \u201cThis is a winnable election. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you anything else,\u201d said Barksdale, a 63-year-old soft-spoken investment manager and political newcomer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in it if I didn\u2019t think it was winnable.\u201d Barksdale, however, trails Isakson by 16 points in a Monmouth University poll released Monday, even though Donald Trump is up only 3 points ahead of Hillary Clinton. Georgia is looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for Democrats trying to win back the Senate \u2013 and many fault Barksdale himself. \u201cWe were giving a godsend, I believe, with Donald Trump,\u201d said Barksdale supporter Leonard Ware as he waited for the candidate to speak in Gwinnett. \u201cIf we had a stronger candidate, we could\u2019ve taken that Senate seat.\u201d Georgia poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in tight race For national Democrats, Barksdale\u2019s disappointing bid is part of a broader trend facing the party that came into 2016 with a favorable map of Senate races. In Ohio, Ted Strickland has been hampered by repeated gaffes and fundraising woes that have led national Democrats to essentially abandon a once-top candidate in the homestretch. Democrats have begun to make similar moves in Florida, where Patrick Murphy \u2013 once a young, impressive recruit poised to flip a GOP seat \u2013 has suffered dearly for embellishing his background and given Republican opposition researchers a trove of material. And here in Georgia, a half-dozen prominent Democrats passed on challenging Isakson, a decision that some in the party now rue. Even with the tight presidential race, Barksdale isn\u2019t trying to capitalize on any anti-Trump sentiment in Georgia. He didn\u2019t mention the GOP presidential candidate when meeting supporters campaigning Friday and barely addressed it until CNN asked him about the top of the ticket in an interview. That\u2019s a far cry from the Democratic playbook that has proved to be moderately successful in other Senate races. Democrats have tortured GOP incumbents like Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Richard Burr in North Carolina for their embrace of the nominee, and the poll numbers show it. Part of his reticence is that Barksdale, a former Bernie Sanders-backer, says he believes there are issues where he agrees with Trump. And he predicted a slew of Barksdale-Trump voters this November. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how somebody can pull the lever for Donald Trump on the Republican side \u2013 who is so anti-the-establishment and anti-the-trade-things \u2013 and then pull the lever for Johnny Isakson,\u201d Barksdale said. Georgia Democrats have long seen their political viability as resting on the state\u2019s booming minority population, and Barksdale\u2019s campaign agrees. If he can consolidate the black vote and win 85% of the community\u2019s 2.1 million voters, Barksdale aides say, he can win. First on CNN: Adelson to spend at least $45 million on 2016 races in boost for GOP The problem, revealed in a walk along this city\u2019s historically African-American Sweet Auburn neighborhood: People don\u2019t know who he is. \u201cBlack dude?\u201d asked Paul Jones, a registered Democrat sitting on a ledge outside an abandoned park here, asked about the white Barksdale. \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d Some here do know Isakson, and he is a revered figure in some pockets of Georgia\u2019s middle class. At a major Republican call center in Isakson\u2019s home base of Cobb County last week, nearly everyone calling on his behalf have some personal relationship with the two-term senator \u2013 whether they teach his granddaughter at Sunday school or write to his personal email every few weeks. And a trio of prominent Democrats, former US Sen. Sam Nunn, former Gov. Roy Barnes, and current US Rep. David Scott have all publicly backed Isakson, snubbing their own nominee. Despite Trump\u2019s struggles \u2013 especially among independent women in the suburbs \u2013 Isakson\u2019s team is calm and confident, thanks primarily to the caliber of the man they are facing. Their main concern is how much Barksdale himself plans to invest his campaign. He has invested $3 million so far, and he declined repeated questions about how high that total would go. \u201cNo question that our Democratic friends are kicking themselves, given how volatile the electorate has become, for not having recruited a candidate with a higher profile with a better set of policies and messages,\u201d said Heath Garrett, Isakson\u2019s chief strategist said at their campaign office. \u201cThe flip is \u2013 they have a candidate that\u2019s willing to write a check,\u201d added campaign manager Trey Kilpatrick. Aside from not going after Trump, Barksdale has had other missteps that have cost him. The list of grievances among Georgians against Barksdale is long: the time conservative radio ridiculed him for misspelling \u2018judgment\u2019 on his campaign website; his sparse public event and interview schedule, stripping him of needed exposure; and his inability to effectively consolidate the Democratic base. Barksdale is further to the left than the centrist Senate bid waged by Michelle Nunn in 2014, who was thought to be a good ideological fit for Georgia despite being walloped in an open-seat contest. His calling card \u2013 the cotton Bailey flat caps that he wears each day \u2013 has drawn criticism as well from Georgia power brokers. \u201cI get a lot of compliments on it,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was worried that it wouldn\u2019t appeal within the, let\u2019s call it, minority communities \u2013 but it really does.\u201d The cap has emerged as the signature emblem of Barksdale\u2019s laggard campaign, with one soft-focus television ad featuring Georgians securing his cap over their hair (\u201cCould I give you a good look here?\u201d he told one grade-schooler here before revealing his balding head.) His office in littered in cap imagery, with supporters imploring Republicans to \u201csend the hat\u201d \u2013 not Barksdale, or as some call him more forgivingly, \u201cthe man in the hat\u201d \u2013 to the Senate. National Republicans don\u2019t send trackers to his events and have barely advertised against him as well. Republicans concede that Isakson would have faced a stronger test if Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed, or rising star state Rep. Stacey Abrams, or presidential scion Jason Carter, had not so strongly resisted overtures from party leadership to run a race seen as winnable. \u201cI had conversations with folks who were thoughtful about their request, and I was speedy in my response,\u201d said Abrams as she awaited a flight. \u201cI was very unequivocal about the fact that I had no interest in running for the Senate.\u201d \u201cI thought seriously about it and I came this close to running,\u201d said Warnock, who said he wanted to remain at his church. \u201cThis was not my time.\u201d Several Democrats pointed to trends that explained Democrats\u2019 candidate problems nationally \u2013 poor showings in 2014 sapped ambition from some red-state hopefuls, while others made their decisions well before Trump\u2019s struggles. Democrats did not land their first-choice recruit in North Carolina, and others have not lived up to the hype that came with their entrances into the race. \u201cWhen you look at states like North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana \u2013 which were places that no one thought were going to be competitive this time last year \u2013 I think it speaks to the quality of the candidates that came forward,\u201d said DSCC spokesman Lauren Passalacqua, who would only characterize Georgia as \u201canother area that we think is competitive in a year when Republican have struggled.\u201d Isakson, for his part, takes some credit for the Democrats\u2019 A-team declining to challenge him. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of friends. And I try to represent all the people when I\u2019m in office,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m grateful they decided to stay where their careers were.\u201d The biggest challenge for Isakson at this point is getting to 50% \u2013 the number he needs to avoid a run-off in January. The Monmouth poll has him at exactly that mark \u2013 with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. Isakson aides predict a runoff would cost each side more than $20 million, and it could become a national spectacle should control of the Senate hang in the balance. \u201cIf Johnny gets into a general election runoff, there will be money from all over the country that\u2019s going to pour into Georgia,\u201d said Eric Tanenblatt, a longtime Republican fundraiser and power player here in the state. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were to win the White House, does she come down here to campaign for Barksdale?\u201d But that may be the Democrats\u2019 best hope at this point. \u201cI was not the likeliest candidate,\u201d Barksdale said. \u201cIf anyone else had gotten involved that I thought I was credible, I would\u2019ve certainly let them carry the water instead of me.\u201d",

The George Washington University poll finds 42% of likely voters supporting Clinton and 40% backing Trump, within the survey\u2019s margin of error. \u201cDespite close numbers, Hillary Clinton is poised to win by dominating the issue dimensions of governing, caring, temperament and being for the middle class,\u201d said pollster Celinda Lake, a Democrat and president of Lake Research Partners, a group that conducted the poll with the university. \u201cThe key is to have voters focus on the true choice for the country.\u201d After being presented with several possibilities for how they may vote, about a quarter of poll respondents said they would vote for a third-party candidate or a candidate \u201cfrom the other political party than the one that you usually support.\u201d While most of those surveyed \u2013 59% \u2013 said they would \u201creluctantly vote for the candidate of the party you usually support,\u201d 13% said they might not vote at all. The majority of both Clinton (60%) and Trump (54%) supporters said they are actually voting in favor of a candidate opposed to against their opponent. More voters have a favorable view of Clinton (43%) than Trump (38%). \u201cWhat is particularly notable is that, in addition to the strongly negative views of expected opponents, Mr. Trump also has a majority unfavorable rating with voters whom his campaign has been targeting like men (55%), white voters (51%), middle-class voters (59%) and voters whose top issue concern is dysfunction in government (66%),\u201d said pollster Ed Goeas, president and CEO of The Tarrance Group, which helped conduct the poll. Voters said the economy (21%) and government dysfunction (18%) should be the most important priorities for the next president. The overwhelming majority of likely voters \u2013 73% \u2013 surveyed are worried about an economic downturn that could negatively affect their families. The GWU poll comes one day after a CNN/ORC survey found Trump clinging to a 2-point lead over Clinton, 45% to 43%, also within the poll\u2019s margin of error. The GWU poll surveyed 1,000 registered likely voters nationwide from August 28 to September 1. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Clinton and Trump attacked each other's security credentials at campaign events Tuesday Trump unveiled endorsements from military brass, while Clinton launched a new ad Hillary Clinton attacked Donald Trump as inexperienced. Trump called Clinton a failed foreign policy leader. So began the homestretch to Election Day, as both candidates on Tuesday put national security squarely at the center of the 2016 campaign in the belief that it gives them the advantage. Trump began by unveiling a list of 88 retired military leaders endorsing his candidacy, including four four-star generals and 14 three-star flag officers. Then, alongside retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn at an event in Virginia Beach \u2013 where fighter jets could be heard whooshing overhead \u2013 Trump said of Clinton that \u201cvirtually every decision she\u2019s made has been a loser.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201clooks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBoy, would he like to see her \u2026 Because just look at her decisions. Look how bad her decisions have been.\u201d In a split-screen moment, Clinton took the stage at the same time in Tampa to launch her own barrage of attacks. Clinton dismisses calls for another congressional probe \u201cWe are going to work with our allies, not insult them. We are going to stand up to our adversaries, not cozy up to them. We are going to have real plans, not claims and secret plans,\u201d said the former secretary of state. Trump argued later Tuesday during a rally that Clinton\u2019s email use and her handling of classified information is \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d \u201cPeople who have nothing to hide don\u2019t smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don\u2019t bleach \u2013 nobody\u2019s even ever heard of it \u2013 their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law,\u201d Trump said, pointing to Clinton aides\u2019 use of a software named BleachBit to expunge traces of deleted emails. The security back-and-forth comes as the campaign enters its final two months and reminders of terror poised to return to the surface in advance of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on Sunday. A new CNN/ORC poll found that both candidates have advantages on national security. Those surveyed said they trust Trump more on terrorism (51% to Clinton\u2019s 45%), underscoring his ability to connect with the fears of Americans in an age of ISIS-inspired domestic attacks. But Clinton holds an edge on foreign policy (56% to Trump\u2019s 40%), enabling her to point to a wider range of national security credentials. Overall, the poll showed the two candidates in a statistical dead heat, with Trump leading nationally among likely voters, 45% to Clinton\u2019s 43%. Poll: Nine weeks out, a near even race For Trump and Clinton, Tuesday\u2019s security focus came in two Southern swing states \u2013 Virginia and Florida \u2013 with large populations of veterans and military families. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight Clinton aides, who asked for anonymity while talking about strategy, said the focus on national security is part of a confluence of important dates and forums with Trump. Early voting, which includes mail-in ballots traditionally used by active-duty military, begins in many states this month. In some states, like Florida, active-duty military are asked to send in ballots starting in late September and early October. Another factor is that Trump has given her material to work with, Clinton aides said. They described her as relishing going after Trump on this topic because she feels she knows it well and he doesn\u2019t. It also allows her to target Republican-leaning voters who have been turned off by Trump. \u201cHis whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform,\u201d Clinton said on Tuesday in Tampa, just miles from MacDill Air Force Base, where 15,000 people work. Clinton\u2019s push also comes with another prize in mind: \u201cSecurity moms,\u201d or female voters who are concerned about terrorism \u2013 particularly middle-class suburban women in must-win swing states like Pennsylvania. A late-August Franklin and Marshall poll found Clinton ahead by 15 points in Southeastern Pennsylvania \u2013 largely Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs \u2013 even as the Republican incumbent senator leads his Democratic challenger by 9 points in the same region. That margin would be close to insurmountable for Trump on Election Day. Clinton, press do awkward dance at 30,000 feet \u201cAny viable path for him would require mitigating that damage somewhat,\u201d said Hari Sevugan, a former Obama campaign spokesman who\u2019s now a strategist for the Democratic firm 270 Strategies. Sevugan said timing is also at play, though the focus on national security isn\u2019t driven solely by the approaching September 11 anniversary. \u201cPeople are starting to tune in and focus in a more concentrated way on the election after Labor Day, and it makes sense from the Clinton perspective to really home in on where they have a relative strength,\u201d Sevugan said. \u201cAnd from the Trump perspective, they need to shore this up.\u201d But Bryce Reeves, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Virginia in 2017 and a former Army Ranger, said national security is a concern across all demographic groups \u2013 and one that can give a big boost to Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time\u201d before another terror attack, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of it we get hit, it\u2019s a matter of when we get hit and how we respond to those threats. \u2026 That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a renewed interest by the candidates.\u201d Clinton: Trump \u2018choked\u2019 when meeting with Mexican president He said the release of Trump\u2019s military endorsements earlier Tuesday underscores the qualifications of the people he\u2019d listen to as president. \u201cThe sign of a great leader is to surround yourself with phenomenal people, and if you look at Trump\u2019s record today \u2013 who he put out supporting him \u2013 he\u2019s got numerous flag officers who led troops in the field during some of our most heightened recent conflicts,\u201d Reeves said. National security will be a focus all week. Clinton and Trump will participate in a joint forum Wednesday sponsored by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and broadcast on NBC and MSNBC \u2013 their first joint appearance of the campaign. Clinton is also bolstering her national security push with a new television ad called \u201cSacrifice,\u201d highlighting Trump\u2019s criticism of Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s war-hero status and his fight with the Muslim parents of an American soldier killed in combat. Donald Trump's empire And her super PAC, Priorities USA, is launching a $5 million ad buy in the swing states North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire on Friday with a spot titled \u201cI Love War.\u201d Featuring a mushroom cloud, it touts Trump\u2019s hawkish remarks about war and nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, delivered a security-focused speech Tuesday in Wilmington, North Carolina, accusing Trump of flip-flopping on how the United States should handle the war in Iraq. \u201cHe says whatever he feels like at any given time because you can do that when you\u2019re a TV star. But you can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re president of the United States,\u201d Kaine said. Trump and Clinton themselves also fought Tuesday over remarks Trump had made in an interview that aired on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t think she has a presidential look and you need a presidential look,\u201d Trump said of Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m talking about general, by the way, she says things about me that are horrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs an example the single greatest asset I have, according to those that know me, is my temperament.\u201d Clinton\u2019s camp seized on the comments, using them to highlight Trump\u2019s previous fights with the Gold Star Khan family, his criticism of Fox News host Megyn Kelly and his questioning of President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time Donald Trump has had a problem looking at someone different from himself and actually seeing them,\u201d said Clinton deputy communications director Christina Reynolds. Clinton also continued to fight back criticism of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She shrugged off calls for additional congressional inquiries into her email usage as nothing more than pandering to right-wing conspiracy theorists, suggesting that the FBI \u201cresolved\u201d all the questions into her email use during their investigation. Clinton, speaking with her traveling press corps aboard her new campaign plane on Tuesday, said she has \u201cjust accepted\u201d the fact that Republicans will continue to call for investigations into her, whether they are warranted or not. Clinton added, \u201cI believe I have created so many jobs in the, sort of, conspiracy-theory machine factory. Because, honestly, they never quit. They keep coming back.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump will call for a moratorium on new financial regulations and a repeal of the federal estate tax Trump's economic plan is being rolled out as the campaign shifts focus after a disastrous week Donald Trump sought to get his stumbling campaign back on track Monday, unveiling a tax reform plan aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s policy agenda. Trump\u2019s new proposal would reduce tax rates for most Americans and simplify the tax code, but the new rates Trump proposed mark an increase from those he proposed last year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination and touted his tax reform plan as offering the lowest income tax rates of any of his GOP opponents. Trump\u2019s new proposal would more than halve the number of income tax brackets and bring rates down to 12%, 25% and 33%. Trump proposed drastically reducing federal income tax rates to 10%, 20% and 25% \u2013 a proposal that nonpartisan groups assessed would add trillions of dollars to the national debt. Americans in the top income bracket are currently taxed at 39.6%. Trump also vowed again Monday that the poorest Americans will have a zero tax rate, which he included in his initial proposal. What\u2019s missing from the 2016 race: Inspiration The Republican nominee, who was interrupted by protestors 14 times, unveiled his economic plan \u2013 which included proposals beyond just tax reforms \u2013 a week after he feuded with Ryan. The real estate mogul initially refused to endorse the speaker, who faces a primary Tuesday. But Trump ultimately backed Ryan on Friday after a tumultuous week of intra-party fighting. Speaking at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump laid out proposals to achieve an American \u201ceconomic renewal,\u201d including a moratorium on government regulations, a proposal to make childcare expenses fully tax deductible, and other proposals his campaign argued will benefit the middle class. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone and, especially, and I say especially, for those who have the very least,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s speech, in which he offered detailed policy proposals rarely heard in his typical stump speech, came as the Republican faces steeply declining poll numbers following two bad weeks on the campaign trail during which he repeatedly stoked controversies that distracted from his core campaign message. But Trump, reading from teleprompters, was laser-focused on promoting his economic agenda and contrasting his plans with Hillary Clinton\u2019s. The Democratic nominee is also set to lay out her own economic proposals in Detroit in a major address on Thursday. Trump pointed to Detroit, a city lately besieged by economic turmoil and run for decades by successive Democratic mayors, as the \u201cliving, breathing example of my opponent\u2019s failed economic agenda.\u201d Trump called the city\u2019s economic collapse an example of politicians abandoning \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies in favor of a globalist agenda. \u201cIf you are a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn\u2019t do better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic agenda,\u201d Trump said. But Trump went beyond bomb-throwing, laying out in detail a number of proposals he would seek to enact as president that would reduce the regulatory influence of the federal government, particularly on fossil fuel industries. He also again vowed to lower the business tax rate for corporations and small businesses alike to 15% \u2013 down from the current top rate of 39%. \u201cWe will make America grow again,\u201d Trump said. On Tuesday, Trump said on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that he would also consider a payroll tax holiday to help the middle class. In response to a viewer question, Trump said he\u2019s thinking about the concept. Trump also said he would look to restart the Keystone XL pipeline project, and withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was enacted by President Bill Clinton. Ryan\u2019s campaign spokesman Zack Roday praised Trump\u2019s proposal, saying it \u201chas many similarities to the job-creating plan at the heart of House Republican\u2019s Better Way agenda.\u201d \u201cA Better Way,\u201d is a plan Ryan introduced in June as speaker that lists changes to six policy areas, including tax reform. Hillary Clinton offered a direct rebuttal to Trump\u2019s remarks during a rally in St. Petersburg, Florida, later in the day. \u201cHe wants to basically just re-package trickle down economics. Now, you know that old saying, \u2018Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?\u2019 \u201d Clinton said. \u201cTrickle down economics does not help our economy grow. It does not help the vast majority of Americans.\u201d Stressing the importance of the fall election, Clinton urged the crowd: \u201cDon\u2019t let a friend vote Trump.\u201d At a family-owned beer brewery earlier in the day, Clinton accused Trump for engaging in the business practice of refusing to pay workers for their services. Clinton said she has met countless people who were \u201cstiffed\u201d by Trump and told: \u201cJust sue us,\u201d and drew on her personal experience of having watched her own father run a small print plan as a child. \u201cHe worked really hard and made a good living for my mother, my brothers and me,\u201d Clinton said about her father at 3 Daughters Brewing, surrounded by thousands of stacked beer cans and large silver brew houses. \u201cThat\u2019s why I just can\u2019t imagine \u2013 he\u2019d worked so hard \u2013 if he had delivered the finished goods to the people who had ordered them, that they would say we\u2019re not going to pay you. And that\u2019s what Trump has done time and time again.\u201d Clinton has been pulling away from Trump in recent polling, following his disastrous battle with the Gold Star parents of slain Iraq War veteran Capt. Humayun Khan. The latest CNN Poll of Polls shows Clinton beating Trump 49%-39% nationwide. But a CNN poll in June and a more recent Fox News survey found that voters trust Trump more than Clinton on the economy. Clinton running mate Tim Kaine tweeted Monday, \u201cDonald Trump is only in it for himself \u2013 just look at his economic plan.\u201d Donald Trump is only in it for himself\u2014just look at his economic plan.https://t.co/VHlTQKrV0b CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, MJ Lee, Dan Merica, and Naomi Lim contributed to this report.",

Clinton has been well supported during the convention by a series of speakers who have sparked international reactions. Newspaper editorials praised the speech by First Lady Michelle Obama, which was shared thousands of times online, saying it had been a powerful endorsement for Clinton. Fallen Muslim soldier's dad to Trump: Read Constitution \u201cMichelle Obama stole the show at the Democratic national convention last night, drawing a powerful parallel between her role as the first black first lady, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid to become the first female president,\u201d British paper The Times wrote on Tuesday. \u201cHere, at last, the profound, moving and devastating riposte to Donald Trump that many in America, and the world, had been waiting for,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s David Smith wrote.

            "article_content": "President Obama gave a strong endorsement of Hillary Clinton and denounced Donald Trump Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg also used speeches to take down Trump The Democratic A-list on Wednesday cast Donald Trump as a threat to the American dream \u2013 and Hillary Clinton as the nation\u2019s only chance to save it. President Barack Obama called Trump a \u201chomegrown demagogue.\u201d Michael Bloomberg dismissed him as a \u201ccon.\u201d And Vice President Joe Biden, in rejecting Trump, declared that \u201cAmericans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down.\u201d How Obama made some anti-Trump Republicans jealous They set the frame for the Democratic National Convention\u2019s most important moment: Clinton\u2019s speech Thursday night. Here are six takeaways from the third night in Philadelphia: Obama cast the 2016 election as a choice between two visions for the country: The one he described on the Democratic convention stage when he rocketed to stardom 12 years ago in Boston against a dark and dystopian view from Trump that Obama said doesn\u2019t match \u201cthe America I know.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a choice between parties or policies; the usual debates between left and right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a more fundamental choice \u2013 about who we are as a people, and whether we stay true to this great American experiment in self-government.\u201d In a direct shot at Trump, Obama said: \u201cOur power doesn\u2019t come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way.\u201d If Democrats wanted to frame the election as their optimism against Trump\u2019s darkness, the Republican nominee was eager to help. As Obama spoke, Trump\u2019s campaign emailed reporters a statement with the subject line: \u201cOWNING THE 3RD TERM: VIOLENT CRIME RISING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.\u201d Obama sought to lend Clinton every ounce of credibility he has, telling delegates that no man or woman has ever been better-qualified for the presidency than his former secretary of state. \u201cNot me, not Bill, not nobody,\u201d he said. Bill Clinton stood and applauded \u2013 two Democratic icons at once saying: This is Hillary Clinton\u2019s party now. From a video introduction that focused on the work left to do to achieve Obama\u2019s vision, the President made clear that Clinton is the only person capable of solidifying his legacy. \u201cI have confidence, as I leave this stage tonight, that the Democratic Party is in good hands,\u201d Obama said as he closed. Even Obama\u2019s final line was designed to underscore his vision of Clinton as his heir. \u201cThank you for this incredible journey,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it going.\u201d Obama got as close to a literal hand-off as possible, with Clinton joining him on-stage as soon as he finished his speech. The two held hands and waved, and then both Clintons and Obama met privately off-stage. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Want to know what Vice President Joe Biden would have brought to the 2016 presidential campaign, had he decided to run? Rewind his 12-minute speech Wednesday night. His 12-minute speech was half anti-Trump  and half pep rally for the middle class. \u201cHe is trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That\u2019s a bunch of malarkey,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t have a clue about the Middle Class. Not a clue.\u201d In what might\u2019ve been Biden\u2019s swan song, Biden \u2013 or \u201cmiddle-class Joe,\u201d he called himself \u2013 made an argument that could penetrate Trump\u2019s base of supporters in a way Clinton and Obama can\u2019t. \u201cBiden just did what Obama and Clinton don\u2019t do effectively\u2026he evangelized American Exceptionalism,\u201d tweeted Rob Stutzman, a California Republican strategist. His job was never going to be easy: Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was up after Biden had brought down the house and while the crowd was eagerly anticipating Obama. Tim Kaine\u2019s convention speech: 5 moments that made a splash on Twitter Kaine wasn\u2019t chosen by Clinton to light up a room. On social media, Kaine was compared to a dad: Slightly embarrassing, yet relentlessly nice, even when he was trying to be mean. He even did an impersonation, mocking Trump with the billionaire\u2019s reprise \u201cbelieve me.\u201d \u201cBy the way, does anybody in this massive auditorium believe that Donald Trump\u2019s been paying his fair share of taxes?\u201d Kaine asked. And the crowd roared \u201cNo!\u201d He built toward a strong close, name-checking a list of icons of the progressive movement. And his biggest applause lines came in Spanish \u2013 a reminder of his fluency in the language, which could help the Democratic ticket reach Latino voters who Trump might have alienated. Democrats have largely been able to snuff out any real damage from the Bernie-or-bust crowd \u2013 but their chants over former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta blew a moment the party had planned all day. Panetta was the designated hitter on the controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that Russia release Clinton\u2019s emails. And he dropped a couple sharp lines as he made the broader case that Trump is unfit to lead the nation\u2019s military. Bernie Sanders protests interrupt California delegation breakfast \u201cAs someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyber-attacks, it is inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible. I say this out of a firm concern for the future of my children and my grandchildren: Donald Trump cannot become commander-in-chief,\u201d Panetta said. Yet the Bernie-or-busters stepped all over the moment by chanting \u201cNo more wars!\u201d over him. It was bad enough that Democrats had to dim the lights over the rebelling delegations to try to get back on-message. Afterward, television anchors focused on the protests \u2013 not Panetta\u2019s anti-Trump message. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent curiosity of the Acela corridor \u2013 delivered a billionaire-on-billionaire assault on Trump\u2019s business record. He quipped that unlike Trump, he didn\u2019t start his business empire with a \u201cmillion-dollar check from my father.\u201d Bloomberg: Richest thing about Trump is his hypocrisy Bloomberg, who mused about an independent run for president himself, endorsed Clinton \u2013 but, as one of the few political figures with the business experience to match Trump\u2019s, he was most effective undermining the core selling point of Trump\u2019s candidacy: His competency, compared to the political establishment\u2019s ineptitude. \u201cTrump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker,\u201d he said. \u201cI know a con when I see one.\u201d",

Not a Clue!\u201d Biden\u2019s speech is likely to be the final major political address of his career, and he used it to also give a strong endorsement of Hillary Clinton. \u201cEverybody knows she is smart. Everybody knows she is tough. But I know what she is passionate about,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI know Hillary. Hillary understands. Hillary gets it.\u201d Entering the hall to the theme from \u201cRocky\u201d and a prolonged standing ovation, he hailed President Barack Obama as \u201cthe embodiment of honor, resolve and character, one of the finest presidents we have ever had.\u201d Flatly rejecting Trump\u2019s views both on foreign policy and the economy, Biden scorched the GOP candidate as the most unprepared nominee ever, and suggested he could put nothing less than the international order at risk. \u201cThe times are too uncertain to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNo major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security.\u201d The remarks came hours after Trump raised alarms in foreign policy circles for his overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe cannot elect a man who belittles our closest allies while embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin,\u201d Biden insisted. \u201cA man who confuses bluster with strength, we simply cannot let that happen as Americans. Period.\u201d Like Obama, Biden is predicted to have a regular campaign presence leading up to November\u2019s vote. \u201cI\u2019m going to be living in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan\u201d leading up to the election, he said on MSNBC Wednesday \u2013 all states where his blue collar appeal would resonate. That tour is set to begin August 15, when Biden campaigns alongside Clinton in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Biden acknowledged his final convention address as an elected official was a bittersweet moment, coming only a year after the loss of his eldest son, Beau. Noting his son had placed his name into nomination during the 2008 and 2012 conventions, Biden said he had gathered strength from his family and supporters, including the President and first lady. \u201cI\u2019ve been made strong at the broken places,\u201d he said, quoting Ernest Hemingway. Biden said he\u2019d joked with Obama they were all speaking in the shadow of First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s remarks on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you are, kid, but you are incredible,\u201d Biden told Mrs. Obama, who was watching Wednesday\u2019s convention proceedings from her mother\u2019s house in Chicago.",

            "article_content": "The TPP has been a sore spot between Obama, Clinton, Sanders and Trump this year Obama will speak Wednesday night, he is the top advocate for the deal Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t even said anything about the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently \u2013 and yet, in 24 hours, she became embroiled in a new controversy about her stance on the deal. A top ally\u2019s prediction that Clinton would flip-flop after the election and support the trade pact \u2013 after escaping the political threat from Bernie Sanders. Making things more uncomfortable: President Barack Obama\u2019s appearance Wednesday night to make the case for Clinton. His administration negotiated the deal; she says she opposes it. So does her opponent, Donald Trump, who seized on the Democrats\u2019 mixed messaging Tuesday to slam Clinton. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the deal \u2013 and why it\u2019s a focal point in Philadelphia: It\u2019s a 12-nation free trade agreement negotiated by the Obama administration. It\u2019s designed to wipe out tariffs with countries like Japan, Australia and Malaysia and expand on the existing U.S. trade deal \u2013 the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 with Canada and Mexico. Obama argues the deal\u2019s provisions covering labor rights and environmental protections make it the best trade pact liberals have ever seen. Also backing the deal: traditional Republican allies in the business lobby, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. But it\u2019s vehemently opposed by traditional Democratic allies like labor unions, which see it as a threat to manufacturing jobs that weren\u2019t already siphoned away by automation, previous trade deals and an increasingly global economy. And Trump has hammered it as a poorly negotiated giveaway of U.S. power. She opposes the deal. But while serving as Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Clinton praised TPP as a deal that \u201csets the gold standard in trade agreements.\u201d Then, last fall, once the 12 participating nations announced they had finalized the text after years of negotiations, Clinton said she opposes it \u2013 citing its lack of a crackdown on currency manipulation and provisions to extend pharmaceutical drug companies\u2019 patent protections in poorer countries. \u201cI did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard,\u201d Clinton said at an October debate with Sanders. \u201cIt was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn\u2019t meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, \u2018This will help raise your wages.\u2019 And I concluded I could not.\u201d Clinton\u2019s history is mixed on free trade. She spoke in favor of NAFTA when her husband signed it into law, but called it a \u201cmistake\u201d during her 2008 presidential campaign. She voted both for and against trade deals during her eight years in the Senate. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2013 a long-time very close friend of the Clintons \u2013 told Politico Tuesday in an interview that Clinton would support the trade deal after the election. \u201cI worry that if we don\u2019t do TPP, at some point China\u2019s going to break the rules \u2013 but Hillary understands this,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the election\u2019s over, and we sit down on trade, people understand a couple things we want to fix on it but going forward we got to build a global economy.\u201d Pressed on whether Clinton would reverse her position, McAuliffe told Politico: \u201cYes. Listen, she was in support of it. There were specific things in it she wanted fixed.\u201d In just moments, McAuliffe had given Americans reason to doubt Clinton\u2019s sincerity on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and suspect she\u2019s willing to do anything that\u2019s politically expedient. That\u2019s a problem for Clinton: Two-thirds of Americans already view her as untrustworthy. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta quickly sought to undo the potential damage of McAuliffe\u2019s remark, saying on Twitter: \u201cLove Gov. McAuliffe, but he got this one flat wrong. Hillary opposes TPP BEFORE and AFTER the election. Period. Full stop.\u201d Love Gov. McAuliffe, but he got this one flat wrong. Hillary opposes TPP BEFORE and AFTER the election. Period. Full stop. He\u2019s essentially saying, I told you so \u2013 and this is another reason you can\u2019t trust Clinton. Trump\u2019s opposition to free trade deals \u2013 particularly NAFTA and the TPP \u2013 are animating causes of his candidacy. He\u2019s railed against them at every campaign rally since he kicked off his campaign 13 months ago. On Twitter, Trump \u2013 who is targeting manufacturing-heavy states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan as his path to the presidency \u2013 immediately attacked Clinton. \u201cJust like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP,\u201d Trump tweeted. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y Yes \u2013 particularly Wednesday night at the DNC, when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will speak. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is perhaps the single biggest difference Obama and Clinton have at this stage. And, like Clinton, her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine \u2013 who\u2019s also slated to speak Wednesday night \u2013 has supported the TPP in the past, only to say he\u2019ll oppose it now.",

            "article_content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is on the campaign trail with Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton Monday's joint appearance could fuel speculation about Clinton's deliberations over a vice presidential pick Elizabeth Warren unleashed a blistering attack against Donald Trump Monday in her debut on the 2016 campaign trail, delivering a fiery speech that resembled a live audition for the role of Hillary Clinton\u2019s top surrogate \u2013 or vice president. Slamming Trump as a \u201ca small, insecure money grubber\u201d who would \u201ccrush you into the dirt,\u201d Warren sought to highlight sharp contrasts between the two parties\u2019 presumptive presidential nominees. \u201cNow, Donald Trump says he\u2019ll make America great again \u2026 It\u2019s stamped on the front of his goofy hats,\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou want to see goofy? Look at him in that hat.\u201d Warren\u2019s speech offered a clear preview of the high-profile role the senator is expected to play in the general election as Trump\u2019s chief public antagonist. Striking the same populist tone that\u2019s core to her political fame, Warren said Trump is only in it for himself \u2013 and willing to hurt middle class Americans for his own personal gain. \u201cWhen Donald Trump says \u2018great,\u2019 I ask: \u2018great for who, exactly?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Donald says he\u2019ll make America great, he means greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump. That\u2019s who Donald Trump is. \u2026 And you have to watch out for him, because he\u2019ll crush you into the dirt.\u201d Warren warned: \u201cYou have to watch out for him, because he\u2019ll crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants.\u201d Warren and Clinton\u2019s joint appearance on Monday was visually striking. The two women, who are only one year apart in age, stepped onto the stage wearing suits of similar shades giving the event a coordinated feel: Warren\u2019s outfit a bright royal blue and Clinton\u2019s a deep purple. The image of the duo standing next to one another will further fuel speculation about Clinton\u2019s deliberations over a vice presidential pick. Sources say Warren is among the handful of Democrats that the Clinton campaign is scrutinizing as it prepares to choose a running mate ahead of the Democratic convention next month. Clinton, for her part, did little to tamp down the rumors. She offered Warren effusive praise and openly acknowledged her surrogate\u2019s unique capacity to take on Trump. \u201cYou just saw why she is so terrific, so formidable. Because she tells it like it is,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI have to say, I do just love how she gets under Donald Trump\u2019s skin.\u201d Clinton closing in on running mate search The two Democrats have not always shared a warm relationship. But on Monday, Clinton suggested on stage that they shared some personal bonds. \u201cElizabeth and I came of age around the same time,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd when we were growing up, as you heard her talking about her parents, her brothers, we believed in the American dream.\u201d The former secretary of state continued to drive home the narrative that Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president. \u201cImagine Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office the next time America faces a crisis,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cImagine him being in charge when your jobs and savings are at stake. Imagine him trying to figure out what to do in case of an emergency.\u201d Trump preempted the event with a dig at both Warren and Clinton. \u201cCrooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage,\u201d Trump tweeted. He avoided his previously used nickname for Warren, \u201cPocahontas,\u201d when referencing a 2012 controversy over how she characterized her Native-American heritage. Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage. In the afternoon, Trump released a statement calling Warren a \u201csellout,\u201d pointing to the campaign contributions Clinton has received from Wall Street. \u201cWhile Warren claims that Wall Street businesses have too much influence in D.C.,\u201d the statement read, \u201cthe Clinton campaign has accepted over $41 million this cycle from Wall Street interests.\u201d Warren\u2019s decision make a formal endorsement and be an active surrogate is a significant political win for Clinton. Clinton\u2019s hard-fought battle against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary spotlighted her struggle to win over liberal factions of her party and Warren\u2019s formal backing earlier this month signaled an important stamp of approval. Elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren is one of Congress\u2019 most outspoken critics of Wall Street and advocate of stringent financial regulations. The former law professor rose quickly to national stardom and holds powerful sway among progressive activists. Warren\u2019s massive liberal fan base crafted a national campaign to recruit the populist senator to run for the White House \u2013 a request that she repeatedly declined. Now, the liberal firebrand is poised to seize the national platform and emerge one of Trump\u2019s most potent adversaries. \u201cI am here today because I\u2019m with her,\u201d Warren said on Monday. \u201cHillary Clinton will be the next president because she knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate.\u201d Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Delayed from hitting the presidential campaign trail, President Barack Obama previewed his 2016 stump speech Friday for an incumbent governor instead, using a fundraiser here to hit Republicans for dividing the country and lambasting \u201ccharlatans\u201d who seek personal gain from exploiting fears. Declaring GOP rhetoric a detriment to progress, Obama even borrowed Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cstronger together\u201d to argue for unity in the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for charlatans and we don\u2019t have time for bigotry and we didn\u2019t have time for film-flam and we don\u2019t have the luxury of just popping off and saying whatever comes to the tops of our heads,\u201d Obama said during the Friday evening event, held for 3,000 supporters of Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat. Obama had likely hoped to use his barbed language about Donald Trump \u2014 who he avoids naming, but whose policies and style Obama has plainly slammed \u2014 during a campaign stop for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. The pair were scheduled to campaign together in Wisconsin a week and a half ago, the debut of what Democrats hope will be a power-team against Trump ahead of the November election. But the mass shooting in Orlando delayed the event, and no replacement date has yet been named. Obama instead used Friday\u2019s event to test-drive barbs against Republicans, including suggesting the party is exploiting the economic fears of white, middle-class Americans for political gain. \u201cUnfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and get themselves votes. And that\u2019s what the Republicans have been doing for a while now,\u201d Obama said. He worked to characterize the entire party as in lock-step with Trump, even as the party\u2019s embrace of their presumptive nominee remains somewhat loose. \u201cIt\u2019s the story they\u2019ve been telling, not just the guy at the top of the ticket, but up and down the ticket,\u201d Obama said. In his remarks, Obama didn\u2019t reference Friday\u2019s results from the British referendum on exiting the European Union. But he did push back on the type of politics that many view as fueling the \u201cleave\u201d campaign, suggesting that divisions and isolation would pull the country backward. \u201cBetween dividing ourselves up, looking for scapegoats, ignoring the evidence, or not realizing that we are all stronger together \u2014 if we turn against each other, whether it\u2019s divisions of race or religion, we\u2019re not going to build on the progress we\u2019ve started,\u201d Obama said. He continued: \u201cIf we get cynical and just vote our fears, or just don\u2019t vote at all, we\u2019re not going to build on the progress we\u2019ve started.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A super PAC tied to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid will spend $10 million to win the Florida seat held by Marco Rubio A major Democratic super PAC is reserving more than $10 million to spend in Florida this fall in what is expected to be an expensive and hard-fought race to replace exiting Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The seat is one of at least five controlled by Republicans that Democrats want to win in November to take outright control of the chamber \u2013 something essential to advance the agenda of a President Hillary Clinton or thwart the policies and nominees of a President Donald Trump. The Senate Majority PAC, a political action committee associated with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, has reserved $10.5 million in television ad time beginning in September and running through Election Day, the group said. The hefty figure is an indication Democrats are serious about winning the seat, which is in one of the most costly media markets in the country. Last month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also reserved $10 million for the race. There are currently four Republicans and two Democrats running for the seat with a primary set for August 30 that will narrow the field. On the Republican side, Rep. David Jolly, who is considered centrist, is squaring off against tea party-backed Rep. Ron DeSantis, Florida t. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who Rubio supports, and businessman Carlos Beruff. \u201cRepublicans are going to nominate a far right, tea party candidate who is out of touch with Florida\u2019s middle-class.  We\u2019re going to be ready to hold their eventual nominee accountable,\u201d said Shripal Shah, a spokesman for the super PAC. On the Democratic side, Rep. Patrick Murphy, an establishment favorite, is squaring off against Rep. Alan Grayson, a populist liberal who has a fraught relationship with Reid. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found the race too close to call although Murphy held a slight advantage over the Republicans in the field. In an unusual move for a party leader, Reid endorsed Murphy earlier this year and called for Grayson, to get out of the race.  Grayson, who is in his second term, has been dogged by ethics charges related to a hedge fund he ran while in Congress, which Reid cited when he called on him to go. Grayson and Reid squared off at a recent closed-door meeting of congressional Democrats where Grayson challenged Reid to provide evidence of his alleged wrongdoing.  Reid told Grayson, \u201cI want you to lose.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what Reid\u2019s super PAC will do if Grayson wins the primary. The news of the Democratic infusion of cash comes as the Miami Herald reported Monday that Murphy embellished his academic achievements, saying he earned a single degree despite repeatedly claiming he earned dual degrees. The campaign told the newspaper the mistake was an \u201cinadvertent error.\u201d The Senate Majority PAC has already reserved $7.5 million in New Hampshire and $9.5 million in Ohio as it tries to unseat vulnerable Republicans Kelly Ayotte and Rob Portman respectively.  It has also reserved $8.5 million for ads in Nevada in an effort to hold onto the seat of Reid, who is retiring. Republicans, who have a 54 to 46 advantage in the Senate, are defending 24 seats in November while Democrats are protecting just 10.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders' backers are unhappy with how they were treated at the Nevada state convention this weekend Some Democrats are now worried about violence at the national convention in Philadelphia Sanders' campaign accuses DNC chairwoman of \"throwing shade\" It was really just a matter of time. With the Democratic presidential primary in its twilight, frustration within the ranks over the party\u2019s handling of the primary process spilled out this week as Bernie Sanders supporters lashed out at party leaders, arguing that their candidate has been treated unfairly. The public outpouring of anger began last weekend at the Nevada Democratic Party convention, where Sanders supporters who said Hillary Clinton\u2019s backers had subverted party rules shouted down pro-Clinton speakers and sent threatening messages to state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange after posting her phone number and address on social media. Nevada Democratic chair speaks about threats she has received since the state convention https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/2mCdGnTAUJ That led Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and other top party leaders to demand an apology and publicly ruminate on the possibility of violence at the Democratic National Convention in July as they prepare for a general election battle with Donald Trump. Obama administration officials on Wednesday played down concerns about escalating tensions, likening the race to the 2008 primary fight between Clinton and then-Sen. Barack Obama. But Sanders isn\u2019t backing down. A campaign spokesman said Wednesday that the campaign was \u201clooking into\u201d whether to ask for a recount in Kentucky, where Sanders narrowly lost on Tuesday night, and he fired up his crowd in Southern California Tuesday night by calling out the Democratic establishment. Dems\u2019 new fear: Sanders revolt could upend Democratic convention The Sanders campaign on Tuesday did condemn unruly behavior from supporters and those who made threats to party leaders, but made clear it is sticking with its stance that the party is subverting the process in a way that benefits Clinton. \u201cThese claims that our campaign is sort of fomenting violence in some way are absolute nonsense,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night, adding that the campaign \u201cabsolutely, categorically\u201d condemns any threatening behavior. The breakdown in civility comes after what has otherwise been a comparatively polite campaign season for Democrats, but the frustration exposes a rift in the party and undercuts the notion that Clinton will be able to march into the Democratic convention this summer with a party unified behind her. Throughout the year, Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton, including debates held on Saturday nights, closed primaries in major states such as New York, and the use of superdelegates \u2013 essentially free-agent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing Clinton. Changing superdelegate rules would still leave Sanders behind \u201cThe problem is that there are long-simmering concerns about unfair treatment out in the Nevada Democratic Party,\u201d Weaver added. \u201cWe are not going to allow the millions of people who supported Bernie Sanders to be sort of rolled over in places like Nevada by the way they handled that convention.\u201d Sanders campaign manager on Nevada convention Earlier on Tuesday, Sanders released a statement suggesting that his supporters were justified in feeling like the party has given them a raw deal. \u201cIf the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,\u201d Sanders\u2019 statement read. \u201cUnfortunately, that was not the case at the Nevada convention. At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.\u201d In an interview with CNN, Wasserman Schultz said that statement wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cI was deeply disturbed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe senator\u2019s response was anything but acceptable. It certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel the fire.\u201d The DNC chairwoman, however, said she has not spoken directly with Sanders, but that her staff has been in touch with the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign. She also pushed back against Sanders\u2019 accusation that the party had rigged the system against him. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama. These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were followed and even if the Sanders supporters were frustrated, there is never, under any circumstances, a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to in response.\u201d The Kentucky primary on CNN in 60 seconds On CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Wednesday morning, Weaver accused the DNC chairwoman of \u201cthrowing shade.\u201d \u201cWe can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how she\u2019s been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI gotta say it\u2019s not the DNC,\u201d he added. \u201cBy and large the DNC has been very good to us, but not Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\u201d Wasserman Schultz brushed off Weaver\u2019s comments later in the day. \u201cMy response to that is hashtag SMH (shake my head),\u201d Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer on \u201cWolf.\u201d \u201cWe need to focus on one thing: get through this primary and work to prepare for the general election and make sure that we can continue to draw the contrasts between either one of our really fine candidates who are focused on helping people reach the middle class and make sure that we get equal pay for equal work and create jobs and not let the Republicans take health care away from 20 million Americans.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon, Vice President Joe Biden said if such disruption happens again, \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about it.\u201d \u201cBut here we are in May, as was pointed out,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cHillary was still in this in May, in June. I\u2019m confident that Bernie will be supportive if Hillary wins, which the numbers indicate will happen. So I\u2019m not worried. There\u2019s no fundamental split in the Democratic Party.\u201d Leading congressional Democrats also pushed Sanders to rein in his supporters. Reid called Sanders\u2019 response \u201ca test of leadership\u201d for Sanders, and a source in his office told CNN that the Nevada senator is waiting to hear from the senator himself on the matter. \u201cThe convention was Saturday. It\u2019s now Wednesday afternoon. And he hasn\u2019t spoken about it,\u201d the source said. California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who spoke on behalf of Clinton at the Nevada convention, condemned the behavior. \u201cHe should get things under control,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a race that is very critical. We have to be united.\u201d \u201cThis is a character moment for Bernie Sanders. He\u2019s got to figure out how he\u2019s true to his values and his ideals fully,\u201d said CNN political commentator Van Jones. \u201cI think Hillary and Bernie both misunderstand this movement. I think Hillary just sees it as just a bunch of rowdy kids that at some point will just calm down and fall into line,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cI think Bernie actually only sees the good in his followers. I think Bernie really misunderstands there is a nasty edge to his following that he\u2019s not taking seriously enough.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine criticized Sanders\u2019 responses in the wake of reports that Democrats felt threatened at and following the convention. \u201cWhat he did yesterday was sort of say it\u2019s the party\u2019s fault,\u201d Kaine told CNN. \u201cThat deflection of responsibility is not leadership.\u201d Kaine added that the angry protests could be \u201cdirty tricksters in the crowd\u201d and not just Sanders\u2019 supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should assume that all of the people raising hell are Bernie people,\u201d Kaine said. Speaking in Southern California Tuesday night, Sanders fired up the crowd by calling out the Democratic leadership. \u201cThe Democratic Party is going to have to make a very, very, profound and important decision. It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change. That is the Democratic Party I want to see.\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI say to the leadership of the Democratic Party: Open the doors, let the people in! Or the other option for the Democratic Party, which I see as a very sad and tragic option is to choose and maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy,\u201d he said. The crowd responded by chanting, \u201cBernie or Bust!\u201d the equivalent of the Republican #NeverTrump slogan for the Democratic race. His speech barreled through his list of Clinton contrasts, comparing his stances with her (and criticizing those stances) on minimum wage, fracking, breaking up the big banks, and her use of super PACs. In response to the chaos in Nevada, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook simultaneously praised the passion and participation of Sanders\u2019 supporters while adding that Clinton believes that \u201cno one should be intimidated, harassed or threatened in this process.\u201d He called on them to focus that energy on unifying the party, a task that could be difficult given the raw feelings many Sanders supporters have for Clinton after the primary. \u201cSupporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into their campaigns,\u201d Mook said. Ultimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose \u2013 to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump\u2019s hands.\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday downplayed any tensions between the two campaigns. He recalled a similar \u201ctenor\u201d to the 2008 contest between Clinton and Obama, saying those tensions were \u201cno less intense\u201d and didn\u2019t lead to a negative result in the general election. \u201cI think one of the lessons of 2008 is not to confuse passion in primary for disinterest in the general election,\u201d he said, adding that \u201chighly motivated\u201d supporters were good for democracy. Could Sanders revolt upend Democratic convention? While the spotlight this year was on the Republican primary and prospect for a contested convention and protests at the national convention in Cleveland, some Democrats now worry about that happening at their convention in Philadelphia. Wasserman Schultz said the incidents in Nevada would result in the DNC reviewing its procedures for Philadelphia. \u201cAs a result of this happening this weekend, we will have conversations both at the staff level as well as my having conversations with the candidates so that we can make sure that both campaigns are focused on making sure that we can allow this process for the duration of the primary to play out in a civil and orderly way,\u201d she said. But the DNC chairwoman said she wasn\u2019t worried about violence happening at the convention. \u201cThis was absolutely a serious concern, which is why I said what needed to be said yesterday and others have said that there was real concern,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer Wednesday afternoon. \u201cBut it is important and I am confident that the candidates take the messages to heart about making sure that we respond and conduct ourselves in a civil and orderly way.\u201d California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, however, warned that Sanders\u2019 intention to take his candidacy to the Democratic convention could spark unrest similar to the chaotic 1968 convention in Chicago and the riots surrounding it. \u201cIt worries me a great deal,\u201d Feinstein told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want to go back to the \u201968 convention, because I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole \u2013 and he should, too.\u201d And Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said he\u2019s concerned about violence in Philadelphia. \u201cWe saw what happened at the Trump rallies, which broke into violence, people punching one another. I don\u2019t want to see that happen at the Democratic Party,\u201d Durbin told CNN. \u201cI call on Bernie to say to his supporters: be fervent, be committed but be sensible. Don\u2019t engage in any violence.\u201d Weaver pledged Tuesday night that the convention will be peaceful. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any violence in Philadelphia, Wolf, I guarantee you that,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cWe hope for a fair and orderly convention.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Elizabeth Landers, Eugene Scott, Gregory Wallace and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

Top Democratic party officials, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, said they were harassed by the Sanders\u2019 supporters at the gathering. Nevada Democratic party chairwoman Roberta Lange\u2019s phone number was posted on social media, leading to over a thousand angry phone calls, text messages, and death threats. The Sanders campaign released a statement Monday condemning any violence and threats, but Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer Tuesday night that the campaign\u2019s response was \u201canything but acceptable.\u201d \u201cIt is never OK for violence and intimidation to be the response to that frustration,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens with the Trump campaign.

High on the list? The likely use of extensive tax avoidance strategies. None other than Trump University \u2013 the now-defunct education company named after the tycoon \u2013 heartily touts a book explicitly designed to help people do just that: avoid taxes. The book, \u201cAsset Protection 101: Tax and Legal Strategies of the Rich,\u201d lays out in extensive detail strategies to keep the U.S. government away from the readers\u2019 assets. It minces no words on its intent, at one point telling readers \u201cthe topic of asset protection is amazing, cunning, baffling, powerful and tricky.\u201d READ: Trump University fraud case becomes campaign issue at GOP debate Trump wrote the foreward to the book, which was authored by attorney J.J. Childers and published in 2007 under the Trump University banner \u2013 part of a series of books promoted as \u201cpractical, straightforward primers on the basics of doing business the Trump way \u2013 successfully.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re not satisfied with the status quo in your career, read this book, pick one key idea and implement it. I guarantee it will make you money,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee wrote in his foreword. RELATED: How to avoid paying taxes: Top 10 list of Trump University-approved strategies Trump touts the book \u2013 and the others in the Trump University series \u2013 as a recipe to riches, calling the contents \u201cthe most important and powerful ideas in business \u2013 the same concepts taught in the most respected MBA curricula and used by the most successful companies in the world, including The Trump Organization.\u201d \u201cI created Trump University to give motivated businesspeople the skills required to achieve lasting success,\u201d Trump wrote. Asked about the book and Trump\u2019s personal strategies on tax avoidance, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Hope Hicks pointed to Trump\u2019s tax plan, which is posted on the campaign\u2019s website. As to Trump\u2019s returns themselves, Hicks reiterated that Trump \u201cis undergoing a routine audit and plans to release the returns when the audit is complete.\u201d Up to this point in the presidential campaign, Trump has declined to release his tax returns on account of an ongoing IRS audit \u2013 one that spans from 2009 onward, according to Trump\u2019s attorneys. He has said he will release his returns upon completion of the audit, though he recently told ABC his tax rate \u201cis none of your business.\u201d Signing my tax return.... pic.twitter.com/XJfXeaORbU Trump has repeatedly said he would be willing to pay more in taxes and a central component to his tax proposal is simplifying the jumbled, unruly and loophole-filled tax code. When it comes to tax policy, Trump has said, his focus is tax relief for the middle class. Yet Trump has also made clear that as it currently stands, the real estate mogul seeks to find as many ways to legally avoid paying more taxes as possible. READ: Trump on his tax rate: \u2018None of your business\u2019 \u201cI mean, I pay as little as possible. I use every single thing in the book,\u201d Trump told supporters in Iowa in January \u2013 a reference to loopholes that exist in tax code in general, not the Trump University book specifically. \u201cAnd I have great people.\u201d He\u2019s also made clear those strategies often play a role in the deals he pursues. \u201cIt\u2019s a factor,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cSometimes, depending on what it is, it becomes an important factor. But taxes are always a factor for me and for everybody else.\u201d The book itself is an in-the-weeds breakdown of strategies to shield income and property from the Internal Revenue Service. With sections including \u201cTax Secrets of the Wealthy,\u201d \u201cLawsuit Protection Secrets of the Wealthy\u201d and \u201cEstate and Retirement Planning Secrets of the Wealth,\u201d it\u2019s composed of the ins-and-outs of how, in its words, readers can set themselves up to \u201cpay as little tax as legally possible.\u201d In short, it\u2019s a certified public accountant\u2019s dream manual. Of particular relevance to Trump is the chapter titled \u201cThe Greatest Tax Shelter in the World: Owning Your Own Business.\u201d READ: How Trump clarified his position on taxing the wealthy It includes a section on breaks known as like-kind exchanges, or the use of \u201c1031,\u201d as it\u2019s often called, for the section of the tax code where it resides. Use of such strategies is so valuable, it\u2019s a shock they\u2019re legal, according to one passage in the book: \u201cWould you be interested in avoiding paying the tax on the sale of your property completely while maintaining or even increasing your overall net worth? Of course, any wise investor would. Amazingly, this can indeed happen and even better, it is totally legal.\u201d The break allows real estate owners to sell a piece of property and avoid taxes on any capital gains by buying a new one shortly thereafter. Continued use of the break, which basically comes down to swapping properties, would result in deferred capital gains that, if deployed strategically \u2013 and repeatedly \u2013 by an active real estate investor, could completely avoid taxation. As it currently stands, it\u2019s unknown how much \u2013 or whether \u2013 Trump has utilized like-kind exchanges. Much of his wealth in recent years, Trump has said, has been derived from licensing the rights to his name, not from specific real estate transactions. But his real estate holdings are extensive, according to financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. In that disclosure, which allows candidates to release their holdings in broad ranges, Trump lists his most valuable assets \u2013 classified only as worth \u201cover $50 million\u201d \u2013 as his real estate holdings. Given that, according to Lily Batchelder, a professor at New York University School of Law, said it\u2019s only logical that Trump would\u2019ve sought to benefit from the break. \u201cI would definitely expect that he\u2019s making use of 1031 for properties that he and his companies own,\u201d said Batchelder, who formerly served as the chief tax counsel for the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cIt creates a big tax sheltering opportunity \u2013 and is particularly generous for real estate.\u201d Or, as the book puts it: \u201cRich people know how to take advantage of their tax situation. This is part of the reason they\u2019re rich.\u201d But it\u2019s not just a how-to manual. It\u2019s also a marketing vehicle for one of Trump\u2019s now shuttered educational businesses: Trump University. At the conclusion of the book is an advertisement for a series of programs, books and even an immersive retreat. The closing message: \u201cThe road to wealth is a choice, but only if you take these steps.\u201d It then provides contact information for to enroll in Trump University courses.",

            "article_content": "In the space of a day, Britain\u2019s two most powerful people \u2013 Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 have been publicly reminded of the perils of a hot mic. Cameron was first, when his candid remarks to the Queen about Nigeria and Afghanistan \u2013 calling them \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d and \u201cpossibly the two most corrupt countries in the world\u201d \u2013 were captured on camera. The comments provoked a storm online and drew a rebuke from Nigeria\u2019s presidential spokesman, who said they were \u201cembarrassing.\u201d Shortly afterward, footage emerged of the Queen telling a senior Metropolitan Police officer that Chinese officials had been \u201cvery rude\u201d during President Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to Britain last year \u2013 potentially complicating relations with the superpower. For people accustomed to living in the media\u2019s glare, it\u2019s surprising how often world leaders forget the golden rule of broadcasting: Always assume the mic is live. Here are some of the most memorable occasions when things have gone wrong: French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama have come under fire after they were overheard talking rudely about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the G-20 summit. Sarkozy was overheard telling Obama: \u201cI can\u2019t stand him. He\u2019s a liar,\u201d according to French website Arret Sur Images. Obama is reported to have replied: \u201cYou\u2019re tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.\u201d Obama should have had no excuse for the Netanyahu incident, as he had been caught two years earlier making another gaffe when he described the polarizing rap superstar Kanye West as a \u201cjackass.\u201d The President was addressing the controversy over West storming the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards to gate-crash Taylor Swift\u2019s big moment. \u201cThe young lady seems like a perfectly nice person, she\u2019s getting her award. What\u2019s he doing up there?\u201d Obama said during an off-the-record portion of a TV interview. \u201cHe\u2019s a jackass.\u201d Another reporter in the room tweeted out the remark, and footage of the comments later leaked online. Obama doubled down on the comment three years later to a journalist from The Atlantic but tempered the criticism with the observation that the rapper was \u201ctalented.\u201d Obama: I don\u2019t have Kanye\u2019s home number Then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown\u2019s 2010 election campaign was not going well, but he had no idea how much worse it was going to get when he stopped to chat with a voter a week before the poll. Gillian Duffy, then a 66-year-old pensioner, proceeded to berate Brown, explaining why \u2013 despite having backed his Labour party all her life \u2013 she was now \u201cashamed\u201d to admit her political allegiance. Brown kept up a polite conversation with her as the TV cameras looked on, then drove away unaware his microphone was still on. Once inside the car, he complained to advisers: \u201cThat was a disaster. They should never have put me with that woman\u2026 Ridiculous\u2026 Bigoted woman.\u201d Brown later apologized, but went on to lose the election. Bigot gaffe threatens to overshadow UK debate Brown\u2019s predecessor, Tony Blair, was witness to one of the most famous on-mic blunders by U.S. President George W. Bush during a lunch meeting at the 2006 G-8 summit in Russia. Bush hailed the prime minister with the greeting \u201cYo Blair!\u201d and thanked him for a recent gift of a sweater. He then began discussing the situation in the Middle East, offering a not-entirely-diplomatic solution to the difficulties between Syria and Israel. \u201cWhat they need to do,\u201d he told Blair, \u201cis get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this s\u2014 and it\u2019s all over.\u201d The 43rd President of the U.S. was no stranger to the gaffe \u2013 entire books were written about his famous \u201cBushisms\u201d \u2013 and they were in evidence even on the election trail. At an Illinois campaign stop in September 2000, Bush was caught on camera referring to New York Times reporter Adam Clymer as a \u201cmajor-league a\u2014\u2014\u201d \u2013 to which his running mate Dick Cheney replied: \u201cOh yeah, big time.\u201d Bush later said he was sorry his comments \u2013 intended, according to his advisers, as a \u201cwhispered aside\u201d \u2013 were overheard. \u201cI regret that the private comments made it to the public airwaves,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret people heard the comments.\u201d George W. Bush is not the only one to have voiced his frustration and anger at a member of the media in an unguarded on-camera moment. Prince Charles got himself in hot water with the British press when he was caught muttering under his breath about a reporter to his sons William and Harry during a photocall on a skiing holiday in Switzerland in 2005. Taking exception to a question from the BBC\u2019s veteran royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, the prince complained: \u201cBloody people. I can\u2019t bear that man. He\u2019s so awful, he really is.\u201d The comment did little to repair Charles\u2019 fractious relationship with the media, and proved that gaffes can still offend, even when couched in polite language. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is in a class all his own when it comes to putting his foot in it. In one of his most famous blunders, he was caught on tape dropping the F-bomb while congratulating Obama over the signing of the controversial healthcare bill in March 2010. Introducing the President to the media, he turned to hug Obama, and was heard whispering: \u201cThis is a big f\u2014\u2014 deal.\u201d Elections are fertile hunting ground for gaffes, as politicians battle for airtime and headlines, but then-UK Prime Minister John Major found himself in trouble in 1993 when he admitted he didn\u2019t understand why people kept voting for him. The day after members of his Conservative party had rebelled in parliament over plans to expand Britain\u2019s links with Europe, the normally unemotive Major was heard referring to the eurosceptic MPs as \u201cbastards,\u201d and threatening to \u201ccrucify\u201d them. Speaking to a reporter after an interview \u2013 when he thought the microphone had been switched off \u2013 Major said he could not see \u201chow such a complete wimp like me keeps winning everything.\u201d French President Jacques Chirac also had winning on his mind when he was caught out on tape, criticizing an entire nation in 2005. Chirac was playing a leading role in Paris\u2019s quest to host the 2012 Olympics when he tried to make the most of what he saw as a clear advantage over competitor city London: Food. \u201cThe only thing that they have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease,\u201d he told Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. \u201cYou cannot trust people who have such bad cuisine.\u201d Predictably, the comments provoked the ire of the British tabloids, but the Brits had the last laugh days later, when London won the rights to stage the 2012 Olympics. While Chretien\u2019s remarks did not prompt an attack on Ottawa, a joke by U.S. President Ronald Reagan at the height of the Cold War could have had much more serious implications. Taking part in a sound-check shortly before his weekly radio address to the nation in August 1984, Reagan \u201cannounced\u201d to listeners: \u201cMy fellow Americans, I\u2019m pleased to tell you today that I have signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. \u201cWe begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The reaffirmation comes in the wake of Donald Trump effectively winning the Republican nomination last week Some conservative activists are pushing for Garland to be confirmed now in case Hillary Clinton wins the White House Top Senate Republicans closed the door Tuesday to the possibility of confirming Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in a post-election lame duck session \u2013 even if Hillary Clinton wins the White House \u2013 reiterating their long-held position that a new president should pick someone to fill the vacancy on the high court. \u201cWe should not do anything before January 20, 2017,\u201d said Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, referring to the date when the next president will be sworn in. Asked if he would take any action in a lame duck session, Grassley said, \u201cno.\u201d The GOP\u2019s reaffirmation not to act on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee came in the wake of Donald Trump effectively winning the Republican nomination last week. That caused some conservative activists to press for quick confirmation of Garland. Those activists argued Trump is likely to lose the general election to Clinton, who could potentially name a more liberal justice than Garland to the bench. A similar position has been endorsed by Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, who sits on the Judiciary Committee. He has argued for months \u2013 and pushed again in a national TV interview Sunday \u2013  that if Clinton wins the White House, Garland should be confirmed in the post-election lame duck session. But several key GOP senators said they wouldn\u2019t change their decision and expressed optimism Trump will win the White House and a nominee more conservative than Garland will make it on the bench. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that. We\u2019ve said we want to wait for the election,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Republican senator. \u201cIt looks like the race is very close and is going to have to play out over the next few months. But no, we\u2019re not going to change course.\u201d Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics in the Senate, said the decision should wait. \u201cI think the next president should pick the Supreme Court nominee,\u201d he said. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, blasted Republicans for trying to preserve the seat for Trump to fill. \u201cIt appears the Republicans want their anti-woman, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim, anti-everything, anti-middle class, billionaire candidate to determine the balance of the Supreme Court for the next generation,\u201d Reid told reporters. Earlier Tuesday, the White House delivered to Capitol Hill the formal questionnaire court nominees must provide the Judiciary Committee, even though no hearings or votes are planned for Garland, who is now the chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The decision to send the lengthy document to the Hill was part of a months-long strategy by the White House and congressional  Democrats to pressure Republicans to act. On Wednesday, the liberal group MoveOn.Org is holding a Washington press conference with a group of Iowans who will say they are disappointed with Grassley\u2019s handling of the Garland nomination. Also, the Center for American Politics, a Democratic group, will release a report critical of Grassley\u2019s stewardship of the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is expected to be the next Democratic leader in the Senate, was asked if Garland is not confirmed and Clinton wins the White House, should she resubmit Garland\u2019s name in the next Congress. \u201cI agree with Leader Reid he\u2019d be a great member of the Supreme Court, but I\u2019m not going to prejudge what happens in January,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf we get the majority, we will spend a lot of time listening to what the new president, President Clinton, has to say. If she were to pick Garland, I think we\u2019d all be very, very happy. If she wouldn\u2019t, obviously we\u2019d give that nominee due consideration.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, one of America\u2019s best-known businessmen, spent Monday trying to clean up his comments about the economy. Trump was under fire for comments on U.S. fiscal policy that were not only out of step with his party \u2013 but in some cases were a reversal of his own positions during the primary. CNN\u2019s Veep Shortlist He sparked concerns last week, for instance, when he dubbed himself the \u201cking of debt\u201d in an interview on CNBC and said he would be open to renegotiating U.S. public debt by treating the interaction like a business deal. But on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Monday, Trump said he never meant to suggest he would want the U.S. to default on its debt. In fact, Trump said, the country would never face such a potential outcome because it can \u201cprint\u201d money. Donald Trump: My debt comments were misrepresented \u201cPeople said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201cFirst of all, you never have to default because you print the money.\u201d Why Donald Trump\u2019s debt proposal is reckless That did little to satisfy economic experts who view U.S. bonds as one of the safest investments in the world and are leery of any talk of default. Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Trump also tried to walk back his comments on taxes. Appearing on the Sunday morning shows, Trump suggested the wealthiest Americans were likely to pay more taxes under his administration. The remarks raised eyebrows, both because they conflict with his past promise to slash taxes across the board, as well as the GOP\u2019s broad support for tax breaks for all income brackets. Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker \u201cFrom a practical standpoint, it\u2019s going to get renegotiated,\u201d the New York businessman said about his tax plan on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd in my opinion, the taxes for the rich will go up somewhat.\u201d But during the \u201cNew Day\u201d interview, he said he was referring to his willingness to consider changes to his own tax plan rather than the existing tax code. He insisted that wealthy Americans would ultimately pay a lower rate than what they are paying now. Fault lines: GOP civil war deepens \u201cIf I increase it on the wealthy, they\u2019re still going to pay less than they pay now,\u201d Trump told Cuomo. Later in the day, Trump tweeted: \u201cAny negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!\u201d I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current! Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the distraction. On a call with reporters Monday afternoon, Clinton\u2019s advisers dubbed Trump\u2019s tax plan \u201cthe most risky, reckless and regressive tax proposal ever put forward by any major presidential candidate.\u201d Nightcap: Paul Ryan gives Donald Trump an out on convention | Sign up \u201cHis tax plan proves that he is on the side of the wealthy and the big corporations and not the middle class and we fully intend to hold him to it,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, Clinton\u2019s policy adviser. Trump clearly sought to move beyond the brouhaha Monday and pivot to the general election. Though the race is six months away, he appointed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of his transition team. That announcement came days after he hired Steven Mnuchin as the campaign\u2019s national finance chairman \u2013 another key hire.",

Bobby Jindal says he\u2019ll vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton if that\u2019s the November match-up \u2013 but he won\u2019t be happy about it. Jindal called the war of words Tuesday heading into Indiana\u2019s primary between Trump and Texas Sen.

But Jindal told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that Trump is likely to win Indiana and the party will have to grin and bear it. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely, this election, this nomination contest could be all but over by tonight. I think it\u2019s more and more likely that Donald Trump will be the nominee,\u201d Jindal said.

Jindal also tweaked Cruz for unloading on Trump. When the former governor was running for president, he was one of the first to deliver a harsh critique of the front-runner, while Cruz made an effort to praise the mogul. \u201cI was worried about the rise of the Donald Trump,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic, Ted Cruz was one of the last people to continue to embrace him, to defend him, as recently as December \u2026 so I think it\u2019s ironic he\u2019s one of the last candidates to go now actually after Donald Trump now that he stands between him and the nomination.\u201d Jindal did have some words of praise for Trump, saying that although he doesn\u2019t believe Trump is truly a conservative, he clearly is speaking to voters. \u201cI think Donald Trump has tapped into middle class anxieties.\u201d Jindal said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well in part because voters are responding to what he is saying, he\u2019s saying, look, he\u2019ll fight for them.\u201d Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

            "article_content": "There are broad areas of overlap between Trump, Sanders Trump campaign manager on Sanders supporters: 'We will bring those people in' With the Republican presidential nomination within his grasp, Donald Trump is courting an unlikely group of voters: Bernie Sanders supporters. The GOP front-runner has ratcheted up his rhetoric against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in recent weeks, calling her a \u201ccrooked\u201d politician who is unqualified to be president. But when it comes to her challenger, Bernie Sanders, Trump has taken a notably softer tone, praising the Vermont senator\u2019s rhetoric and encouraging him to launch a third-party bid. \u201cI think Bernie Sanders should run as an independent. I think he\u2019d do great,\u201d Trump said at a victory rally in New York City Tuesday night, after sweeping five GOP contests in the Northeast. Related: Why I\u2019m voting for TrumpThe next morning, Trump said on MSNBC: \u201cBernie Sanders has a message that\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m going to be taking a lot of the things Bernie said and using them.\u201d Trump\u2019s advisers say these comments are a preview of more explicit overtures the campaign is ready to make to Sanders\u2019 supporters once the populist liberal exits the 2016 race. That strategy is based on the broad areas of overlap between voters attracted to Trump and those who have flocked to Sanders. Both have angrily denounced the political system as corrupt and expressed deep frustration that Washington is not helping ordinary people. They both oppose international trade deals, saying they hurt American jobs. And, of course, targeting Sanders supporters could serve to undermine Clinton. Can Donald Trump avoid a contested convention? Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the campaign is ready to bring into the fold anyone in the \u201cfeel the Bern\u201d movement who is not inclined to support Clinton in the general election. \u201cYou have two candidates in Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders which have reignited a group of people who have been disenfranchised and disappointed with the way Washington, D.C. and career politicians have run the country,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cBernie Sanders has large crowds \u2014 not as large as Mr. Trump\u2019s, but large crowds \u2014 and so there is a level of excitement there for people about his messaging and we will bring those people in.\u201d But even as the two candidates share similar campaign messages, there is a big hurdle to Trump winning over Sanders supporters. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showed that among Democratic leaning voters who want Sanders to be the party\u2019s nominee, only 13% of them view Trump favorably, while 86% view him unfavorably. And Sanders has been unequivocal: he wants the eventual Democratic nominee to defeat the Republican. Still, Trump and Sanders have both caught party leaders by surprise this year with the size and intensity of their followings. Sanders laying off hundreds of campaign staffers Trump is a brash Manhattanite who runs a multi-billion dollar real estate empire and has never sought public office; Sanders was born in Brooklyn and has been in public office since the 1980s, advocating for progressive causes like raising the minimum wage and affordable housing. Despite their starkly different backgrounds, both Trump and Sanders have managed to garner huge followings by tapping into a similar anger that\u2019s erupted into the open in this election cycle. Trump, even as he frequently boasts about his personal wealth, has made a point of disavowing special interests and corporate money like Sanders, billing himself the only candidate that is \u201cself-funding\u201d his presidential campaign. On the stump, the two men both passionately rail against a political system that is designed to prop up the elite while ignoring lower- and middle-class Americans. Resetting red and blue in the Rust Belt Marina Coddaire, a 25-year-old woman from Woodbury, Connecticut, is a registered Democrat who is supporting Sanders. But over the weekend, she was in the audience of a Trump rally in Waterbury. It was \u201ccuriosity\u201d that brought her there, she told CNN: \u201cI just want to see it for myself.\u201d \u201cI feel that the core of both what Bernie\u2019s movement is and Trump\u2019s movement is, is the same. This anti-establishment, being upset with the way that our government has been run and how the mistakes that they\u2019ve made have really damaged the middle class and have disenfranchised them,\u201d Coddaire said. \u201cThis cry of change. The way that they\u2019ve both gone about it is of course different but I still respect it.\u201d Coddaire said she would not vote for Clinton in the general election but left the door open \u2014 just a crack \u2014 to the possibility of supporting Trump in November. \u201cI really, really, really do not want to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when the media says\u2026 oh no, they\u2019ll make the switch, they\u2019ll consolidate, I don\u2019t think they will. Because I\u2019m not going to.\u201d Other Sanders fans are far less willing to consider Trump as an alternative. At a Sanders rally at Purdue University in Indiana on Wednesday, one Sanders supporter said he would \u201cnever even consider\u201d supporting the New York billionaire. \u201cTrump\u2019s hurdle is, you can\u2019t believe anything he says,\u201d said David Mason, a 42-year-old Lafayette photographer. \u201cYes, he and Bernie have some overlap on issues. But as people, they couldn\u2019t be more different.\u201d Bill Hillsman, a political consultant who has advised many independent candidates, said not only is there real potential for Trump to grow his base by reaching out to Sanders fans, it is crucial that Trump win over independents if he wants to win the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s evident many Democrats (and certainly those supporting Bernie) find Hillary\u2019s campaign lacking,\u201d Hillsman said. \u201cSo what Trump is doing is smart. The only possible route to a November win for him is on the backs of independent voters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report",

The mild-mannered lawyer from Wisconsin is caught in the middle of a firestorm. Front-runner Donald Trump is accusing the RNC of rigging the delegate system against him. The so-called \u201cestablishment\u201d is fighting to stop Trump and blaming Priebus for letting the billionaire get this far. Priebus sees it differently. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything to help anyone, and I\u2019m not going to do anything to hurt anybody,\u201d Priebus told CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel. But with daggers seemingly being thrown from all sides, the Kenosha native keeps things in perspective. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t fix it,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cSometimes you can just take a seven-alarm fire and just make it a four-alarm fire. It\u2019s still burning, but it\u2019s not as bad as it was.\u201d That attitude is what keeps Priebus grounded, according to Sally, his wife of 17 years. \u201cReince is very strong. He has a thick skin. He lets it roll off his shoulders. He\u2019s tough. He doesn\u2019t tolerate a lot of drama.\u201d In order to step away from that drama, the 44-year-old turns to several favorite pastimes: fishing, Green Bay Packers\u2019 football and music. His wife says Priebus sometimes puts the phone away and spends spends 30-45 minutes on the piano. In fact, Priebus is a two-time piano competition champion who plays all genres. His favorite? The blues. But he quickly points out that his playlist includes everything from rock-and-roll to Frank Sinatra to Beethoven. Priebus has been playing piano since he was a young boy. And now, his two small children \u2013 Jack and Grace \u2013 are taking lessons. \u201cMusic, I think, is an important part of life. I think it\u2019s good for kids to learn an instrument \u2013 do something besides iPhone games,\u201d Priebus said. Games may be exactly how he was able to woo his wife. The couple, who have known each other since middle school, spent their first date at a political dinner in their hometown. \u201cHe told me we were going to the movies. It was pretty boring. But we did go to the movies afterward and we had a great time,\u201d Sally said. Priebus, also with a huge grin on his face, admits, \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird. That\u2019s a nerd alert.\u201d A lifelong \u201cpolitical nerd\u201d is exactly how he describes himself. The son of a Greek mother and a German father, Priebus says his maternal grandfather got him interested in the game. \u201cHe loved politics,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAs a little guy, I followed him everywhere. He wasn\u2019t from here, and he loved this country. So I just started loving politics and the Republican Party.\u201d In fact, his first political memory was in third grade. \u201cAt our class election, I remember voting for Ronald Reagan,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI remember going to rallies. My mom would bring me.\u201d And, by 16, he became the youngest member in the history of the Kenosha County GOP Board.  It was his first step in fulfilling his \u201cmission\u201d to lead the Republican Party. Priebus took over the helm of the GOP in January 2011.  At the time, the party was dealing with a huge financial crisis and millions of dollars in debt. The little-known Wisconsin man, who had served as RNC general counsel during his predecessor Michael Steele\u2019s term, surprised the political world by winning the chairmanship on a seventh ballot. His mission at the time: Fix the financial troubles, grow the party, win a presidential election. He accomplished the first goal in less than two years by raising tons of money and improving relations with major donors. Now, his goal in one word: \u201cWin\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a midterm party that doesn\u2019t lose and a presidential party that\u2019s had a hard time winning,\u201d he said. But being the middle man during this year\u2019s Republican presidential fight has made things difficult for Priebus, who is visibly uncomfortable talking about himself. \u201cNo one should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed up for this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voters think Clinton would most likely win in a hypothetical match-up against Donald Trump The poll also finds Clinton would start the general with an edge over Trump If Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the respective front-runners in the race for the Democratic and Republican nominations for president, wind up leading their respective parties into the general, voters nationwide think Clinton would most likely win in the November election, according to a new CNN/ORC Poll. What a Clinton vs. Trump match up would look like The poll also finds Clinton would start the general election contest with an edge over Trump on several potential presidential qualifications, with the former secretary of state widely seen as better able to handle the responsibilities of being commander in chief, more in touch with the middle class and more often aligned with Americans\u2019 views on important issues. Hillary Clinton on Donald Trump: America needs \u2018steady hands\u2019 Overall, 56% say they think Clinton would win a match-up between the two leading candidates in November while 42% say Trump would take it. Democratic voters are more convinced that Clinton would win (87% say she would) than Republicans are about Trump (75% say he would win), and Republican voters who aren\u2019t currently backing Trump are particularly skeptical of his chances. Among that group, 40% say Clinton would win, 57% Trump, vs. 92% of Trump supporters who think he would win in November. The complete CNN/ORC poll results An earlier release from the same survey found Clinton ahead of Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up, 53% to 41% among registered voters. Trump: Clinton doesn't have the stamina to be President The new poll also asked which of the two candidates was better described by a range of potential presidential attributes. On those, 55% say Clinton would make a better commander in chief vs. 36% for Trump, and 51% see Clinton as more in touch with middle-class problems vs. 36% for Trump. Opinion: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are made for each other The margin is narrower when voters are asked which of the two agrees with you on the issues that matter most to you, though Clinton still holds a significant lead, with 48% choosing Clinton and 40% Trump. The two are about even, however, when voters are asked who is a strong and decisive leader. There are steep divides on each of these questions by gender, race and education, with women, non-whites and those with college degrees more apt to choose Clinton in each positive statement tested, but little of the age gap that defined the presidential elections that brought Barack Obama to the presidency and is currently prevalent in the Democratic nomination fight. How $67M failed to stop Trump The poll also finds some doubts about the front-runners. Asked whether Trump or Clinton is better described as \u201ca person you admire,\u201d Clinton has a 15-point lead over Trump, yet nearly one-quarter of voters say they admire neither candidate. And 17% say neither is honest and trustworthy, though Clinton has a 5-point edge there among those who do choose a candidate. Asked who would be more likely to change their position on issues for political reasons, 47% say Clinton, 42% Trump, 6% say both do, but the share offering that neither would do that drops to 3%. Hillary Clinton slams Donald Trump for 'bigotry' None of the remaining presidential candidates, including Clinton and Trump, is particularly well-liked. Not one of the five are viewed favorably by a majority of voters. Bernie Sanders and John Kasich are the only two with net positive reviews. Sanders notches the highest overall favorability among registered voters, with 48% viewing him positively vs. 45% unfavorably. That\u2019s a steep drop since last month, when 60% of registered voters overall had a positive take on the Vermont senator. Sanders has seen his ratings slip among registered Democrats and Republicans during that time, and independents\u2019 impressions of him are now evenly divided. For the latest political news and buzz get the CNN Politics Nightcap | Sign up Both of the two front-runners \u2013 Clinton and Trump \u2013 are viewed unfavorably by a majority of registered voters nationwide, with 57% having a negative take on Clinton and 65% on Trump. Most say they have an unfavorable take on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as well, 56% say so. Views of Kasich divide 43% favorable to 32% unfavorable, with 25% unsure about the Ohio governor. Within their own parties, the candidates are generally more highly regarded. Among Democrats, 73% have a positive take on Clinton, 71% Sanders. Among Republicans, 63% see Trump favorably, 60% Cruz and 49% Kasich (that\u2019s down 10 points since February). Amid this slate of unpopular candidates, the parties themselves aren\u2019t faring well. Trump, Clinton unleash new attacks on each other The Republican Party\u2019s unfavorable rating is at its highest level since the partial government shutdown in 2013, when it notched its worst ratings in CNN/ORC and CNN/Gallup polling dating back to 1992. Just 34% of adults in the new poll have a positive view of the party, 61% negative. Among registered Republicans, the view is rosier, 66% have a favorable impression, but that\u2019s still down from 73% favorable in January. Do you know the campaign logo? More have a positive take on the Democrats, 50% overall, with 45% saying they have an unfavorable view. That\u2019s up slightly since January, when 45% had a positive view. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone March 17-20 among 1,001 randomly selected adult Americans, including 925 registered voters. The results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and it is larger for subgroups. Can you guess whose campaign logo this is?",

            "article_content": "Kasich, Clinton win Ohio Trump takes Florida, Illinois, North Carolina Marco Rubio drops presidential bid Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump won pivotal primaries Tuesday, while Gov. John Kasich\u2019s long-awaited debut victory in his home state of Ohio raised the chances of a historic GOP convention fight. A humiliating loss on home ground in Florida, meanwhile, ended the White House dreams of Sen. Marco Rubio, who was once hailed as a Republican Party savior. Clinton took big strides toward the Democratic nomination by winning Florida and North Carolina. And in crucial victories, she stopped Bernie Sanders in his tracks in the industrial Midwest by taking Ohio and Illinois. The Republican Party, meanwhile, veered closer to a contested convention after Kasich held his own state and deprived Trump of its 66 delegates. That makes it more difficult for the billionaire to reach the 1,237 delegates he needs to capture the GOP prize. Trump did, however, prevail in the biggest contest of the night, taking all of Florida\u2019s 99 delegates. That resounding win helped force Rubio out of the race after failing to win his own state and unite the Republican establishment against Trump. The real estate tycoon also won primaries in Illinois and North Carolina. \u201cThis was a great evening,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was an amazing evening.\u201d Jerry Springer: Donald Trump was \u2018inevitable\u2019 The drama is still unfolding in other key races. Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are locked in a tight battle for Missouri. And Clinton is still hoping for a sweep, with votes still being counted in the close race with Sanders in Missouri. Vote counting was completed for the night in Missouri with both Clinton and Trump clinging to tight leads of less than half a percentage point, but CNN will not project a winner in either contest as the margin of victory in each case is less than 1 percentage point. Trump was already looking forward to the general election as he urged party unity amid growing speculation about the potential for a convention fight. \u201cWe have to bring our party together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to bring it together.\u201d Still, GOP leaders may now look to Kasich as their final chance to unite behind a candidate who could challenge Trump in the event of a contested convention. \u201cWe are all very, very happy,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in a telephone interview. According to CNN estimates, Trump needs to win about 60% of the remaining delegates available in the GOP race \u2013 a goal complicated by the fact that some states award delegates on a proportional basis, rather than doling out their entire hauls to the winner, as is the case in Ohio and Florida. Obama knocks \u2018vulgar and divisive\u2019 presidential campaign But it\u2019s unclear how Kasich, a contender who has won only one state and who has been laboring in obscurity for much of the race, can overtake Trump, who has now won 18 states and is far ahead in the delegate race. The billionaire, who has harnessed the anger of grass-roots Republicans against party elites, is responsible for destroying the campaigns of some of the GOP\u2019s most imposing personalities \u2013 all of whom were once considered strong White House contenders, including Rubio, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie. On the Democratic side, Clinton has won the Illinois, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio primaries \u2013 crucial victories that bolster Clinton\u2019s claim that she is her party\u2019s only candidate who can win diverse states that will be pivotal in the November general election. Her win in North Carolina completed her sweep of Southern states, where she has enjoyed strong support from African-American voters. \u201cWe are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November,\u201d Clinton said in a victory speech in West Palm Beach, Florida. Clinton campaign defends Libya comment in face of RNC attacks Clinton said that by the end of the night, she would have two million more votes than Sanders, and hold a lead of more than 300 in the delegate count. While Clinton did not urge Sanders to quit the race so she could turn her fire on Trump, her comments appeared to be a gentle message to her stronger-than-expected challenger. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Clinton\u2019s victory in Ohio follows her surprise loss in Michigan last week, which raised fresh questions about her campaign strategy and provided a lift to Sanders that he hoped would help him sweep the Midwest. That loss may ultimately turn out to be an anomaly given her wins in Illinois and Ohio. She unveiled a retooled message in her victory speech that simultaneously rationalized her campaign against Sanders and foreshadowed a general election duel with Trump, as she stressed repeatedly she would create jobs as president and stand up for the middle class. \u201cWe are going to stand up for American workers and make sure no one takes advantage of us \u2013 not China, not Wall Street, not overpaid corporate executives,\u201d she said. Clinton\u2019s victories on Tuesday give Sanders a tough climb if he is to grab the nomination. He would need to win about 72% of the remaining delegates in order to do so, according to CNN estimates, and time may be running out for him unless he can start racking up huge victory margins in coming state contests. Still, most Democratic strategists expect Sanders to stay in the race for several months. With Rubio\u2019s decision to drop out, three Republican candidates remain in the White House race \u2013 Trump, Kasich and Cruz. Moments from Marco Rubio's career In a speech that served as a thinly-veiled rebuke of Trump\u2019s campaign tactics, Rubio warned that the politics of division will leave America a \u201cfractured nation.\u201d \u201cAmerica is in the middle of a real political storm, a real tsunami and we should have seen this coming,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhile we are on the right side,\u201d he said, \u201cthis year, we will not be on the winning side.\u201d Rubio spent the final weeks of his campaign in an often bitter fight with Trump. But on Tuesday night, Trump congratulated the Florida senator \u201cfor having run a tough campaign.\u201d \u201cHe is tough,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is smart and he has got a great future.\u201d Cruz also praised Rubio warmly, saying he could \u201cpaint a picture and weave a tapestry about the promise of America like nobody else.\u201d Ted Cruz urged to apologize for attacks against Mitch McConnell And Cruz told Rubio\u2019s bereft supporters: \u201cWe welcome you with open arms.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After losing Michigan, Hillary Clinton looks to win Ohio and Missouri Clinton will likely need a new message in those states Meanwhile, Sanders' win could give him a fundraising boost After losing unexpectedly to Bernie Sanders in Michigan, Hillary Clinton must now win over voters in nearby Ohio and Missouri next week to continue on the path to becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Clinton will likely need to find a new message in those Rust Belt states, after her positioning herself as a defender of the auto industry fell short in Michigan. She tried to paint her rival as voting against the auto bailout, an argument which didn\u2019t ring true. Sanders decried trade deals as hurting manufacturing and the middle class. Sanders campaign: Michigan win due to trade message \u201cMany of the same issues that resonated in Michigan with Democrats there are going to resonate in Ohio,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cThe auto industry there was also severely damaged. There are a lot of people in Ohio who are hurting. That\u2019s an industrial state. Same in Illinois. Same in Missouri.\u201d Sanders will now take his anti-trade deal message to Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, which hold primaries next week. Each have solid manufacturing and union bases. Clinton, meanwhile, will discuss her plans to create jobs and increase incomes on the trail, said Karen Finney, the campaign\u2019s senior spokeswoman on CNN. Who have celebrities endorsed for the 2016 election? Finney also tried to blunt some of the Sanders\u2019 campaign criticism over trade, saying Clinton did vote against certain agreements when she was a New York senator. The two Democrats will have another chance to win over voters Wednesday night when they go head-to-head in a Univision debate in Florida that will be simulcast on CNN. In Michigan, it\u2019s clear Sanders\u2019 messaging hit home: The Vermont senator led her among voters who believe trade hurts American jobs by 56% to 43%, according to exit polls. He also beat Clinton among union households by 49% to 47% Tuesday. Read: Exit polls: Dem, GOP voters worry about economy Clinton: Campaigns should be about results, not insults Sanders\u2019 Michigan win should give him a big fundraising boost as he continues his quest to unseat Clinton. But he still faces substantial hurdles \u2013 he only picked up 67 delegates Tuesday to Clinton\u2019s 84, thanks to her decisive Mississippi victory. Overall, she now has 1,234 of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination versus Sanders\u2019 567. The Clinton campaign made note Wednesday of her solid lead. \u201cWe are quite far ahead when we talk about pledged delegates,\u201d Finney said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this nomination is about winning delegates.\u201d Read: 5 takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries Clinton is currently ahead of Sanders 63% to 33% in Ohio, a new CNN/ORC poll shows. But Weaver pointed to polls prior to the Michigan primary also showed the former secretary of state far ahead. \u201cThe race is much closer than that,\u201d he said. Read: What went wrong for Hillary Clinton in Michigan? Still, her campaign is optimistic about upcoming contests. \u201cThe Sanders campaign \u2026 needs to show that they can put together a winning coalition of voters,\u201d Finney said, noting Clinton\u2019s strong support among African-Americans and Latinos. \u201cThat is how you win an election, both in the primary and the general.\u201d Hillary Clinton wins Miss. as exit polls favor Trump Sanders\u2019 campaign is also looking beyond the next Super Tuesday. The primary calendar turns more favorable for Sanders from here on, Weaver said. There are fewer races in Clinton\u2019s stronghold in the south, and Sanders\u2019 campaign feels he has a good shot of winning on West Coast and in other states. \u201cOutside of the south, Hillary Clinton has yet to show she can win convincingly anywhere,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThe math just looks so much better for him after March 15.\u201d He also noted Sanders improved his standing among African-American voters, capturing about half of young African-American voters in Michigan, though Clinton still trumped him in the demographic overall. But even if Clinton is able to beat Sanders, her struggles have highlighted potential vulnerabilities against GOP front-runner Donald Trump. On Tuesday, the billionaire businessman highlighted Clinton\u2019s stumbles, saying his campaign is drawing unhappy Democratic and independent voters. \u201cThere is no enthusiasm for Hillary,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not going to bring back trade. She\u2019s in favor of trade deals. She\u2019s not going to bring back businesses. She\u2019s not going to bring back all of the employment that\u2019s gone, all the factories that have closed.\u201d Clinton, however, still tops Trump in polls of a general election match-up between them.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are looking to pad their delegate leads Tuesday Michigan is the big prize; Democrats and Republicans also vote in Mississippi Republicans vote in Hawaii and Idaho The two presidential front-runners are both eyeing Super Tuesday 2 as a chance to build on their momentum and pad their leads as they look to put the races away by the end of the month. Hillary Clinton will try to set the tone for the entire Great Lakes region by holding off Bernie Sanders in Michigan, and she is expected to claim another Southern victory in Mississippi. Super Tuesday: Clinton, Trump win big And Donald Trump will try to run the table, with four Republican contests on tap. He leads in Michigan, and has done well in Southern states like Mississippi. Idaho and Hawaii vote Tuesday as well, a chance to pick up more delegates. Here\u2019s what to watch in the day\u2019s elections: Trump vs. Cruz TV wars Time is running out for Trump\u2019s opponents to turn things around before the winner-takes-all states start to vote and the GOP front-runner racks up enough delegates to lock the nomination up before the convention. Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have broken away from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the delegate count \u2013 and Tuesday should help them build on their advantage. Delegate math: Rubio, Kasich wins key to stopping Trump Trump leads the polls in Michigan, the crown jewel of Tuesday\u2019s contests. Mississippi, meanwhile, will test whether Cruz\u2019s surge in Louisiana \u2013 he closed a massive polling gap and finished within four points on Saturday \u2013 expands to other Southern states, or Trump can finish running the table in the Deep South. Idaho could be better ground for Cruz, who has spent more time in the state than other candidates. All three states, though, pose problems for Rubio. Mississippi and Michigan each require candidates to reach 15% to accumulate delegates. Idaho requires candidates to top 20%. The stronger Trump and Cruz run, the tougher it becomes for Rubio to make any gains at all. Florida newspaper won\u2019t endorse any GOP candidate Rubio has a history of doing well with \u201clate deciders\u201d \u2013 voters who make up their minds in the last week. He picked up 39% of those voters in Virginia, for example, according to exit polls. But those voters, polls have shown, typically make up less than one-third of a state\u2019s electorate. For the latest news and political buzz get the CNN Politics Nightcap | Sign up In Michigan, a Monmouth University poll showed 23% of voters were undecided or only had a slight preference in the days leading up to the primary. And supporters of Trump, polls have shown, tend to be more locked-in on their candidate than supporters of Rubio. What Tuesday\u2019s contests could demonstrate is whether there\u2019s enough late movement to help Trump\u2019s rivals \u2013 particularly since the week leading up to the debate featured the most explosive Republican debate yet. After Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver raised eyebrows when he referred to Clinton as a \u201cregional candidate\u201d who struggles to win outside the South. Clinton and Sanders battle over auto industry bailout For Clinton, Michigan will put that claim to the test. She\u2019s increasingly eager to turn her attention to the general election \u2013 and to do that, Clinton needs to turn the tide with white voters, and particularly run up her advantage among women. She has performed better in those demographics since Sanders won in New Hampshire just over a month ago, and Michigan is a good bellwether for Clinton. It\u2019s a heavily-populated, diverse state that Democrats absolutely have to have in order to win the general election in November. Clinton likens Sanders\u2019 campaign to her failed 2008 effort Sunday night in Flint, Michigan, Clinton dropped a bomb on Sanders, bringing up his 2008 vote against the auto bailout bill, setting up a line of attack she will likely use in other midwestern industrial states down the line. \u201cThe money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference,\u201d she said at the CNN debate. \u201cGiven the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do,\u201d she added. \u201cYou were either for saving the auto industry or against it. I voted to save the auto industry and I\u2019m very glad that I did.\u201d A victory in Michigan could set Clinton up for a huge March 15 \u2013 when Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri vote. If Sanders can\u2019t win Michigan, he might not be able to win any of those states. A Clinton loss, though, means Missouri, Ohio and potentially Illinois could be in play. Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'I endorse John Kasich' Ohio Gov. John Kasich has actually jumped ahead of Rubio for third place in Michigan, and is rising quickly, a Monmouth University poll out Monday showed. He appears to have worn well in last week\u2019s Republican presidential debate, when he stayed out of the Trump-Rubio-Cruz scrum. So imagine this scenario: Kasich beats Rubio in Michigan. Then, on March 15, Kasich wins his 66-delegate, winner-take-all home state of Ohio,  and Rubio loses his 99-delegate, winner-take-all home state of Florida. Find your presidential match with CNN\u2019s 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Suddenly, Kasich would become the leading moderate, establishment-type Republican in the race \u2013 and Rubio would lack a path forward. There are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d for that to happen. But for Kasich to stand any chance of turning what\u2019s been a smaller-scale campaign that\u2019s been much choosier about where he tries to compete into one with a real shot at quickly racking up delegates, Michigan is where it has to start. Winning Ohio could help Kasich play a small role in denying Trump the delegates he needs to win the GOP nomination outright. But to have a shot at the nomination himself, Kasich has to win the Midwest \u2013 states like Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, which have similarly-styled Republican governors and are often general election battlegrounds.",

Ted Strickland of Ohio. The endorsement from the two leaders of the Democratic Party comes as a boost to Murphy, who is behind Rep. Alan Grayson in recent polls for the Senate seat vacated by Marco Rubio. The Florida primary contest for the Democratic nominee has already received national attention. In 2015, it was revealed that Grayson was running a hedge fund while serving in Congress. In February, The New York Times reported that emails and marketing documents obtained by the newspaper showed that Grayson\u2019s roles as a hedge fund manager and a congressman intertwined, including promoting his status as a congressman to steer business.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump faces lawsuits from Trump University, the online real estate courses the bore his name Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both raised the issue at the GOP debate in Houston Trump could be called to the witness stand later this year Donald Trump likes to talk a lot about winning, but it is one of his failed ventures that brought out daggers from his opponents in Thursday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate. Florida Senator Marco Rubio took the first stab at trying to label Trump\u2019s failed \u201cTrump University\u201d as a fake. \u201cThere are people who borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University, and they\u2019re suing now,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.\u201d Trump, Rubio, Cruz spar over Trump University That allegation is mostly true. Donald Trump continues to be haunted by a failed real estate investment school that threatens to pull him into the witness chair in the middle of this presidential campaign. And that opened the door for the second dagger in last night\u2019s debate, this time from Texas Senator Ted Cruz. \u201cYou know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It\u2019s a fraud case, \u201d Cruz told the debate audience before asking Republican voters to think about what that would mean if Donald Trump is called into court to stand trial for fraud, right in the middle of an election. \u201cIf this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee, on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud, \u201cCruz explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?\u201d Trump brushed off the attacks saying the case is a civil suit that he intends to win. But it is also true that six years after the school shut down, is he still facing lawsuits. From the time he launched Trump University in 2005 until it shut down in 2010, about 10,000 students from across the country signed up for the program that promised success in real estate by offering courses and seminars based on the principles of the business mogul himself. \u201cAt Trump University, we teach success,\u201d Trump said in a 2005 infomercial when the program was launched. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Success. It\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d Now, Trump is facing three separate lawsuits \u2013 two class action suits filed in California and one filed by New York\u2019s attorney general \u2013 which argue the program that took in an estimated $40 million, but was mired in fraud and deception. \u201cWe started looking at Trump University and discovered that it was a classic bait-and-switch scheme. It was a scam, starting with the fact that it was not a university,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d after filing suit in 2013. Prosecutor: Trump lawsuit no stunt Schneiderman\u2019s case argues that Trump and Michael Sexton, the former president of the program, engaged in fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct, and that although the program promised to offer courses taught by experts personally selected by Trump, the teachers were neither handpicked nor experts. Trump University\u2019s courses ranged from $1,495 three-day seminars to $35,000 \u201cGold\u201d level programs that allowed for personal mentoring, real estate field trips and access to the expertise that made Trump a billionaire. Affidavits from the case additionally show some students felt the program consisted of worthless information they could have obtained for free elsewhere. Others said they simply did not receive the services they paid for. \u201cI have not been able to get in touch with anyone after I signed up for the trump Gold Elite Program,\u201d student Kathleen Meese wrote in one such affidavit. Another enrollee, Michele Cintron, who paid $25,000 to have special access to high-level mentors said in an affidavit that a \u201cnon-existent \u2018power team\u2019\u201d was unable to be reached. As for investing knowledge, student Maribel Paredes described Trump University in an affidavit as \u201ca bad investment on my part.\u201d CNN was unable to reach these former students for comment. Other former students who wrote affidavits for the lawsuits also declined to be interviewed. Most of the students never met or laid eyes on Trump, but representatives of the program, which is now called Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, say students were never promised they would meet Trump in person. Is Trump University a fraud? Trump\u2019s attorney Alan Garten said many students were satisfied with the courses and the lack of success of some should not be attributed to the program. \u201cAll we can do is provide the tools for people to go out there and apply these things,\u201d Garten said. \u201cI can\u2019t control what happens out in the real world. If someone goes and takes our classes and decides to sit on their couch and not apply them, I can\u2019t help that, OK?\u201d He added that Trump University should not be blamed for some enrollees having trouble selling real estate in the midst of the economic collapse of 2008. Garten provided CNN with 14 affidavits from satisfied students and said those who complained about the program are a \u201cminiscule\u201d amount out of approximately 10,000 who enrolled. He said Trump will continue to fight each of the three lawsuits until he wins, even if legal fees outweigh the profits Trump earned from the courses. The fight has carried on for more than six years, although Trump recently won an important victory. A California judge handed down a ruling that will make it harder for former students of Trump University to get any money back in damages, even if those students can eventually prove the courses were fraudulent. Donald Trump in the public eye One of the California cases has been set for pre-trial motions in May and trial for August, right in the middle of the presidential campaign.  Donald Trump has been listed as a witness. At a hearing in December, a Trump lawyer even requested the court dates be scheduled around Trump\u2019s campaign schedule, so as not to interfere with Super Tuesday primaries next week or the Republican National Convention. The presiding judge said he is anxious to move the case forward. \u201cObviously, everyone knows this is a unique set of circumstances that we have here. There\u2019s not many cases where there\u2019s a presidential candidate who is one of the parties in the case,\u201d Judge Gonzalo Curiel said. Despite its possible political implications, Trump told the debate audience Thursday night he plans to fight the case in court, and win. \u201cIt\u2019s something I could have settled many times,\u201d Trump stated. \u201cI could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u2019t want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed, most,  many, many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.  And believe me, I\u2019ll win that case.\u201d",

NEW: Donald Trump said he will decide whether to release his tax returns and called Mitt Romney \"yesterday's news\" The 2012 Republican nominee's broadside followed Trump's thumping victories in three of the first four GOP nominating contests Romney warned Wednesday that Donald Trump's tax returns could contain a \"bombshell\" Donald Trump is striking back at Mitt Romney on Thursday, after the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said his party\u2019s current front-runner could have a \u201cbombshell\u201d in his tax returns. \u201cMitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!\u201d the billionaire businessman said in a series of Tweets attacking Romney. Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! Trump wrote that tax returns have zero to do with a person\u2019s net worth, and all swung at the establishment wing of the Republican party, many of whom have coalesced behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as an answer to Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!\u201d Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN!\u201d Romney used the same medium to respond, tweeting back at the billionaire businessman Thursday. \u201cMethinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes, @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding,\u201d Romney tweeted. Methinks the Donald doth protest too much. Show voters your back taxes, @realDonaldTrump. #WhatIsHeHiding The real estate mogul first rejected Romney\u2019s accusation out of hand in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, saying \u201cthere is no bombshell at all other than I pay a lot of tax and the government wastes the money.\u201d Romney\u2019s biting attack hinted at clear signs of alarm in the Republican establishment at the billionaire\u2019s tightening grip on the party\u2019s presidential race. \u201cWe have good reason to believe that there\u2019s a bombshell in Donald Trump\u2019s taxes,\u201d Romney told Fox News, and also called on the top anti-Trump contenders Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio to disclose their tax information as well. \u201cEither he\u2019s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn\u2019t been paying taxes we would expect him to pay or perhaps he hasn\u2019t been giving money to vets or to the disabled like he\u2019s been telling us he\u2019s been doing,\u201d Romney added. Nightcap: Mitt Romney predicts a \u2018bombshell\u2019 in Donald Trump\u2019s taxes | Sign up Other Republicans \u2013 including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham \u2013 came to Trump\u2019s defense Thursday. \u201cWe as Republicans should not accept that this man has a tainted financial past,\u201d Graham told CNN\u2019s \u201cThis Hour,\u201d adding later, \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me he doesn\u2019t want to show us his financial situation.\u201d The 2012 Republican nominee\u2019s broadside followed Trump\u2019s thumping victories in three of the first four GOP nominating contests, including in Nevada on Tuesday night, which have established the billionaire businessman as the party\u2019s undisputed front-runner. Opinion: It\u2019s over; Trump is going to be the Republican nominee It was also an attack steeped in irony, since Romney was on the receiving end of similar claims by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, when Democrats eviscerated him over his fortune and business record during the 2012 campaign. Reid zeroed in on his taxes, saying he hadn\u2019t paid any in a decade without offering any evidence to support the claim. Trump left the door open to not releasing his tax returns Wednesday. The GOP front-runner told CNN that he will \u201cmake a determination over the next couple of months\u201d as to whether he will release his tax returns. Romney, who decided against a third presidential run last year after initially considering jumping in to the race, uncorked his attack on Trump, ahead of next week\u2019s Super Tuesday contests that could further cement the billionaire\u2019s strong front-runner status in the GOP presidential race. Romney\u2019s move appeared to not just be a sign of concern that Trump \u2013 after defying pundits and political logic since he launched his \u201coutsider\u201d campaign last summer \u2013 could actually go on to claim the Republican nomination. Mitt Romney comments on Donald Trump It was also a sign of skittishness about the damage the Democrats will try to inflict on Trump, who has a long and sometimes controversial business record, in a general election, if he does indeed emerge as the GOP nominee. \u201cThey were all over me for my taxes,\u201d Romney told Fox. While Cruz and Rubio have yet to release their tax returns this campaign season, years of tax returns from both candidates are already publicly available from the time when they ran for Senate. Reid ignited a firestorm in the 2012 presidential race by claiming on the Senate floor, without presenting any evidence, that \u201cthe word\u2019s out that he hasn\u2019t paid any taxes in 10 years.\u201d His attack was part of a fierce effort by the Obama re-election campaign to portray Romney as an out of touch and heartless businessman unable to understand the economic problems afflicting the middle class. Reid later told CNN that he did not regret his move, noting archly that Romney did not win the election. The irony of the moment was not lost on Reid. \u201cAll I know, I can\u2019t imagine Romney having the gall coming after anybody\u2019s returns,\u201d the Senate minority leader told CNN on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s look at his.\u201d It also struck one key member of Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cDid Mitt Romney just do to Donald Trump on tax returns what he was so mad at Harry Reid for doing to him?\u201d said former Obama political adviser and current CNN commentator Dan Pfeiffer on Twitter. Under intense pressure, Romney did finally release his tax returns during the campaign, but when it emerged that he had paid around 14% taxes on his 2010 return, there was political uproar that played into the hands of the Obama campaign. The former Massachusetts governor was taking advantage of rules in the tax code under which income derived from dividends and capital gains is taxed at lower rates than traditional wages. Trump last summer released his personal financial disclosure shortly after announcing his presidential run and has consistently touted the fact that he released his financial numbers ahead of schedule. Trump said he was worth $8 billion, a figure he and his accountants later revised to $10 billion when he officially released his personal financial disclosure. Forbes has estimated Trump\u2019s net worth at $4.5 billion, a figure Trump has disputed. On Wednesday, Trump also stressed that his tax returns \u201care extremely complex,\u201d which Romney has rejected given that Trump would only need to publish several years of past tax returns which he has already filed. Trump stressed as he has in the past that he pays \u201cas little as possible because it\u2019s an expense and it\u2019s not one I\u2019m happy paying because frankly the United States government wastes a lot of money.\u201d CNN\u2019s Julia Manchester contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Harry Reid spoke to CNN about the possibility of a brokered convention \"These races go on for a long long time,\" the Senate Minority Leader told CNN Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday that the Democratic race for president could drag on for months \u2013 and possibly to the Democratic National Convention in July. In an interview with CNN, Reid said that the race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton shows no signs of dying down, even as the former secretary of state had hoped the upcoming Nevada caucuses and South Carolina primary would be her launching pad to the Democratic nomination. Reid on a brokered convention: 'it would be kinda fun' \u201cThese races go on for a long long time,\u201d Reid said. When asked if that included a brokered convention, he responded \u201cSure, seriously some of the old conventions produced some good people.\u201d Reid also said, \u201cIt would be kind of fun.\u201d Reid\u2019s comments reflect the party establishment\u2019s growing uncertainty about Clinton\u2019s viability and lingering questions about whether she can hold off the Sanders surge. But Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says she sees a contested convention as unlikely. \u201cI do think that this will continue to be a robust primary that will play out over the course of the next several months,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d Thursday. \u201cBut there were predictions of a brokered convention, a fight that would go all the way to the convention, in 2008, if you recall, Jake, and that didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t happen because this was wrapped up in a timely process through the normal primary schedule, and I think that will be the case here.\u201d In the wide-ranging interview in his office, Reid raised concerns about both Sanders and the Clinton camp, criticizing the Vermont independent\u2019s proposal to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his policy ideas. And he ridiculed Clinton\u2019s campaign for suggesting that 80 percent of the Nevada electorate is white, suggesting that her team was out-of-step with his state\u2019s ethnic diversity. \u201cWell, it appears to me they\u2019ve been reading one of the old yearbooks from my high school,\u201d said Reid, 76. \u201cThey\u2019re way behind the times.\u201d What is a brokered convention? Reid spoke just days before the next presidential contest, which will take place in his home state of Nevada on February 20. Coming off a huge victory in New Hampshire, Sanders has been spending big bucks on TV both in English and in Spanish, while adding at least 50 staffers and 11 offices in the state. Reid, who is neutral in the race, said that his state will be a toss-up, a potential warning to Clinton who had hoped that the Sanders bubble would burst after New Hampshire. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be very close,\u201d said Reid, who still runs the state\u2019s political machine even as he prepares to retire at year\u2019s end. Reid added: \u201cClinton won one of the states already, Sanders won another state already, there\u2019s one more state, Nevada, then South Carolina. No matter what happens in Nevada or South Carolina, the race is going to go on.\u201d Just as Reid is paying close attention to the Democratic race, he\u2019s not afraid to lay out his views of the Republican side as well. And the blunt-speaking Nevada Democrat, who usually lays out brutal attacks against his political enemies, offered a surprising take on the GOP frontrunner, Donald Trump, saying the two are relatable. \u201cHe\u2019s a person who is authentic,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou may not agree with his authenticity but he\u2019s authentic. People like that. He speaks his mind, which reminds me of me once in a while. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s refreshing.  He just says whatever he thinks is appropriate. I think some of the stuff is not so good but he does that. People identify with that. It wouldn\u2019t sell very well with Democrats but he\u2019s selling pretty well with Republicans.\u201d Reid declined to handicap Trump\u2019s chances against the eventual Democratic nominee, but he pushed back hard on Marco Rubio, ridiculing the Florida senator for consistently saying that Democrats are terrified to run against him. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d Reid chuckled when asked if Democrats were worried about Rubio. \u201cHe came in third in one election, in Iowa.  He came in fifth in New Hampshire.  I\u2019m not quaking in my boots I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d Exit polls out of New Hampshire showed Clinton badly damaged over questions over trustworthiness, and Reid said there\u2019s a reason for that: The influx of attack ads trying to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Clinton. \u201cThe Koch brothers and all their minions that are not only spending huge amounts of money trying to denigrate Hillary Clinton, but other candidates we have around the country,\u201d Reid said. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t do a very good job of reporting about that.\u201d Asked if that ad money would be detrimental to Clinton in a fall campaign, Reid said: \u201cOf course, of course \u2013 it already is. Why do you think her numbers are changed around? Because of all the millions of dollars spent against her. That\u2019s been so unfair.\u201d Still, Reid said he thought Sanders or Clinton could beat the GOP nominee \u2013 and he downplayed concerns from moderates in his party that Sanders\u2019 socialist views would be devastating for down-ticket races. \u201cWhoever wins the election, and you know it\u2019s going to go on for a while, as I\u2019ve already indicated, we\u2019re, it\u2019ll turn out fine,\u201d Reid said. With his thumb and index finger extended, he said: \u201cMy worry is this small compared to any Republican that sees either Trump or (Ted) Cruz being their nominee.\u201d Unlike Clinton, Reid would not say if Sanders\u2019 plan to create a single-payer health care system is unfeasible, saying, \u201canything is possible.\u201d But he pushed back on Sanders\u2019 proposal to raise taxes across the board, including the middle-class, to pay for his sweeping domestic policies. \u201cWell I\u2019m a big fan of having the richest of the rich pay more, and the sad part about it is that they don\u2019t mind paying more, it\u2019s just the only people in America that don\u2019t believe they should pay more are the Republicans in Congress,\u201d Reid said. \u201cRepublicans around the country, the vast majority agree with me. So I\u2019m in favor of doing that, but let\u2019s leave the middle class alone\u2013they\u2019re really struggling.\u201d Iowa \u2018doesn\u2019t represent America\u2019 Despite Sanders\u2019 close-second place finish in Iowa and resounding victory in New Hampshire, Reid said the first test will be in Nevada, given the ethnic makeup of the state \u2013 with its large influx of Latinos \u2013 makes it more representative of the Democratic coalition. \u201cIowa doesn\u2019t represent America,\u201d Reid said. \u201cNew Hampshire, first of all very few people live there, and Iowa and New Hampshire are basically white states. Nevada is part of the Great West.\u201d Reid added that Iowa and New Hampshire should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have such power in choosing the parties\u2019 nominees. \u201cThat\u2019s why I pushed hard for Nevada and South Carolina so that then we go across the country after we get out of these states,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut previously we never, we never stepped foot in Nevada or South Carolina. We did it all in New Hampshire or Iowa \u2013 that was wrong.\u201d As he winds down his three-decade Senate career, Reid has made it a top goal to keep his Senate seat in Democratic hands, bring his party back to power into the chamber and help elect a Democratic president. But, he also knows his limitations. He suffered a brutal eye injury last fall, leaving him blind in his right eye. Asked how his eye was doing now, Reid dead-panned: \u201cStill blind.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump: \"We are going to make America great again\" Sanders: \"Tonight we have sent a message\" Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders swept to thumping outsider victories in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, seizing on the fury of grass-roots voters to rock the elites who control American politics. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose aspirational conservative message contrasts with Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric, surged to a surprise second place in the GOP race. Bernie Sanders is first Jewish candidate to win a primary. Does he care? But the nation\u2019s second presidential contest failed to clarify the battle between establishment candidates. There are doubts about Kasich\u2019s viability in more conservative states and ability to raise money. Marco Rubio faces renewed questions about his readiness after a shaky debate performance robbed him of momentum. And Jeb Bush, the one-time front-runner, did just enough to survive. WATCH: Trump describes New Hampshire victory That means the opposition to Trump and Iowa caucuses winner Ted Cruz remains divided. Huffington Post blasts Trump as \u2018racist, sexist demagogue\u2019 Trump, a brash businessman and reality TV star who has never run for office, and Sanders, a self-declared democratic socialist, were both seen as long-shot outsiders when they launched their campaigns. Their victories reflect deep bipartisan anger at professional politicians and suggest that both the Democratic and Republican races will now be long, acrimonious struggles that could stretch well into the spring. New Hampshire also delivered a painful personal blow to Hillary Clinton, who squeezed out the narrowest of victories in Iowa last week. The scale of her defeat \u2014 by more than 20 points \u2014 is likely to fuel signs of growing internal rancor in her campaign and complaints by Democrats that her message as a progressive who gets results is no match for Sanders\u2019 heady demands for a political revolution, which has inspired younger Democratic voters. The loss was especially rough because New Hampshire has long been kind to the Clintons. It\u2019s the state that made Bill Clinton the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d in 1992. And Hillary Clinton beat Barack Obama there in 2008, salvaging her campaign after a third-place showing in Iowa. Trump, relishing a victory that restored luster to his claim to be one of life\u2019s perpetual winners, which lost some sheen after his second in Iowa, took to the stage at his victory party with a beaming smile and a thumbs-up after defying doubters who had questioned whether he can turn stellar poll numbers into actual votes. \u201cWow, wow, wow,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to make America great again!\u201d He spoke in unusually personal terms about his family during his acceptance speech. The real estate mogul\u2019s win is likely to send shudders through the Republican establishment, which fears his explosive rhetoric targeting women, Mexicans and Muslims could hamper the GOP\u2019s chances of appealing to a general-election audience. A hoarse but jubilant Sanders proclaimed his victory to be the result of a \u201chuuuuge\u201d turnout. His emphatic performance will now propel him into a nationwide battle against Clinton as he attempts to shatter the firewall among ethnically diverse voters that she has built in South Carolina and other Southern states. \u201cTonight, we have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, from Maine to California,\u201d he said, before predicting that the race against Clinton was going to quickly get even more contentious. \u201cThey are throwing everything at me except the kitchen sink and I have the feeling that the kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well,\u201d he said. Clinton appeared in her concession speech to be trying to co-opt Sanders\u2019 message about an economy stacked against the middle class. \u201cNow we take this campaign to the entire country. We are going to fight for every vote in every state,\u201d she said, foreshadowing a long fight for the nomination that she was once expected to win easily. \u201cPeople have every right to be angry. But they are also hungry. They are hungry for solutions,\u201d she said, adding that she wanted to rein in Wall Street. \u201cBut I know how to do it,\u201d Clinton said, implying that Sanders\u2019 calls for a revolution were unrealistic. At 11:15 pm ET, with 75% of Republican votes counted, Trump had 34%. Kasich had 16% and Cruz, Bush and Rubio were tied at 11%. Chris Christie may have hurt Rubio but he didn\u2019t do much to help himself and was trailing at 8%. The somber New Jersey governor said he would return home to consider his position, but there was every indication his White House race is now at an end. On the Democratic side, Sanders led Clinton 60% to 39%. His gaping margin of victory dwarfed the few tenths of one percent by which the former secretary of state prevailed in the Iowa caucuses last week. The tightly bunched race behind Trump on the Republican side set up an intriguing clash between Rubio, Kasich and Bush in the next battleground of South Carolina, which favors a much more hard-knuckle brand of politics than New Hampshire. Kasich declared that something \u201cbig happened\u201d in New Hampshire that could give him the chance to expand his campaign across the country. The Ohio governor will especially eye Northern and Midwestern states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Illinois, where he message could resonate \u2014 if he can stay in the race that long. How John Kasich might be able to catch Trump \u201cThere is magic in the air with this campaign,\u201d Kasich said. It was also a good night for Cruz, who was on course to finish third in a state that is much less less receptive to his social conservatism than Iowa. A chastened Rubio admitted that his debate performance on Saturday in which he was roasted by Christie for repeatedly reciting sound bites was to blame for his disappointing showing. \u201cI did not do well on Saturday night,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will never happen again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Manu Raju contributed to this report",

Reality Check: Clinton on Sanders\u2019 gun control votes By Chip Grabow, Sonam Vashi As in past debates, Hillary Clinton took on Bernie Sanders\u2019 voting record on gun control legislation. Thursday night, it came up regarding a debate over who is the true \u201cprogressive candidate.\u201d Clinton said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get into labels, I don\u2019t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times. I don\u2019t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity,\u201d referring to Sanders\u2019 voting record. So, regarding the Brady Bill, what is Sanders\u2019 record? As the CNN Reality Check team has reported before, Sanders did vote against various iterations of the 1993 Brady Bill five times. The bill\u2019s full name is the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and it mandates federal background checks on gun purchasers. There were several votes in that bill\u2019s evolution, the first vote coming in 1991. Sanders voted against a draft that required a seven-day waiting period for background checks. A subsequent version of the bill returned to the House and Sanders voted against it. Then, in 1993, two more drafts returned to the House, and Sanders voted against those. Finally, later in 1993, the Brady Bill finally passed, but without Sanders\u2019 vote. Sanders has defended his votes, saying that it constituted federal overreach. \u201cThere are parts of it that made sense to me,\u201d he said in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\u201d last month. Sanders added, \u201cLook George, if you have a small gun shop owner in Northern Vermont who sells a gun legally to somebody and then, you know, something happens to that guy, he goes nuts or something, and he kills somebody, should the gun shop owner be held liable? I think not.\u201d Sanders also added, \u201cI am absolutely willing, as I\u2019ve said for many, many weeks, if not months, to take another look at that piece of legislation.\u201d Though Sanders may have his reasons for voting against the Brady Bill, Clinton\u2019s claim that he voted against it five times is true. Reality Check: Clinton and Wall Street By Chip Grabow, CNN The topic of big money influencing American politics was raised by Sanders, who said it was \u201cundermining American democracy.\u201d Clinton attempted to distance herself from perceptions her campaign is influenced by Wall Street interests, saying, \u201cI think the best evidence that the Wall Street people, at least, know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.\u201d It was a refrain she used in Wednesday night\u2019s town hall, too: \u201cEverybody that I know who looks at what\u2019s happening in this campaign sees the same thing: The Wall Street interests, the money interests, the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me.\u201d Wall Street interests may be spending a lot in support of her opponents, but of all the candidates, Clinton is the leading recipient of donations from individuals in the securities and investments industry. According to OpenSecrets.org, as of January 31, Clinton has received $2.9 million in itemized contributions from a category the Federal Election Commission calls \u201cSecurities and Investments,\u201d often shorthanded as \u201cWall Street.\u201d That\u2019s the most of any of the candidates. Republican Jeb Bush is just behind Clinton, receiving $2.4 million, with Marco Rubio ($1.3 million) and Ted Cruz ($664,000) following. Clinton implies that Wall Street has no fondness for her. But given that her campaign received $2.9 million from securities and investment donors, the most of all the candidates, Republican or Democrat, our verdict is false. Reality Check: Clinton on Sanders\u2019 $1 trillion health care plan By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Clinton accused Sanders of not telling voters the truth about his proposals, particularly his Medicare-for-all plan. \u201cI am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost. A respected health economist said these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year. I\u2019m not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes and not mean it,\u201d Clinton said. Actually, according to that health economist, Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Sanders\u2019 universal health care plan would cost nearly $1.4 trillion a year. RELATED: 5 unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan But Sanders has recently been upfront about how much it will cost. He released Friedman\u2019s assessment alongside his plan for Medicare-for-all last month. Also, Sanders has acknowledged that the plan calls for a new 2.2% income tax on all Americans and a 6.2% levy on employers, as well as additional taxes on the wealthy. The Vermont senator, however, argues that ultimately middle class Americans will save money under his health plan because they will no longer pay premiums to private insurers. RELATED: What\u2019s behind the Clinton-Sanders health care fight? That said, Sanders initially was reluctant to spell out his proposal. Clinton pushed him earlier this year to release the details, pointing out that she pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class. Sanders finally unveiled the plan a few hours before a Democratic debate last month. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Clinton on classified information in her emails By Laura Koran, CNN Clinton claimed she \u201cnever sent or received any classified material\u201d when she was secretary of state, and the State Department is \u201cretroactively classifying\u201d information in her emails. It is true that all the classifications we\u2019ve seen in emails released by the State Department have been retroactive, meaning the State Department determined there was a need to classify the information as they were preparing the emails for release and so they \u201cupgraded\u201d it to classified. The State Department also maintains that none of Clinton\u2019s official emails (of the 85% reviewed and released so far) contained information that was marked as classified when it was sent. However, last week, the State Department acknowledged it had launched a separate review to determine whether any information in the email was classified at the time it was sent and received. That review, led by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and Research, is ongoing and has yet to put out a verdict on the issue. All of the classified redactions the public has seen so far have been the result of retroactive classifications, but the investigation into whether the information was classified during her time in office is ongoing. For that reason, our verdict is it\u2019s complicated. Reality check: Sanders on his role writing Obamacare By Kevin Liptak, CNN During a back-and-forth about health care, Sanders pointed to his role in Congress during the creation of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI am on the Health, Education, Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea that I would dismantle health care in America while we\u2019re waiting to pass a Medicare-for-all is just not accurate,\u201d Sanders said, adding later: \u201cI helped write that bill, but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.\u201d Sanders did indeed sit on the Senate panel that helped craft the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and used his post to advocate loudly for a single-payer system in which insurance is provided by the government to all citizens. Sanders wasn\u2019t alone; many liberal Democrats pushed for such a provision when crafting comprehensive health care reform. But the single-payer option proved to be divisive, and opposed by most Republicans. That led to the development of alternative mechanisms to get more Americans insured: the establishment of marketplaces for Americans to purchase health insurance, and an individual mandate requiring all Americans obtain coverage. When Sanders\u2019 preferred version of the bill failed to come up for a vote, he diverted his focus instead to securing the inclusion of billions of dollars in funding to community health centers. But he remained skeptical of a bill that didn\u2019t include a single-payer plan. Indeed, in the months leading up to a final vote on the bill, Sanders voiced doubt that he could support the version that lacked such a system (ultimately, he did vote for the Affordable Care Act). While Sanders played a major role in the debate over health care reform, and helped craft an $11 billion inclusion into the final measure, his claim to have \u201chelped write\u201d the measure misrepresents his part in creating the central pillars of Obamacare. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Sanders as the longest serving independent in the history of Congress By Ryan Browne, CNN Sanders, a Vermont independent, stressed his longevity and independence on Thursday when he said, \u201cI am the longest serving independent in the history of the United States Congress.\u201d Sanders was first elected to the House of Representatives as an independent from Vermont in 1990 and assumed office in January 1991. He won his Vermont Senate seat in 2006. As a result, although he caucuses with the Democratic Party, Sanders has been an independent in Congress for 25 years. This 25-year tenure is indeed the longest of an independent member of Congress. According to the Senate\u2019s official record, the two runner-ups are Sen. Harry F. Byrd of Virginia and Sen. David Davis of Illinois. Byrd was first elected to the House in 1932 as a Democrat. He entered the Senate in 1965 and switched parties to become an independent in 1970 after a clash with the Democratic Party leadership in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election. He left office in 1983, giving him 13 years as an independent. Unlike Byrd, Davis, who had been an associate justice of the Supreme Court and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln, initially assumed office as an independent in 1877 and left office in 1883, giving him six years in Congress as an independent. Sanders\u2019 25 years in Congress is easily the longest span as an independent. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Sanders on the major banks By: Kate Grise and Tami Luhby, CNN Sanders threw an elbow at some of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions. \u201cSix financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion, equivalent to 58% of the (gross domestic product) of the United States of America. That is a lot of money,\u201d Sanders said. The six largest financial institutions are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as of September 2015, according to the Federal Reserve Bank. Their assets total close to $10 trillion ($9,845,804,000,000). So, doing the math: $9,845,804,000,000 (assets) / $18,128,200,000,000 (GDP) =.5431 Accordingly, the assets of the six largest institutions equal roughly 54% of the GDP. We rate Sanders\u2019 claim as true. Reality Check: Sanders \u2018endorsed\u2019 by New Hampshire newspaper By Tom LoBianco, CNN Asked by MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow why his campaign put up an ad insinuating that he was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph, Sanders said that his campaign was careful never to say he was \u201cendorsed\u201d by a newspaper. \u201cAs I understand it, we did not suggest we had the endorsement of the newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper, endorsed us that did not. What we did say is, \u2018Blah blah blah blah\u2019 was said by the newspaper,\u201d Sanders said. The ad, an online spot entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d showed a blurb from the Telegraph praising his integrity, but the ad did not say the paper endorsed him. However, in the next clip, the ad said that The Valley News of Lebanon, New Hampshire, \u201cendorsed\u201d Sanders. That paper did not endorse Sanders. The Clinton campaign and fact-checkers hit him throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday for the spot and the Sanders campaign eventually revised the ad to remove the \u201cendorsed\u201d language. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Sanders on Koch-funded veterans group By Lisa Rose, CNN Discussing the need for reforms improving access to care at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Sanders said that a group funded by the Koch brothers is promoting the privatization of the agency. An organization called Concerned Veterans for America is sanctioned by the influential conservative siblings, Sanders said. Wayne Gable, CVA\u2019s chief executive and trustee, is also a board member of a Koch-backed organization called Freedom Partners, according to a 2013 tax filing. That filing lists CVA as the business name of an affiliated organization called Vets for Economic Freedom Trust. The filing states the tax exempt group had $3 million in contributions and a nearly equal amount of expenditures, money allegedly spent advocating for \u201cpolicies that will preserve the freedom and liberty that veterans and their families so proudly fought and sacrificed to defend.\u201d The group produced an anti-Obamacare web video in 2013, \u201cGovernment Health Care Equals Disaster,\u201d suggesting that the scandal at the VA was a prelude to a looming disaster prompted by the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, the CVA has a glossy, yet glitchy website and there is not much documentation of the group\u2019s financials and its staff post-2013. According to the Guidestar charity finder, the organization has not yet filed its IRS 990 form for 2014. Furthermore, its affiliated group, Vets for Economic Freedom Trust is not a verified exempt organization, according to the IRS exempt check search tool. In terms of privatizing the VA, the group has a report called the Veterans Independence Act on its website, recommending a voucher system for veterans to purchase insurance through private companies. We\u2019d like to learn more about the plan but the \u201cRead the Report\u201d link at the bottom of the page is dead. Sanders is correct in describing the group\u2019s Koch lineage and its intent. Our verdict is true. CNN\u2019s David Siegel, Chad Weaver and Justin Gamble contributed to this report.",

Pelosi gave a nod to the single-payer health care model, saying it was \u201ca very popular idea\u201d but said Democrats came together on another approach with Obamacare and touted that 18 million more Americans now have health insurance because of the law. But then Pelosi took another pointed swipe at Sanders\u2019 plan, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s no use having a conversation about something that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Pelosi told reporters the enthusiasm for the Democratic field, embodied in the large numbers attending campaign rallies, is a positive sign for those down ballot, and even raised the prospects of winning back the House in 2016 \u2013 something few political analysts, or even Democrats, believe is within reach. Vermont Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, who hasn\u2019t endorsed any candidate, told CNN that Hillary Clinton has \u201cdeep roots\u201d and strong support inside the Democratic caucus and \u201cthere is a lot of amazement in how well Sanders has done.\u201d On Sanders\u2019 self-identification as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d and how that would be viewed by the electorate outside Vermont, Welch admitted, \u201cthat\u2019s a real question mark.\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, who is a Hillary Clinton supporter, told reporters that Sanders has tapped into \u201cthe struggle\u201d of the middle class. That message, along with that of the other Democratic candidates\u2019 focus on jobs and wages, is in contrast to the \u201csideshow and a circus and nothing but name-calling\u201d on the Republican side. Welch said other House Democrats are just starting to realize the size of Sanders\u2019 following and thinks that the gathering in Baltimore will be the first chance for members to huddle to hash out what it could mean for their own electoral prospects. Welch admitted, \u201cany talk about taxes makes politicians nervous.\u201d But he also emphasized Sanders is connecting with younger voters and that if the party is going to do well in November, it needs to bring those voters to the polls.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders told CNN's Chris Cuomo Monday night that he would raise taxes to pay for his universal health care plan Since Walter Mondale, Democrats have generally campaigned on protecting the middle class and raising taxes on the rich It had been more than 30 years since a Democratic presidential candidate said he\u2019d raise taxes on all Americans. Walter Mondale had been the last. In 1984, accepting his party\u2019s nomination he said: \u201cTaxes will go up \u2026\u2009 It must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won\u2019t tell you. I just did.\u201d It didn\u2019t work out so well for Mondale, who was trounced in that election by President Ronald Reagan. Ever since then, Democratic candidates have been scared to broach the topic, said Joseph Thorndike, a historian with Tax Analysts, which publishes tax information. Until Monday night, when Bernie Sanders told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that he would raise taxes to pay for his universal health care plan. \u201cWe will raise taxes. Yes we will,\u201d Sanders said at the Democratic Town Hall, explaining that Americans would ultimately save money because they\u2019d no longer pay private insurance premiums. READ: Hours before debate, Sanders releases Medicare-for-all plan Sanders\u2019 health care plan calls for raising income taxes by 2.2%. In addition, to pay for at least 12 weeks of family and medical leave, he\u2019d boost payroll taxes by $1.61 a week for the typical worker. \u201cSanders is the first to say government is good and it\u2019s worth paying for,\u201d Thorndike said. He is \u201cbreaking the mold of Democratic candidates.\u201d Since Mondale, Democrats have generally campaigned on protecting the middle class and raising taxes on the rich. President Bill Clinton said he\u2019d rather cut spending than hike taxes on Middle America. President Barack Obama promised he would increase the levy on the rich. Republicans, meanwhile, typically say they will cut taxes for all to spur economic growth, and their plans often give hefty breaks to the wealthy. The question remains whether Sanders can convince voters that the government is worth funding. So far, Sanders is doing better than many had expected. A Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll conducted prior to the town hall showed him beating Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and tightening the race with her in Iowa.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton subtly charged Bernie Sanders with only offering voters with slogans and rhetoric, not concrete plans, on Tuesday night in Cedar Falls. After laying out her plans on college affordability, clean energy and taxes, Clinton said that she puts her plans on her website and cites how she is going to pay for each plan to prove to voters that she isn\u2019t offering empty promises. \u201cI do want you to know that I am not just shouting slogans, I am not just engaging in rhetoric,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI have thought this through, I have a plan.\u201d \u201cI want you to understand because I don\u2019t think you can get what we need done in this election nor in the presidency unless you level with people. You tell them what you can do and then you let them then respond to it,\u201d she added. The refrain was a shot against Sanders, who Clinton aides and advisers believe is promising pie-in-the-sky plans that he wouldn\u2019t be able to deliver on if he gets to the White House. Although Clinton does post many of her plans on the White House and her campaign has detailed how he plans to pay for them, so, too, has Sanders. His campaign has released a host of plans, including his plan to overhaul the health care system. Sanders and his aides have also released how their candidate will pay for his plans. \u201cWe will raise taxes, yes we will,\u201d Sanders told CNN on Monday night, a nod to his plan to raise taxes on both wealthy and middle class families for pay for his single payer plan. The Clinton knock is also reminiscent of a charge she made against Sanders after the first Democratic debate in October, when the former secretary of state said Sanders\u2019 accusation that she was \u201cshouting\u201d about gun control was actually a sexist comment. \u201cI\u2019m not shouting,\u201d Clinton said on the trail. \u201cIt\u2019s just that when women talk, some people think we\u2019re shouting.\u201d Clinton has vacillated between calling out Sanders by name and subtly hitting him in the run up to Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses. The former first lady has avoided hitting Sanders directly for much of the week, however, instead choosing to tout herself and her policies and only subtly knock the senator who is challenging her in Iowa and New Hampshire.",

The mobilization of his young army of admirers will help determine whether he\u2019s able to slow \u2013 or stop \u2013 Hillary Clinton\u2019s march to the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m not the hippest guy around,\u201d Sanders told CNN in an interview aboard his campaign bus. \u201cI have to freely admit that.\u201d Yet the 74-year-old Vermont senator has become one of the hippest candidates of the election cycle, at least in the digital world, where he\u2019s developed an unlikely following of young supporters. Poll: Clinton tops Sanders, but lead shrinks \u201cBernie Sanders is America\u2019s uncle,\u201d Jake Hoyng, 17, who was drawn to Sanders by some of his friends. He intends to caucus for Sanders next Monday in Iowa, which is allowed because he will be 18 by Election Day in November. It\u2019s an open question how many young voters like Hoyng, particularly in the 17-to-25 age range that Sanders is targeting, will take part in the Iowa caucuses. The campaign is trying to rally supporters through a new website and advertising on Reddit, with a challenge to prove skeptics wrong: They say you don\u2019t care. They say you won\u2019t caucus. They say Bernie can\u2019t win. Prove them wrong. As he travels across the country, Sanders\u2019 crowds look far younger than that of other candidates, including Clinton\u2019s. In Iowa, the contrast is particularly stark, with Clinton drawing far older audiences. But those voters, traditionally, are far more reliable. The Sanders campaign launched a new push on Snapchat, running daily advertisements encouraging people to attend the caucuses and share their pictures with other supporters. The ads are targeted by geography, with only people in Iowa allowed to put the campaign messages over their photos or video. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging Snapchat to help us turn out young caucus-goers in Iowa who know Sen. Sanders is the best candidate to make college affordable, fight climate change and take on a corrupt political system,\u201d said Kenneth Pennington, the campaign\u2019s digital director. Sanders said he had little doubt his supporters would vote. \u201cYoung people are by nature idealistic,\u201d Sanders said in an interview. \u201cThey understand that something is wrong in this country when our middle class continues to decline and when they may end up with a lower standard of living than their parents. They want us to do something about it.\u201d It\u2019s supporters like Kailey Gray, a 20-year-old student at Drake University, who is fueling his rise. She volunteers night and day for Sanders at his headquarters in a crowded strip mall on the north side of Des Moines. \u201cA lot of young people are turned off by politicians because they don\u2019t exactly tell the truth all the time and flip flop around the issues,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou can just kind of tell when someone isn\u2019t sincere, but Bernie\u2019s been saying the same thing for decades and he doesn\u2019t sway on the issues. He really knows what\u2019s right and sticks to what he believes in even if it\u2019s not the most popular.\u201d 5 takeaways from the Democratic town hall If elected, Sanders would be the oldest president \u2013 nearly six years older than Ronald Reagan when he took office. He pledged Monday night to release his medical records before the Iowa caucuses. Sanders has aggressively campaigned on college campuses across Iowa. He often arrives to loud cheers, even after declaring awkward phrases like, \u201cGuess what youngins?\u201d His wife, Jane, who is often at his side on the campaign trail, marvels at his young following. \u201cWhen he was mayor he was popular among young people,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cHip, I never expected.\u201d",

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is in second place in the GOP race, among likely Republican caucus-goers, 37% to 26% Sanders, meanwhile, has opened up an eight-point lead over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, leading her in Iowa 51% to 43% Donald Trump holds a commanding lead in Iowa as Sen. Bernie Sanders takes control of the Democratic race in the critical first-in-the-nation voting state, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday. Trump leads Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is in second place in the GOP race, among likely Republican caucus-goers, 37% to 26%. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, is in third at 14%, the only other Republican in double digits. Ben Carson failed to register half of Rubio\u2019s support and is in fourth place at 6%. Sanders, meanwhile, has opened up an eight-point lead over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, leading her in Iowa 51% to 43% among likely Democratic presidential caucus-goers. READ THE RESULTS The sampling is key for both leaders: Only including voters who previously caucused in their party\u2019s most recent competitive caucus, Cruz is neck-and-neck with Trump, with 30% for Cruz to 28% for Trump. Rubio is steady at 16% in that sample. Of Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders, 55% to 38%. In December, Clinton led Sanders in the Hawkeye State by 18 points in CNN/ORC\u2019s polling, 54% to 36%. Sanders\u2019 lead is in part built on his economic policies. Democratic caucus-goers said they trust the Vermont senator over Clinton on the economy by 22 points, and 67% said they thought he would do more to help the middle class, as opposed to 30% who felt that way about Clinton. Clinton, a former secretary of state, led on foreign policy, garnering more trust by 40 points. She also was seen as more likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%. Meanwhile, likely Republican caucus-goers are more divided when it comes to who would best handle foreign policy, with Trump (27%), Rubio (26%) and Cruz (25%) in a virtual three-way split. On the question of which candidate better represents Republican values, 29% choose Cruz, 28% side with Trump and 15% favor Rubio. Cruz holds an edge as the one who would better handle social issues, however, with 29% to Trump\u2019s 18%, while 12% name Rubio, 10% Carson and 9% former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement of Trump came while the survey was in the field, but the sample size is not large enough to assess whether it made any difference in the race. CNN/ORC surveyed 2,002 Iowa adults by telephone Jan. 15 to Jan. 20, including 266 likely Republican presidential caucus-goers and 280 likely Democratic presidential caucus-goers. Both party samples have a margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Democratic debate dominated by disputes between Clinton, Sanders Clinton, Sanders are neck and neck in Iowa, New Hampshire polls Hillary Clinton embraced President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy on Sunday, seeking to halt a late surge by rival Bernie Sanders, as fierce clashes over guns, health care and Wall Street ripped through the Democratic presidential debate. With Sanders threatening to upset Clinton in the first two nominating contests next month, the former secretary of state sought to stall his momentum, puncture his progressive credentials and raise questions about whether the self-declared socialist has the skills and experience to be president. She used the final debate before voting starts in Iowa and New Hampshire to make a case to faithful supporters of Obama, who some Clinton allies worry might be shifting to Sanders. She\u2019ll need them to build a winning coalition capable of winning the Democratic nomination and mounting a successful race in the general election. \u201cI am going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the finance industry and getting results,\u201d Clinton said. READ: 6 takeaways from the Democratic debate Sanders, meanwhile, was far more comfortable in attacking Clinton than in his previous debate encounters, and the evening in Charleston, South Carolina, was notable more for personal clashes between the two of them rather than attacks on Republicans. He hit back at Clinton by insisting that Obama was his friend and took a swipe at Clinton over the lucrative months she spent on the speaking circuit after she left the State Department. NBC Democratic presidential debate in 90 seconds \u201cI don\u2019t take money from big banks, I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,\u201d Sanders said. But, for all the passion and raised voices, it seemed unlikely that either Clinton or Sanders changed the dynamic of their race, which has them fighting tooth and nail in the first two states. Recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire also show Clinton in an increasingly precarious position. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics survey had Clinton up just two points in the Hawkeye State last week. A survey by Monmouth University in the Granite State last week had Sanders ahead by 14 points. Clinton still holds a commanding lead over Sanders nationally. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll on Sunday showed Clinton leading Sanders 59% to 34%, with the third candidate in the race, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, at 2%. Clinton\u2019s strategy on Sunday involved clasping Obama as close as she could, ironically in a state where she clashed bitterly with the President during the 2008 campaign. Eight years later, African-American voters in the state could now provide a firewall against Sanders\u2019 rise. Clinton, Sanders disagree on support of President Obama She called the Affordable Care Act, \u201cone of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\u201d And she warned that Sanders\u2019 plan for a Medicare-for-all universal health care unveiled hours before the debate, which would hike taxes on the middle class, would reopen a bitter debate with Republicans and could endanger Obamacare. Clinton to Sanders: I'm not starting over on healthcare \u201cTo tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction,\u201d she said. Sanders was furious that after fighting for universal health care for decades, he was now being accused of sabotaging Obamacare. \u201cNo one is tearing this up, we\u2019re going to go forward,\u201d said Sanders, complaining that 29 million Americans still lacked health care. Clinton\u2019s decision to tie herself so closely to Obama could be a risky one if she wins the nomination and gets to take on the Republicans. While the President\u2019s approval ratings are very high among Democrats, a majority of Americans still disapprove of the job he is doing, so events in the economy and around the world could leave Clinton vulnerable by association with him. Clinton sought to undermine Sanders in the opening moments of the debate by attacking him in one of the few areas where she can get to his left \u2013 guns. She slammed her rival for voting \u201cwith the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times,\u201d and reeled off a list of occasions when she said the Vermont senator sided with gun manufacturers and gun rights backers in Congress. She also said she was glad that he had \u201creversed his position on immunity,\u201d after Sanders backed away from a 2005 vote that gave gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution. He announced Saturday that he supports a proposed bill to amend that vote. But Sanders hit back hard, arguing that he had a D-minus voting rating from the National Rifle Association and rejected her list of charges. READ: The debate as it happened \u201cI think that Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous,\u201d Sanders said. The exchange was a powerful moment, unfolding on a debate stage just a block from the Charleston, South Carolina, church where a self-proclaimed white supremacist went on a shooting rampage last year that left nine African-Americans dead. Sanders sought to catch Clinton off balance over the swift rise in his poll numbers over the last month, stirring fears among some Clinton supporters that history could be repeating itself, after her once \u201cinevitable\u201d 2008 Democratic primary campaign floundered when then-Sen. Obama won Iowa. Sanders pointed out that when the campaign started, \u201cshe was 50 points ahead of me.\u201d \u201cGuess what: In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very very close,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are running ahead of Secretary Clinton in terms of taking on my good friend, Donald Trump.\u201d Clinton hopes to use the debate to underscore her argument that she is the most electable Democrat, has the best experience required of a commander in chief and is more likely to beat a Republican in the general election. The former secretary of state touted her connections to African-American voters, who are crucial in the Palmetto State primary and could form a firewall for her should she lose the first two contests in early February. When asked whether African-American lives are seen as \u201ccheap,\u201d she responded, \u201cSadly, it\u2019s reality.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been heartbreaking and increasingly outraging to see stories of young men like Walter Scott who have been killed by police officers,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\u201d A former North Charleston, South Carolina, police officer was charged in Scott\u2019s shooting death. When the conversation turned to foreign policy in the second half of the debate, Clinton appeared more comfortable than Sanders, as would be expected for a former secretary of state. She said she was \u201cproud\u201d of the nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers implemented this weekend. She said she paved the way for it by getting punishing international sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic when she served as secretary of state. But she warned it would be wrong to move too quickly toward rapprochement with Tehran. \u201cWe have one good day over 36 years,\u201d Clinton said, after a week in which frenzied diplomacy resulted in the freeing of 10 U.S. Navy sailors captured by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps and a prisoner swap that saw four imprisoned Americans freed by Iran. Clinton stressed that she had a three-point plan to crush ISIS in Syria and Iraq and to end the brutal civil war in Syria. Seeking to hold his ground on foreign policy, Sanders, meanwhile, warned that it would be wrong to send more Americans into the \u201cquagmire of Syria\u201d and once again brought up the cautionary tale of the war in Iraq that Clinton, then a senator, voted to authorize in 2002. He said that another U.S. venture in the Middle East would be \u201can unmitigated disaster.\u201d READ: Hours before debate, Sanders releases Medicare-for-all plan Clinton defended her signature first-term Obama administration policy of resetting relations with Russia. That effort later sputtered when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in 2012 and took a harsh turn against the United States. She said with a smile that her relationship with Putin was \u201cinteresting\u201d but was about respect. Clinton warned that Putin was \u201clike many bullies\u201d who would take anything he could get before someone stood up to him. Once again, the debate was a frustrating experience for former Maryland Gov. Martin O \u2018Malley, who repeatedly complained that he was not getting equal time. An hour before the debate started, Sanders unveiled his long-awaited new health plan \u2013 a Medicare-for-all system that would be paid for by raising a series of taxes on the middle class. Clinton has previously questioned exactly how Sanders could make his plan add up. But Sanders aides argue that the tax increase people would face would be outweighed by the savings they would get under the system. A Clinton victory in November would, of course, mark the return of Bill Clinton to the White House. As the debate wound down, Clinton was asked if she would take advice from her husband. \u201cIt will start at the kitchen table,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will see where it goes from there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bill Clinton gave a Monday speech at the Nashua Community College in New Hampshire He has offered advice and helped fundraise behind the scenes for his wife's presidential campaign Bill Clinton made his speaking debut on the 2016 campaign trail Monday by telling voters about the softer side of his wife, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. In a speech at the Nashua Community College in New Hampshire, Clinton told stories about the early days of their relationship. \u201cI thought she was the most amazing person,\u201d he said, describing the two meeting and falling in love nearly 45 years ago. \u201cEverything she touched, she made better,\u201d he said. Clinton was less charitable toward the Republican presidential candidates. Though he didn\u2019t mention anyone by name, he said the entire field is \u201ckind of scary.\u201d Clinton\u2019s speech marked the beginning of what is expected to be a month-long drive to help his wife win the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. Though Hillary Clinton officially entered the presidential race in April 2015, her husband hasn\u2019t yet had a speaking role. Instead, he has mostly offered advice and helped fundraise behind the scenes. His decision to return to the campaign trail in New Hampshire is notable because that\u2019s the state that boosted his own campaign in 1992. Heading into the 2016 primary, Hillary Clinton is fending off a challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont. Bill Clinton on the trail: The good, the bad and the ugly Bill Clinton joked that he is out of place on the campaign trail in the current political climate. \u201cI don\u2019t fit anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m a happy grandfather. I\u2019m not mad at anybody.\u201d The former president, who President Barack Obama has dubbed the explainer-in-chief, was a controversial figure in Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign \u2013 when exit polls showed that particularly in states like South Carolina, his negative attacks on then-Sen. Obama could have had a net negative effect. In this campaign, Bill Clinton said, Hillary Clinton is pursuing \u201cpolitics that are inclusive enough to actually get something done.\u201d \u201cI think this election is about restoring broadly shared prosperity, rebuilding the middle class,\u201d Clinton said. He said his wife once excitedly came home explaining how she\u2019d found a human side of Tom DeLay, the former House Republican leader and nemesis of Democrats whom she\u2019d discovered was also an adoptive parent. Monday\u2019s nearly 30-minute speech came in front of an audience of about 720 people in the community college\u2019s gym, according to Nashua\u2019s fire marshal. Clinton\u2019s arrival is not a guaranteed success, and Republicans \u2013 including Chris Christie who was also in New Hampshire Monday \u2013 attacked Clinton as \u201cgoing backward.\u201d And GOP front-runner Donald Trump has recently revived Clinton\u2019s past scandals \u2013 including Monica Lewinsky \u2013 as a way to attack the Clintons.",

Julian Zelizer: Trump has a chance to make good on promise to defy Washington norms President-elect will need to work on achieving the bipartisan deals that eluded Obama Donald Trump loves to imagine himself as the best dealmaker in America. But many Democrats are not buying it. When they look at the new White House, they see little room for finding common ground. The President-elect ran a campaign that was antithetical to their party values, in addition to, they believe, consistently lying and spreading falsehoods. And now he has assembled a right-wing cabinet, which makes many Democrats\u2019 skin crawl. One option for Trump is to simply ignore the Democrats altogether. Given that he has a united government, and since Senate Democrats can no longer filibuster non-Supreme Court judicial and cabinet appointments, there will be strong incentives to do so. He can put aside all his campaign rhetoric about wanting to break through Washington\u2019s gridlock and just govern from the right. (Notably, the Republicans are also now in control of 32 state legislatures and 33 governors, and they will be defending far fewer seats in the 2018 midterm elections than Democrats, so Trump\u2019s conservative mandate could be even greater if he so chooses.) But if he wants to make good on his promise to defy Washington convention, he should adequately address partisan polarization. In other words, Trump should channel his inner dealmaker and try to achieve the kind of bipartisan deals that eluded President Barack Obama, despite his high approval ratings. The most important policy statement that the incoming administration could make would be a clear and firm commitment that it will not do anything to compromise Social Security and Medicare, two signature measures for the Democratic Party. While Trump promised several times on the campaign trail that he had no interest in touching these popular programs, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has been making noise that he wants to go after these policies. If Trump takes a stand right now, stating that he will not support Ryan\u2019s proposals, he might win some Senate Democratic support for his cabinet appointments. Report: Bannon pushing trillion-dollar infrastructure plan But this would not be enough. He needs to show with his feet, and not just his mouth, that he is serious about making deals. The most important step that he could take is to allow Democrats to present a new version of an infrastructure stimulus that would create jobs and boost spending for blue collar and middle class Americans. Trump\u2019s current proposal doesn\u2019t please many Democrats since it would primarily provide tax relief to private contractors as a means of lowering the cost of financing the program, not offer public jobs to America\u2019s workers. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders, has offered a plan of his own, revolving around $1 trillion in direct spending on projects. Letting congressional Democrats do the initial drafting work on a bill, and then making a deal from within the framework that they establish would be appealing, even for opponents who fundamentally don\u2019t trust him. Obama puts Trump on the spot with Russia sanctions The final step Trump could take to build some goodwill with Democrats would be to join the bipartisan drive to investigate whether Russia launched a cyberattack during the presidential election. Thus far, Trump\u2019s reaction has been almost entirely defensive. He has questioned the intelligence agencies producing this data, and he has distanced himself from Republicans like Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham who are demanding immediate and swift action. But Trump can still reverse course, demonstrating to Democrats that he is serious about protecting America\u2019s political institutions and throwing his support behind the establishment of a select committee to investigate Russian interference. President Obama has now put new sanctions into place as a retaliation for Russia\u2019s actions. Rather than just saying it\u2019s time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the hacking scandal, he can demonstrate that he is serious about using sanctions \u2013 peace through strength \u2013 until there are assurances that Russia will desist from engaging in these kinds of attacks again.  The odds of Trump doing any of these three options are low. From the moment he won the general election, he has towed the Republican Party line \u2013 except on the issue of Russia. He has done little to appeal to Democrats, and he has only continued with the incendiary partisan rhetoric of the campaign. But when it comes to Trump, one can never make assumptions. Perhaps in the lead up to the inauguration he will want to show that some of the skills he is always boasting about can actually be put into effect. That would be the biggest surprise of all.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. America enters 2017 divided, with major questions hovering over Trump presidency, writes Julian Zelizer One side fears consequences of Trump presidency, the other has grand expectations of positive change, he writes It\u2019s a safe bet that 2017 will be a year for the history books. In the world of politics, we have not seen anything like this in recent memory, or maybe ever. Donald Trump rocked the U.S. with an election victory that almost nobody saw coming. His campaign, his persona, his style, and his rhetoric were unlike anything else that we have seen from a mainstream political candidate, let alone a victor. After such a turbulent year, it\u2019s not easy to say where America is headed. But here are a number of major political issues that could well dominate 2017: If there was one big issue that came out front and center in this election, it is the fact that middle class Americans are struggling. Even though the economic indicators are good, many Americans families don\u2019t feel that their future is secure. They look at the growing economic divide between the rich and the poor, fearing that they and their children will fall down the bottom rung of the latter. They are doing much better in terms of employment and income than they were a few years ago, but the kinds of jobs they enjoy seem less stable than in the heyday of unions, with fewer benefits and worse prospects for upward mobility. With rising education and health care costs, they worry about how their kids will do. This issue animated the supporters of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. The economic anxiety drove millions of voters to choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, believing that a fundamental change to the status quo is now essential if their communities are ever going to be rebuilt. Whatever divisions exist between the parties, there is in fact common ground on this basic problem. The question will be whether the Trump administration decides to act on these concerns, and to do so in a way that could allow Democrats to give him their support. While there are certain issues where Trump will clearly stick to the Republican playbook, such as supply side tax cuts, there are other areas such as infrastructure where there is the possibility for a deal. The key will be that the infrastructure package can\u2019t be a series of tax cuts for private projects, as Trump has thus far suggested, but rather needs to be the kind of stimulus spending that will provide workers with good jobs. It is now time to thoroughly revamp our counterterrorism policy. In the wake of ISIS, the United States and the world has increasingly been facing the troubling threat of a dispersed terrorist network that depends on lone wolves who commit horrendous acts in their name. The kinds of attacks that we are now seeing might be considered attacks on \u201csoft targets,\u201d such as holiday markets and nightclubs, that usually are not the focus of concerted security operations. Furthermore, the terrorism is often committed by deranged individuals who have proclaimed their unity with ISIS even if they have little if any direct connection.  As a nation and as an international community we have failed to put into place an effective strategy to combat these threats. We need to rethink our security measures and develop a better way to flag individuals who might be problematic. We also need to direct our security operations toward soft targets and not simply major tourist sites. Until we do so, we will be living on the perpetual edge. The question of whether our democratic institutions can withstand a Trump presidency have been raised by many of his loudest critics. Independent candidate Evan McMullin has been at the front of the pack, writing a number of important pieces warning that he sees autocratic and totalitarian tendencies in the new president that can threaten the freedom of the press, other civil liberties, and more. Trump\u2019s expansive understanding of executive power will put the other branches of government on alert, and in a defensive position. Conservatives who have been blasting Democrats about too much government interference in the economy have winced as the president has lashed out against specific businesses and started to warn that if they move their plants overseas he will take punitive action against individual companies. Trump's business shutters 3 overseas projects His refusal so far to take sweeping steps to eliminate the potential conflicts of interest that exist with his business empire has raised alarms about whether this president will make big decisions about domestic and foreign policy with his eye on his family\u2019s bottom line rather than what is in the best interest of the nation. Although complaints about excessive executive power and the abuse of authority are a perennial in politics, the genuine concerns about the health of our democratic institutions today are more intense than at any time in recent memory. US journalism can legitimately be viewed as in a state of crisis. This past year exposed a number of structural, professional and technological challenges that are shaking the core of this industry. The commercial pressures facing most major news organizations on television and in print has often led to the pursuit of stories that might not be worthy of so much attention but which do guarantee lots of eyeballs. Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying \"sources said,\" DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies! We have an incoming administration that will clearly challenge the press in a way we have not seen since President Richard Nixon and his Vice President Spiro Agnew went after the \u201cnattering nabobs of negativism\u201d by withholding information from reporters and avoiding as much direct contact as possible. Social media affords Trump an opportunity to reach his followers while bypassing mainstream media. Trump doesn\u2019t hesitate to directly attack journalists, as he has done via Twitter, in a toxic social media environment that stimulates fierce attacks from his followers. The phenomenon of fake news and the willingness of political actors to say things that are patently untrue will force reporters to figure out how to handle this kind of information while adhering to high-level professional standards. All of the challenges have been brewing for some time now; they are not an invention of 2016. But this election brought them all to the forefront of national debate and, for some, revealed the dangerous consequences this era of journalism can produce. Although many Republicans are acting as if they can move swiftly past the underside of the recent Republican campaign, they can\u2019t. Ignoring the vitriol from the past year grossly minimizes the very dark forces that emerged throughout Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Through his polemical and controversial statements, Trump mobilized some of the most reactionary elements of the electorate. His own words about illegal immigrants being \u201crapists and murderers,\u201d his sexist invectives, his broadsides against the entire religion of Islam and his hesitance to disassociate himself from people like David Duke energized fringe groups of Americans who have been angry about the pluralistic direction of America society since the 1960s. Trump: Deplorables have mellowed out Just because the campaign is over and Trump is switching to \u201cgovernance\u201d mode doesn\u2019t mean that all the voters and organizations energized by his campaign will go away. They liked Trump because they believed he was their candidate, and they are expecting him to deliver. You can\u2019t play around with those political passions for political purposes and then assume they are forgotten. Whether Democrats and Republicans can push back on these forces will be an essential part of the upcoming year. As fearmongers have discovered in the past, it is often impossible to reverse the damage that these campaigns have wrought. The uptick in hate crimes that has followed the election could be just a taste of things to come. This will be an urgent matter for the losing party. The Democrats were really slammed in this election. With united government, Republicans can now make immense changes if they stay on the same page. It\u2019s not clear that Democrats know what they should do. Some of them feel they need to cooperate with the administration, looking to possible areas of agreement. Others are dead set against any proposals to work with Trump given what he represents and the radical threat that he, his Cabinet, and the Republican Congress pose to the social safety net. They have seen how Republicans have done well politically by being obstructionist throughout Obama\u2019s presidency. And now they feel that there is no reason that they can\u2019t do the same. On GPS: Debating U.S.-Iran relations The battle over who should direct the Democratic National Committee has turned into a debate about who has the best vision for rebuilding the electoral and organizational muscle of Democrats after they have suffered so many blows since 2010 with more and more of the political map looking red. Democrats will have to start making some big decisions about how to respond in the first few months of the New Year. The earliest battle might be when Trump puts an infrastructure bill forward. They will also have to decide how to respond if President Trump uses executive power to start to undo the progress that President Obama made on core issues like climate change, perhaps by walking away from the Paris Agreement, or on criminal justice reform relating to sentencing. The possibility of expanded military conflict may have increased with the outcome of the election. President-elect Trump is someone who does not mind being provocative and has made some extremely hawkish statements about how he plans to take on threats like ISIS, although at times he has sounded an isolationist theme and spoken out against nation-building. Within a few days of winning office, he took a call from the leader of Taiwan, a clear blow to the \u201cone China\u201d policy that the US has followed since the 1970s, and Trump continued the theme with blistering tweets about the last remaining communist superpower. He is supportive of a Russian government that can easily create explosive situations around the globe. There are also many people who have his ear, such as National Security Adviser Mike Flynn and possible Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton, who may be willing to use military force as a first resort. Will the abundance of generals in the Cabinet lead to a preference for using military force over diplomacy? We are already living in heated times. The civil war in Syria has led to a humanitarian disaster that is not likely to end anytime soon. An emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin will throw more support behind the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. These existing conflicts, with a US president who has even bolder visions about who he would be willing to take on, leaves the world sitting with bated breath to see what comes next.  The most important concrete issue that will be on the table is the Iran nuclear deal. Although this deal was extremely controversial when put into place, it has now become operationalized. Even critics like Gen.  James Mattis, the nominee for Secretary of Defense, don\u2019t think it is possible to reverse. But if Trump uses his executive power to undo the deal, this would be the first clear sign that we are moving closer to a dangerous war with Iran. America enters 2017 divided, with one side fearing the consequences of a Trump presidency and the other with grand expectations that we are about to embark on a period of positive change. We will soon find out who\u2019s right.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James Pethokoukis is an economic policy analyst and the DeWitt Wallace Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The views expressed here are his own. James Pethokoukis: If Trump plans to micromanage companies, it's a very big deal With tweets and interference, Trump is sending the opposite of a pro-business message, he writes Every hour, thousands of Americans leave jobs or start new ones. From that perspective, Donald Trump\u2019s nudging and pressuring to save some 800 jobs at Carrier from being shipped to Mexico is trivial \u2013 other than to the workers themselves. But if Trump is going to keep up these micromanaging moves, even when he\u2019s kicking back in the Oval Office, then it\u2019s a very big deal. And this could be a troubling, even chilling, development. Already Trump has moved on from Carrier to another Indiana manufacturing firm, tweeting, \u201cRexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!\u201d Think about what Trump is telling company bosses across America: Open a factory overseas and maybe President Trump will send a nasty tweet telling America to avoid your products. Or perhaps your parent company will lose a government contract. (Such a thought may have flashed through the minds of executives at United Technologies, Carrier\u2019s corporate parent.) Worst-case scenario: Your products will face Trump\u2019s big, fat tax when you ship them back into the country. Making a decent profit anytime is hard. Indeed, more American companies are dying than starting these days. Now imagine having to make products in a way that pleases your customers and the President of the United States. And think about one American company after another, year after year, attempting such a juggling act. It\u2019s hardly a recipe for a prosperous and dynamic US economy. What to expect on Obamacare, taxes and spending under Trump The economic case for trade is an old one, but Trump\u2019s election does nothing to invalidate it. America should specialize in and sell to other nations what we produce relatively efficiently. And we should buy from other countries what we produce relatively inefficiently. Moreover, as companies compete, they are forced to become more innovative or else lose ground. The results are more productive companies, more productive workers, and higher living standards overall for the nations on both sides of these trading relationships. For all Trump\u2019s bad-mouthing of the US economy, it remains the most innovative in the world and one that constantly pushes the technological frontier. And a big reason for this is that it is open to new ideas, talent and competition. No wonder our research suggests that big trade deficits are associated with higher employment, not less. A recent survey of top economists asked whether it was smart to slap import duties on products such as air conditioners or cars to encourage producers to make them in the United States. All of them either \u201cdisagreed\u201d or \u201cdisagreed strongly.\u201d As one economist put it, \u201cNo. Just no.\u201d Even the North American Free Trade agreement \u2013 the one trade deal Trump seems most fixated on \u2013 has produced net gains when it comes to productivity, wages, output and consumer spending for American citizens. Open trade, top Obama White House economist Jason Furman said in 2015, is \u201cone of several tools that we can use to promote long-term growth in productivity and middle-class incomes.\u201d We may live in a \u201cpost-fact\u201d era, but these facts and analyses are hard to ignore. Trump will continue to rewrite the rules of presidency -- brace yourself But it\u2019s also hard to ignore \u2013 or at least it should be \u2013 the plight of workers hurt by trade. And this seems especially to be the case from the \u201cChina trade shock\u201d of the 2000s. Many communities hit hard by offshoring never really recovered. But the answer isn\u2019t to keep companies from leaving. For starters, that would only hasten the rise of the robots, which already accounts for most of the job loss in manufacturing. A better way forward would be to increase the economy\u2019s level of dynamism and competitive intensity, while also updating the safety net for workers. We need to constantly be generating new kinds of high-wage jobs \u2013 tax and regulatory reform would help \u2013 as the old ones move elsewhere or are automated away to Robot Land. At the same time, if the jobs aren\u2019t where a displaced US worker lives, then government may have a role in helping them get to a city where the jobs are. Only half as many Americans move from state to state as they did a generation ago. The government can help increase mobility by funding relocation subsidies for the long-term unemployed living in depressed labor markets. Of course, workers have a responsibility to make sure they are preparing themselves to prosper in a modern, technologically advanced economy with no promise of lifetime employment at any one firm.  Fostering a dynamic economy is a messy business for management, workers and government alike. As the transition hurtles forward, lots of people are worried Trump will continue to manipulate government to his company\u2019s interest even once he\u2019s in office. But the bigger worry is that he will continue to manipulate other people\u2019s companies. So far, he\u2019s sending the very opposite of a pro-business message: Before a company makes a big business decision, it had better consider how Washington might react.",

Gayle Tzemach Lemmon: Longest US war was virtually invisible during presidential campaign But for first time, military leader of post-9/11 wars looks poised to lead Pentagon, she says Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to become his secretary of defense means that America\u2019s forgotten wars are finally being remembered, at least for a while. For the second time in a row, America\u2019s longest war has been virtually invisible in the national conversation surrounding a presidential election. In 2012 and 2016, neither main party candidate wanted to discuss the fight in Afghanistan. And there was also little said about the future of US engagement in Iraq, aside from how it related to the battle against ISIS. It is as if the post-9/11 wars are now simply a kind of grim mood music for a conversation over the nation\u2019s future that has turned dark and full of concern. But that could be set to change. For the first time, one of the early military leaders of the post-9/11 wars looks poised to lead the Pentagon \u2013 this time, as a civilian. The choice marks a break with America\u2019s tradition of civilian leadership of the military \u2013 the National Security Act of 1947 stated: \u201cThat a person who has within ten years been on active duty as a commissioned officer in a Regular component of the armed services shall not be eligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.\u201d (Congress reduced this exclusion to seven in 2008.) But if confirmed, Mattis \u2013 who will never have forgotten those charged with doing the fighting in the post-9/11 wars \u2013 would force Americans to confront these conflicts at a time when the United States has done a good job forgetting to feel like a country at war. In his book \u201cThe Generals,\u201d Tom Ricks quotes Nate Fick, then a young Marine officer, talking about finding Mattis in a fighting hole on the front lines in Afghanistan. \u201cNo one would have questioned Mattis if he\u2019d slept eight hours each night in a private room, to be woken each morning by an aide who ironed his uniforms and heated his MREs. But there he was, in the middle of a freezing night, out on the lines with his Marines,\u201d Fick is quoted as recalling. Women in military finally getting respect Mattis led Marines at the very start of the war in Afghanistan. Reportedly a devotee of the book \u201cGood to Great,\u201d Mattis focused on getting the right people on his team and keeping his staff small. He earned, and earned again, the trust of those who served under him, who trusted him as a plain-talking and erudite leader steeped in military history and the classics. Yet the military of which he was a part of from 1972 until 2013 has become an ever-smaller sliver of society, even as it is asked to do more \u2013 and for longer. Only a tiny fraction of Americans has fought in US wars of the past 15 years, meaning much of the country is detached from the realities of conflict. This point was underscored by Mattis and his co-editor Kori Schake in their recent book, \u201cWarriors and Citizens: American Views of Our Military.\u201d \u201cThe American public used to have greater familiarity with military service because many more Americans were directly affected than are now,\u201d Mattis said in a September interview with RealClearDefense about the book. \u201cTo many in the military, we seem to be not a country at war, but a military at war.\u201d That \u201cmilitary at war\u201d that Mattis referenced remains at war. Special operations forces continue to suffer combat losses, and military families are being changed forever, yet few in America are noticing.  Indeed, Navy SEALs, Green Berets, Army Rangers and all-female Cultural Support Team members who join the Rangers on nighttime combat operations, among others, are deployed in places such as Afghanistan even as you read this. And while the taxing nature of warfare hasn\u2019t changed, the faces of those tasked with fighting is poised to. Then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially lifted the ban on women in ground combat in 2013, paving the way for such roles to be opened to women this year. Also this year, female West Point cadets could for the first time choose to enter combat arms jobs, including armor and the infantry. And finally, on the same day the story broke of the Mattis nomination, the first female soldiers graduated from the Army\u2019s Armor Basic Officer Leaders Course at Fort Benning, Georgia. But while these soldiers may have made history, that wasn\u2019t their goal. They wanted only to serve to their utmost. And they won over their instructors in the process. \u201cThere was some skepticism at first, just to see can they do it \u2026 but as soon as they started performing to those same standards \u2013 because we didn\u2019t change anything and they performed to those same standards, and they met and exceeded those same standards \u2013 it solidified that they have a place here,\u201d Staff Sgt. George Baker told reporters as the first gender-integrated class of Armor Basic Officer Leaders Course that graduated 53 male and 13 female officers concluded Thursday.  That skepticism may or may not be shared by Mattis, who has written and spoken at length about the need for \u201ca little more humility and a little more modesty on the part of those who may have statutory, legal, constitutional authority over the military, as they listen to (non-commissioned officers) and junior officers who will actually have the responsibility to try to create unit cohesion.\u201d His words over the years have left many observers wondering whether the opening of all combat roles to women will be reversed with him at the helm of the Pentagon. But Mattis is a leader known for caring deeply about all those in uniform under his command, a leader who has focused a great deal on exploring and narrowing the gap between America\u2019s warriors and the country they serve. All this suggests that as he embarks upon the path toward making history as the first post-9/11 military commander to lead the Pentagon, Mattis and his record of service will be a stark reminder to the country that it remains at war, even if it doesn\u2019t bother to notice. And if he is indeed confirmed, the history-making former general will find that much history has been made in the meantime by those wanting to contribute as much as they might to their nation\u2019s security.",

Follow him @paulcallan. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Paul Callan: Trump University settlement is a victory for both sides -- to an extent Settlement raises the bigger issue of how president-elect will handle other lawsuits, Callan writes The Trump University lawsuit \u201cthorns,\u201d long festering in the side of the Trump transition team, have now been excised in an out-of-court settlement. Both sides have reason to claim at least a partial victory in the final resolution of this class action litigation drama. The suits asserted fraud claims on behalf of approximately 6,000 former students who had enrolled in the President-elect\u2019s seminar and what many would label a faux on-line \u201cuniversity.\u201d In a defensive tweet, Mr. Trump suggested that he quite reluctantly ordered the suits settled only because of the potential that they would interfere with his presidential responsibilities. His incoming chief of staff, RNC chair Reince Priebus, reinforced this claim. Trump also repeated a prior assertion that the suits lacked merit and that he would have preferred to litigate and win: \u201cThe only BAD thing about winning the presidency\u201d is he doesn\u2019t have time to sit for a trial he says he would have won, he tweeted. \u201cToo bad!\u201d Trump also said the $25 million settlement was much less than his potential financial exposure in the cases, which alleged Trump defrauded people who enrolled in real estate seminars he started in 2005. Ex-employees describe Trump University as a scam \u201cI settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.\u201d In fact, the settlement looks to be a good deal for the students. Most will recover at least 50% of the tuition they paid for taking the Trump courses. The plaintiffs get some significant compensation that publicly affirms the common-sense validity of their accusations of fraud. Try to picture legitimate universities like Trump\u2019s alma maters Fordham and Penn issuing 50% tuition refunds to students in response to class action lawsuits alleging fraud.  Mr. Trump, though, also had sound reasons to act. Class actions almost always settle if they have been \u201ccertified\u201d by the court as non-frivolous matters. The students might even have won at trial if supported by credible evidence. The Trump University matters were not only \u201ccertified\u201d but had also survived motions to dismiss. All of this means that these cases were destined to go to trial if not resolved out of court. The vast majority of \u201ccertified\u201d class actions settle with good reason. Legal defense costs are exorbitant and if the defendants lose the case, the verdict can be catastrophically high. Trump University pushed out of Texas to avoid lawsuit? Let\u2019s say the jurors agree to the kind of number customarily awarded for only a minor injury, say $25,000 as restitution for the tuition and a \u201cpunitive damage\u201d award to \u201csend a message\u201d that reprehensible conduct of this sort will not be tolerated. Multiply $25,000 times 6,000 students and the figure award adds up to $150 million. But wait\u2026those expensive Trump defense lawyers at O\u2019Melveny and Meyers including Dan Petrocelli (the victims\u2019 lead counsel on the OJ Simpson civil case) and other defense lawyers and experts have to be paid for their work on the cases in New York and California. Let\u2019s throw in at least $5 million for them, bringing the total award to at least $155 million. Would the number get reduced on appeal? Probably, but that process would be a long, costly and embarrassing effort \u2013 all taking place in the middle of the Trump presidency. Although both sides made sensible decisions in settling before trial, Mr. Trump will still have to worry that potential litigants will be emboldened by these settlements to pursue cases of their own against the new Commander-in-Chief. There are by all accounts several dozens of lawsuits pending against Mr. Trump and his businesses, with more in the wings.  Ironically, the Supreme Court has previously ruled in the case of William Jefferson Clinton vs Paula Jones (the latter being one of Mr. Trump\u2019s invited guests at one of the presidential debates) that even the president of the United States has to appear in civil cases regarding matters that occurred prior to his election. It really wouldn\u2019t take much of the president\u2019s time, opined the unanimous court.  The justices obviously never considered a Trump presidency, ruling that the matter of a president having to appear in court had only come up three times in American history. These were single, inconsequential matters involving Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy. Compared with his less litigious predecessors, then, Mr. Trump faces, even if only considering a conservative estimate of potential suits, an historic number of legal matters that will hover over him like a dark cloud on Inauguration Day. Unless the Supreme Court carves out a new rule deferring personal lawsuits against the president until his term is complete, President Trump will be coughing up substantial coin to make these lawsuits go away so he can get around to building that wall.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Trump may look to presidents who have served during his lifetime, writes Michael D'Antonio Nixon may be the closest to a possible presidential role model, says D'Antonio It was a look we haven\u2019t seen from the man who has been the constant focus of media attention for more than 30 years. Donald Trump appeared wan, if not a bit shocked, as he sat with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office on  Thursday. Aides told The New York Times that their man was truly surprised by the success of the get-out-the-angry-voter campaign that won him the presidency. In Washington, Trump and Obama discussed the upcoming transfer of power and the awesome responsibility of the office. By the sound of things, the President-elect appreciated the session. During the brief moment when the press was invited to see the two men, Trump repeatedly called Obama \u201ca very good man\u201d and predicted he would seek his counsel in the future. This note seemed more sincere than the usual bland talk of cooperation that follows an election, as if Trump recognizes that he needs help. A day later he spoke of retaining parts of Obamacare, which he had previously said he would immediately repeal in its entirety upon taking office. Although Trump may come to appreciate Obama\u2019s strengths, he\u2019s not going to model his presidency on the man whom he has trashed for much of the past eight years. This leaves him challenged to find a presidential role model that would help him to deliver on the claim that he has the temperament to serve. His irritable tweet about people protesting his election \u2013 \u201cVery unfair!\u201d \u2013 revealed this is a work in progress for the famously direct man who has confessed to being \u201ca fabulous whiner.\u201d However, Trump has no choice but to transform himself from tetchy celebrity into the chief executive and commander in chief. Trump and Obama finally meet after years of bad blood Not a reader of books, Trump won\u2019t seek a role model in the Abraham Lincoln of \u201cTeam of Rivals\u201d by Doris Kearns Goodwin or the Andrew Jackson of  \u201cAmerican Lion\u201d by Jon Meacham. However, he is perhaps the most avid consumer of mass media ever to be elected president, and he has formed impressions of those presidents who have served during his lifetime. Among the most recent presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Obama, Trump has seen much to criticize. Although he recently praised Reagan, when the Gipper was in office Trump questioned his ability to deliver the goods. In his book \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal,\u201d he said Reagan was so \u201csmooth\u201d that it took seven years for people to \u201cquestion whether there\u2019s anything beneath that smile.\u201d Trump was once close to Bill Clinton but shredded him in the 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton. In that campaign he also repeatedly lashed out at George W. Bush. And, though he told me he admired Obama\u2019s skills, Trump built his political base on a racially provocative and false suggestion that his predecessor was not born in the United States and was thus ineligible for the office.  In light of his wavering attitude about those who occupied the White House since 1980, we must go back further to seek a Trump role model. Trump would have been a bit young to identify with Dwight D. Eisenhower. Besides, it was Ike who sicced the federal bureaucracy on Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump Sr., on suspicion that he abused a housing program for veterans and the middle class. So the general would be out as an exemplar for Trump. John F. Kennedy\u2019s wealth, glamor and sex symbol status would have appealed to Trump when it came to style. However, to my knowledge, Trump has never said anything notable about Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson or Gerald Ford. Jimmy Carter, in Trump\u2019s view, \u201chad the nerve, the guts, the balls\u201d to get elected, but \u201ccouldn\u2019t do the job.\u201d The process of elimination, if nothing else, suggests that it may be Richard Nixon whom Trump will choose to emulate. A close look shows that Trump has already followed the Nixon model in important ways. During his winning campaign, Trump borrowed from Nixon the term \u201csilent majority,\u201d which was used by the Republican ticket to refer to Americans who quietly supported their agenda in 1967. When the words appeared on Trump placards in 2015 few, if any, of the reporters covering him were old enough to recall the origins of the term. They were also too young to have experienced the anti-press sloganeering that Nixon running mate Spiro Agnew practiced (he called reporters \u201cnattering nabobs of negativism\u201d), or the law-and-order rhetoric that was Nixon\u2019s dog-whistle signal to Southern whites who had been discomfited by the civil rights movement. In the search for Trump\u2019s guiding example, the President-elect\u2019s temperament and his campaign performance evoke another of the slogans \u2013 \u201cNixon\u2019s the One\u201d \u2013 that resonated in 1968. (Trump said \u201conly I\u201d can fix the country\u2019s problems.) Trump\u2019s Nixon connection was cemented when the disgraced president, forced from office by the Watergate scandal, sent him a kind of fan letter after his wife Pat reported seeing young Trump on TV in 1987. \u201cI did not see the program,\u201d wrote Nixon. \u201cBut Mrs. Nixon told me you were great. As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you\u2019ll be a winner!\u201d Nixon\u2019s references to Trump\u2019s future greatness and winning touched on themes that the candidate would use frequently in the 2015-2016 campaign. Trump would also rely on a former Nixon hand, one of the few surviving tricksters of the old man\u2019s 1972 reelection effort, to inform both his political identity and his strategy. When it comes to politics, no one has been closer to Trump for as long as Roger Stone, who maintains to this day his credibility as an extreme operator, which he established when he posed as a socialist donor to undo Nixon\u2019s fellow Republican and antagonist Rep. Pete McCloskey of California in 1972. Just as Trump used a no-holds-barred approach to prevail in business, Stone is known as a dark-arts genius in politics and his Nixonian style could be seen in the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants directed at Hillary Clinton at his client\u2019s rallies. (It\u2019s not clear whether Stone coined the phrase, but he loved using it.) Besides calling on prejudice and labeling the press an enemy of the people, Trump matches Nixon when it comes to his resentment of the elite. Nixon hated Brahmins, and Trump has long sought to separate himself from the elite by fashioning himself as the People\u2019s Billionaire. And like Nixon, who kept an enemies list, Trump does seem to nurse grudges.  But as alike as they may be, two key factors separate Trump and Nixon. First, Trump is a much less focused man and is thus more subject to influence. Second, Trump is more eager to be loved (a classic Baby Boomer trait), which makes him eager to please. Pushed properly, Trump could be like the Nixon who surprised the world by using his Cold Warrior credibility to reach out to communist China. Trump\u2019s backtracking on his promise to immediately repeal Obamacare indicates just this trait. Those who fear Trump at his worst should try to encourage this element of the President-elect\u2019s style, reminding him that his outsider status gives him a chance to succeed in surprising ways.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Ron Paul is a former congressman from Texas and three-time presidential candidate. He\u2019s currently the host of \u201cThe Ron Paul Liberty Report.\u201d The views expressed are his own. Ron Paul: Problems created by government meddling cannot be cured with more government meddling A different philosophy must be adopted that will truly serve the rich, poor, and middle-class alike, he says \u201cPopulism\u201d was one of the big buzzwords of this election cycle. It was largely attached to the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, with both candidates referred to as \u201cpopulists\u201d despite having distinctly different political philosophies. Still, they both used the approach \u2013 with success \u2013 to tap into the deep dissatisfaction of the average American voter. For Donald Trump, populism has paid off well: In a shock to the political establishment, Trump has ridden populism straight to the White House. But we must understand what populism is really all about. Populism has traditionally been understood to include trade protectionism, low interest rates, and government welfare to the poor and middle classes. The philosophy is meant to appeal to the common person, as opposed to establishment elites. Populism has historically seen a revival when economic conditions have deteriorated for the average person while the elites continue to prosper. Demagogues rush to use the dreadful economic conditions to their political advantage. However, the solutions offered by so many opportunistic politicians aren\u2019t really solutions at all. The proposals are always laced with promises that government will \u201cdo something\u201d to fix the problem. Unfortunately, most people still fail to understand that the economic pain they are suffering is the government\u2019s doing in the first place. Government monetary, economic and trade policies lie at the root of the problem. The lack of a free market, sound money and genuine private property rights inhibit the return of economic prosperity. This widespread lack of understanding leads those who fall for the siren song of populism down a road of perpetual disappointment. The problems created by government meddling cannot be cured with more government meddling. Cause and effect have yet to be overturned. Nevertheless, more intervention seems to be the only item on the menu, no matter which party happens to hold the reins of power. The option of peeling government away from our lives is rarely presented to the American public beyond some occasional, and insincere, campaign rhetoric. Populism is contagious, and once it catches on both conservatives and liberals rush to capitalize on the moment. They both promise to rescue the middle class from the scoundrels who have been in charge. The situation is framed as the people versus the privileged class, and if such a fight is not properly understood it has the potential to create even greater harm for everyone. Despite what the demagogues often proclaim, economic distress is not the result of free markets. It is brought about by layers of government regulation, a central bank that tries to \u201crun the economy\u201d by counterfeiting money and manipulating interest rates, and the fanatical idea that the United States should run the world militarily. Something has to change, but the solution cannot be further government involvement in our economic lives and liberties.  The only real \u201cpopulism\u201d worth thinking about is that which the ideas of liberty provide. If one really cares about the middle class and poor, more government meddling can no longer be an option. Instead, we must consider the tremendous economic benefits that a true free market would provide. In a free society, there would be no bailouts to the too-big-to-fail banks, artificially low interest rates, crony regulations or coveted government contracts. Cozying up to power would be a thing of the past since such power centers would cease to exist.  America\u2019s disastrous foreign policy of regime change and armed \u201cliberation\u201d would be tossed into the dustbin of history where it belongs. The practice of aggression at home and overseas leads a country to disaster. The essence of the liberty movement is the embrace of the nonaggression principle. One may never use aggressive force against one\u2019s neighbor for any reason. One may also never use government force to aggress against one\u2019s neighbor. Government cannot act as your proxy to expropriate the property of others. Force, if it is to be used at all, is for the purpose of defending yourself from an aggressor. More government, and more of the same, will end. A different philosophy must be adopted that will truly serve the rich, poor, and middle-class alike. It is a philosophy of liberty and peace. There are many encouraging signs that Americans are coming in our direction on this. Our movement is growing.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Candidates have stumbled with a format in which ordinary citizens ask the questions, writes Julian Zelizer Talking points and negativity are not the way to go, he says On Sunday night, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will square off in their second debate. Unlike the last event, where the two candidates stood behind podiums as they were asked questions by moderator Lester Holt, this time it will be a town hall format where the candidates will be taking questions from a live audience, with Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz moderating. The town hall debate is a very different dynamic than the standard debate format so Trump should be nervous, especially since his poor performance in the first debate and falling poll numbers raises the stakes for this event. The Washington Post\u2019s revelation of Trump\u2019s vulgar 2005 conversation about women has generated anger and deeper concern, and the issue can easily come up in what would be an uncomfortable moment. Trump is eager to find an opportunity to introduce the issue of Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity into the town hall, which can easily backfire. And there are risks for Hillary Clinton in this kind of format as well. Since this kind of format became part of the presidential debate mix in 1992, some candidates have stumbled during these events, causing harm to their campaigns, while others have thrived at the back-and-forth with the audience members. The town hall format was an effort to bring the democratic impulses of the New England town hall meeting to the sometimes-rigid debates that began when John F. Kennedy faced off against Richard Nixon in 1960. In the famous New England town hall meetings residents would gather to debate and discuss the major issues facing their communities. These events were remembered as quintessential examples of how the colonists were determined to practice a new kind of inclusive democracy that would broaden the number of people involved in decision-making. Megyn Kelly is right about Trump choosing Hannity over 'unsafe spaces' In 1968, Roger Ailes, who later ran Fox News, organized \u201cMan in the Arena\u201d events. These were shows on airtime purchased by the Nixon campaign showcasing average citizens asking questions (that in this case were scripted) of the Republican candidate. Ailes\u2019 goal was to make Nixon appear more human. (Ailes\u2019 events were influenced by television spots that President Dwight D. Eisenhower pioneered in 1952 when he answered scripted questions from citizens). President Jimmy Carter, who was elected in a moment of great distrust following the Watergate scandal, believed that the town hall offered a way for him to reach out to ordinary voters on the key issues and to reestablish confidence in government. During his push to sell the unpopular Panama Canal Treaties in 1978, Carter held a number of town hall meetings, where he appeared via remote cameras, to build support for this program. And after President Barack Obama pushed his health care program in 2009, many legislators held town hall meetings in their districts and were subject to intense crowds who came to express their opposition to the plan. Town halls became a part of the presidential campaign in 1992 with the second debate.  President George H. W. Bush, the Republican nominee seeking re-election, showed how badly this format could go. During one famous interaction Bush wasn\u2019t really listening to the question. When one young woman asked \u201cHow has the national debt personally affected each of your lives? And if it hasn\u2019t how can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience in what\u2019s ailing them?\u201d Then disaster struck for the GOP.  Bush, impatiently looking at his watch, stood up and said, \u201cWell, I think the national debt affects everybody. Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates.\u201d As he tried to finish, the moderator Carole Simpson interrupted him to explain, \u201cShe\u2019s saying you personally.\u201d The woman repeated her question. He said, \u201cWell, \u201cI\u2019m sure it has. I love my grandchildren and I want to think that\u2026.\u201d When interrupted again with the question of how, Bush tried to talk about making sure that education was affordable. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I get it,\u201d Bush acknowledged with a nervous look, \u201cHelp me with the question and I\u2019ll try to answer it.\u201d  He tried again but would never get it quite right. Who won the vice presidential debate? Bill Clinton, who held a number of town halls while he was running in the primaries, virtually jumped off his seat, walking up to the woman and asking how it had affected her. Then he spoke about his experience as governor and watching the terrible conditions that middle-class Americans were feeling. \u201cIn my state, when people lose their jobs there is a good chance I will know them by their names.\u201d The woman listened carefully in what was a mesmerizing exchange. At this and other moments, he showed the capacity to display empathy as he gave his answers, biting his lip, and responding directly to the concerns of the person speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to be a good talker than a good listener,\u201d Clinton would say. He never let the other two men on the podium, Bush and the independent candidate Ross Perot, shake him or fundamentally disrupt his style with the people asking questions. It was a tour de force. Town hall debates are challenging for candidates who tend to stick to certain talking points. Every campaign wants to emphasize certain themes but given that the town hall questions are less predictable, candidates have to show they can think on their feet. Many observers credited Obama in 2008 with being able to bring back the discussion to taxes, with promises for a middle class tax cut, whatever the subject was.  His campaign believed that this offered him a major advantage against Sen. John McCain in swing states where Republican supply-side economics didn\u2019t sit so well with struggling Americans. Body language can also be a trap given that the candidates are sometimes seated on stools and have the opportunity to get up and walk around. This can cause problems. Al Gore faced George W. Bush in 2000. While Bush had trouble articulating some of his policy views in the standard debate, he did pretty well in relating to the people asking questions in the town hall format. Gore\u2019s stiff and awkward demeanor really cost him some points. When Gore stood up and walked over to Bush during one answer, he looked like a schoolyard bully. Bush deflected him with a humorous nod. The moment became a legendary example of what not to do. McCain would come under comedic fire after his town hall debate with Barack Obama, where he seemed to aimlessly walk around the stage and sometimes ended up blocking the camera. Who won the presidential debate? \u201cHas Anyone Seen My Dog? Has anyone seen my little Mr. Puddles?\u201d The Daily Show suggested as a mock internal dialogue that he was having. During another exchange, McCain called Obama \u201cthat one\u201d which some saw as a sign of disrespect and contempt. McCain also didn\u2019t shake Obama\u2019s hand when it was over. During a town hall debate with supporters, McCain also learned how the audience could cause trouble when one woman said she heard that Obama\u2019 was an \u201cArab.\u201d McCain, with a crowd that booed him at times, had to grab the microphone from here to say, \u201cI have to tell you. Sen. Obama is a decent person and a person you don\u2019t have to be scared of as president of the United States.\u201d Some members of the audience yelled out \u201cliar\u201d and \u201cterrorist,\u201d speaking of the Democratic nominee. On Sunday night, Donald Trump will have to show many traits that have not been evident in his campaign so far. Trump will have to actually listen to the people asking him questions. He will have to contain some of his innate anger and instinct to punch back, given that the questions are now coming from average Americans rather than representatives of the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d And he will have to be extremely cautious in the way he moves and physically interacts both with Hillary Clinton and the people in the room.  Clinton, who has done many of these events and is skilled at handling this format, once again needs to use this opportunity to display some of the emotion and empathy that her husband showed back in 1992. Of all the debates, this is the one that gives her a chance to show us more of the person rather than the candidate. She will also have a chance, and must do more to take it than in the first debate, to talk about the issues that really matter with her. Much of her campaign, understandably so, has turned toward demonizing Trump rather than talking about herself. In the town hall it will be important to focus more on what she would do for Americans rather than what risks her opponent poses. Negative has not been the way to go in the town hall. The town hall debate this Sunday will be an exciting event, and it will certainly test both candidates in areas where they will be vulnerable as they grapple with the concerns of American voters. But, as with Bill Clinton in 1992, the candidate who can rise to the challenge will be able to show that he or she can connect with and respond to the anxieties facing this restless electorate.",

Follow him on Twitter: @ericpliu. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. The Democratic Party convention is taking place this week in Philadelphia Eric Liu: The spirit of true patriotism was best expressed and embodied by Barack Obama On the day that Donald Trump made news by openly inviting Russia to intervene in the presidential election, the Democrats in Philadelphia reminded America what true patriotism is. For months, Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan has been not just the heart of his campaign, but also the reflection of the wounded pride of his followers: in the Rust Belt, in Appalachia, among uneducated white men who feel \u201cripped off\u201d by the world. Trump\u2019s brand of patriotism is strikingly, even shockingly, about decline and loss. It does not strike any of the mystic chords of memory that Lincoln touched and Reagan struck again. It does not evoke our nation\u2019s founding ideals. It is just a vision of America-as-Trump, a promise that if an unashamed swindler can become a wealthy celebrity then America must still have a chance. Wednesday night\u2019s speakers offered a different story about patriotism. It started with Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, who have served their country in office and in uniform, and who as citizens now are fighting to reduce the gun violence that almost took her life. It continued with Vice President Joe Biden, who rekindled a spirit of blue-collar pride in America based not on fear or resentment or a sense of decline, but on resilience and toughness. Biden did something no other speaker had done to that point: He spoke in anger. He was not just offended or indignant about Trump\u2019s words and deeds. He was angry that this fraud and possibly even traitor would dare lay claim to middle-class loyalties. The narrative about true patriotism rolled on with former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, once a Democrat and then a Republican and now an independent, who delivered the line of the night: \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker. I know a con when I see one.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s pitch, devastatingly effective, was explicitly about putting country above party.   It continued with vice presidential pick Tim Kaine\u2019s spirit of humility and message of service before self. His pride in his son, a Marine who\u2019s just deployed to Europe, was palpable. As was his all-around corniness, which played as earnest, uncynical belief in the country. But ultimately, the spirit of true patriotism was best expressed and embodied, as it was 12 years ago at this convention, by Barack Obama. \u201cFilled with faith\u201d in America is how he described himself. He contrasted that belief in American ingenuity and decency with the pessimism and zero-sum fearfulness that Trump feeds on. He contrasted the \u201cWe\u201d of \u201cWe the People\u201d with Trump\u2019s \u201cI alone.\u201d He quoted Teddy Roosevelt. And he painted Hillary Clinton in these colors of patriotism properly understood. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Over a century ago, a U.S. senator from Missouri came to national prominence in a time of nativism and fear. His name was Carl Schurz. He was a German immigrant. He had been a general in the Union Army during the Civil War. When demagogues chanted \u201cMy country, right or wrong,\u201d Schurz replied with a profound twist. True patriotism, he said, means, \u201cMy country: when right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be set right.\u201d The United States thrives when citizens of both parties think and act this way. On Wednesday night, Americans who happen to be Democrats reminded us again how to do it.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. David Gergen: This is my 20th political convention and I cannot remember one with such a raucous, rocky start Trump and campaign are mirroring Nixon's 1968 presidential run and that could be a big mistake, says Gergen Donald Trump is rightly \u201cfurious\u201d about the controversy enveloping his wife, Melania, after her speech on GOP opening night \u2013 but he should be angry at a lot more than that and ought to be kicking himself the hardest. This is my 20th political convention and I cannot remember one that has gotten off to such a raucous, rocky start. Apparently, the Trump staff is so lean \u2013 and mean \u2013 that since conventioneers started to arrive, they have been continually misplaying one of the most important moments of the campaign.  And if recent reports play out about their affinity for Richard Nixon, they are careening toward more trouble. To be sure, as the Trump camp believes, the press is blowing some of the early mishaps out of proportion and is focusing too little on barn burning speeches like that of Rudy Giuliani on opening night.  But pros understand that is the nature of the game and they know how to handle it. Welcome to the NFL! The trouble started right out of the gate on Monday morning when two leading surrogates for Trump launched attacks on the Bush family, Mitt Romney, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.  The most jarring was the criticism that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort aimed at Kasich. It is by now axiomatic that Trump must win Ohio to win the White House, that the race here is a dead heat, and that Kasich \u2013 the most popular political leader in the state \u2013 may hold the keys to victory.  Knocking him on day one was a blunder, and an omen of things to come.   That very afternoon, the Trump team compounded its problems as anti-Trump forces demanded an open, roll-call vote. When Trump\u2019s allies squelched the protesters, all hell broke loose on the convention floor. \u201cChaos,\u201d the press called it, casting a shadow over the entire first day.  And bitter tastes lingered: delegates on the losing side claimed they had been \u201cstrong armed.\u201d  One put it this way to me: \u201cThe Trump people would have won the roll call; they had plenty of votes.  If they want to unify the party, why weren\u2019t they smart enough to give us something we could take home?\u201d  Why not, indeed? Trump's convention choice: Bring the party together or blow it apart A surly mood continued into Monday night, but this time was directed in rat-a-tat attacks against Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the Democratic establishment.  The moment that was to recast the evening in a warm glow and to serve as its climax was the debut of Melania Trump on a national stage.  Convention nominees historically stay away from personal appearances until their final night, but so important was Melania\u2019s speech that Trump flew in to introduce her. And she delivered!  In the moments immediately after, commentators from one network to the next gushed over her poise, her portrayal of her husband as a patriot, and her embrace of her new homeland.  She seemed, and remains, a woman of good values. Melania: the good, the bad and the beautiful By now, everyone knows the glow didn\u2019t last long, as a sharp-eyed gent took to social media to point out the remarkable parallels between her speech and that of Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention eight years ago.  A new hell broke loose across all media, shredding hopes by convention planners for a great opening night. Melania Trump is hardly the first high-profile person to be accused of plagiarism, but this won\u2019t be forgotten quickly. Manafort: Plagiarism accusations are crazy That is especially true because the Trump campaign made such a hash of things in the aftermath Tuesday morning when they denied there was anything wrong but added \u2013 ludicrously \u2013 that if there were anything wrong, the blame should lie with Hillary Clinton! Sure. That argument came right out of a Richard Nixon playbook.  When in trouble, stonewall.  And perhaps therein lies the root of the problems the Trump team is having: They have spent so much time studying Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign that they are starting to copy it. Top aide: Trump will channel 1968 Nixon in speech It is hard to believe, but we now know that Trump and his team have come to believe that Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 convention speech and  campaign should serve as their model.  There are indeed some parallels between then and now:  Nixon was running at a time of turmoil on the streets at home and an agonizing war overseas. Middle class voters were angry.  Nixon proclaimed himself to be the law-and-order candidate and as Joe McGinnis records in his classic book, \u201cThe Selling of the President,\u201d he skillfully used television to speak over the heads of a querulous press corps to what he called \u201ca silent majority.\u201d   Nixon went on to win in a tight election, a lesson the Trump team has taken to heart. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. So, it makes sense to study the Nixon years, but it is bizarre beyond words to intentionally choose his candidacy and presidency as a role model.    As a young man, I worked for Nixon in the White House and believe he did far more good for the country than is generally appreciated. Yet, even the most loyal Nixonite would acknowledge that his insecurities and paranoia led to a long string of political and legal abuses.  He could not control his inner demons and eventually did himself in.  In politics, moreover, his  \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d became an invitation for segregationists, then staunch Democrats, to become Republicans.  That was a Faustian bargain that ultimately tore the party away from its Lincolnian roots and haunts it still. DNC chair: Trump campaign has to answer for RNC speech In days ahead, commentators here in Cleveland will hammer Trump over his embrace of Nixon. In a preview of what is likely coming, Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution acidly wrote Tuesday, \u201cBut why should anyone be surprised at an instance of plagiarism in a single speech?  By Trump\u2019s campaign manager\u2019s own admission, they are plagiarizing the entire campaign from Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 law and order campaign.\u201d There are surely people around Donald Trump who know all this.  But Trump hasn\u2019t invested enough resources to build a first-rate staff around him and after all, they take orders from the top. Trump has every reason to be angry with his team over the Melania speech, but when it comes to the presidency, as Harry Truman pointed out a long time ago, the buck stops with him.",

Liberal and progressive voters detest Pence\u2019s stands on the issues, and conservatives question his commitment and competency. At least Pence is objectionable in different ways than the mercurial and unorthodox Trump. Pence personifies misguided ultra-conservative approaches in a low-key, non-bombastic way. He\u2019s much more of a traditional GOP bogeyman. Democratic strategists will be relieved to have at least one target who conforms to the traditional playbook. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Pence\u2019s biggest moment in the national spotlight was in spearheading Indiana\u2019s ill-advised and spectacularly mishandled Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law legalized discrimination against LGBT Americans, sparking a backlash. The business community revolted, forcing Pence into a humiliating retreat. Mike Pence\u2019s economic policies have been hostile to the middle class and the poor while rewarding the ultra rich. He has consistently opposed increasing the minimum wage and even signed a law that allowed skilled construction workers in Indiana to have their pay rates cut. S.E. Cupp: Why, Mike Pence? Why? He has supported privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare, all the while advocating huge tax cuts for corporations and the rich. If Pence\u2019s conservative politics alienate progressive voters, his seeming inability to effectively move his agenda forward has the right wing up in arms. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter called Pence a \u201ccombo-platter of disaster\u201d  and \u201cTrump\u2019s first mistake.\u201d While I don\u2019t agree that this is Trump\u2019s first mistake, we can find common ground in agreeing it is a mistake. Trump-Pence: A ticket with two right wings There is a reason that Gov. Pence was willing to drop his re-election bid to board the Trump crazy train. Even in conservative Indiana, his combination of extremism and incompetence put his prospects of winning reelection very much in doubt. That this is the best he could do \u2013 and the best Donald Trump could do \u2013 says a lot about both men on the GOP ticket.",

She is a principal at the Dewey Square Group, which does work for a super PAC supporting Clinton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Maria Cardona says female voters won't buy his argument that Clinton was an enabler Trump's attitudes toward women will be bad for him as a general election candidate, Cardona says Warning: This article contains offensive language. Donald Trump\u2019s current strategy of attacking Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husband\u2019s peccadilloes will not succeed.  Nor will he win by accusing her of condemning the women who supposedly were the ones committing these indiscretions with her husband.  Hillary by contrast, will fight back and win by focusing on the issues that will help women and their families lead better lives. First of all, if these are the stones Trump is going to throw, he needs to move out of his very brittle glass house.  The derogatory words Donald Trump has used to describe women are legion and have already been used against him by some of his Republican rivals during the primary.  They were not successful in vanquishing the real estate magnate because the Republican primary electorate looks very different from what a general election electorate will look like. Trump starts with an already massive deficit in approval ratings among women in general \u2013 70% have a negative view of Mr. Trump \u2013 and these are women who will be ripe for hearing more about how he denigrates, makes fun of and reduces a woman to being just a \u201cpiece of ass.\u201d Trump's devils could lurk in tax return details If you separate that out to African-American women at 92% negatives, and Latinas at 86%, according on the GW University Battleground poll by Tarrance Group and Lake Research Partners, it indicates just how prohibitively difficult his rehabilitation among female voters \u2013 who are most engaged and participatory, and who represent 53% of the electorate \u2013 is going to be. Why I am backing Donald Trump Secondly, any woman who has experienced infidelity by her partner will not be quick to criticize Clinton for either wanting to believe her husband or for even expressing \u2013 in less than glowing terms and in private conversations \u2013 what she thought of these women.  She is a human being after all, and this was an incredibly painful and heart-wrenching period for her and her family. She chose to keep her family together, and that is her personal choice to make.  Most women understand that choice, even if it might not have been the one every woman would have made. Trump's devils could lurk in tax return details Let\u2019s remember, she is the one running for president, not her husband.  She should be judged by her own actions, her own record, and her own public-facing words.  This is a woman who has fought for women and children and families for three decades, while Donald Trump was running around Manhattan polishing his image as a Playboy millionaire, going on the Howard Stern show boasting of his conquests and how famous married women desired him, talking about oral sex, venereal diseases, judging the looks and builds of possible sex partners, marrying and divorcing three times over. C\u2019mon America.  Is this someone you want in the White House?  Is this someone you want as your commander in chief?  Is this someone you can hold up to your kids and say what a great role model he is?  I think we all know the answer to that. Trump supporters or Clinton critics would say, \u201cWell he can\u2019t be worse than Bill Clinton,\u201d to which I would respond that if you really thought Bill Clinton was bad for women because of his weaknesses, why in hell would you want to repeat that tenfold with someone like Donald Trump? Why Sanders is a better bet against Trump Trump supporters would also say that Trump really didn\u2019t mean any of those derogatory and demeaning statements he made about women.  That it was all for show.  That when in the White House, he will act very differently.  Presidential even. Well, I\u2019m sorry, but the job of President of the United States and leader of the free world is too important to trust to a man who has behaved, in both word and deed, exactly the opposite of what we would want and deserve to have representing us in the White House.  That contrasts with Bill Clinton, whose weaknesses were personal, and who never spoke in a denigrating manner about women or members of any other demographic.  Clinton\u2019s administration was responsible for the greatest economic expansion in a generation, which helped women and their families succeed and get ahead. And consider Hillary Clinton\u2019s career.  She fought for and helped achieve health care coverage for 8 million children while she was first lady.  She co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which allows women to sue for equal pay for equal work.  She has championed paid family leave, affordable child care, equal pay for equal work, affordable, debt-free college, and has focused her campaign on breaking down barriers for middle-class families, while Donald Trump talks about building walls,  forcefully removing millions of people and keeping a whole religion out of the country. Hillary Clinton is far from perfect.  She is a self-described policy wonk who finds the art of campaigning difficult and admits it does not come naturally to her. She does not wear her heart on her sleeve.  But she has put her heart in her lifelong fight for those who traditionally have not had a voice or a champion in their corner.  Many women know exactly how that feels. As women, we are not our partners\u2019 keepers.  We are our families\u2019 breadwinners, protectors, guardians, voices and unifiers.  We stand on our own words and deeds and we will judge our candidates as such.  If that is indeed the case, then Hillary Clinton has an excellent chance of being the next and first female President of the United States.  And the country will be better for it.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. SE Cupp: Instead of talking about looming victory in N.Y., Trump has spent days whining about delegates and  GOP' \"rigged\" system She says system not secret; Trump should have studied up.  If RNC had rigged it, Walker or Bush would be presumptive nominee by now If Donald Trump has nicknamed Ted Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d maybe Cruz should take a page out of Trump\u2019s book and nickname him \u201cWhinin\u2019 Don.\u201d You would think that in the week leading up to your home state primary, where you\u2019re expected to do very well, you\u2019d want all attention on your looming victory. Instead Trump has inexplicably spent the past few days complaining about his loss of all 13 Colorado delegates to Cruz, whining about the \u201crigged\u201d system, and stomping around like a petulant child. It\u2019s more terrible twos than commander-in-chief. All of which has only served to expose gaping holes in Trump\u2019s organization and an apparent \u2014 and embarrassing \u2013 inability to figure out how to work the system effectively. It\u2019s an odd look for Trump, and ironic, considering that over the course of this tumultuous Republican primary, he has proudly boasted about gaming the system \u2013 that is, figuring out how to legally exploit whatever weaknesses he can to benefit him most in business, particularly when it comes to tax and labor laws. He brags about outsmarting his opponents in business and bringing his superior business acumen to politics, where he\u2019ll be better than the \u201cstupid\u201d \u201cdummies\u201d currently leading the country. Right now, though, he isn\u2019t looking all that smart. Trump seems to have a middle school civics class idea of how we elect a president \u2013 that it\u2019s a glorified popularity contest. It isn\u2019t, nor has it ever been. The delegate-selecting process is an important part of running for President, and one Trump\u2019s campaign should have been paying attention to from the outset. The rules for selecting delegates are complicated and arcane \u2013 but they are not a secret. Anyone, including Trump or any member of his organization, could have discovered that Colorado was going to elect delegates and not a candidate, or learned when the deadline to become a delegate in Virginia, Arizona or Indiana was (all have passed, potentially shutting Trump out). Some of Trump\u2019s recent problems have been, to be blunt, categorically dumb mistakes that don\u2019t happen to campaign staffs that know what they\u2019re doing. Sending out emails to persuade voters to select your slate of delegates \u2013 after the deadline \u2013 or confusing Washington state voters for Washington, D.C., voters \u2013 well, this is not the stuff of a crack team of election veterans. It\u2019s the mark of amateurs who are learning on the job, and not quickly enough. As masterful as Trump has been on the campaign trail and in the press, Team Trump\u2019s ineptitude when it comes to the delegate process is astounding, and does not bode well for a contested convention if that\u2019s where we end up. But as laughable as it is that Trump is whining about a system he was as free to exploit as any other candidate, though, it is infuriating that he is also suggesting the Republican Party is somehow rigging the election. To say something is \u201crigged\u201d is to say it\u2019s designed to give one group an unfair advantage over another. This is, in fact, demonstrably false in both assertion and outcome. No candidate has had more advantages than Trump has, whether in terms of name recognition, press coverage or money. He also has no legislative record to scrutinize, unlike senators and governors who are actually held accountable for their positions and votes. And because of all those advantages, Trump, as he enjoys pointing out, has won more votes and more delegates than Cruz or anyone else. He has also won a higher percentage of delegates than he has voters, showing he is more than capable of securing the convention representation he will need to become the nominee. The RNC, for its part, has bent over backward to work with Trump, asking in return only that he quit openly attacking the party, a request he has ignored time and time again. Most recently, Trump called the RNC \u201cdirty tricksters,\u201d adding \u201cThey should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen.\u201d RNC chair Reince Priebus was right to call Trump out on his juvenile complaints, and doing it Trump-style, on Twitter: Nomination process known for a year + beyond. It's the responsibility of the campaigns to understand it. Complaints now? Give us all a break The truth is, if the party were to rig the election, it wouldn\u2019t be so Donald Trump was leading Ted Cruz as the two likely nominees for president. It would have \u201crigged\u201d it for Scott Walker, Jeb Bush or literally anyone else long before Trump or Cruz got within striking distance. Trump has been outfoxed by Cruz and he has no one else to blame but himself. Now, he can continue to whine like a brat about it, or he can act like a grown-up and actually learn the process.

Her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, is the co-founder and president of Business Talent Group, a global consulting marketplace, and chairman of Demos, a nonprofit public policy organization.  They are the authors of \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (Still) Going Broke,\u201d from which parts of this article are adapted The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. Elizabeth Warren and daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi say it's not building a wall but investing in America's people that will make a difference They say it took conscious policy to create a strong middle class, we can do it again America\u2019s middle class is starting to crumble. When we delivered that message in a book called \u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d back in 2003, it seemed fairly shocking.  Today, not so much. A dozen years ago, if anyone thought about it at all, they seemed to think that America\u2019s middle class was pretty close to invulnerable. Solid and invincible \u2014 and maybe even a little dull. After all, our middle class had survived wars, scandals, epidemics and a Great Depression. Surely it could survive whatever the 21st century had to throw at us. Even when reports surfaced about rising levels of economic pain, there was a story to explain it \u2014 a very comfortable story that made it easier to ignore the bad news. Books, newscasts and breathless five-part series in the local paper came to the same conclusion as your Aunt Edith, the guy in the next office, and pretty much everyone else: Americans are in trouble because they are overspending! Just look at all those Nike sneakers and big-screen TVs. The malls are jam-packed, dog leashes are studded with rhinestones, and everyone \u2014 everyone! \u2014 has a microwave. Rising health-care costs? Job insecurity? Climbing foreclosures? (Yes, back in 2003 they were already climbing.) Plug your fingers in your ears, la-la-la I can\u2019t hear you. The message was clear: Everything is great. And, if it isn\u2019t so great for you personally, then it\u2019s your own dang fault. In our book, we rejected this story.  We told a story of families with no savings, mountains of credit card debt, and mortgages that were out of sight. A story of flat-lining incomes, disappearing jobs, skyrocketing health-care costs and overwhelming college costs. A story of greedy Wall Street banks that made families\u2019 financial dealings as risky as swimming with sharks \u2014 big sharks. A story about a government unable, or unwilling, to rein in the powerful and make investments that would expand opportunities for all of America\u2019s kids. A story of families that played by the rules, hit a bump, and ended up with nothing.  And we backed it all up with hard data. Fast-forward 13 years.  \u201cThe Two-Income Trap\u201d has just been re-issued.  The shock factor is long gone. Home ownership has dropped to its lowest rate since 1967, and one in every three American families is dealing with a debt collector. Middle-class-in-perilous-trouble has migrated from \u201cThat can\u2019t be!\u201d to \u201cNo kidding.\u201d And now, the middle class is fighting for its life.  The good news is in this election year, pretty much everyone is paying attention.  Finally, finally the pressure on America\u2019 middle class is a center-of-the-plate issue. The bad news is \u2013 well, it\u2019s everywhere. The problems facing the middle-class family are complex and far-reaching, and the solutions must be, too. We wish there could be a simple silver bullet, but after a generation of relentless assault, there just isn\u2019t. When we wrote \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d we were shocked and deeply disturbed about what was happening to the middle class.  Now we\u2019re angry. But we want that anger to mean something. We want that anger to translate into real changes.  When candidates for office give simplistic answers \u2014 keep out the Mexicans or blame the Muslims \u2014 they insult everyone who is fighting to survive in a rigged game. When candidates for office give simplistic answers\u2014keep out the Mexicans or blame the Muslims\u2014they insult everyone who is fighting to survive in a rigged game. Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi Instead of digging in on the hard problems that need work, instead of figuring out how to deal with $3 trillion in deferred infrastructure repairs or how to reduce $1.2 trillion of student loan debt, these candidates offer snake oil, and America\u2019s middle class can\u2019t get stronger on a diet of snake oil. But there is one overriding idea. Together we can. It\u2019s time to say it out loud: a generation of I-got-mine policy-making has failed \u2013 failed miserably, completely and overwhelmingly. And it\u2019s time to change direction before the entire middle class has been replaced by hundreds of millions of Americans relentlessly tumbling down an economic mountain. America\u2019s middle class was built through investments in education, infrastructure and research \u2014 and by making sure we all have a safety net. We need to strengthen those building blocks: America\u2019s strong middle class was not a natural resource, like deep rivers or giant forests. It was not an accident of history or a gift bestowed by a generous king. It was something we built together, something we cultivated with patient investments and thoughtful policies, and something we once nourished and made stronger over time. We can do it again. We can build a country that works, not just for some of our children, but for all of our children. We can, and we must. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine",

Trump has mastered playing roles, including on \"The Apprentice,\" Michael D'Antonio says The one Trump has to play to win the White House is the most challenging, he writes He has repeatedly promised he can be \"unifier,\" but role has eluded him, D'Antonio says Not since Ronald Reagan have we seen a presidential candidate so experienced at playing dramatic roles. Yet as the Republican primary season enters its final two months, Donald Trump is being called upon to play a role that has eluded him \u2013 and that could determine whether he follows Reagan\u2019s path to the White House. In October, he said, \u201cI will be a great unifier for our country.\u201d  After his Super Tuesday wins, Trump struck a similar note: \u201cI\u2019m a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me.\u201d Thursday afternoon, he tweeted, \u201cJust had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together \u2013 and it will happen!\u201d Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together --- and it will happen! And ordinarily, party front-runners do play that role, rolling up endorsements from leaders and elected officials and positioning themselves to lead a broad coalition in the general election. Yet Trump hasn\u2019t warmed to the role and seemingly does almost precisely the opposite, inflaming the race with a threat to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on Ted Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi; putting forth but soon retracting the idea that women should be punished if abortions were ruled illegal; and carrying on a running defense of his campaign manager after he was charged with battery, accused of grabbing a reporter. How Donald Trump sees himself Trump\u2019s difficulty with moving into the new role contrasts with his decades of success at crafting his own image, most notably with his emergence as a flamboyant entrepreneur in the New York political and real estate worlds of the 1980s and with his reinvention as the star of the popular TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2004. Even before these exploits, he was fascinated with show business and the theater. A true film buff, he has spent his life studying Hollywood movies and developing his own talent as a showman in a series of roles that he has performed for the press, in order to sell real estate, products and ultimately himself to the American public. Now, he\u2019s asking voters to cast him as American president. Does he have it in him to unify his party and to lead the world\u2019s most powerful nation? As we decide whether he\u2019s up to the part, it may help to consider his career thus far. Does he have it in him to unify his party and to lead the world\u2019s most powerful nation? Michael D'Antonio At age 23, Trump co-produced a Broadway flop \u2013 \u201cParis is Out!\u201d \u2013 that starred Sam  Levene, who would soon win praise in \u201cThe Sunshine Boys,\u201d and Molly Picon, whose previous role had been in the hit show \u201cThe Front Page.\u201d  Sadly for them all, \u201cParis Is Out!\u201d was so vapid and unoriginal that legendary critic Walter Kerr wrote, \u201cI neither hated it nor liked it. I simply sat there and looked at it.\u201d The failure drove young Trump out of the legitimate theater for good, but it did not end his fascination with performance. Instead, he began a lifelong process of manufacturing identities, which he would present to the media and the public in place of a true self. This practice could be seen as the natural outgrowth of Norman Vincent Peale\u2019s \u201cPower of Positive Thinking,\u201d one of the young\u2019s Trump\u2019s favorite books, which advised readers to show the world that they were optimistic and successful, even when they were not. \u201cThere is a real magic in enthusiasm,\u201d argued Peale. \u201cIt spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment.\u201d Dear women who love Trump: Ditch this guy As he played his first self-made part, Trump bought fancy clothes, acquired an expensive car, hired a furloughed cop to be his driver and began spending his evenings at swanky clubs. For a young man who hated small talk and didn\u2019t drink or take drugs, the club scene was mostly a place to be noticed, hopefully in the company of celebrities or, at the very least, photogenic women. Trump the Super-Successful Young Real Estate Developer appeared in the papers, which led to a TV talk show appearance in which he was billed as a young \u201ctycoon\u201d on the rise. All this happened in 1976, before Trump had built a single project. However, the image-making served him well. When he finally did pursue the right to renovate an old hotel at Grand Central Terminal, Trump was associated with success. With the completion of the Grand Hyatt  renovation and then the famous  68-story Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, Trump was a married man of 37 with two children and a third on the way. Time for a new role: Glamorous Rich Guy. At GOP town hall, Trump's weaknesses and Cruz's strengths In his second big part, Trump surrounded himself with celebrities, many of whom \u2013 Michael Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Johnny Carson \u2013 bought apartments in the tower. He bought a football team in the soon-to-fail United States Football League and opened his home to Robin Leach and his \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\u201d TV show. It was the 1980s of Big Hair and \u201cgreed is good,\u201d and Trump seemed like a character from \u201cDallas.\u201d Although he was occasionally skewered by the likes of Spy Magazine, which originated the claim that Trump was short-fingered, Trump was more often portrayed in the press as a fabulously wealthy and successful man. He was also a master at attention-seeking, which he proved with the publicity campaign for his 1987 book \u201cThe Art of The Deal.\u201d Begun with a faux exploratory campaign for president, the assault on the media included a helicopter ride for Barbara Walters and a publishing party where outlandish boxing promoter Don King pronounced Mr. and Mrs. Trump \u201cThe king and the queen!\u201d America, wake up to the Trump menace The Glamorous Rich Guy reached the top of his story arc in the late 1980s, when Trump acquired the partially built  Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, bought New York\u2019s famous Plaza Hotel and took over the Eastern Airlines shuttle to operate under the name Trump Shuttle. Over-leveraged, Trump would see the casino go bankrupt in 1991. The airline ceased operating in 1992, and he lost the Plaza in 1995. In the middle of these very public losses came a sex scandal involving an aspiring actress named Marla Maples that ended his marriage.  As they fed the tabloid press juicy quotes, the story of Trump; his wife, Ivana; and Maples turned into a lurid spectacle.  Publicly humiliated and besieged by creditors, Trump retreated to rebuild. True to form, Trump didn\u2019t leave it to anyone else to declare that he was \u201cback.\u201d Instead, he invited a crowd of friends, acquaintances and associates to a party in Atlantic City where they were serenaded by an Elvis Presley impersonator. When the theme from the movie \u201cRocky\u201d blared from the loudspeakers, an announcer declared, \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for the king!\u201d and Trump burst through a large paper screen. He wore a red boxer\u2019s robe draped over his tuxedo and sported boxing gloves on his hands. As the crowd applauded, Trump casino executive Nick Ribis offered a salute to his boss in the style of Muhammad Ali: \u201cHe was tough and resilient and he had no fear. He made the comeback of the year. Against all odds, his opponents buckled with a thump. The winner was, Donald J. Trump\u201d With this gaudy display of showmanship, Trump insisted that he was once again on top. Evidence for this claim was scant, but it set the tone that Trump the performer wanted establish. He then turned himself to the task of rebuilding his empire. Finally, in 1996, he returned to the annual list of the 500 richest people of America, published by Forbes magazine. Bernie Sanders is this year's biggest story Trump had long pointed to the Forbes list as proof of his success. This time, he was ranked No. 373. He called the editors to complain that his net worth was much bigger than their estimate of  $450 million: \u201cI\u2019ve got that much in stock market assets alone,\u201d he told them. In 1997, he returned to the billionaires\u2019 club \u2013 $1.4 billion \u2013 and almost cracked the top 100. Still, he wasn\u2019t satisfied. He insisted,  \u201cThe real number is $3.7 billion.\u201d The pattern continued for the next couple of years. In 1999, he said the Forbes estimate of $1.6 billion was off by almost $3 billion. \u201cWe love Donald,\u201d said the Forbes editors. \u201cHe returns our calls. He usually pays for lunch. He even estimates his own net worth ($4.5 billion). But no matter how hard we try, we just can\u2019t prove it.\u201d With nearly all of his wealth privately held, Trump could say anything he wanted about his net worth, and no one could access the data to confirm or refute the figure. The public didn\u2019t seem to care. It was enough that he was a billionaire, and in true Trump fashion, he played the role well. It was enough that he was a billionaire, and in true Trump fashion, he played the role well. Michael D'Antonio Trump got the chance to solidify his new image when he was offered a starring role in an actual TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d that brought his act into America\u2019s living rooms. On the show, a cast of hopefuls competed for his favor and helped him cement himself in the public mind as an authority figure. Seated in a chair elevated to make him seem more powerful, he played the character of \u201cboss\u201d to the hilt.  Trump demonstrated his leadership style with gestures and clich\u00e9s. He used a dismissive hand gesture he called \u201cThe Cobra\u201d to punctuate the moment when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d How the GOP can avoid chaos in Cleveland Like many other reality TV shows \u2013 \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201cBig Brother,\u201d \u201cThe Real World\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d offered viewers a distorted version of events.  Days worth of filming were compressed into minutes, and scenes were cut and spliced in order to tell a story that may or may not have been true. Extra value was attached to salesmanship and scheming, two of Trump\u2019s own principal traits. Winners have been photogenic and, in the main, pursued post-contest careers that involved public speaking or media appearances. Not surprisingly, a few including Omarosa Manigault and Andy Dean have turned up as Trump boosters in the current political campaign. The best way to predict support for Trump In his presidential campaign, Trump is using a dangerous demagogue routine, which he performs in arenas filled with adoring fans, as a kind of screen test for his ultimate role as leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. In these performances, Trump evokes Forest Whitaker as the charismatic but menacing Idi Amin in \u201cThe Last King of Scotland,\u201d who proclaimed for the people that despite his high status, \u201cin my heart, I am you.\u201d Trump makes a similar appeal as the billionaire who gives voice to the struggling middle class. As a performer, he deploys every tool in the dramatist\u2019s kit, including his face, his body and his tone of voice.  When he wants to make a point, his flashes an extreme expression of disgust, rage, revulsion or glee and holds it for a few beats so that everyone in the audience, and the cameras recording the moment, get what he wants to communicate. Does Donald Trump know what he's talking about? Trump uses his body like a comedian doing standup \u2013 think Robin Williams \u2013 to amplify his emotions and say things that words cannot communicate. This is what he is doing when he contorts his arms as he talks about a disabled reporter or raises his right hand to invite a crowd to pledge allegiance, not to their nation but to him. If you are chilled by the sight of Trump\u2019s raised hand and thousands of hands raised in response to his call, this is the response he intends. No current campaigner one is more skilled at the practice of creating powerful and even frightening scenes. In his choice of gestures, as well as words, Trump is doing what what works on TV. When he announced his candidacy, Trump used the kinds of words candidates almost never utter \u2013 \u201crapists,\u201d \u201cmurderers,\u201d \u201ckilling\u201d \u2013 to provoke fear and outrage. From that moment forward, he offered ever coarser, ever more provocative remarks to hold the nation\u2019s attention. Then, in addition to demonizing foreigners, he started demonizing fellow Americans, especially protesters at his rallies. His rallies have come to resemble pro wrestling matches, with the crowd getting so riled up that they become part of the performance. It is no surprise that violence has broken out at these events. Trump has never shown the temperament that anyone would call \u201cpresidential.\u201d  Devoid of diplomatic charm and disrespectful of his adversaries, he has appalled many world leaders and alienated officials in his own party. If charming communicators like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton struggled to find support in Congress, what could we expect of a charmless President Trump? And then there\u2019s the matter of Trump\u2019s loose association with facts and ideas. As a candidate who confesses that he doesn\u2019t read books and gleans most of his knowledge from the very same press that he scapegoats at his rallies, Trump doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in those who want  a president who understands the world. Ted Cruz is the real radical in GOP race His views on the issue of trade deficits make one wonder what he learned while studying finance at the University of Pennsylvania, and his anti-terrorism plans sound like they are drawn from the TV show \u201c24.\u201d Nothing in Trump\u2019s record suggests a man who is willing to take advice from a wide range of people or one who knows how to accommodate competing concerns like human rights and security. Of course, Trump\u2019s appeal has never been to our intellect or our political principles. He has sought the presidency \u2013 his role of a lifetime \u2013 by presenting, instead, his personality and his emotion. The personality is marked by extreme self-confidence and simple conceptions of leadership. The emotions are drawn from a repertoire that would be the envy of any actor and include anger, disgust, rage, contempt, pride and paranoia. Trump\u2019s appeal has never been to our intellect or our political principles. Michael D'Antonio The trouble with Trump\u2019s tryout so far is that all that he\u2019s shown us is his ability to appeal to the darker side of human nature. Americans have never settled for such a limited version of a leader. Instead, we have wanted presidents who can comfort the nation in times of loss, bridge our divisions and call upon the better angels of our nature when we need to pull together for a higher purpose. Can Trump show us these qualities as he stakes his claim to be the No. 1 star in the world?  His performance thus far, in the campaign and in the course of his life, suggests that he doesn\u2019t have the range.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Super Tuesday isn't what it was intended to be but still can have huge impact on the presidential primary races, says Julian Zelizer Challengers to front-runners Trump and Clinton have a lot at stake, he says March 1 will be a big day for both parties. On Super Tuesday, 12 states and one U.S. territory will hold their primaries and caucuses. At stake are 595 delegates for the Republicans and 865 for the Democrats. Everything changes March 1 For each party the outcome will be significant. If Donald Trump can continue to dominate the competition and accumulate a significant number of delegates, the math will become increasingly difficult for the other GOP candidates and the momentum from the victories will put him in great position to thrive in the remaining states. Cruz, Rubio and Kasich desperately need victories to prove they are still competitive. What's so 'Super' about a Tuesday? Hillary Clinton could compound the delegate challenge that Bernie Sanders faces, taking the wind out of a campaign that surged in New Hampshire. If Sanders can win enough states to show that his campaign has real legs, he would re-energize supporters to the subsequent states. Yet Super Tuesday no longer serves its original purpose. Created in its current form in 1984 as a counterweight to the ability of insurgents to succeed in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Southern Democrats had envisioned a day with numerous contests in their region to assert their collective power in deciding who should be the party nominee. Chris Christie endorses Donald Trump This would allow them to push the party back toward the center and the establishment, serving a similar function as the South Carolina primary for Republicans. Based on a report by the Hunt Commission, several Southern states agreed to front-load the Democratic primaries in order to have a bigger impact. Although Super Tuesday initially didn\u2019t work the way Southerners hoped in the 1980s, with Sen. Walter Mondale from Minnesota winning the nomination in 1984 and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in 1988, the effects did become more significant in 1992 when Arkansan Bill Clinton won the nomination. GOP debate: A 'barroom brawl' that bloodied Trump? The Republican Party leaders also turned Super Tuesday into a major event that would ensure their preferred candidate was the front-runner. The idea was that after the party favorite gained a footing in South Carolina, only a candidate with huge financial resources, major party endorsements, and access to the substantial media coverage would be able to pull off victories. This was supposed to be the day that insurgents in either party could not survive and where the center would hold. In this topsy-turvy year, it is not certain that Super Tuesday will serve its original function. For Republicans, the odds are that the contests will end up boosting the standing of Donald Trump with a string of victories that make it almost impossible for the other candidates to bounce back. Chris Christie\u2019s endorsement will likely counteract any negative fallout from the debate, and make Trump more appealing to undecided voters in some of the states voting. Donald Trump is all your fault, John Boehner For Hillary Clinton the odds are also good. Bernie Sanders will find it difficult to translate his narrower electoral appeal to the kind of coalitions, with more conservative voters, needed to win in states like Texas. That said, some news reports are suggesting the outcome is far from certain. Politico reports that Sanders is in striking distance of victory in Vermont, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota. Just a few victories, even if the delegate count continues to go Clinton\u2019s way, would ensure a long and tough primary season for the Democrats. The older functions of Super Tuesday \u2014 as a mechanism for the party to ensure the nomination of the candidate the party barons  preferred \u2013 have become weaker because of how the campaign process has changed. As the floodgate to private money opened, more candidates have been able to gain access to the funds they need to compete in bigger states. With candidates armed with their own super PAC money, the party favorite no longer has a monopoly on resources. At the same time, Howard Dean, Barack Obama and now Bernie Sanders have shown how  technological developments have created methods of raising mass amounts of small donations quickly. Robbins: It's over; Trump is going to be the Republican nominee The media \u2013 in fact, society \u2013 has undergone a dramatic revolution that is changing the campaign game. As Jill Lepore argues in The New Yorker, major transformations in communications have historically shaken up the party systems. \u201cWith our phones in our hands and our eyes on our phones, each of us is a reporter, each a photographer, unedited and ill judged, chatting, snapping, tweeting, and posting, yikking and yakking.\u201d For Hillary Clinton, a turning point The open-ended nature of the new media has given all the candidates opportunities to make a huge imprint in the national dialogue. Nobody has done this better than Trump, who has brilliantly exploited Twitter to gain constant attention. Sanders has also proven effective at gaining media interest by embracing the role of the political revolutionary. The free-wheeling media has exploded the possibility of a party front-runner having a monopoly on access and coverage. Before, during and after Super Tuesday numerous voices can gain a hearing. Super Tuesday also has less power because the entire election process has been nationalized. This is no longer the single day when everyone is watching. The entire campaign is a major event. The campaign industrial complex, as it has been called, is so vast and so enormous that this campaign has been going on for months, long before Iowa. As a result, it is harder for any one moment to be as decisive in creating \u201cmomentum.\u201d Voter volatility is another factor that makes sizing up Super Tuesday\u2019s impact in 2016 particularly difficult. The electorate is very angry; great frustration exists with the status quo. The anger is driven by two factors: anxiety that has been created by the new normal in an economy where the middle class always feels insecure and the division between rich and poor keeps growing and a problematic political system that gives enormous power to wealthy candidates and contributors while Washington seems totally gridlocked. Still, the large delegate bounty of Super Tuesday and the narratives surrounding the front-runners in each party will likely make March 1 a particularly important milestone. Even if this isn\u2019t your grandfather\u2019s Super Tuesday, the stakes remain large and the day will significantly push the nomination battles in a more decisive direction.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Watch CNN\u2019s Iowa Town Hall with the Democratic presidential candidates at 9 p.m. ET Monday.  Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, is the founder of Purple Strategies and NewRepublican.org. Follow him on Twitter @alexcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Bernie Sanders is only doing as well as he is because of the faults of Hillary Clinton as a candidate, says Alex Castellanos Sanders promises the base something that energizes them; Hillary's attacks on him fall flat Poor Hillary Clinton.  She has the Sadim Touch; the Midas touch spelled backward. An untidy, 74-year-old socialist from Vermont should never have been able to climb into the ring with the former first lady, our 67th secretary of state and co-owner of one America\u2019s most loved political brands.  At least in the early rounds, however, Bernie Sanders has pinned Clinton to the ropes, pummeling her with solid left hands. The biggest contributor to Sanders\u2019 success is neither the small-dollar donor who sustains him nor the millennials who flock to his rallies.  The co-author of Sanders\u2019 accomplishment is Hillary Clinton.  Sen. Sanders\u2019 indispensable assistant has been the candidate he\u2019s running against. I\u2019ve only met Clinton once.  She was fun and warm and rendered a few minutes a delightful experience.  The public persona she has created is of a different character, a woman who has fought, not for people, but for survival and power. Is Bernie Sanders right about health care? The political Clinton is regarded as a strong, chilly, no-nonsense contender, not a passionate warrior for causes beyond her self-interest. Voters understand that what Clinton has endured has toughened her.  If she had shown weakness or surrendered to emotion on her journey, it is doubtful she\u2019d be where she is today. Clinton is as much a member of the establishment as anyone in the Democratic Party.  In a debate, she described one of her signal achievements: \u201cI represented Wall Street as the senator from New York.\u201d With her party in hot revolt against the status quo, neither her frosty pragmatism nor establishment credentials endear her to the Democratic base. Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic Party is far left of the one her husband, Bill Clinton, fashioned when he said: \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s party has been radicalized by Internet activism. Social media has not only concentrated the Democratic Party on its left, it has also squared its intensity, much like talk-radio flamed fires on the Republican right. Success on Twitter is not earned by the moderate or the meek. Bloomberg for President? Today\u2019s Democratic Party has little room for old-school, mechanical pragmatists such as Clinton.  Its heart belongs to the rebellious, agitators such as Elizabeth Warren.  Combine George McGovern\u2019s 1960 anti-war protest campaign with a dash of the \u201cDecade of Love.\u201d  Tailor the mix with a sprinkle of 2016;  iPhones, principled shoes (TOMS, \u201cThe Shoes That Educate Poor People!\u201d) and replace LSD with a few pharmacological mood-stabilizers to round life\u2019s sharp edges.  There, you have Bernie Sanders\u2019 throwback-to-the-future campaign: It is fantasy camp for middle-class, wannabe \u201960s radicals.  It is an undemanding revolution, accessible without risk or effort. They would be more comfortable Ubering to Wall Street than marching on it, but their mission of insurrection is unchanged. Before Sanders is done, Democrats may again wear bell-bottoms with peace-sign patches.  Gallup reports that 59% of Democrats have no problem embracing a self-described socialist for president. Perhaps no campaign comes naturally to Hillary Clinton.  She is more comfortable with process than with people.  But this particular crusade, requiring her to overthrow the very establishment to which she belongs and to undermine the rich, among whom she must be counted, has been uniquely difficult for her. Ta-Nehisi Coates' flawed attack on Bernie Sanders Clinton has campaigned with awkward artificiality.  She has advocated her party\u2019s new lefty-populism with the grace of Charles Barkley\u2019s golf swing. She has tried. She broke with President Barack Obama on the Trans-Pacific Free-Trade Deal.  She cloned Sanders\u2019 support of the $15 an hour federal minimum wage.  With robotic focus, Clinton even pretended to be Elizabeth Warren. When she said, \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that\u2026 businesses create jobs,\u201d she looked like a right-handed NFL quarterback attempting a left-handed completion. Clinton is no more comfortable as candidate of the little guy than Richard Nixon walking on the beach in wing tips. Still, the Democratic Party did not cover its ears.  It tried to teach its discordant candidate to sing harmony. Why Iowa's evangelical voters matter At the beginning of the campaign, Democrats had accepted that Clinton offered the best shot at winning a general election and protecting the White House from a somewhat deranged mob of Republicans. And Democrats owed a debt to Clinton:  Eight years ago, they chose to correct injustices of race before those of gender.  They nominated the first black president instead of the first female president.  Democrats sent Hillary Clinton and the women of America to the back of the bus to wait their turn.  They hoped not to do that again. Dear Ted Cruz... Then, Bernie Sanders gave Democrats an opportunity to party like it\u2019s 1967.  They could dig their tie-dyed shirts out of the closet while helping Clinton. They could bring her home to their middle-class version of Woodstock, this time with cozy theater seating and no mud.  By embracing Sanders, they could pressure Clinton to move left: At last, she would be like them. Initially, Sanders was not Clinton\u2019s opponent.  He was a plea from concerned friends, imploring Clinton to renew herself as Hillary Rodham, Wellesley grad, and restore her radicalism. But Clinton achieved the impossible.  She transformed Bernie Sanders from an unelectable messenger to serious opponent.  Again, the Sidam Touch doomed her. Instead of letting the base of her party send her a message, Clinton attacked their messenger.  While Sanders runs ads with a 1968 Simon & Garfunkel anthem, inspiring Democrats to \u201call come to look for America,\u201d Clinton has fought back angrily.  Her campaign has called Sanders a \u201csocialist,\u201d a move of questionable effect, in that he has proudly admitted the same. For millennials, Sanders is a grandpa who gets them Clinton is running Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign against the Democratic left at the same time she is appealing to it.  She is trying to murder the \u201960s. For the past month, Clinton has thought she has been attacking her opponent.  She has actually been condemning the Democratic Party\u2019s base as it has been trying to rescue her.  Instead of telling them, \u201cI hear you!\u201d she has informed them, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d  Her attacks have worked in reverse, expanding Sanders\u2019 advantage day by day. In the first two states, Clinton has run out of time. The most powerful thing Democratic caucus and primary voters can do with their ballots is not consent to Clinton\u2019s rejection of their heartfelt, \u201960s interpretation of populism but to send her a louder message: Defeats in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Why Sanders' Simon & Garfunkel ad raises goose bumps When the nomination process heads south and west after New Hampshire and the population of black and brown voters grows, Clinton\u2019s fortunes may improve \u2013 if she is capable of finding her inner radical and applying her strength where Democrats value it, striking at Republicans instead of her base.  \u201cThe enemy of my enemy,\u201d she should remember, \u201cis my friend.\u201d Genuine poll-tested, fake-sincere authenticity, however, is not Clinton\u2019s gift.  Communing with the little people may not be in her. In politics, tides usually rise and fall to their previous marks.  The tide has gone out on Clinton before.  It could easily do so again. Poor Hillary Clinton has the Sadim Touch.  Everything she taps turns to lead. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell is issuing a grave warning to Republicans: Repealing Obamacare will result in \u201cchaos.\u201d Burwell, President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services, told CNN Wednesday that dismantling the Affordable Care Act will hit millions of Americans\u2019 healthcare coverage, result in a spike in premiums and unleash widespread uncertainty across the insurance market. Why Obamacare could be the messiest battle of 2017 The secretary\u2019s sober remarks came five weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s Election Night victory \u2014 an unexpected outcome that has suddenly handed the Republican Party an opening to overhaul Obama\u2019s signature policy accomplishment. In anticipation of Trump\u2019s inauguration on January 20, GOP lawmakers are preparing to vote to repeal key portions of Obamacare early next month. \u201cIf there is repeal, there would be chaos,\u201d Burwell said in an interview at a diner in Newark, New Jersey. \u201cIf your child is on your policy \u2018til 26, and it\u2019s repealed, that goes away. If you have a pre-existing condition \u2013 asthma, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, any of those things \u2013 you could be kept off of insurance if you had to make a move or a transition or were unemployed for a portion of time.\u201d She added: \u201cThe 20 million folks who have gotten insurance \u2013 that would go away too.\u201d That 20 million figure is the estimated net increase of individuals insured through Obamacare. Many policy experts agree with Burwell that the law, now almost  seven years old, is so massive and complicated that rolling it back would inevitably be a messy and disruptive process. 4 million people sign up for Obamacare as deadline nears Burwell cautioned that even a partial repeal would have a domino effect on the entire health care system, and that coming up with a replacement is a massive endeavor. \u201cIt is a difficult task and our system is one where when you move one piece, it\u2019s related to another piece,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Jenga puzzle. And if you pull a piece out, you can make the thing tumble.\u201d To counter these concerns, Republican lawmakers have suggested putting off when the repeal would go into effect by as many as three years \u2013 a plan that has been dubbed \u201crepeal and delay\u201d in Washington. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fierce critic of Obamacare, has pointed to that hypothetical transition period as a way to ensure that nobody is \u201cworse off\u201d after repeal. Burwell replied: \u201c\u2018repeal and delay\u2019 is a repeal and recipe for collapse.\u201d \u201cInsurance companies have to make their decisions in the first half of the year \u2013 whether or not they\u2019re going to be in the marketplace and what prices they\u2019re going to charge,\u201d she said. \u201cWith that level of uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen studies and more and more analysis is coming out that what insurance companies will do \u2013 many of them \u2013 will make the choice to be out of the marketplace or else to raise their prices dramatically.\u201d Obamacare chaos: Insurers may flee before new plan is put in place Trump has nominated Georgia Rep. Tom Price to be Burwell\u2019s successor at the Department of Health and Human Services. An orthopedic surgeon, the Republican congressman has authored several versions of an Obamacare replacement plan and is Capitol Hill\u2019s most outspoken critics of the ACA. Trump Chief of Staff Priebus promises busy 'first 9 months' Burwell told CNN that she has congratulated Price on his nomination and offered her assistance in executing a smooth transition. But despite the cordial tone, Burwell nevertheless echoed many of her fellow Democrats by going after Price\u2019s Obamacare repeal blueprint. \u201cIt actually goes even further than repealing,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, 11 million seniors have benefited $23 billion \u2013 that\u2019s something the congressman\u2019s plan wants to take away. The other thing is, the congressman has proposals on Medicare and the employer-based market that would do things that would potentially increase costs for individuals in those markets.\u201d Trump Chief of Staff Priebus promises busy \u2018first 9 months\u2019 Working with Democratic lawmakers and other Obama administration officials, Burwell has been touring cities on the East Coast this week to encourage Americans to meet this week\u2019s December 15 enrollment deadline for coverage beginning on January 1. Over cookies and muffins at Tops Diner in Newark on Wednesday, Burwell spoke with several individuals who said they would not be able to afford their current coverage if not for the Affordable Care Act. David Moyer, a 34-year-old man from Westwood, New Jersey, says he is a big beneficiary of Obamacare. Prior to the law, he said, he and his wife paid around $500 a month for a plan that covered little and had a sky-high deductible of over $10,000. Now, he says, the couple pays less than $300 each month, doesn\u2019t have a co-pay for their doctor, pays nothing for generic medicine and has a deductible of $1,000 each. Asked how he feels about GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare, Moyer said, \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you and say that it\u2019s not something that I\u2019m worried about. I would hope that our lawmakers who represent us would realize the good that the Affordable Care Act has done for people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Will Obama weigh in publicly on Democrats' leadership battle? Schumer plans to fight repeal of Obamacare, privatizing Medicare Leadership battles within the Democratic Party. The fight over repealing Obamacare. And the story of an awkward hallway scramble two decades ago involving Al Gore and Fidel Castro. It\u2019s all part of our weekly \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast, where you get next week\u2019s headlines today. House Democrats pick their leadership team this week, and while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remains a prohibitive favorite, there is more drama than usual because of discontent over the presidential election and calls for fresh stewardship. Her rival is a congressman she once mentored, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who says he remains a huge Pelosi fan but that it is time for new leadership. Tim Ryan to challenge Nancy Pelosi CNN\u2019s Manu Raju shared some insights on the process that will culminate with a secret ballot later in the week. \u201cShe\u2019s taking steps to reassure skeptics that she is listening to them, bringing in new voices into the leadership team and also telling these top rank-and-file members that they will have more of a platform on the committees to voice their positions,\u201d said Raju. \u201cWhat they want to hear is a concrete plan for the Democrats to regain the House majority, not necessarily by 2018 but by 2020.\u201d There is a new leader on the Democratic side in the Senate \u2013 New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer \u2013 and he is raring to battle the Trump White House and congressional Republicans on two big health care issues. One is the President-elect\u2019s promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The other is House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to privatize Medicare. Paul Ryan: We'll replace Obamacare with better option Ed O\u2019Keefe of The Washington Post recently interviewed Schumer and shared some of the new leader\u2019s thinking on how Democrats will push back against GOP healthcare reforms. \u201cHe says, \u2018Think about all of the good things in this law that they don\u2019t want to take away.\u2019 They are preparing to highlight that over the course of the next few months,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cThe idea that 20 million people are covered, that women have more protection and coverage than they ever did before, that younger people can stay on their parents plans \u2013 he (Schumer) says Republicans will rue the day that they decided to try to repeal Obamacare.\u201d One recurring criticism of President Obama from fellow Democrats these past eight years is that he hasn\u2019t shown much interest in the nitty-gritty work of the Democratic National Committee. But as Obama prepares to move out of the White House, he and his team are taking an interest in the race to pick a new DNC chief \u2013 adding a new wrinkle to what already was a tense debate among Democrats. Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison has the backing of influential voices like Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But team Obama reportedly believes Labor Secretary Tom Perez or former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm would be better choices. Sanders: Ellison is 'the candidate we need' for DNC Lisa Lerer of the Associated Press waded through some of the Obama White House\u2019s calculations. \u201cOne person everyone is watching, of course, is President Obama,\u201d said Lerer.  \u201cThe big question is whether he gets involved. It\u2019s unclear whether the White House will go from behind-the-scenes whispers to a public position that will certainly influence where this goes.\u201d Repealing and replacing Obamacare isn\u2019t just a big debate in Washington. It\u2019s also being watched closely in state capitals, including those with Republican governors. Many of them reduced the rolls of the uninsured by taking advantage of a Medicaid expansion included in the health care law. CNN\u2019s Nia Malika Henderson noted the governors could face a political backlash if major changes are enacted. How quickly will Congress repeal Obamacare? \u201cIf you look at the expansion of Medicaid particularly, that\u2019s covered about 15 million people roughly. About 10 governors \u2026 Republican governors, have this expansion of Medicaid in their state,\u201d said Henderson. \u201cThey are looking to be very involved in terms what this repeal \u2013 and particularly the replace \u2013 is going to look like, because they are on the front lines of these folks in their states who have the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\u201d The death of Fidel Castro stirred a memory of a long-ago encounter that was part comedy and part trouble. It was in May 1994, at the historic inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa. Vice President Al Gore led the U.S. delegation, which also included then First Lady Hillary Clinton. A Who\u2019s Who of world leaders were on hand, including Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro. Crowds cheer Castro's death in Miami At one point before the ceremony, Gore and Castro ended up in the same hallway of the parliament building, and the Cuban leader seemed determined to get in a quick hello. But it was considered taboo, of course, for a US leader to have any dealings with Castro, so the Vice President and his Secret Service detail took a zig-zag path to avoid any contact with him. Two young White House staffers were later reprimanded, however, when word surfaced they took the opportunity to pose for a photograph with Castro, who was smiling as he mingled with other dignitaries in his trademark military uniform.",

            "article_content": "Trump told the paper he was reconsidering his stance after Thursday's meeting with Obama It's a far cry from what Trump uttered during the primary to his boisterous fans at rallies President-elect Donald Trump appeared open Friday to compromising on his oft-repeated pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2013 citing a conversation with none other than President Barack Obama himself. But the openness was complicated by a shift in the official positions listed on his website. The comments, made in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, signal less of a policy shift for Trump than a change from the rhetoric that helped win him the presidency just three days ago and could set up a fight with conservatives. Trump told the paper he was reconsidering his stance after Thursday\u2019s meeting with Obama, who urged him to protect parts of the law. Trump said he would like to keep the provision forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and to allow young Americans to remain on their parents\u2019 healthcare plans. \u201cEither Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,\u201d he said, acknowledging that it was Obama, who met with Trump in the Oval Office for 90 minutes, who encouraged him to reconsider. \u201cI told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that.\u201d Trump reiterated his plan in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to ensure individuals with pre-existing conditions continue to have coverage. \u201cYes, because it happens to be one of the strongest assets,\u201d Trump said. Trump went on to explain to CBS that he would also try to keep the measure that allows young people to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance plans until age 26. Americans are freaking out about losing Obamacare \u201cWe\u2019re going to very much try to keep that. It adds cost but it\u2019s very much something we\u2019re going to try to keep,\u201d Trump said. When pressed about the time between repealing and replacing Obamacare, Trump assured CBS correspondent Leslie Stahl that the two would happen \u201csimultaneously.\u201d \u201cIt will be just fine. That\u2019s what I do, I do a good job. You know, I know how to do this stuff. We\u2019re going to repeal it and replace it. We\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced and we\u2019ll know. And it will be great health care for much less money,\u201d Trump said. But the President-elect did not offer a replacement plan. Trump also told the Journal that he would bring the country together and that \u201cI want a country that loves each other.\u201d But that grace did not extend to any reflection on his coarse rhetoric. When asked about whether his language was inappropriate, Trump said: \u201cNo. I won.\u201d Trump\u2019s positions on Friday are not entirely new, as he\u2019s previously voiced support for certain parts of Obamacare as a candidate. But the statement, three days after Americans elected him president, is a fresh sign that he may be willing to distance himself from some of his campaign positioning, such as calling for the immediate repeal and replace of Obamacare. And it\u2019s a far cry from what Trump uttered during the primary to his boisterous fans at rallies. \u201cLook at the mess, and look at the corruption,\u201d Trump said at a rally just a day before Election Day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \u201cReal change begins immediately with the repealing and replacing of the disaster known as Obamacare.\u201d Also on Friday, The Washington Post reported that Trump has revised his health care agenda to steer it more in line with Republican Party orthodoxy. The paper said the presidential transition website has been edited to now include allowing health care workers to not perform acts that would violate their religious or moral beliefs and to \u201cprotect innocent human life from conception to natural death.\u201d The paper also said the website omits Trump\u2019s call to allow Americans to import prescription drugs from other countries where they are sold at lower prices. Trump has previously voiced support for other provisions of Obamacare. At CNN\u2019s town hall in February, Trump said he likes the Obamacare mandate that requires every American to be insured. He went even further in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview last year. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Scott Pelley. \u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d But in his plan, he says: \u201cOur elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.\u201d At CNN\u2019s GOP debate in February, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare but maintain the provision that insurers must cover people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cI want to keep pre-existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it,\u201d he told Dana Bash. His plan, however, offers no defense of those with pre-existing conditions. Instead, he said Obamacare must be repealed \u201ccompletely.\u201d Trump was most emphatic when talking about having the government take care of poor people who are sick. \u201cYou cannot let people die on the street, OK? Now, some people would say, \u2018That\u2019s not a very Republican thing to say.\u2019 Every time I say this at a rally \u2026 it got a standing ovation,\u201d he said at a CNN town hall in February. \u201cThe problem is that everybody thinks that you people, as Republicans, hate the concept of taking care of people that are really, really sick and are gonna die. We gotta take care of people that can\u2019t take care of themselves.\u201d On the trail, Trump sketched different ways of accomplishing this. He\u2019s mentioned making deals with hospitals and \u201cconcepts of Medicare.\u201d But in his plan, he only says that no one should slip through the cracks because they can\u2019t afford coverage. While he wants to repeal Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion provision, he says it could be accomplished by reviewing \u201cbasic options for Medicaid\u201d and working with states to ensure health care is provided to those who want it.",

            "article_content": "A 2013 speech by Clinton shows she was once more open to major changes in entitlement programs than she is now Entitlements and debt will be one of the issues at Wednesday night's debate in Las Vegas A closed-door speech to Morgan Stanley in 2013, revealed in hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks, could stoke new questions for Hillary Clinton Wednesday night about whether she truly believes in the fiscal sustainability of the promises she is making on the campaign trail. In the speech, Clinton referred to the 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan as \u201cthe right framework,\u201d a stance that is seemingly at odds with her 2016 platform. Throughout the year, Clinton has been decidedly to the left of Simpson-Bowles, which called for a series of changes, including raising the Social Security retirement age from 67 to 69, cutting the growth of future benefits and considering a change in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 if health care costs grow faster than expected. While the general election has been seemingly void of policy issues, the future of Social Security and Medicare may come up at Wednesday\u2019s final presidential debate, where \u201cdebt and entitlements\u201d are one of six pre-selected topics. Should you let your kids watch the final debate? Obama: Trump's rigged election claim 'whining before the game's even over' WikiLeaks has posted roughly 15,000 emails hacked from campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s account this month, with more to come. The Clinton campaign is not confirming the authenticity of any of the individual emails and sharply criticized Trump for not condemning what they view to be a hack directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the purpose of influencing the US election. But the Clinton campaign is simultaneously distancing itself from the Simpson-Bowles framework and is suggesting that the Democratic nominee is now firmly in the liberal camp wanting to expand benefits. \u201cSince the beginning of the campaign, Secretary Clinton has committed to expanding Social Security and she\u2019s made clear that she would not raise the retirement age or reduce cost of living adjustments,\u201d Clinton spokesperson Julie Wood told CNN In her 2016 campaign, Clinton has promised to look at raising Social Security taxes on wealthier Americans without specifying exactly how she would do it. Currently, the Social Security tax only applies to the first $118,500 of income. At the same time, Clinton has shied away from the kinds of restraints on spending advocated in the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. But in the April 2013 Morgan Stanley speech, Clinton suggested that Democrats who call for higher taxes while rejecting restraints on spending contribute to Washington\u2019s \u201cgridlocked dysfunction\u201d because they leave no room for compromise with Republicans. \u201c[T]he Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. The specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues, and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that,\u201d said Clinton, according to the speech excerpt contained in the stolen email. \u201c[Y]ou\u2019ve got Democrats saying that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that\u2019s the sine qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into spending,\u201d she said according to the excerpts. \u201cWell, look what\u2019s happened.\u201d WikiLeaks releases transcripts of Clinton Goldman Sachs speeches Trump tried to seize on the Simpson-Bowles hacked email while campaigning last week in Pennsylvania. \u201cThe speeches also show that Crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton\u2019s public position is a lie,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security. She wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare and Medicaid. And I am going to save them.\u201d Trump\u2019s suggestion that Clinton would \u201cknock the hell\u201d out of Social Security and Medicare has been called \u201cfalse\u201d by CNN\u2019s Reality Check team \u2014 the Simpson-Bowles blueprint would not have amounted to drastic cuts as suggested by Trump\u2019s language. Trump has endorsed sweeping tax cuts and a \u201chands off\u201d approach to entitlements that could explode the nation\u2019s debt somewhere between $5.3 trillion and $7 trillion, according to studies conducted by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Policy Center, leading to the obvious question of how that can be paid for and maintained. On her website, Clinton promises to \u201coppose reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments\u201d and to \u201coppose Republican efforts to raise the retirement age\u201d \u2013 stances that her staff reaffirmed this week to CNN. The Simpson-Bowles blueprint, by contrast, called for both of those moves: it would have raised the retirement age and it would have changed how annual cost-of-living adjustments are calculated, a controversial move that would have meant lower benefits for some Social Security recipients. Changing how benefits are calculated would have reduced deficits by an estimated $280 billion over a decade. Maya MacGuineas, the president of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, maintains that the Simpson-Bowles debt plan was an \u201copportunity missed\u201d for a country that is currently on track to add $9 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt over the next 10 years. \u201cUnder Simpson-Bowles, debt was projected to peak around 70% of gross domestic product and come back down to less than 55% of GDP by 2026,\u201d MacGuineas wrote in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cInstead, under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals, the country is on track for debt to be 86% of GDP in 2026 or 105% of GDP under Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201d MacGuineas says that a debt burden of this magnitude would slow future growth, starve public investment, and eventually lead to even larger across-the-board cuts. Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group leading the charge for expanding Social Security benefits, told CNN that he is not surprised that Clinton appears to have been supportive of Simpson-Bowles back in 2013. Green said the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d has shifted since then due to organizing efforts of liberal activists and the support of leaders on Capitol Hill like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton\u2019s praise of the Simpson-Bowles framework \u201cwould be concerning if it were a private comment last week,\u201d said Green. \u201cBut it is not a surprise that she held the view of many other Democrats \u2013 including President Obama \u2013 in 2013.\u201d Green says that Trump has been voicing a \u201cfaux populism\u201d: he talks about protecting Social Security and Medicare while advocating deep tax cuts for the rich. According to a recent study by the Tax Policy Center, Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for the top 1% of earners by $317,000 per year despite saying back in April on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show that he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy including himself. Clinton, by contrast, has proposed a series of measures to raise taxes on Americans who make more than $250,000 per year with the heaviest burden falling on multi-millionaires. Deficit hawks are looking forward to Wednesday\u2019s debate, believing that the nation\u2019s fiscal challenges have been virtually ignored during the 2016 campaign. \u201cThey are both embracing free lunch economics,\u201d MacGuineas said of Trump and Clinton \u201cin that they are not holding themselves responsible for dealing with \u2026 the $9 trillion that we are on track to borrow.\u201d \u201cI would challenge anyone to point to any hard choice that either candidate has proposed during this campaign,\u201d she added. While criticizing both candidates for not doing enough on the debt, MacGuineas was quick to point out that there is an important difference between the proposals that Trump and Clinton have put forward thus far. \u201cShe would grow the debt by [an additional] $200 billion over 10 years,\u201d said MacGuineas. \u201cTrump would grow the debt by [an additional] $5.3 trillion.\u201d \u201cClinton has taken the critically important step of saying that these fiscal issues matter while Trump is absolutely burying his head in the sand,\u201d said MacGuineas. \u201cThey are not equivalent but neither is sufficiently fiscally responsible.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s a round-up of this week\u2019s whoppers from the campaign trail: During the presidential debate, Donald Trump, at times paced the stage like an angry man, sometimes bringing him physically close to Hillary Clinton. This led to an argument over just who was invading whose space. \u201cHe was really all wrought up and you could just sense how much anger he had,\u201d Clinton told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview. \u201cAnd, so he was really trying to dominate and then literally stalk me around the stage and I would just feel this presence behind me and I thought, \u2018Whoa this is really weird,\u2019 so I was just trying to stay focused.\u201d Trump saw it differently. \u201cI was standing by my lectern, and all of a sudden from nowhere, she walks right in front of me,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly later in the week. \u201cI never walked near her. She stands right in front of me. The next day, it was I was in her space. I was standing at my chair, my lectern.\u201d So who\u2019s right? As the old sportscaster Warner Wolf used to say, let\u2019s go to the videotape. There are a couple of instances where Trump and Clinton have close encounters on stage. But the one that stands out occurs during a question from an audience member about the Affordable Care Act. Here\u2019s the blow-by-blow: Trump is about to answer the question when he is reminded by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, who co-hosted the debate, that it\u2019s actually Clinton\u2019s turn to respond. As the two candidates banter over who should speak first, Trump walks towards the front of the stage, away from the questioner and away from his chair and lectern. When it is decided that Clinton will go first, she crosses the stage behind \u2013 not in front of \u2013 Trump towards the questioner. She stops just in front of Trump\u2019s chair and lectern and begins her answer. As she speaks, Trumps walks back to his chair and stands there waiting for her to finish. That takes him perilously close to Clinton who is still standing only a few feet in front of him. There is no question that Trump, a big man, looms almost ominously behind the much smaller Clinton. It is especially jarring because the camera angle from the front makes him look even closer. But, the fact is, he is correct. He is standing by his chair and his lectern. Sure, he could have backed away from Clinton but the area close to the chair and lectern is his space and he has every right to be there. He does not appear to be \u201cstalking\u201d her. This round goes to Trump. A new ad from the Trump campaign called \u201cCorruption\u201d contains a bevy of explosive charges. Check out the script: The Clinton: from dead broke to worth hundreds of millions\u2026\nSo how did Hillary end up filthy rich?\nPay to play politics. Staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America.\nHillary cut deals for donors.\nSold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need. She even handed over American uranium rights to the Russians.\nHillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself.  Pretty hard-hitting, right? The only problem is that by compiling unsubstantiated claims, misleading statements and one outright falsehood, the Trump campaign has produced an ad that is breathtaking in its dishonesty. It is certainly true that the Clintons went from what Hillary Clinton termed \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House in 2001 to earning more than $10 million in 2015 and $28 million the year before, as well as owning at least three properties \u2013 two in New York, one in Washington \u2013 valued in the millions. But the ad suggests the couple became rich because of \u201cstaggering amounts of cash\u201d given to the Clinton Foundation. This is false. The Clintons, according to the foundation\u2019s tax records, do not receive any income from the foundation. And according to the Clinton\u2019s personal tax records, they receive most of their income from books and paid speeches. Neither the narrator, nor any background text in the ad identify the criminals, dictators and countries that \u201chate America\u201d that have allegedly given to the foundation. To be sure, the relief effort in Haiti following the catastrophic 2010 earthquake \u2013 an effort that was, in many ways led by Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 has been a mixed-success. Some aspects of the overall relief effort have been criticized for poor planning and cronyism. But because the ad does not specifically say how Haitians were \u201cexploited,\u201d we can\u2019t issue a verdict. The charge that Clinton personally gave American uranium rights to the Russians is, at best, misleading. The US government did, indeed, approve a deal that allowed a Russian state agency to purchase a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian company with significant uranium assets in the US. The company, at one time, included investors who had contributed to the Clinton Foundation. The State Department did approve the transaction. But it was one of nine US agencies, including Treasury, Commerce, Defense, Energy and Homeland Security, as well as at least one state regulator, that had to sign off on the deal. Overall this ad is false. At a Pennsylvania rally last week, Trump said that excerpts of speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street bankers show the Democrat wants to gut entitlement programs. \u201cThe speeches also show that Crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton\u2019s public position is a lie. She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security. She wants to knock the hell out of your Medicare and Medicaid. And I am going to save them,\u201d he said. The excerpts were contained in Clinton campaign officials\u2019 emails which were hacked and revealed by WikiLeaks. In the excerpts, Clinton spoke approvingly of the approach taken by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, who co-chaired a commission to come up with ways to reduce the federal debt. \u201cSo, you know, the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right,\u201d she told a gathering sponsored by Morgan Stanley. \u201cThe specifics can be negotiated and argued over. But you\u2019ve got to do all three. You have to restrain spending, you have to have adequate revenues and you have to have growth. And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that.\u201d Among the recommendations that Simpson and Bowles made was a plan to shore up the Social Security Trust Fund. The plan included gradually increasing payroll taxes on high earners, a restructuring of benefits to increase the amount of retirement payments for lower income workers while decreasing the amount for upper income ones. The plan also called for gradually increasing the age a person could draw full Social Security benefits from age 66, which it was in 2010 when the recommendations were made to 69 in 2075. Whether one agrees that raising taxes on high earners and raising the retirement age by three years over a 65-year-period is \u201cknocking the hell out of Social Security,\u201d the fact is the excerpts released by WikiLeaks so far do not show Clinton specifically calling for cuts in Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Indeed, she said the specifics of Simpson-Bowles approach \u201ccan be negotiated.\u201d Who knows what Clinton will do if she is elected president. But, based on what she has said so far, there is no evidence that she would severely cut Social Security or Medicare. During the presidential debate, Clinton asserted that Russia was behind the hacking of computer systems related to the Democratic Party as well as WikiLeaks\u2019 release of thousands of emails. Clinton said Moscow was trying to influence the presidential election to favor Trump. \u201cOur intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election and WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cAnd believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\u201d Recently, the Obama administration said it was \u201cconfident\u201d Russia was behind recent hackings of the Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations over the summer. \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. The statement also said the hacks and then publishing of these emails are \u201cintended to interfere with the US election process.\u201d Russia has denied all involvement in hacking attacks on US servers and organizations, saying the accusations are \u201cnonsense.\u201d While there has been speculation that the hacking benefits Trump as it has targeted Democrats and Clinton, the intelligence community has not reached that conclusion. So Clinton\u2019s assertion that the hack was meant to benefit Trump may be her hunch, but not the conclusion of investigators. We rate that false. In his speech on Friday in Cleveland, President Barack Obama put out a litany of reasons he said made Trump unfit to be commander in chief. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a guy who\u2019s insulted POWs and attacks a Gold Star mom and has called our troops and veterans weak,\u201d Obama said. Just a minute here. Called troops and veterans weak? Obama is, no doubt referring to remarks that Trump made recently to a group of veterans. In response to a question about programs he would use to combat PTSD, Trump said: \u201cWhen you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you\u2019re strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can\u2019t handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn\u2019t see in a movie, nobody would believe it.\u201d This kind of stream-of-consciousness sentence could easily confuse anybody. It has led many people to conclude that Trump was saying anyone who suffers from PTSD is weak. But a fair parsing of his words done by some fact-checkers such as Snopes.com does not lead to that conclusion. Just because some people in the room, in Trump\u2019s view are strong and can handle the horrible things they have seen in war, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that others in the room \u2013 or outside for that matter \u2013 who can\u2019t handle horrible memories of war are weak, a term Trump never used. But, even if that is what Trump meant, Obama takes it a step too far by suggesting that the Republican called all troops and veterans weak. CNN\u2019s Justin Gamble contributed to this report.",

The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate and selected key statements from both candidates, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Trump on Obamacare premiums By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump cited Obamacare as one of the top problems he wants to address if he is elected president. \u201cWhen I watch the deals being made and watch what\u2019s happening with horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care are going up by numbers that are astronomical. By 68%, 59% and 71%,\u201d Trump said. It\u2019s true that some insurers are raising some of their plans\u2019 premiums by that much, but that\u2019s not the typical increase. Insurers have requested a rate hike of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan for 2017, up from 2% for this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The vast majority of Obamacare enrollees, however, don\u2019t see those massive hikes. Some 85% of them receive federal subsidies that can lower their premium to less than 10% of their income. Verdict: True, but misleading. Reality Check: Clinton on 90% insured rate By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Clinton praised Obamacare as providing health insurance for 20 million people who didn\u2019t have it before. \u201cRight now, we are at 90% health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we have ever been,\u201d she said. Clinton is right that the largest share of Americans now have health insurance. It\u2019s actually even more than 90%. The uninsured rate was 8.6% in the first three months of this year, according to the National Health Interview Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means a record 91.4% of Americans were insured. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Canadians traveling for health care By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN In response to a question on Obamacare, Trump said, \u201cIf you ever noticed Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States, in many cases because their system is so slow it\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.\u201d According to a 2015 report by the conservative Canadian think tank Frasier Institute, \u201cIn 2014, more than 52,000 Canadians received non-emergency medical treatment outside Canada.\u201d The 52,000 is an increase of about 10,000 from the previous year. The report last year said one reason for patients traveling abroad is the long wait times in Canada, which were reported to be nearly 10 weeks for treatments deemed medically necessary. The report itself says it does not have exact numbers but assumes it underestimates. That said, 52,000 Canadians is a miniscule percentage of the more than 35 million Canadians who receive benefits. While the report doesn\u2019t say how many patients travel to the US for medical treatment, we rate Trump\u2019s claim as true, but misleading. Reality Check: Clinton wants single-payer system? By Debra Goldschmidt, CNN Trump said Clinton \u201cwants to go to single-payer, which means the government basically rules everything.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cHillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step.\u201d In July, Clinton said she supported a public option, which is a government health plan as a choice alongside private health insurance options. This is different than a single-payer system, which is a singular, government-run system without other options to chose from. The goal of adding a public option would be to stabilize Obamacare, which has seen several large insurers downsize their presence and premiums rise as insurers try to deal with sicker-than-expected enrollees. Obamacare had created non-profit cooperative insurers to give consumers more choice, but most of those carriers have failed. Last month, in response to a question posed by the New England Journal of Medicine on how she would improve on quality and access to care, Clinton said she wants to build on the progress of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, something she has said before. Clinton wrote, \u201cWe must work to expand Medicaid coverage in the 19 states that have left 3 million Americans without health insurance because their states refused to expand Medicaid and enroll people eligible for coverage. We need to improve and strengthen the ACA through enhanced tax credits to make coverage affordable, implementation of strong measures to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, increased competition between insurers, and an aggressive campaign to increase outreach and enrollment. And finally, we need to ensure the availability of a public option choice in every state, and let Americans over 55 buy in to Medicare.\u201d The medical journal asked the same question to Trump but he has yet to respond. He has said Obamacare should be repealed. We rate Trump\u2019s claim that Clinton wants a single-payer system as false. Reality Check: Trump claims 2008 Clinton campaign source of Obama photo in Somali garb By Theodore Schleifer, CNN Trump told Clinton that \u201cyour campaign\u201d was responsible for circulating photos during the 2008 primaries depicting Barack Obama dressed in traditional Somali garb, a famous flare-up during the Democratic primary eight years ago. Well, sort of. The photo first appeared on Drudge Report, the conservative aggregator, and was attributed at the time to sources within the Clinton campaign, though no names were offered. The Obama campaign pounced on the report, blasting it as \u201cdivisive politics\u201d and \u201cpart of a disturbing pattern.\u201d The Clinton campaign at the time did not immediately dispute that it was responsible \u2013 its first statement did not address the substance of the allegation. \u201cThis is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry. We will not be distracted,\u201d her aides said at the time. The campaign said later that it had not been sanctioned by the campaign - but was not definitive about where it originated. \u201cWe have over 700 people on this campaign and I\u2019m not in a position to know what each one of them may or may not have done,\u201d campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said at the time. Previous questions about the Clintons\u2019 race-based attacks on Obama have been blamed on volunteers, who might not have been \u201csanctioned\u201d by the campaign. Clinton\u2019s campaign brass pointed the finger at a \u201cvolunteer coordinator\u201d in Iowa who shared the photo, which was part of what Trump said was an effort to discredit Obama\u2019s heritage and legitimacy. The volunteer was clearly backing Clinton and organizing on her behalf in the first-in-the-nation primary state. But it\u2019s not certain whether the volunteer was drawing a paycheck from her campaign and therefore an official Clinton actor. \u201cI don\u2019t recall whether they were an actual paid staffer,\u201d former Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle told CNN earlier this year. \u201cBut they did forward an email that promoted the conspiracy.\u201d Verdict: It\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton emails By Ryan Browne, CNN National Security Producer Trump returned to a common theme, slamming Clinton for her use of personal email during her tenure as secretary of state. \u201cYou think it was fine to delete 35,000 emails? I don\u2019t think so. She said that 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class.\u201d He added, \u201cfor you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 emails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Clinton handed 30,000 emails over to the State Department and said she deleted another 32,000 personal messages. So the number was actually 32,000, not 39,000, 35,000 or 33,000, as Trump charged. Of the 32,000 emails the FBI was able to find, more than 17,000 of them and determined that a \u201csubstantial number\u201d were duplicates of emails that had already been turned over to the State Department. The State Department has reviewed about 15,000 of the emails and determined that more than 9,400 were purely personal and will not be released and that another 5,600 are probably work-related and will be made public in the weeks before the election. But he is partially right about the description Hillary gave for the emails that were deleted, thousands of which have been found to be work related. Back in March 2015, when the server\u2019s existence was first revealed, Clinton downplayed the email as being \u201cabout planning Chelsea\u2019s wedding or my mother\u2019s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.\u201d Trump\u2019s three numbers are all inaccurate and the State Department confirmed that the majority were personal. Therefore, we rate Trump\u2019s claims about the numbers as false. But true that Clinton downplayed emails that turned out to be work-related. Reality Check: Can Trump appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton? By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer \u201cIf I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception,\u201d Trump told Clinton. \u201cThere has never been anything like it, and we are going to have a special prosecutor. I go out and speak and the people of this country are furious.\u201d But would Trump be constitutionally empowered to take such an action if he were elected the 45th president of the United States? Under Title 6 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the attorney general does have the authority to appoint a special prosecutor, according to Stephen Vladeck, a law professor with the University of Texas School of Law. Such action can be taken when the attorney general determines that a criminal investigation is warranted and that an investigation by the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest or \u201cother extraordinary circumstance\u201d and that \u201cunder the circumstances it would be in the public interest to appoint and outside special counsel.\u201d But the prosecutor would need to bring charges and that might a difficult proposition in the current climate, in the face of the comments by FBI Director James Comey earlier this year at the conclusion of the FBI investigation into whether or not Clinton broke the law in her use of a private email server. In July, Comey said that Clinton had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her use of a private email server in which classified material was was sent over in small amounts. But Comey also said \u201cour judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case\u201d when he announced that the FBI would not recommend the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Clinton over the matter. \u201cI just don\u2019t see a scenario where, if the director of the FBI doesn\u2019t believe criminal charges can or should be brought, a subsequent Justice Department would bring them anyway,\u201d Vladeck said of the political situation after Comey\u2019s comments. But in practical terms regarding the legality of Trump\u2019s promise, the only constraints are the ones set out in the federal regulations. And would Trump be able to \u201cinstruct\u201d his attorney general to undertake such an investigation? Vladeck points out that the attorney general is supposed to be at least somewhat independent, but at the end of the day, the President can fire him or her for no reason. So in reality, the President could demand that the AG appoint a special prosecutor or else be fired. That is essentially what led to the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d during the Nixon administration when President Richard Nixon dismissed Archibald Cox during the investigation of Watergate. But that incident ended up being a significant factor in turning the public tide against Nixon in the scandal that eventually brought down his presidency. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Clinton on Russia and hacking By Justin Gamble and Kate Grise, CNN Clinton said Russia was behind the hacking of systems related to the Democratic Party and then releasing thousands of emails in an attempt to influence the presidential election to favor Trump. \u201cOur intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election and WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cAnd believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump\u201d Trump was not so convinced that the Russians were behind the hacks. \u201cAnytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians. She doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia is because they think they are trying to tarnish me with Russia.\u201d The intelligence community had been debating whether they should \u201cname and shame\u201d the Russians for the cyberattacks because of some concerns about the strength of the evidence and fears that it would be seen as a political statement to help Clinton\u2019s election. However, on Friday, the Obama administration said it was \u201cconfident\u201d Russia was behind recent hackings of the Democratic National Committee emails and the sites of other Democratic Party-linked organizations over the summer. \u201cWe believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement. The statement went on to say that the hackings and then publishing of these emails are \u201cintended to interfere with the US election process.\u201d Russia has denied all involvement in hacking attacks on US servers and organizations, saying the accusations are \u201cnonsense.\u201d While there has been speculation that the hacking benefits Trump as it has targeted Democrats and Clinton, the intelligence community has not reached that conclusion. So on Trump\u2019s claim that it is not known if there is any hacking, we rate the claim false. On Clinton\u2019s opinion that the hack is meant to benefit Trump may be her hunch, but not the conclusion of investigators. We rate that false as well. Reality Check: Bill Clinton\u2019s law license, Paula Jones settlement By Sonam Vashi, CNN Trump went after Clinton\u2019s husband tonight. \u201cBut what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law, he had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women \u2013 Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.\u201d The day before he left the Oval Office in 2001, Bill Clinton agreed to a suspension of his Arkansas license to practice law for five years, after giving misleading testimony during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The suspensions, and his payment of a $25,000 fine to the Arkansas bar association, was in exchange for the end of the seven-year Whitewater probe. The suspension of Clinton\u2019s license closed the disbarment proceedings in Arkansas. Clinton is still listed as suspended on the Arkansas judiciary government website, although it\u2019s been 10 years since the end of his suspension. That same year, after the suspension of his Arkansas license, the Supreme Court disbarred Clinton from practicing law before it, a routine decision that happens if lawyers have been suspended or disbarred elsewhere. The action was mainly a symbolic one, since Clinton had never argued in a Supreme Court case, and Clinton was given 40 days to fight against the disbarment. Instead, Clinton resigned from the bar of the Supreme Court \u2013 again, a symbolic gesture. Trump is also correct on the $850,000 figure. Paula Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who accused Clinton of making \u201cpersistent and continuous\u201d sexual advances toward her while he was governor. She filed a federal lawsuit in 1994, and Clinton settled the lawsuit in 1998, paying out $850,000 to Jones and her lawyers. Clinton wasn\u2019t disbarred in Arkansas, but he did lose his license for a time. Trump\u2019s claims are true. Reality Check: Clinton on African-Americans\u2019 incomes rising under Bill Clinton By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Hillary Clinton praised the prosperity America enjoyed during the administration of her husband, Bill. In addition to saying millions of jobs were created and everyone\u2019s income rose, she specifically cited how African-Americans benefited. \u201cAfrican-American incomes went up 33%,\u201d she said. The typical African-American household\u2019s income rose to $40,830 in 2000, up 31.5% from 1992, just before Clinton took office, according to Census Bureau data. That\u2019s an even more robust increase than Americans as a whole. Overall, the typical American household saw its income climb to $57,790, up 13.9% from 1992. While Clinton was slightly off on the numbers, our verdict: True. Reality Check: Trump would not have had US in Iraq By Eve Bower, CNN Trump again claimed that he would not have supported the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Specifically, he said, had he been president, he \u201cwould not have had our people in Iraq,\u201d and Captain Humayun Khan would still be alive. Khan was killed in combat in Iraq in 2004, and was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Khan\u2019s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, gained national prominence after speaking critically of Trump at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In reality, Trump was on the record as being supportive of the Iraq War as early as a month before Congress voted to authorize military force in Iraq in 2002, as well as soon after the invasion. He didn\u2019t express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later, in an August 2004 interview. We rate Trump\u2019s continued insistence that he would not have led America into war in Iraq as false. Reality check: Trump says Clinton would raise taxes on everyone By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney Trump claimed Clinton would be \u201craising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.\u201d Clinton has proposed raising taxes on the highest-earning Americans, but not anyone making less than $250,000. Independent analyses of her plan find that her proposed tax hikes would squarely hit the most well off. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center noted that \u201cnearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.\u201d The Tax Policy Center will soon publish an updated analysis of her tax plan to incorporate new tax proposals she made over the summer. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Clinton says Trump would raise taxes on middle-class families By Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney Clinton said that despite claims that he would cut taxes for everyone, Trump actually \u201cwould end up raising taxes on \u2026 millions of middle-class families.\u201d Clinton was referring to a study that estimated his proposals would raise the tax burden on millions of low- and middle-income parents. A leading Democratic tax policy expert conducted the study, but the conservative Tax Foundation said it replicated many of her numbers and found her conclusions \u201creasonable.\u201d The study estimated that roughly 20% of households with minor children and more than half of single parents could end up paying more in taxes than they do today. These groups include about 25 million adults and 15 million children. What explains the tax impact? While Trump would increase the standard deduction and add new child care tax breaks, he would also raise the lowest tax bracket to 12% from 10%, eliminate the head of household status and repeal some personal exemptions. Many single parents could find that tradeoff leaves them with a higher tax bill, the study found. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Trump says Assad, Russia and Iran are \u2018killing ISIS\u2019 By Jamie Crawford, CNN National Security Producer Trump said the following about the fight against ISIS. \u201cI don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy\u201d But is Trump right that those three countries are \u201ckilling\u201d ISIS amid the bloody civil war convulsing the country? Backed up by Russian military power, the Assad regime has targeted what it commonly refers to as \u201cterrorists\u201d but that has primarily meant various groups who are specifically acting to depose the Assad government. Some of those groups include groups the United States also sees as being capable to assist the primary aim of the US-led coalition which is to dislodge ISIS from its base in Syria and Iraq. Russia insists it has been targeting ISIS forces since it entered into military action inside Syria in support of the efforts of the Assad regime, but US officials have said the majority of Russian airstrikes have been against US-backed rebels battling Assad\u2019s forces, as opposed to ISIS. That was one of the reasons US efforts to establish a mechanism where Russia and the United States might cooperate to increase the pressure on ISIS fell part. Earlier this year, Secretary of State John Kerry said Iran had been \u201chelpful\u201d in targeting ISIS on their own inside portions of Iraq, but there has been little evidence of Iranian forces targeting ISIS inside Syria in support of the Assad regime. Iranian forces in Iraq did play a key role in some of the critical battles that dislodged ISIS from Tikrit and Baiji, and other portions of northern Anbar province where ISIS had a large presence. Syrian forces backed up by the Russian military have also been accused of targeting civilians inside Syria and launching attacks that have indiscriminately killed thousands of Syrian civilians throughout the course of Syria\u2019s civil war \u2013 most recently in Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo. Because there has been no visible effort by Assad regime forces to go after ISIS, and with the Russian military not using overwhelming force to go after ISIS in Syria, but to focus on going after groups that opposes Assad, we rate Trump\u2019s claim false. In Iraq especially, US officials and others have noted Iran\u2019s role in targeting ISIS as one of the reasons the group has lost ground there, but the picture of Iran\u2019s role against ISIS in Syria is not as clear. We would rate his comment as true, but misleading. Reality Check: Trump suggests Muslim-Americans don\u2019t cooperate with law enforcement By Amy Gallagher and Emma Lacey-Bordeaux, CNN A voter asked what the candidates would do to help Muslim-Americans who are being \u201clabeled as a threat\u201d and are targets of Islamophobia. Trump side-stepped her question by calling on the Muslim community to do more to report terrorism. \u201cWe have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAs an example in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed and wounded many, many people. \u2026 Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\u201d We have checked the claim about witnesses to the bombs in the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 apartment before and have found that there is no evidence that anyone saw the bombs and did not report them.  There is also no evidence that Muslims in the terrorists\u2019 community had information and withheld it. On Trump\u2019s larger point,the Muslim community has actually been more effective than law enforcement at uncovering potential terror attacks in America since 9/11. Charles Kurzman, professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill conducted a study in 2013 to examine the relationship between Muslim-Americans and terrorism on American soil. He found that \u201cSince 9/11, 54 Muslim-American terrorism suspects and perpetrators were brought to the attention of law enforcement by members of the Muslim-American community out of 188 individuals where the initial tip was made public. Another 52 individuals were discovered through US government investigations.\u201d We rate Trump\u2019s suggestion that Muslim-Americans don\u2019t cooperate with law enforcement false. Reality Check: Trump on radical Islamic terrorism By Travis Caldwell, CNN In a response to rising Islamophobia in America, Trump suggested that the terrorist attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, as well as the events of 9/11, were a direct result of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and stated Clinton and President Barack Obama won\u2019t use the phrase. First, a breakdown of the events Trump mentions. The attacks on September 11, 2001, were coordinated and carried out by al Qaeda, an Islamic extremist terror network. According to law enforcement officials, the San Bernardino shooters may have been self-radicalized, following a warped and extremist version of Islam. The terror group ISIS claimed credit for the San Bernardino shootings, but it has yet to be determined if the shooters and members of ISIS made contact or received instruction. The Orlando shooter cited himself as an \u201cIslamic soldier\u201d during his talks with police negotiators, but like the San Bernardino attacks, officials believe the shooter acted as a \u201clone wolf\u201d and was radicalized by online sources. At face value, the attackers noted by Trump were indeed beholden to a radicalized ideology. Verdict: True. Trump also criticized Clinton and Obama for their failure to use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Clinton, however, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d in June that she did not object to the phrase when used properly, saying, \u201cFrom my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. \u2026 And it mattered we got (Osama) bin Laden, not what name we called him. I have clearly said we \u2013 whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I\u2019m happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing.\u201d Obama spoke with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper last month on his particular reluctance to use the phrase, saying, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured, because there is no doubt, and I\u2019ve said repeatedly, that where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse, for basically barbarism and death.\u201d Clinton doesn\u2019t object to the phrase so we rate Trump\u2019s claim as false. Obama may call the issue a distraction, but he refuses to use the term. That claim is true. Reality Check: No, Hillary Clinton did not use her office to make $250 million By Theodore Schleifer, CNN Trump was curious why Clinton had not devoted any of her personal fortune to his campaign, like he has to his. But his charge included a curious datapoint. \u201cShe made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money,\u201d Trump claimed. The main way the Clintons made money: private speeches. The speaking fees \u2013 and what Clinton said to financial audiences behind closed doors \u2013 emerged as a major campaign issue during the Democratic primary, with her rival Bernie Sanders repeatedly calling for the release of the transcripts. And the money she made was another sign of what critics said was a disconnect between the life of the secretary of state and the life of the average American. But that number\u2019s not right. Clinton delivered 92 paid speeches between April 2013, when she was a private citizen, through March 2015, right before she launched her presidential campaign. But those remarks only yielded $21.6 million \u2013 an average speaking fee of $235,000, according to a CNN analysis of her payments. Trump may have been misspeaking and meaning to reference a different number: $150 million, which is the amount that both Clintons collected during their time after office. When you include Bill Clinton\u2019s 637 paid speaking engagements from February 2001 to May 2015, the total Clinton fees rises to $154 million split over 729 speeches. And if you throw in other sources of income, the two Clintons\u2019 intake does indeed arrive to the $250 million ballpark. Forbes reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton earned $230 million between 2001 and 2014 through advising and consulting gigs, book deals and speaking fees. But a majority of that money came from Bill Clinton, who has had a much lengthier tenure outside of public office. As for how much she has contributed to her campaign, Clinton has made $1.2 million in in-kind contributions to her campaign. So we rate the $250 million total, ascribed purely to Hillary Clinton, to be false. Reality Check: Trump says Clinton \u2018failed\u2019 to bring jobs to upstate N.Y. By Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney Trump criticized Clinton\u2019s record as a senator representing New York, saying: \u201cHillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\u201d As a senator, Clinton promised to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York. She did not. Upstate New York consists of 49 counties, according to the New York Federal Reserve. It does not include New York City and its surrounding suburban counties. Clinton became a senator in January 2001 and her last full month in office was December 2008. During that time, employment in the metro area of Syracuse increased by 5,029 workers. However, the unemployment rate in Syracuse was 4.8% at the start of 2001 and, like much of the nation, rose in 2008 to 6.7%, Labor Department figures show. Ithaca also had jobs gains but a rise in the unemployment rate. In Binghamton\u2019s metro area, employment declined by 3,600 workers during Clinton\u2019s term. In Rochester, employment declined by 5,600 workers. In a December 2007 report, the New York Federal Reserve found private sector job growth in upstate New York declined 0.2% on average per year between 2000 and 2005. Job growth did pick up in 2006 and 2007. The region did lose 85,000 manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2006. However, that was in line with the national trend. While Clinton was a senator, the US economy lost about 4.2 million manufacturing jobs due to improved technology and trade. The New York Fed noted in its report that the manufacturing job losses in upstate New York \u201cappear unlikely to be reversed.\u201d The manufacturing job losses also weren\u2019t entirely offset by job gains in lower-paying industries such as health care, education and hospitality, the report found. Verdict: Mostly true. Reality Check: Trump on $800 billion trade deficit By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump once again blasted America\u2019s trade deals and once again gave the wrong figure for the nation\u2019s trade gap. \u201cLast year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable,\u201d Trump said. The nation had a nearly $763 billion deficit in the trading of goods in 2015, according to Census Bureau figures. But America is shifting to a service economy and exports $262 billion more in services than we import. That brings our overall trade deficit down to $500 billion for 2015. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Clinton on the people Trump has insulted By Kate Grise, CNN Clinton said Trump has insulted many different groups. \u201cWe have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms. So, yes. This is who Donald Trump is. It\u2019s not only women and this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president. Because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims and so many others,\u201d Clinton said. Let\u2019s break down some of Clinton\u2019s points. \u201cWe have seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10,\u201d Clinton began. In a 2005 interview with Howard Stern, Trump said, \u201cI view a person who\u2019s flat-chested as very hard to be a 10.\u201d He then proceeded to rank a list of celebrity women on a scale from one to 10 as Stern provides him with their names. Stern suggested Trump should start a \u201cDonald Trump evaluation show\u201d to give weekly ratings on women. \u201cYou know that would be a very good show for Sirius I think,\u201d Trump agrees. \u201cYou do that for hours and hours. It would get tremendous ratings.\u201d We rate Clinton\u2019s claim as true. \u201cWe saw him after the debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe on the harshest most personal terms,\u201d Clinton said. In the days after the first presidential debate last month, Trump repeatedly defended his statements about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. \u201cShe gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem, we had a real problem, not only with that but her attitude, and we had a real problem with her,\u201d Trump said on Fox News. Trump went after Machado on Twitter as well \u2013 \u201cDid Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?\u201d We rate Clinton\u2019s claim as true. \u201cHe has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilites, POWs, and Muslims and so many others,\u201d Clinton said. Trump on immigrants: \u201cBut you have people coming in and I\u2019m not just saying Mexicans. I\u2019m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and they\u2019re coming into this country,\u201d Trump said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d last year. During the first presidential debate, Trump said, \u201cWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they\u2019re illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.\u201d Trump on African-Americans: \u201cYou\u2019re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed \u2013 what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump on Latinos: \u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\u201d Trump said in his presidential announcement speech in June last year. Trump on people with disabilities: At a rally last November, Trump mocked a disabled reporter by impersonating him. Trump said that he did not know the reporter, so therefore he could not have been mocking him. Trump on POWs: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Trump said of Sen. John McCain who was a prisoner of war during the Vietman War. \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Trump on Muslims: Trump has called for surveillance of mosques, religious tests for immigrants that would prevent Muslims from entering the country and compiling a national database of Muslims living in the United States. We rate Clinton\u2019s litany of claims as true.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine's book shows how the Democratic Party has moved left over the past 24 years compared to Bill Clinton and Al Gore's effort Twenty-four years after Bill Clinton published \u201cPutting People First,\u201d Hillary Clinton is about to produce her own policy tome: \u201cStronger Together: A Blueprint for America\u2019s Future.\u201d The 249-page book, which was co-written with her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, is set to be published on Sept. 6 by Simon and Schuster (list price $15.99), the day after Labor Day, the traditional kick-off of the fall campaign. The book \u2013 which includes policy prescriptions on everything from strengthening the economy to defeating ISIS \u2013 is intended to provide a contrast with Donald Trump, whose campaign has been light on policy details. But when read alongside the book that her husband and Al Gore published in 1992, it offers a glimpse into the many ways that the Democratic Party has drifted to the left over the past quarter-century on everything from crime to trade, from Social Security and welfare to Israel and the Middle East. Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cPutting People First\u201d declared: \u201cWe need to put more police on the streets and more criminals behind bars\u201d (p. 71). Hillary Clinton\u2019s book, by contrast, calls for reforming the criminal justice system, expanding the use of body cameras, and ending \u201cthe era of mass incarceration.\u201d \u201cWe should work together to pursue alternative punishments for nonviolent offenders where appropriate,\u201d write Clinton and Kaine. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create another \u2018incarceration generation\u2019\u201d (p. 198). Bill Clinton and Gore promised to \u201csupport a North American Free Trade Agreement\u201d (p. 156), a pledge he made good on in the White House. The Clinton-Kaine book, by contrast, promises to \u201creview\u201d trade agreements like NAFTA that are \u201calready on the books\u201d and promises to oppose the controversial Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \u201c[W]e oppose the TPP \u2013 and that means before and after the election,\u201d write Clinton and Kaine. The Democratic Party has also moved to the left on the issue of Social Security \u2013 a shift that is reflected in Clinton\u2019s book. Bill Clinton\u2019s book promised to \u201cprotect the long-term solvency of Social Security\u201d (p. 140). Hillary Clinton\u2019s book, by contrast, promises to reject \u201cyears of mythmaking claiming we cannot afford Social Security and that the only solution is to cut the benefits on which 90 percent of Americans seniors rely.\u201d (p. 87). Clinton and Kaine propose expanding Social Security for \u201cthose who need it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system \u2013 including women who are widows\u201d (p. 88) Clinton calls for paying for this expansion of Social Security benefits by \u201casking the wealthiest to contribute more\u201d (p. 88). As part of his effort to move the Democratic Party to the center, Bill Clinton made welfare reform a cornerstone of his 1992 presidential bid. \u201cNo one who can work should be able to stay on welfare forever,\u201d wrote Clinton and Gore in their book. (p. 164). Hillary Clinton\u2019s book is silent on this front. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another area where the Clinton books diverge. In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore wrote \u201cWe oppose the creation of an independent Palestinian state\u201d (p. 123). Writing in 2016, Clinton and Kaine say in their book \u201c\u2026 we refuse to give up on the goal of two states for two peoples.\u201d (p. 125). One area where Hillary Clinton\u2019s book comes off as more moderate than her husband\u2019s is on the issue of health care, a contentious issue that both Clintons wrestled with in the White House. Bill Clinton\u2019s book proposed creating a health standards board that would establish an annual health budget for the nation to limit both public and private expenditures. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, does not propose capping national health spending. Instead, she proposes letting people over 55 to buy into Medicare, supporting efforts across 50 states to create a government-run public option, and providing a new \u201cprogressive, refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 per family\u201d to help with out-of-pocket health-care costs.",

            "article_content": "Reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened to the speeches CNN rated key statements as either true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated The Republican Party gathered in Cleveland  on Tuesday for the second night of its convention, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check Team put the speakers\u2019 statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Christie on Clinton and China By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Christie attacked Clinton on multiple points, including the accusation that Hillary Clinton wanted the Chinese to purchase U.S. debt to help the Obama administration. \u201cIn China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance Barack Obama\u2019s bloated stimulus plan,\u201d he said. In February 2009, soon after being named secretary of state, Clinton traveled to China and urged Beijing to keep buying U.S. debt, according to media reports at the time. In an interview on Chinese television quoted by Reuters, Clinton said that China made a \u201cwise\u201d choice by buying United States debt instruments. Based on these reports, we rate Christie\u2019s statement as true. Reality Check: Christie on Clinton and \u2018bring back our girls\u2019 By Ryan Browne, CNN Christie also hammered Clinton with a series of charges about her failures while serving as secretary of state. He was particularly critical over Clinton\u2019s handling of the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria. \u201cIn Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an al Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list,\u201d Christie said. Boko Haram, an affiliate of al Qaeda, was never designated a foreign terrorist organization during Clinton\u2019s leadership of the State Department. The department eventually labeled the group a terrorist organization while under Kerry in December 2013. According to a report obtained by Reuters, then-Justice Department official Lisa Monaco had lobbied Clinton\u2019s State Department to designate the group a terrorist organization in 2012. The Daily Beast also reported on the State Department\u2019s hesitancy during Clinton\u2019s tenure to designate the group a terrorist organization, noting that a group of bipartisan members of Congress had also lobbied the department to put the group on the list, with some members saying that the designation would allow U.S. law enforcement personnel to work more closely with governments in the region. The kidnapping of the 200 Nigerian school girls occurred in April 2014. While Clinton was head of the State Department at the time, Christie says she \u201cfought\u201d to keep them off the list and there is no evidence that she herself was personally responsible for the delay in the designation. Our verdict: false. Christie went on to add: \u201cBecause of this reckless action by the candidate who is the self-proclaimed champion of women all around the world. These al Qaeda terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young women two years ago. These school girls are still missing today. And what was the solution from the Obama/Clinton team? A hashtag campaign.\u201d While Clinton did tweet out the hashtag \u201cbring back our girls\u201d in the wake of the kidnapping, she was no longer in office when the kidnapping occurred. It\u2019s impossible to know whether a U.S. terror designation would have made any difference in the girls\u2019 kidnapping. President Barack Obama did authorize the deployment of 80 U.S. troops to neighboring Chad about a month after the event in an effort to aid in their search. Therefore we rate the claim that the \u201csolution from the Obama/Clinton team\u201d was a \u201chashtag campaign\u201d as false. Reality Check: Christie calls Clinton \u2018chief engineer\u2019 of Gadhafi\u2019s overthrow By Eve Bower, CNN Christie assumed the role of prosecutor on the RNC stage, arguing that Clinton\u2019s policy in Libya made her \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201cruining Libya\u201d and \u201ccreating a nest for terrorist activity by ISIS.\u201d He labeled her the \u201cchief engineer\u201d of the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, saying Clinton\u2019s \u201cgrand strategy\u201d in Libya was to blame for the North African state\u2019s current calamity. In early 2011, as protests spread like wildfire from Tunisia to Egypt and then Libya, the world watched for weeks as Libyan security forces used increasingly brutal methods to suppress the uprisings. By mid-February, there seemed to be a coalition of European powers emerging in support of implementing a no-fly zone over Libya. The approach would decisively change the course of events in Libya, and then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy seemed eager to take the lead. In the U.S., Obama had been elected, in part, on the basis of his opposition to the U.S. war in Iraq, and he was deeply reluctant to engage in open-ended overseas military conflict. But Sarkozy saw himself in a different situation altogether: having campaigned on his desire to enhance France\u2019s position in the Arab world, Sarkozy promised France \u201cwould be side by side with the oppressed.\u201d When the uprising in Libya began, Sarkozy saw an opportunity to make his mark. Though Clinton would ultimately be described as one of the most hawkish voices on Libya in the Obama administration, senior U.S.  officials say that Clinton was initially skeptical of U.S. involvement in this international coalition. Obama at first tried a less interventionist approach, signing an executive order freezing Gadhafi\u2019s assets, and then backing a UN Security Council resolution to impose sanctions. Days later, France and Britain pushed the UN Security Council for a quick resolution that would authorize a no-fly zone, but Clinton, still reluctant, chose instead to work with Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to buy time in which to build broader international support for the move. But by mid-March, as intelligence warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis if government forces took on rebel-stronghold Benghazi, aides say Clinton shifted and became convinced that an immediate no-fly zone was necessary. The Security Council resolution passed March 17. Yet even after it was decided that a coalition of NATO members would enforce the resolution, France remained eager to take the lead. On March 19, hours before the air campaign\u2019s official start, French jets attacked Libyan government tanks on their way to Benghazi. Where the Obama administration had been reluctant to be seen as jumping into another war, Republicans at the time used the administration\u2019s own words against it, describing the U.S. role, with some sarcasm, as \u201cleading from behind.\u201d In the first weeks after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, when Libya\u2019s short-term future seemed more hopeful, sources in the administration were eager to credit Secretary Clinton for her work helping to build an international coalition \u2013 and Clinton was happy to take it. \u201cOur response,\u201d Clinton has said, was \u201csmart power at its best.\u201d But because Clinton was neither the first to call for military intervention, nor the only one to plan the administration\u2019s handling of the aftermath, we rate Christie\u2019s claim false. Reality Check: Donald Trump Jr. on his father\u2019s campaign funding By Juana Summers and Sonam Vashi, CNN Donald Trump Jr. said his father would be \u201ca President not beholden to special interests, foreign and domestic and one who funded his entire primary run out of his own pocket just to prove it.\u201d It\u2019s a claim we\u2019ve heard again and again. Although Trump has sunk a significant amount of his own money into his campaign, CNN has found that he received about $14 million in campaign contributions from 8,200 individual donors through the end of April. Trump has loaned his campaign 76% of the the $57.7 million that the campaign has received through the end of April, according to the Federal Election Commission. While he\u2019s funded a vast majority of his campaign, he\u2019s also taken millions from outside donors \u2013 not just funding entirely out of his own pocket. His son\u2019s claim is false. Reality Check: Donald Trump Jr. on Clinton \u2018destroying\u2019 Medicare By Amy Gallagher, CNN The younger Donald Trump compared his father\u2019s proposals to those of Clinton\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re going to elect a President \u2026 who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care,\u201d Trump Jr. said, \u201cand who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors as Hillary Clinton has proposed.\u201d But did Clinton really propose to end Medicare? Earlier this month, Clinton tweaked her previous stance on health care as a nod to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her most recent position proposes expanding Medicare as an option to adults as young as 50. This expansion is why some conservative pundits have suggested that Clinton could destroy Medicare, since it invites more people into an already overloaded system. \u201cMedicare is stretched so thin to meet the needs of today\u2019s seniors that expanding enrollment is like inviting the neighborhood for dinner when you don\u2019t have enough to feed your own kids,\u201d wrote Fox News commentator Betsy McCaughey in the online news outlet Newsmax. So is expanding Medicare likely to destroy it? Medicare does have serious solvency problems, and is currently set to run out of funds by 2028. Therefore, it would seem likely that any expansion of the program would exacerbate those problems and shorten the life of the program. However, as a historically popular program, it is unlikely that Medicare will be allowed to go bankrupt. Despite being criticized by the likes of former President Ronald Reagan, the program has continued to expand since its creation \u2013 under both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, even several small-government conservatives have expanded it \u2013 including Reagan, former President Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. It seems likely that the next president, whoever it may be, would look for ways to shore up Medicare, rather than let it die. Therefore, we rate Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s claim that Clinton has proposed destroying Medicare false, however you read the phrase \u2013 Clinton has not proposed to destroy Medicare, but to expand it. While an expansion might strain the system, it is unlikely the system would be allowed to collapse. Reality Check: Carson on Saul Alinsky, Lucifer and Clinton role model By Julie Block, CNN Carson claimed that one of Clinton\u2019s \u201cmentors was Saul Alinsky \u2026 someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently.\u201d He also said Clinton wrote her college thesis on Alinsky\u2019s writings, and that the dedication page for Alinsky\u2019s book, entitled, \u201cRules for Radicals,\u201d acknowledges Lucifer. Alinksy was a community activist, regarded as a radical in the mid-20th century for his teachings about people\u2019s empowerment. Clinton did write her college thesis on Alinsky\u2019s life, writings and political views, though much of her thesis was analytical. The conclusion of the thesis reads: \u201cIn the first chapter it was pointed out that Alinsky is regarded by many as the proponent of a dangerous socio/political philosophy. As such, he has been feared \u2013 just as Eugene Debs or Walt Whitman or Martin Luther King has been feared, because each embraced the most radical of political faiths \u2013 democracy.\u201d This comparison to Debs, Whitman and King, along with Clinton\u2019s continued exchange of letters with Alinsky well into her law school years, suggests that Clinton had a deep respect for Alinsky. Indeed, Alinsky personally acknowledged Lucifer in his book, published in 1971. He wrote, \u201cLest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins \u2013 or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom.\u201d Additionally, a Washington Post piece written in 2007 suggests Alinsky had great influence over Clinton\u2019s political ideology, causing her to switch from a Republican to a Democrat. The article reads, \u201cArriving at Wellesley, she became president of the Young Republicans, but she soon drifted left. She said that 1968, the year she met Alinsky in Chicago, was a watershed in her \u2018personal and political evolution,\u2019 marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War and the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.\u201d The paper also noted, however, that Clinton wrote in her 2003 memoir, \u201cLiving History,\u201d that Clinton and Alinsky had a \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d about how to change the system.  Because of this, it is a stretch for Carson to say that Alinsky affected \u201call of her philosophies subsequently.\u201d Verdict: Mostly true. Reality Check: Day on Clinton Foundation money By Sonam Vashi, CNN \u201cAs head of a foundation, you accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign countries who enslave women and who treat them as second-class citizens,\u201d Day said, referring to Clinton. The Clinton Foundation has accepted millions from foreign governments, according to its website, which lists cumulative amounts. Saudi Arabia, Australia and Norway each gave the Foundation between $10 million and $25 million; the Netherlands and Kuwait gave between $5 million and $10 million; and Qatar, Brunei, Oman and the United Arab Emirates gave between $1 million and $5 million. Given that slavery is illegal in all countries but modern-day slavery exists in many countries to varying degrees, we\u2019re going to look at the women\u2019s rights records of these top donor countries instead. (Note: for these indices, a rank with a smaller number generally denotes better treatment of women in that country.) According to 2014 data from the United Nations\u2019 Gender Inequality Index, Qatar ranks 116th out of 155 countries for gender inequality. Kuwait (79th), Saudi Arabia (56th), Oman (53rd), and the United Arab Emirates (47th) all rank in a middle-performing range, while the Netherlands (7th), Norway (9th), and Australia (19th), all ranking in a higher-performing range, treat women more equally. For context, the United States is ranked 55th in this index. (Brunei was not included in the overall ranking for this index). To compare with another index: The World Economic Forum\u2019s 2015 Global Gender Gap Report shows that Oman ranks poorly (135th out of 145 countries), as does Saudi Arabia (134th), Qatar (122nd), the United Arab Emirates (119th), and Kuwait (117th). Brunei was ranked 88th, Australia was ranked 36th, and Norway and the Netherlands were both in the top 15. The United States was ranked 28th. Given that at least some of the countries who donated millions to the Clinton Foundation have poor records in regards to women\u2019s rights, we rate Day\u2019s claim as true. Reality Check: Clinton and the Second Amendment By Chip Grabow, CNN Gun rights was the focus Tuesday night in a speech by Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action. He targeted Clinton\u2019s stance on guns and the Second Amendment, which reads in part that \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d Cox claimed Clinton wants to take away that right. Cox referenced a 2008 Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down Washington, D.C.\u2019s ban on handguns, which the court said violated the Second Amendment. The court said it violated the Second Amendment. Cox said Clinton disagreed with the decision: \u201cShe said, \u2018The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u2019 Think about that. All the Supreme Court said was that you have the right to protect your life in your own home but Hillary says they\u2019re wrong.\u201d But Cox went further, saying that \u201ca Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is gone.\u201d That echoes claims made by Trump that Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. In a leaked recording of a private fundraiser last year, Clinton was heard saying, \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,\u201d referring to that 2008 ruling. But in a statement earlier this year, apparently clarifying Clinton\u2019s comments about that decision, a policy adviser to Clinton told Bloomberg Politics: \u201cClinton believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe, like safe storage laws to prevent toddlers from accessing guns.\u201d The statement went on to say, \u201cIn overturning Washington, D.C.\u2019s safe storage law, Clinton worries that Heller may open the door to overturning thoughtful, common sense safety measures in the future.\u201d Clinton has also been on-the-record about her views of the Second Amendment. She told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that \u201cI believe we can have common sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment, and, in fact, what I have proposed is supported by 90% of the American people and more than 75% of responsible gun owners. So, is Cox correct in his claim that Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment? As CNN reported in May: \u201cClinton \u2026 has called for universal background checks and stricter controls on firearms, but has never called for the abolition of the Second Amendment. In fact, on her website, she calls gun ownership \u201cpart of the fabric of many law-abiding communities.\u201d Verdict: False. Reality Check: Trump on winning by the most votes in history By Sonam Vashi, CNN Trump appeared at the convention by satellite to accept his official nomination. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ve achieved historic results with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Former President George W. Bush held the previous record in 2000, with 10.8 million votes. CNN estimates that Trump holds almost 14 million raw votes. That\u2019s after record-setting turnouts this year during the primary season. However, Trump also holds a record for the number of people that voted for other Republican candidates. CNN estimates 15.7 million people voted for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich or another Republican candidate \u2013 which means more people voted against Trump in the primaries than for him. The previous record for \u201cmost votes against\u201d in a Republican primary was held by Arizona Sen. John McCain. So, while Trump does have the largest raw vote total in a Republican primary, we rate his claim true, but misleading, since that number clearly doesn\u2019t reflect unified Republican support for his candidacy. Reality Check: Ryan on poverty By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Obama and progressives such as him have let down the poor in America, according to Ryan. \u201cUnder the most liberal President we have had so far, poverty in America is worse, especially for our fellow citizens who are promised better and who need it most,\u201d Ryan said. It\u2019s true that the poverty rate has increased during Obama\u2019s presidency. It rose from 13.2% in 2008, just before Obama took office, to a high of 15.1% in 2010, in the wake of the Great Recession. As the economy has improved, the share of Americans in poverty has drifted down to 14.8% as of 2014, the most recent year for which federal statistics are available. Reality Check: Mukasey on Clinton emails By Eve Bower, CNN Citing Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while leading the State Department, Mukasey used his platform at the convention Tuesday to argue that Clinton had \u201cviolated\u201d her oath to uphold the Constitution. Mukasey did not cite which part of the Constitution he feels she breached. But following extensive investigations by the FBI, the Justice Department and the State Department\u2019s Inspector General, no government entity has found basis for pressing charges against Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, let\u2019s break Mukasey\u2019s claims down one by one. Mukasey said, \u201cWe now know that she chose to use her private email overseas.\u201d This is true. Earlier this month, when FBI Director James Comey spoke about the findings of his department\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails, he said Clinton \u201cused her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.\u201d Based on this, Comey said, \u201cIt is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email account.\u201d But Comey concluded that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case on this basis. Mukasey also spoke of Clinton\u2019s email server, arguing that it \u201cwas so remarkably primitive the FBI could not figure out whether or not it had been hacked,\u201d and, \u201cwe do know that the emails of people she communicated with were hacked.\u201d It is true that the FBI believes that \u201chostile actors\u201d gained access to the email accounts of people with whom Clinton was in \u201cregular contact.\u201d But it is not clear that a more advanced server could have thwarted a sophisticated hacker, and indeed, the most sophisticated attacks rarely leave evidence of their presence. Mukasey argued that Clinton had \u201csent and received secret, and top secret, and beyond top secret information and emails on an unsecure private email system instead of on the secure government system. And she did it without authorization.\u201d The State Department had initially said that none of the information on Clinton\u2019s server was classified at the time it was sent or received, but some of it was given restricted classifications afterward. But Comey\u2019s investigation found that a small number of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received. Of the 30,490 emails Clinton gave investigators, Comey said, three emails were in this category. Clinton has also maintained that she had permission to use personal email. But a report by the State Department\u2019s Inspector General \u201cfound no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server.\u201d The relevant laws that are in place to preserve transparency in government records were not enacted until 2014, after Clinton left office. And neither the FBI nor the Justice Department found that a criminal case was warranted. But Clinton\u2019s former colleagues at the State Department did find that she was in violation of \u201cgovernment policy.\u201d Mukasey made three accusations that have been hotly debated for more than one year. Based on the findings of the investigations that have come out of this controversy, we rate Mukasey\u2019s claims as true. Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this Reality Check misstated the number of emails that were marked \u201cclassified\u201d at the time they were sent or received. Reality Check: McCarthy on fairer taxes By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney McCarthy ticked off the ways the Republican agenda would help the nation. Among them, he said, \u201cour taxes will be fairer.\u201d The Republican Party platform calls for establishing a pro-growth tax code, calling it a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d \u201cGetting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity,\u201d it reads. For Republicans, tax reform usually means cutting rates for the wealthy in order to stimulate economic growth, which will then trickle down to benefit all Americans. That\u2019s what Trump wants to do. His tax plan would give the wealthy far bigger breaks than the middle class or working Americans. His proposal calls for reducing the current seven tax brackets to four and cutting the top rate on the wealthy to 25%, from 39.6%. It would also eliminate the estate tax, which affects only the very wealthy, and the Alternative Minimum Tax, which ensnares many affluent families. Bottom line for taxpayers: Middle-income Americans would see a federal tax cut of $2,700, or 4.9% of their after-tax income, on average, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. The top 1% would see a whopping $275,250 reduction in their federal tax bill, or 17.5% of their after-tax income. Whether you consider this fairer depends on your place on the economic ladder. If you are wealthy, you may consider this fairer, but if you aren\u2019t, you may wonder why the rich are getting such a big break. Verdict: It\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Capito on Clinton and coal miners\u2019 jobs By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Capito ripped into Obama and Clinton for supporting policies that have hurt coal mining, a key industry in her state. \u201cHis recklessness has cost more than 60,000 coal workers their jobs since 2011,\u201d Capito said of Obama. \u201cNot to be outdone, Hillary Clinton has already promised \u2018to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s no question that coal mining is on the decline, but it\u2019s been on a steady downward slope long before Obama took office. Government regulations and the rise of cleaner natural gas as a popular energy source have hurt the coal industry. Four big coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy in the past two years. That said, Obama has not been a great friend of the coal industry, favoring instead clean energy. He\u2019s also made addressing climate change a priority. Earlier this year, the Interior Department instituted a pause on issuing new coal leases on public lands while it reviews the federal coal program. Coal miners have lost jobs, though not as many as Capito cited. According to the Mine Safety & Health Administration, a government agency that\u2019s part of the Department of Labor, there were 127,977 individuals (employees and contractors) working in coal mining in the first quarter of 2011.  In the first quarter of 2016, that number has fallen to 78,359. That\u2019s a decline of 49,618 jobs. To give some perspective, back in 1986, there were more than 185,167 people working in coal mines. So on the number of coal workers who\u2019ve lost their jobs, we rate Capito\u2019s claim false. Clinton, however, did actually say at a CNN town hall in March that as President, she\u2019d put a lot of coal miners and companies out of business. She later called it a misstatement, saying she meant that coal miners would continue losing jobs the way things were going. Clinton has proposed \u201crevitalizing\u201d coal country with $30 billion in investment aimed at retraining former coal miners, protecting health and pension benefits for mineworkers and attracting investment to counties impacted with layoffs. She has also pledged to invest federal funds in clean coal technology. So it\u2019s true that Clinton said she\u2019d put coal miners out of work. EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This Reality Check has been updated as the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures previously used did not include contractors. Reality Check: McConnell on Clinton and Keystone positions By Chip Grabow, CNN McConnell said, \u201cHillary has changed her positions so many times, it\u2019s impossible to tell where the conviction ends and the ambition begins.\u201d He cited various policy examples, including the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. McConnell added: \u201cOnce a backer of the Keystone Pipeline, last year she opposed it.\u201d Clinton made her opposition to the project clear in September 2015. She was answering a question about climate change from a college student who was against the pipeline. Clinton said she opposed the project: \u201cI think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone Pipeline as what I believe it is: a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change, and unfortunately, from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with all the other issues. Therefore, I oppose it.\u201d But what was her position prior to that time? An analysis of some of her past comments about Keystone show something less definitive. \u201cInclined\u201d to back it was her answer in October 2010 when Clinton, then secretary of state, discussed the project at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. There she was careful to add: \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished all of the analysis \u2026 we\u2019ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so.\u201d Then, in June 2014: \u201cI can\u2019t really comment at great length \u2026 the Obama administration is trying to get it right\u201d was her answer while speaking to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail. When pressed on the question, Clinton said, \u201cI can\u2019t respond.\u201d In January 2015, Clinton again declined to give a position. \u201cWe have differences and you won\u2019t get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I\u2019m not going to express an opinion,\u201d she told an audience in Winnipeg. \u201cIt is in our process and that\u2019s where it belongs.\u201d In July, 2015: \u201cI am not going to second guess (Obama) because I was in a position to set this in motion,\u201d Clinton told a voter at a town hall event in New Hampshire. \u201cI want to wait and see what he and Secretary (John) Kerry decide.\u201d She added, \u201cIf it is undecided when I become President, I will answer your question.\u201d In these instances, Clinton clearly avoided definitive support of the pipeline. Clinton carefully phrased her answers as \u201cinclined to\u201d move ahead with the project. And as Clinton phrased it during CNN\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in October 2015: \u201cI never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.\u201d Indeed. While her answer\u2019s may exemplify \u201cpolitispeak\u201d at its best, Clinton never stated definitively that the administration would support the pipeline. Our verdict on McConnell\u2019s charge that Clinton changed positions on Keystone XL: false.",

            "article_content": "Pence is deep in Trump's vice presidential vetting process He would accept the job if it were offered, sources say The prospect of Donald Trump tapping Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to serve as his running mate has both national Republicans and local party members salivating \u2013 but for different reasons. Pence is deep in Trump\u2019s vice presidential vetting process, tasking two aides with coordinating with the campaign and flying over the weekend with his wife, Karen, to meet with Trump in New Jersey. After meeting Trump, Pence told aides Wednesday he expects \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the governor\u2019s office \u2013 but also indirectly confirmed that he\u2019d accept the vice presidential nod if offered, and would remain Indiana governor through November\u2019s election, rather than resigning his post to focus on the campaign. \u201cEven if I become vice president, I can fill out my term,\u201d Pence told staffers, according to an Indiana Republican familiar with the discussions. READ: The race to replace Mike Pence is already underway Time is running out for both Pence and Trump: Pence has to decide by July 15 whether to run for re-election as governor or join Trump, since Indiana law prohibits doing both past that date. And the Trump campaign has set an informal deadline for announcing his pick by next week \u2013 highlighted by the breakneck pace of meetings with potential running mates like Pence and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. That ticking clock has Republicans eyeing Trump\u2019s visit to Indianapolis next Tuesday for a fundraiser and rally as the perfect chance for Pence to seal the deal. \u201cThe general feeling is there\u2019s a 45% chance and that everybody got along famously,\u201d said one Indiana Republican briefed on the Pences\u2019 meeting with Trump over the weekend. Marc Lotter, Pence\u2019s re-election campaign spokesman, referred questions about the vice presidential selection process to the Trump campaign. con \u201cGov. Pence has said multiple times that nothing has been offered and nothing has been accepted,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGov. Pence remains focused on his duties as governor of the state of Indiana and his re-election in 2016.\u201d The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Pence meets Trump\u2019s stated needs \u2013 a veteran Washington insider who could shepherd Trump\u2019s agenda through Congress, where he rocketed to prominence as a member of the Republican leadership. He also fulfills desires from national GOP elites: unflappable message discipline and a bridge to social conservatives and top-dollar GOP donors. It also makes for a good fit for Indiana Republicans, who are ready for Pence to go after a tumultuous first term in Indiana that has opened up a chance for Democrats to claim the governor\u2019s office. If that means sending Pence on the road with Trump, all the better. Removing Pence from the governor\u2019s race, several senior Indiana Republican officials, aides and operatives said, would allow the state GOP to escape from the turmoil of years of social battles over same-sex marriage and religious freedom. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Pence would accept the vice presidential nomination if he\u2019s asked, several sources who have spoken with him or have been briefed on his meeting with Trump said, arguing he could help Trump with the party\u2019s most conservative factions. For Trump, there\u2019d also be symbolism in tapping Pence. Indiana was the state that clinched the Republican nomination for him. Even after Pence endorsed Ted Cruz \u2013 praising Trump, too, while doing it \u2013 Trump crushed his rivals, knocking Cruz and then Ohio Gov. John Kasich from the race and securing his spot as the presumptive Republican nominee. In recent days, Pence directed D.C.-based lobbyist Josh Pitcock and his Indiana-based campaign attorney Matt Morgan to answer the Trump campaign\u2019s vetting requests, with Pitcock handling document delivery, according to several senior Indiana Republican operatives familiar with Pence\u2019s plans who were granted anonymity to speak candidly about the process. Both Pitcock and Morgan offer a view into Pence\u2019s inner circle and his commitment to the process. Pitcock was part of Pence\u2019s top staff when he was a high-ranking figure in Congress as chairman of the House Republican Conference. He\u2019s an important line to another former Pence staffer there \u2013 Marc Short, who was the top political adviser in Washington for the Koch brothers, the conservative mega-donors who so far have declined to invest in spending on behalf of Trump. Short, along with consultant Nick Ayers, ad-maker John Brabender and strategist Kellyanne Conway, are the foundations of Pence\u2019s national operation. Conway, two national GOP operatives said, began pitching Pence as a vice presidential pick to Trump\u2019s team as soon as Ted Cruz withdrew from the race. Conway was hired by Trump\u2019s campaign last week. Morgan, meanwhile, works for Barnes and Thornburg law firm managing partner Bob Grand, an Indiana powerbroker and fundraiser who was a key figure in George W. Bush\u2019s fundraising operation \u2013 another signal that Pence could help shore up Trump\u2019s nascent attempts to reach donors and match Hillary Clinton in the money race. Pence appeals to other influential conservative groups, too. \u201cMike Pence would make a very good VP,\u201d said Club for Growth President David McIntosh, who like Pence is a former Indiana congressman. How to pick a running mate \u2013 and how not to Though the Koch network isn\u2019t monolithic, and Charles and David Koch aren\u2019t supporting Trump, several sources connected to it said Pence would help donors overall grow more comfortable with the GOP ticket. Pence could bridge the divide between Trump base of anti-establishment supporters and the religious and social conservatives who rallied behind Cruz and many of whom are supporting the delegate revolt at the GOP convention. However, it\u2019s not clear that Trump needs help with those voters: As long as a convention rebellion is staved off, they\u2019re unlikely to support Clinton in November anyway. Short, who left his post in the Koch network to assist Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign and is now a consultant, said Pence\u2019s time in Congress would be an asset, pointing to his opposition to No Child Left Behind, the bank bailout and Medicare Part D. \u201cMike has the credentials that earned him affection among the tea party back long ago, when he was one of the only congressmen speaking at a tea party rally at the Capitol back in 2009,\u201d he said. The question that many Indiana Republican leaders have been asking behind the scenes is whether Pence can square his deep and sincere religious convictions with a man who cited \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d \u2013 a verbal misstep, since Christians typically would say \u201csecond\u201d rather than \u201ctwo\u201d in citing scripture. Joni Ernst\u2019s big RNC moment likely won\u2019t be as VP Pence, meanwhile, has had trouble in his four years in the governor\u2019s office \u2013 struggling to grasp the reins of state government after spending 12 years as a congressman more often reacting to events than setting an agenda. His travails were largely written off in his first full year in office because of a combination of learning curve and the incredibly high bar for performance set by predecessor Mitch Daniels, who had just wrapped an exhaustive eight-year tenure at the Statehouse with speculation that he\u2019d run for president. But 2015 proved to be disastrous for Pence politically, laying the groundwork for an opening for Democrats. The first signs of trouble appeared when The Indianapolis Star scooped Pence on his own plans to launch a state-run news service. Pence\u2019s response, including allowing the debacle to overshadow his rollout of a state-crafted Medicaid expansion, foreshadowed the crippling fight he would face on \u201creligious freedom\u201d just a few months later. Conservative lawmakers, not Pence, started the push for Indiana\u2019s \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act,\u201d which ultimately proved deeply unpopular with the business community. But the blame fell on his own shoulders, in the wake of backlash from the likes of the NCAA and others. How Newt Gingrich became Donald Trump's inside man And at the height of the battle, one of Pence\u2019s greatest political strengths \u2013 his unerring ability to deliver the message he wants despite dogged questioning \u2013 became a crippling weakness under the national media spotlight. In one memorable exchange, ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos grilled him on national television, and Pence refused to answer direct questions about whether the law would discriminate against gay couples. The damage to Pence\u2019s brand was deep: His support plummeted from 62% in February of 2015 to 45% and his disapproval rating rose to 46%, according to a poll conducted by Bellwether Research for Howey Politics Indiana. The deeper damage to Pence was among women voters \u2013 one area of weakness for Trump that Pence would be precisely the wrong candidate to help with. Still, a leader in the national conservative movement said Pence would be a \u201csolidifying\u201d choice for Republicans not yet sold on Trump. The conservative said Pence \u2013 a devoutly religious man \u2013 would need to be sure he feels \u201ccalled by God\u201d to abandon the governor\u2019s office to run for vice president. Pence isn\u2019t \u201csitting there pining for it, hoping for it,\u201d the conservative movement leader said \u2013 adding that Pence still would likely accept the role. Jenny Beth Martin, the president of Tea Party Patriots, said he\u2019d \u201cgive those GOP voters still undecided about Trump a reason to unite and vote for a more principled ticket.\u201d \u201cMike Pence is a man who, time after time, does what he thinks is best for conservative principles, the country, and his party,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe seems to be a man who would once again put those principles first and consider walking away from a winning reelection campaign if it is best for the country \u2026 A Trump-Pence ticket could be just what Trump needs to unite the party and win.\u201d",

But it does not line up with Sanders\u2019 positions on trade, a carbon tax and a Medicare-for-all single-payer health insurance system. \u201cWe have made some good gains,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have more to do.\u201d Sanders has said he\u2019ll support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and do everything he can to defeat Republican Donald Trump in November. But, pressed about polls that show nearly half of his voters not currently supporting Clinton, Sanders said she\u2019ll need to embrace progressive policy positions to win over those supporters. \u201cAnd if she does the right thing, I am absolutely confident that the vast majority of my voters will vote for her,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is the process we are engaged in right now. We\u2019re working on the Democratic platform. We are talking to the Clinton campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope very much that Secretary Clinton understands that not only is it good public policy, it\u2019s the right thing to do; it is good politics to begin to move in that direction.\u201d Sanders said he doesn\u2019t believe Trump will win in the general election \u2013 in part because of his refusal to accept climate science and his proposed cuts in taxes for the wealthy. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Sanders also said Trump goes against \u201ccenturies of struggle that we have had in this country to combat discrimination.\u201d \u201cThat is not the candidate that the American people are going to support in November,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Progressives huddling in Chicago to plot path forward Prominent Sanders backers Cornel West and Tulsi Gabbard to speak Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgent presidential bid has effectively ended, but for the progressive army that stood at the front lines of his \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d a new campaign kicks off on Friday in Chicago at a \u201cPeople\u2019s Summit\u201d expected to draw several thousand supporters. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some genuine discussion and debate about how to unify all these disparate movements, how to take the energy and enthusiasm, and coalition that came together around the Sanders campaign and continue it,\u201d National Nurses United spokesman Chuck Idelson told CNN. The Vermont senator, a democratic socialist who sought the Democratic party\u2019s nomination, did not endorse Hillary Clinton on Thursday night and urged supporters to keep up their efforts during and beyond the election season. \u201cThe political revolution must continue,\u201d Sanders told his followers. RELATED: Sanders vows to help Clinton fight Trump Coordinated primarily by NNU, a Sanders-backing union with ties to a supportive super PAC, and People for Bernie, the \u201cPeople\u2019s Summit\u201d is slated to feature a mix of local activists and some of the campaign\u2019s top national surrogates, including Dr. Cornel West, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and former NAACP President Ben Jealous. \u201cActivists are going to congregate and work on process and working groups and have breakout sessions and talk more broadly about what\u2019s next,\u201d said People for Bernie co-founder and Occupy Wall Street alum Winnie Wong. \u201cWhat does the movement look like? What kind of platform do we demand? What kind of democracy are we going to create together?\u201d More than 3,000 potential allies are expected to take up those weighty questions during a three-day series of panel discussions, film screenings, and workshop sessions with titles like \u201cBuilding Independent Political Power\u201d and \u201cEnding Voter Suppression, Mass Incarceration, Deportations and Gender Inequality.\u201d Among the participants will be representatives and members of a broad swath of progressive organizations, including the Working Families Party, Reclaim Chicago, 350.org and dozens more. Thanks in large part to Sanders, the issues they\u2019ve chipped at for years \u2013 raising the national minimum wage to $15, implementing Medicare for all, reducing the gap between rich and poor, expanding voting rights, passing criminal justice reform, making higher education free while ending student debt, and imposing new taxes on Wall Street \u2013 have become familiar to even the casual political observer. But the questions facing the senator\u2019s supporters and the progressive left become more complicated outside the laser focus of an electoral campaign, when voting dates and ballot imperatives offer structure to the fight \u2013 and the candidate has a media platform and debates and town halls to communicate to the nation. Speaking to progressive writer Kate Aronoff in April, organizer and journalist James Schneider, an activist and ally of the leftist British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, underlined the challenge \u2013 and opportunity \u2013 now facing the Berniecrats in the wake of Clinton\u2019s victory. \u201cThe strategy needs to be made clear very early on (after the contest is resolved),\u201d he said, warning that the energy created by the campaign will quickly fade. \u201cIt would be important for some legitimate figure to hold it together. It\u2019d probably have to be Bernie Sanders himself. I understand the problematic elements of saying that you need a singular authority figure in order to launch a sustainable democratic movement, but I think that is the case.\u201d Further complicating matters is the rise of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Organizers like Idelson have expressed concern that energy otherwise devoted to crafting an \u201cinspiring, affirmative program\u201d could be sapped by anti-Trump efforts. Sanders is among the invitees to the summit \u2013 Clinton wasn\u2019t asked to attend \u2013 and Idelson is \u201chopeful\u201d the Vermont senator will turn up to address the gathering, but he stressed that presidential politics would be a secondary interest in Chicago. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve described it is this is more like a \u2018Bernie moment\u2019 rather than a \u2018Bernie movement,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of people who have been working in politics for a very long time and Bernie\u2019s a part of that, but this would have been happening even if he had not run. The fact that he did run crystallized a lot of things.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"If Marco decides to run, it's going to be tough,\" said Montana Sen. Jon Tester But Democrats hope another defeat this year will harm his 2020 chances Top Democrats are plotting a new effort to derail Marco Rubio if he seeks re-election to his Senate seat, saying they will pour millions to defeat the Florida senator in the hopes that a defeat would end his once-rising political career. With Rubio now reconsidering a run for the Senate, Democratic leaders have sharpened their focus on Florida, piecing together an anti-Rubio campaign that attacks the Florida senator for skipping hearings and voting against a high-profile gun bill \u2013 and tying him to presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. But above all else, Democrats say, their donors and supporters will be motivated by the expectation that a Rubio loss would end the senator\u2019s chances of ever becoming president. \u201cIf Marco decides to run, it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Montana Sen. Jon Tester, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN Tuesday. \u201cIf he gets beat twice in one year, it\u2019s not good for him,\u201d he added, a reference to Rubio\u2019s defeat in his home state during the Republican presidential primary fight. \u201cDemocrats are going to really go after him,\u201d said one high-ranking Democratic source who asked not to be named discussing internal strategy. \u201cBecause if he loses this time, he\u2019s gone for president in 2020.\u201d Citing Orlando shootings, Rubio opens door to Senate run Democrats, of course, have a reason to issue their warning now: They have a better chance at winning back the Senate seat if Rubio decides to retire at the end of the year. But the DSCC and other Democratic outside groups, including American Bridge and the Senate Majority PAC, are preparing to spend tens of millions in the expensive state against Rubio, and officials say the attacks against the senator in the perennial swing state will be relentless. The Democratic National Committee, which dug heavily into Rubio\u2019s record in the presidential campaign, has already been in contact with the DSCC to share opposition research, according to a source familiar with the matter. John Morgan, an attorney and major Florida Democratic donor, said that Rubio will be \u201cdone forever\u201d if he loses a bid for a second term. To make that happen, he said, donors would pour big bucks behind Rep. Patrick Murphy, the favorite of the Democratic establishment, who is facing progressive firebrand Rep. Alan Grayson in the August primary. \u201cI think if Marco Rubio runs, Patrick Murphy will have more money than he can spend in Florida,\u201d Morgan said. Rubio has until June 24 to make a decision on whether to run, but the calculation is complicated. Rubio confidantes say he\u2019d like to run for president again, potentially in 2020 if Trump loses this fall, and they believe he could be better positioned to do so by not having the baggage of holding a political office. Yet if the GOP loses his seat, and the Senate majority, Rubio could be accused of not doing more to help his party stay in power. Plus, he could lose a national platform that being a senator provides. On Tuesday, Rubio and his aides declined to comment. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about campaigns today,\u201d Rubio told CNN Tuesday. But increasingly, Rubio has kept the door open to running. After insisting repeatedly that he would be a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d in January if he lost his bid at the White House, the Florida senator has come under intensifying pressure from Senate Republicans and top donors to change his mind. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans fear that the current crop of Florida Senate GOP candidates are underfunded and have performed poorly thus far, arguing that only Rubio stands a chance of keeping the Senate seat from flipping to the Democrats. \u201cI hope he runs,\u201d said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cI think he\u2019s struggling with the decision right now. I think if he runs, he\u2019ll be a heavy favorite.\u201d Adding to the pressure, GOP outside groups are planning to spend heavily to help Rubio, but some warn they\u2019d sit out in the general election if he decides not to run. \u201cThere is literally one person in America who has the ability to dramatically increase the chances of Republicans keeping the majority \u2013 Marco Rubio,\u201d said Steven Law, a former chief of staff to McConnell who now runs the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund. \u201cIf Marco\u2019s in for Florida, we\u2019re in for him \u2013 money, marbles and the chalk.\u201d Rubio: Orlando shooting \u2018new face of the war on terror\u2019 Rubio friends say it\u2019s uncertain what the senator will ultimately do. But after returning to the Senate following his loss in the Florida primary to Trump, Rubio has become more engaged in his job, taking a leading role pushing for funding to combat the Zika virus and now helping in the federal response to the massacre at an Orlando nightclub last weekend. Speaking to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Monday, Rubio suggested that the fallout from the deadly Orlando shootings had made him rethink his own life choices. \u201cI haven\u2019t even given it thought in that perspective, other than to say I\u2019ve been deeply impacted by it and I think when it visits your home states, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause, to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,\u201d Rubio told Hewitt. \u201cYou know, honestly, I haven\u2019t thought about it from a political perspective but it most certainly has impacted my thinking in general about a lot of things,\u201d Rubio added before saying: \u201cMy family and I will be praying about all this. We\u2019ll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.\u201d Rubio has cited his longtime friendship of a GOP candidate in the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, as a prime reason why he wasn\u2019t planning on running. But top Republicans want the lieutenant governor to step aside and make way for Rubio, and many believe the candidate would drop out if the senator asked his close friend to make way for his re-election bid. Courtney Alexander, a spokeswoman for the lieutenant governor, did not respond to multiple inquiries on whether her boss would definitively stay in the race. Only Rep. David Jolly has signaled he\u2019d drop his Senate run if Rubio jumped in, but the other GOP candidates in the race have insisted they\u2019d stay in no matter what Rubio does. \u201cWe\u2019re not concerned with Washington insider chatter,\u201d said Brad Herold, campaign manager for GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Senate candidate. So if Rubio runs, he\u2019s bound to face criticism on both the right and the left. Democrats plan to hammer Rubio over his opposition to a bill that would deny terrorist suspects of purchasing firearms. DSCC spokeswoman Sadie Weiner said Rubio has an \u201cimpossible record\u201d to defend, citing his missed votes, support for Trump \u2013 whom Rubio himself once called a \u201ccon artist\u201d who should not have access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes \u2013 and his opposition to the gun bill. An official with American Bridge said that the group will also push on traditional Democratic attacks over Social Security and Medicare, as well as social issues such as same-sex marriage. And the high-spending Senate Majority PAC has already reserved more than $10 million in television airtime in Florida, adding to the $10 million booked by the DSCC. On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid took to the floor and lashed out at Rubio, an unusual rebuke but a sign of things to come if the GOP senator runs for reelection. \u201cHow can the junior senator from Florida \u2013 who all of a sudden is again interested in running for re-election \u2013 how can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?\u201d Reid said. Republicans oppose the gun bill because they argue it will sweep up innocent people unfairly, prompting them to lose their constitutional rights. And Rubio\u2019s GOP allies said that Democrats are attacking the senator now because they are scared of his potential candidacy. \u201cMost everyone here would want to see him run for reelection,\u201d said Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kentucky should be a good state for Clinton Sanders needs to win big to cut into Clinton's lead If Bernie Sanders is going to catch Hillary Clinton, he\u2019ll need to narrow the delegate gap \u2013 significantly \u2013 on Tuesday night. Two Democratic presidential primaries are taking place: Kentucky, with 55 pledged delegates up for grabs, and Oregon, with 61 delegates. Kentucky also has five additional superdelegates and Oregon an additional 13, but those are not specifically at stake Tuesday. For Sanders, erasing Clinton\u2019s lead in pledged delegates (currently 1,722 to 1,424) will take winning about two-thirds of those that remain. That\u2019s to say nothing of Clinton\u2019s huge edge among superdelegates \u2013 a project Sanders is saving for later. Here\u2019s what to watch in Tuesday\u2019s contests: Kentucky should be a good state for Clinton. Her husband was the last Democrat to carry it in a general election, in 1992 and 1996, and she beat then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama there in 2008. READ: Changing superdelegate rules would still leave Sanders behind Clinton mocks Trump in hypothetical debate In an attempt to avoid her mistakes in Indiana (where Sanders spent nearly $2 million to Clinton\u2019s $0 on the airwaves, and Sanders narrowly won), the Democratic front-runner has invested more time and money in the Bluegrass State. She\u2019s held 11 campaign events over three visits in a two-week span. \u201cEverybody\u2019s ready to go vote,\u201d Clinton said in Paducah on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this: I\u2019m not going to give up on Kentucky in November.\u201d But Clinton\u2019s campaigned hard and still lost before \u2013 most notably in Michigan. Clinton knows that with a big delegate lead, wins in states like Kentucky could turn Sanders\u2019 efforts to catch her from improbable to impossible. As soon as she can do that, she can turn her attention fully to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2013 a pivot Clinton has wanted to make for two months. Sanders, meanwhile, will have his eyes on Oregon, a culturally liberal West Coast state where he\u2019ll need to rack up a massive margin of victory \u2013 and hope it\u2019ll foreshadow similar results on June 7 in California. The math doesn't favor Bernie Sanders, despite wins Since a blowout in Kentucky is unlikely, the Vermont senator will need to crush Clinton out West. It\u2019ll have to start with a win in Oregon. Then, he\u2019ll need to pick up smaller states like Montana and North Dakota \u2013 and top it off with a big win in California. \u201cHere in North Dakota and the remaining seven other states we\u2019re going to have to win about 65% of the pledged delegates. Right now were at about 45.5%. I want to be at 50% plus one,\u201d he said Friday in Fargo, North Dakota. \u201cSo that\u2019s task No. 1.\u201d To understand why Clinton could win Kentucky on Tuesday, consider the state\u2019s recent history in gubernatorial elections. Then-Gov. Steve Beshear, a popular Democrat even in the red state, embraced Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and his implementation served as a national model. He\u2019s been succeeded by Republican Matt Bevin, who has set out to dismantle everything Beshear built, but also seen his approval ratings decline. Kentucky is a culturally conservative state with a history of electing moderate Democrats to statewide offices. That history \u2013 combined with Clinton campaigning as the protector of the Obama (and Beshear) legacy \u2013 will aid her in a state where bigger liberal programs like Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposal seem especially out of reach. Another factor working in Clinton\u2019s favor: Kentucky is a closed primary, which means only registered Democrats can participate \u2013 not the independents Sanders has so successfully brought into the voting booth elsewhere. She\u2019ll look to run up a significant margin in Jefferson County, home of Louisville and much of Kentucky\u2019s African-American population. There\u2019s nothing to watch on the Republican side on Tuesday. Donald Trump: London mayor made 'rude statements' Sure, Oregon is holding a GOP primary, too. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 who less than a month ago struck a deal with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to get a one-on-one showdown with Donald Trump there \u2013 has already dropped out of the race. Kasich: I\u2019m not endorsing Trump yet \u2014 or serving as his VP The only question to keep an eye on is whether Oregon Republicans will attempt to sending a message by refusing to vote for Trump. Still, Oregon is on pace to break the 1 million vote mark for only the second time in its history in a primary \u2013 with 2008, when Obama and Clinton were still competing, being the first. It was early 2015, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul had a problem: He knew he was running for president \u2013 but he also knew Kentucky state law prohibited from hedging his bets by staying on the ballot for re-election to the Senate, too. So he came up with an alternative. Paul raised and paid $250,000 to have Kentucky scrap its Republican presidential primary (originally set for Tuesday) in favor of caucuses to be held March 5. The problem: Paul didn\u2019t last even close to long enough to compete in Kentucky\u2019s presidential caucuses. The money was a waste, and now, Paul is on the ballot for a second term in the Senate. That\u2019s why in Kentucky, only Democrats will vote Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "\"I think we've had our fun. Now let's get serious,\" Pelosi said Pelosi added a not-so-veiled endorsement of Hillary Clinton House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday had harsh words for Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, saying she has \u201cgreat faith\u201d in the American people to deny him the White House in November. The California congresswoman, speaking to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation 2016 Fiscal Summit in Washington, acknowledged the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s popularity but downplayed his impact. \u201cRight now, Donald Trump has influence, but he doesn\u2019t have power, and I don\u2019t think he ever will,\u201d Pelosi said. Pelosi said Trump and other Republican efforts to demean the legitimacy of President Barack Obama paved the way for Trump, a former reality television star. But Pelosi said she believes voters are getting past the spectacle. \u201cI have great faith in the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had our fun. Now let\u2019s get serious.\u201d She also dismissed reports that Trump had once given to her campaign, saying she only met him once years ago. Pelosi\u2019s comments follow a scathing critique she made of the Republican Party earlier Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference, ripping party leaders who say they are not yet ready to support the presumptive GOP presidential nominee. \u201cSome Republicans, including members of their leadership, have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican front-runner,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cToday, we have gathered to ask, since when? Since when have House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas?\u201d Pelosi added: \u201cWhat has happened in this campaign is that Donald Trump has pulled back the veil. What he says is what they say, and now people can see the connection between them. And unless the Republican leadership is going to be as, shall we say, critical of their own members as they are of Donald Trump, it is all a show.\u201d Continuing on the 2016 race, Pelosi praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for choosing not to respond to Trump\u2019s personal attacks. \u201cThis is what the American people expect and deserve in a campaign. Elections are about the future,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that we could wish for, it\u2019s that the debate would go to a level of real substance and not where it has been going,\u201d she said. \u201cHillary\u2019s kept it to that place. I\u2019m very proud of her candidacy. And Bernie (Sanders) has too. It\u2019s all about the issues.\u201d Pelosi said that taking a high view in our presidential election is key to the U.S. role in the world. \u201cAn election is about who gets elected. But it\u2019s also about the tenor of how we take our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we have to recognize our importance as a model democracy to have an election that is worthy of our founders\u2019 sacrifice, our soldiers\u2019 sacrifice and our children.\u201d The minority leader dismissed the Democrats\u2019 superdelegate process \u2013 even though she is one. \u201cI am not a supporter of superdelegates. I am one. I have not even endorsed yet. I think there should be no doubt that what the people say is what the outcome would be,\u201d she said. Top Democrats just shy of endorsing Clinton But Pelosi hinted at endorsing the Democratic front-runner. \u201cThe next president \u2013 whoever she may be \u2013 will be one of the best qualified people to enter the Oval Office \u2013 knowledge, experience, vision, strategic thinking about how to get the job done,\u201d Pelosi said. The minority leader\u2019s veiled backing of Clinton comes after Vice President Joe Biden said he was \u201cconfident\u201d Clinton would be the nominee and eventually president and Obama joking at the White House Correspondents Dinner last month that \u201cit\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who she will be,\u201d referring to the next president. Pelosi didn\u2019t elaborate on her remark, but said, \u201cIf people see that as the standard, maybe they will measure other people by that standard as well. I think they\u2019ll recognize our responsibility to the American people to be \u2013 not mistake cruelty for wit, not mistake vitriol for strength, but to remember that we are this beautiful country, a nation of immigrants and a nation of freedom.\u201d During a campaign stop in Virginia on Monday, Clinton said she was in favor of allowing people to buy into Medicare at a certain age, a step to the left for the likely Democratic nominee. Asked about the proposal, Pelosi told Bash she\u2019d have to see more details of the plan before saying if it\u2019s a good idea. But, Pelosi said, \u201cI think what she proposed is responsible. Is it good for everybody? They have to check themselves, and we\u2019ll see as a matter of public policy.\u201d She added that she would need to review what the plan\u2019s impact would be on the deficit as well.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders aims to force Democrats to adopt \"the strongest progressive\" platform Sanders held his first campaign event after Hillary Clinton's wins Tuesday Facing daunting delegate math, Bernie Sanders now has a back-up plan: to force Democrats to adopt \u201cthe strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen.\u201d In his first campaign event after Hillary Clinton crushed Sanders in four East Coast primaries, the Vermont senator told a crowd of college students Wednesday at Indiana\u2019s Purdue University that he won\u2019t exit the Democratic race despite Clinton\u2019s massive advantage in the delegate race. \u201cLet me make this clear, so that there\u2019s no confusion: We are in this campaign to win and become the Democratic nominee,\u201d Sanders said to cheers. But he also acknowledged the reality that Clinton has a lead of more than 300 pledged delegates, and once super delegates are included, CNN estimates she has 2,168 of the 2,383 she needs to win the Democratic nomination. \u201cWe are in this campaign to win, but if we do not win, we intend to win every delegate that we can, so that when we go to Philadelphia in July, we\u2019re going to have the votes to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seen,\u201d Sanders said. He continued, \u201cAnd our job, whether we win or whether we do not win, is to transform not only our country, but the Democratic Party \u2013 to open the doors of the Democratic Party to working people and young people and senior citizens in a way that does not exist today.\u201d Sanders made the case that he\u2019s the more electable general election candidate because he can draw more independents into the process than Clinton. \u201cI am very good in arithmetic, and I can count delegates, and we are behind today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? Unusual things happen in politics, and with your help, we are going to win the pledged delegates, and with your help, super delegates may well reach the conclusion that Bernie Sanders will be the strongest candidate against Donald Trump.\u201d Sanders pledge to win was a different message than his statement that was distributed after Tuesday\u2019s results, which some translated as repositioning the campaign off winning the nomination to focusing on altering the party\u2019s platform. \u201cThat is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change,\u201d Sanders said in the statement. Sanders\u2019 campaign manager said the statement was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a concession of the nomination fight, adding, \u201cThis has been a campaign for the nomination, it continues to be.\u201d Sanders did not back down at Wednesday\u2019s event on his criticisms of Clinton, despite Clinton offering an olive branch to Sanders and his supporters in her victory speech on Tuesday night. Instead, Sanders stuck to comparing and contrasting their records, hitting her for a $12-an-hour minimum wage that falls short of his call for a national minimum $15 wage. He also hit her on trade, fracking, and a tax on carbon. And he did not let the opportunity pass to hit her for the speeches she made to Wall Street \u2013 though he didn\u2019t make his common demand to \u201crelease the transcripts.\u201d The senator also criticized the Clintons, both of them, in a bigger picture argument he made about taking on the establishment. \u201cWe were taking on the most powerful politician organization that had elected Bill Clinton for two administrations and run a very strong campaign in 2008,\u201d he said of the odds being stacked against his bid since day one. At Sanders\u2019 rally at Purdue, supporters who\u2019d just heard him lay out the delegate math were coming to grips with the reality that the nomination now looks out of their candidate\u2019s reach. \u201cIt would be close to a miracle for it to happen, but you do have massive states like California,\u201d said David Mason, a 42-year-old Lafayette photographer. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold my breath,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be canvassing this Saturday with my daughter here in Lafayette.\u201d Republican front-runner Donald Trump made a play in a Tuesday night speech for Sanders supporters \u2013 but none at Wednesday\u2019s rally were interested in backing the real estate mogul. Some, though, said they\u2019d back the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. Jeremiah Beaver, a 36-year-old video editor from Indianapolis, said he\u2019s \u201cashamed\u201d that he skipped 2012\u2019s election because he felt like Obama had \u201csold us out.\u201d This time, though, he\u2019d back Stein, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot: What is Clinton going to do when the 40% of progressives and independents walk away?\u201d Beaver said. \u201cBecause we will.\u201d Other Sanders supporters, though, said they\u2019re too afraid of Trump to back the Republican. Eighteen-year-old Noblesville high schooler John Parke said he\u2019d support Clinton if she defeats Sanders. \u201cThe debate Bernie and Hillary are having is the right kind of debate: Whether there should be debt-free college or free college,\u201d he said, \u201cnot whether we should just do nothing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats clashed at the CNN debate in Brooklyn Here's what you need to know Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled over her judgment and his grasp of policy in a tense and at times personal debate here Thursday, less than a week before the pivotal New York primary. Held in prime time and on a weeknight \u2013 unlike most Democratic debates \u2013 the CNN-sponsored event was the highest-profile opportunity for both campaigns to make their final arguments before Tuesday\u2019s crucial vote in a state where both contenders have strong roots. Clinton is looking to New York to solidify her role as front-runner, while a strong showing \u2013 or a victory \u2013 for Sanders would deal a significant blow to her confidence and bolster his campaign\u2019s argument that the party\u2019s so-called super delegates should switch their allegiance to him. Here are six takeaways from the most combative Democratic debate yet: The Democratic candidates took sharp aim at one another almost immediately over a series of issues, including the Iraq War, Wall Street and questions about judgment and qualifications to be president. Both contenders shifted back and forth between offense and defense, a sharp departure from the calmer tone of the party\u2019s earlier debates. Sanders began by explaining a recent comment he made on the campaign trail in which he suggested Clinton was \u201cunqualified\u201d to be president. \u201cDoes Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does. But I do question her judgment,\u201d Sanders said, pointing to her Senate vote for war in Iraq, her willingness for her campaign to benefit from millions of dollars spent on her behalf by super PACs and her relationship to Wall Street. \u201cSenator Sanders did call me unqualified. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things in my life. That was a first,\u201d Clinton responded, pointing to the fact that she was elected twice to the Senate and chosen as secretary of state. Democratic debate: CNN\u2019s Reality Check team vets the claims Clinton then counter-attacked, citing an interview Sanders gave to the New York Daily News in which he struggled to provide specifics about his plans for breaking up banks and other issues. \u201cTalk about judgment and talk about the kinds of difficulty he had answering questions, including his core issues,\u201d Clinton said. The sparring continued throughout the night, so much so that at one point, CNN debate moderator Wolf Blitzer moved to break up the fighters. \u201cIf you\u2019re both screaming at each other, the viewers won\u2019t be able to hear either of you,\u201d Blitzer said after Clinton and Sanders spent several seconds talking over each other. From rush transcript of tonight's CNN #DemDebate, so. much. crosstalk. pic.twitter.com/NevmdaBEqj Just a month ago, Clinton appeared poised and eager to pivot to the general election and start building a case against a Republican nominee. But Thursday\u2019s attacks on Sanders showed that her campaign realizes that she has to turn all of her attention to her left flank. At previous debates, she seemed to spend as much time talking about Republicans as Sanders. Not in Brooklyn. Clinton arrived at Thursday\u2019s debate with policy knives sharpened and ready. An hour before the contest, her campaign released a memo outlining the case she would make against Sanders and repeatedly released briefings throughout the night that both tried to defend her from attacks. At every turn possible, she criticized him on gun regulation, the release date of his tax returns, how he would break up big banks, provide Medicare for all and other issues. READ: The most memorable lines from the Democratic debate in Brooklyn Her campaign knows that next week\u2019s primary could be a major opportunity for her to stop Sanders\u2019 fast-growing momentum \u2013 or else. With time running out before Democrats go the polls, Clinton\u2019s aggressive tactics suggest that she knows she needs to start making some of the blows against Sanders count. A key difference in Clinton\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 approaches to governing was on full display during the debate over climate change. Clinton is a politician who is content with incremental change, seeing it as the most realistic \u2013 if not the only \u2013 way to achieve her goals. The Vermont senator wants sweeping change, and believes the nation\u2019s problems are too big for singles and doubles. He wants to swing for the fences. Their debate over climate change, in particular, highlighted their contrasting philosophies. Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker \u201cIncremental steps are not enough,\u201d Sanders said after Clinton knocked him for faulting the recent international Paris agreement on climate change. Clinton fired back, \u201cI don\u2019t take a back seat to your legislation that you have introduced that you have been unable to get passed.\u201d This is the heart of their differences: To Sanders, the Paris climate agreement does not go far enough, and therefore isn\u2019t good enough. To Clinton, the Paris agreement was the best deal possible. Once again, Clinton came under fire for keeping the content of her highly paid speeches to financial firms under wraps after she left the State Department. Sanders has hammered her for refusing to release transcripts of remarks she made to companies like Goldman Sachs, gigs that have earned her millions. \u201cWhy not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?\u201d CNN co-moderator Dana Bash asked Clinton. Clinton tried to use the question to criticize Sanders over financial reform, but Bash continued to press the issue. Clinton said she only would release transcripts if Republicans did the same. \u201cThere are certain expectations when you run for president. This is a new one. And I\u2019ve said, if everybody agrees to do it \u2013 because there are speeches for money on the other side. I know that,\u201d Clinton said, and again pivoted to Sanders by criticizing him for not yet releasing his tax returns. Sanders responded that he planned to release a year of tax returns Friday and would unveil more soon, which turned the attention back on Clintons\u2019 unwillingness to release the transcripts. The exchange highlighted Clinton\u2019s struggle with transparency\u2013whether it\u2019s over her State Department emails or what she tells Wall Street behind closed doors. Clinton and Sanders both acknowledged that the aggressive measures they championed in the 1990s to fight crime have proven to have disproportionately negative affects on African American communities, a fact for which she apologized Thursday. When asked if the move was a \u201cnet positive\u201d in the fight against crime, Clinton defended the good intentions of the measure, saying \u201cit had some positive aspects to it,\u201d but conceded that as new information has come to light about the adverse affects of policy, so should approaches to problems. \u201cIf we were to have the balance sheet on one side there are some positive actions and changes. On the other side there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people\u2019s lives. I\u2019ve seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities. That\u2019s why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue\u2026 because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.\u201d In a rare moment of agreement during an otherwise contentious night, Sanders also expressed regret for some of the outcomes of the bill. \u201cMuch of what Secretary Clinton said was right. We had a crime bill. I voted for it. It had the Violence Against Women Act in it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system. We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up. And that means, for a start \u2013 and we don\u2019t talk about this. The media doesn\u2019t talk about it \u2013 you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed. You know what I think? Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.\u201d The apologies largely stopped there, however, as Clinton took on Sanders over gun policy. When Blitzer said that a parent of a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings had called on Sanders to apologize for opposing a measure that would allow victims of gun violence to sue firearms companies, he declined. \u201cI voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don\u2019t believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them \u2013 somebody walks in. They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.\u201d \u201cSo, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?\u201d Blitzer asked. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is on the verge of failing to pass a budget The budget drama is a big political black eye for Ryan and his top lieutenants House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2013 who developed a national profile as one of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest thinkers \u2013 is on the verge of failing to pass a budget, an embarrassing setback that underscores deep divisions inside the GOP. As a practical matter, Ryan, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee, doesn\u2019t need a budget. The two-year fiscal deal that his predecessor, John Boehner, negotiated before stepping down set overall federal spending level for the next fiscal year. But the budget drama is a big political black eye for Ryan and his top lieutenants who promised a return to \u201cregular order\u201d under his leadership. Completing a budget would have allowed them to lay down markers on big policy changes and give a potential Republican president the chance the move quickly in 2017 on plans to simplify the tax code, replace Obamacare and make significant changes to Medicare and Social Security. Paul Ryan's career in politics Instead, Ryan has been wrestling for months with conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus, most of whom opposed the budget deal brokered by Boehner. Without support from some in this group, no GOP budget can pass \u2013 and the clock is ticking. Under budget rules, the House and Senate have until Friday to approve a fiscal blueprint, but no vote is scheduled. House members return Tuesday, and aides and members report little progress was made over the long spring break recess to break the impasse. \u201cBoth sides are too far part at this point to suggest we\u2019ll make an April 15 deadline,\u201d North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told CNN in a phone interview. The tumult comes as Ryan is at the center of speculation that he might emerge from the Republican National Convention this summer as a consensus presidential nominee if the party can\u2019t unite behind Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Ryan formally ruled out that prospect Tuesday afternoon. Meadows said there are still ongoing talks to see whether there\u2019s an alternative plan that achieves significant savings from changes to Medicare or food stamp programs that would move separately from the budget. But even if GOP leaders move a so-called \u201csidecar\u201d bill, many conservatives say that\u2019s not good enough because there\u2019s no guarantee the Senate would even take it up and the budget they don\u2019t like would still move forward without the cuts they want. South Carolina GOP Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal conservative who has been pushing for deeper spending cuts, told CNN \u201cpart of the reason that many Republicans are balking (on the budget) is not just because of the number but because we see it being meaningless.\u201d He said during his tenure in Congress, not one appropriation bill has been enacted into law. Instead, he complained that members vote year after year on stopgap spending bills or a \u201ccromnibus\u201d that rolls several bills and policy changes into massive legislation. He\u2019s holding out some hope that the GOP-led Senate can pass appropriations bills that he and other House Republicans can consider so Congress can return to the regular process on annual spending bills. Leadership aides and conservatives tell CNN there are still efforts this week to discuss action on the budget. \u201cNo final decisions have been made. The chairman looks forward to continuing to work with his colleagues to advance a balanced budget that promotes common-sense, conservative solutions to the nation\u2019s fiscal, economic and national security challenges,\u201d William Allison, a spokesman for House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, told CNN. But conservatives continue to stress that they never liked the deal Boehner cut, didn\u2019t vote for it, and without a guarantee that they get major cuts to mandatory programs attached to a must-pass bill, they are reluctant to back a budget on the House floor. \u201cBoehner called it cleaning the barn, Paul Ryan called it a crap sandwich, now we\u2019re supposed to vote for it? That\u2019s quite an ask,\u201d GOP Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia told CNN. He blamed Senate Republicans for stalling action on a budget to help protect some of those facing tough re-election races from having to take some tough votes. Although many of the Republicans CNN interviewed concede it doesn\u2019t send a good message that their party can\u2019t rally around a budget proposal, they don\u2019t hold Ryan personally responsible or believe there will be any serious fallout for him. Many cite his efforts over several months to listen to input from members, and privately and publicly saying he won\u2019t shove any plan down their throats. The speaker made it clear in private sessions that it\u2019s his preference to pass a budget and start action on the dozen spending bills so Republicans could put their stamp on federal agencies\u2019 funding priorities, and work to add restrictions to programs they oppose. But he\u2019s also repeatedly stressed that he\u2019s not a dictator and said if members couldn\u2019t come to an agreement, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if they skipped a budget this year. \u201cSome would view it as a positive,\u201d Meadows told CNN, praising Ryan for the hours he has spent listening to members\u2019 concerns and trying to find common ground, adding, \u201cIn times in the past, there would have been a forced vote. And because there is not a consensus from the bottom up, he has not done that.\u201d Brat told CNN that not passing a budget sends the wrong signal. \u201cConservatives are upset at us, and the American people are upset at us,\u201d he said, and said the only way Republicans can impact the Obama administration\u2019s policies is through the power of the purse. Normally, the internal food fights inside the House GOP have generated more outrage from fuming conservative activists who want GOP leaders to take a harder line. But the contentious 2016 battle for the Republican presidential nomination is sucking up most of the oxygen for those activists this spring. \u201cNot a single person has asked me about the budget,\u201d Mulvaney told CNN, stressing he held more than 30 events with constituents over the spring recess in his district.",

The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Rubio on Trump\u2019s diminutive digits By Chip Grabow, CNN It wasn\u2019t long into Thursday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate in Detroit that the size of Donald Trump\u2019s hands came under the microscope. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was asked, after long denouncing the use of personal attacks in the campaign, why he recently changed tactics and chose to make more personal attacks on Trump. Moderator Chris Wallace noted that in recent days, Rubio made very personal attacks, including a jab he made at the size of Trump\u2019s hands during a campaign rally in Virginia on Sunday. Rubio responded to Wallace, saying the focus should be on \u201cthe issues that matter to this country.\u201d But Trump wanted to talk about Rubio\u2019s hand slur: \u201cNobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee you.\u201d Trump seemed to think Rubio\u2019s hand slur was a lightly veiled insult to Trump\u2019s manhood. So what did Rubio actually say? Rubio told the Virginia rally: \u201cHe\u2019s always calling me Little Marco. And I\u2019ll admit he\u2019s taller than me, he\u2019s like 6\u2019 2\u201d, which is why I don\u2019t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5\u2019 2\u201d. Have you seen his hands? They\u2019re like this. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can\u2019t trust them.\u201d While Rubio\u2019s comment wasn\u2019t an explicit reference to Trump\u2019s masculine endowment, it does appear Rubio\u2019s jab at Trump was aimed, well, below the belt. Verdict: True. Reality Check: Trump on Rubio\u2019s worst Senate absentee record By Sonam Vashi, CNN Trump brought up Rubio\u2019s truancy record in the Senate a couple times. \u201cThis guy has a number one, the number one absentee record in the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said. He later added, \u201cThe real con artist is Sen. Marco Rubio, who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. He doesn\u2019t go to vote. He\u2019s absent.\u201d Rubio has missed 224 of 1,512 roll call votes, or 15%, since he has been in the U.S. Senate, according to GovTrack, a leading government transparency website.  Compared with a median of 1.7% of missed roll call votes from the lifetime records of current senators, Rubio\u2019s percentage is quite high. Rubio also had the worst voting attendance record of any senator for 2015. Rubio has defended his absences, citing the presidential campaign and saying that voting is only one part of a job that also requires constituent services. His office has previously stated that Rubio is one of the few senators with young children who do not live in Washington, and he spends as much time in Florida with them as possible. However, GovTrack also analyzed how presidential campaigns affect candidates\u2019 voting records and found that Rubio\u2019s missed votes were still the most of current and former senator presidential candidates from the 2016 election cycle \u2013 higher than Sen. Ted Cruz. But it was lower than the missed votes from the 2008 election candidates; both President (and former Sen.) Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain had worse voting attendance records during a comparable time frame. The most no-show senator of all time was Sen. Maryon Allen, who served for five months in 1978 after her husband died in office. She missed 43.5% of the roll call votes during that time. Trump doesn\u2019t specify a time frame for his claim, but because Rubio had the No. 1 absentee record last year, we rate Trump\u2019s claim as true. Reality Check: Trump on spending cuts By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump has said the country can afford his tax cuts, which will add trillions to the nation\u2019s deficit, because he will cut waste, fraud and abuse. Asked on Thursday for specifics, he cited cutting down the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as squeezing better discounts out of drug companies. \u201cDepartment of Education. We\u2019re cutting Common Core. We\u2019re getting rid of Common Core. We\u2019re bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid of it in almost every form \u2026 Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste,\u201d Trump said. CNNMoney looked at this in January. It found that even if Trump cut the EPA and Education Department entirely, it would save less than 3% of the $3.7 trillion the federal government spent in the past year. The nation spent $90 billion on education and $7 billion on the EPA. As for saving hundreds of billions from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, that would be hard to do since Medicare is estimated to have spent $77 billion on drugs in 2015, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Total spending on drugs, which includes outlays by private insurers, was just under $300 billion in total in 2014, federal National Health Expenditures data. Can Trump make up for his tax cuts by cutting two federal agencies and negotiating with drug companies? Our verdict: false. Reality Check: Trump on 9/11 hijackers\u2019 wives By Ryan Browne, CNN Trump was asked whether he still supported targeting the family of terrorists as part of a U.S. counterterrorism strategy. Trump reaffirmed his stance and referenced the families of the terrorists who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, claiming they had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and saying that this knowledge justified including the families of terrorists on a list of targets. Trump said: \u201cThe wife knew exactly what was happening. They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right? I have no problem with it.\u201d The 9/11 Commission Report, the most exhaustive report on the attacks and the 19 hijackers, does not show any evidence to support this claim. According to the report, only two of the hijackers were married, and there is no evidence that either of the wives of the two hijackers had ever traveled to the United States, much less left the U.S. two days before the attacks. \u201cNone of the 9/11 terrorists could have \u2018sent their wives home\u2019 before the attacks because, as you suggest, none of them brought female companions to the United States,\u201d Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told The Washington Post in December. One of the hijackers did have a German girlfriend that had visited him in the United States, but her last visit to America was months before the attacks. The 9/11 Commission contains no evidence that supports Trump\u2019s claim. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Cruz beat Trump five times By Chip Grabow, CNN Texas Sen. Ted Cruz claimed he has beaten Trump five times during the primaries. During a plea to voters who think \u201cnominating Donald Trump would be a disaster,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cWe have demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald and if you don\u2019t want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.\u201d A quick look at results in the states that have held primaries or caucuses shows Cruz\u2019s record as having only won four states so far: Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska. But Cruz said \u201cfive separate times we have beat Donald.\u201d The key word being \u201cbeat\u201d\u2026 so in what states did Cruz do better than Trump? Minnesota, where Rubio took the most votes. But Cruz came in second ahead of Trump\u2019s third-place finish. Our verdict on Cruz\u2019s claim he has \u201cbeat Donald\u201d five separate times is true. Reality Check: Cruz on Obamacare as a job-killer By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Asked how he would bring back manufacturing jobs to Detroit, Cruz said he would lift regulations. And his No. 1 target is Obamacare. \u201cAs president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America,\u201d he said. In fact, Obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September. The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn\u2019t qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. Kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage. An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers\u2019 hours to retain talent and reduce training costs. As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it\u2019s nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Cruz on Trump hiring immigrants By Eve Bower, CNN One of Trump\u2019s most frequent claims on the campaign trail is that he will do the most for American workers, in part because he has a long record of creating jobs and employing \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people. On Thursday night, Cruz sought to weaken this claim, saying that many of those who were hired were brought in from overseas, including at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club resort: \u201cDown in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers.\u201d In August, Reuters analyzed data from the Department of Labor and found that, since 2000, companies owned by Trump had \u201csought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas,\u201d including about 70 \u201cforeign workers\u201d who had recently been requested to serve as cooks, wait staff and cleaners at the Florida resort. Cruz noted that though the resort jobs were in high demand in Palm Beach, few locals have actually been hired: \u201cRoughly 300 applied. Donald hired 17,\u201d he said, referring to federal data published in The New York Times last week. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get help,\u201d Trump has said. Cruz\u2019s accusations about Trump hiring workers from overseas are true. But from there, Cruz departed into claims that were more difficult to substantiate: \u201cHis record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens and abusing American workers.\u201d CNN has previously investigated claims that Trump hired undocumented workers from Poland in the early 1980s, the most specific claim about Trump and undocumented workers that has been made. Trump has denied ever knowing that the workers were undocumented since the hiring was made by a contracting company. A subsequent legal case regarding Trump\u2019s involvement in withholding wages from the workers was settled out of court. Because of an appeal that was pending at the time, there was never a final verdict on Trump\u2019s knowledge of the workers\u2019 status. If Trump has since \u201crepeatedly\u201d hired undocumented workers, that has also not been proved; the thousands of workers his companies have brought to the United States have come through legal channels, frequently on temporary visas. We rate Cruz\u2019s second claim as it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Cruz on Trump\u2019s donations to Hillary Clinton By Lisa Rose, CNN Ted Cruz questioned how effective Trump will be squaring off against Hillary Clinton in a general election, given his history of donating money to her political campaigns. \u201cDonald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHow can you stand on a debate stage with her and say you don\u2019t think she should be president?\u201d That\u2019s not quite right, according to the Federal Election Commission and the Center for Responsive Politics.. Trump donated one $600 check to Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2007. But Trump also contributed to 2008 GOP nominee Sen. John McCain\u2019s campaign, and gave him more, to boot. In response to Cruz, Trump acknowledged donating to Clinton. \u201cI supported Clinton,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI supported many other people, by the way.\u201d Indeed, the businessman, his family and his companies donated more than $10,000 to Clinton dating back to her days as a New York senator in 2002. It\u2019s also true that Trump has donated lots of money to a broad array of politicians. His FEC profile is a testament to his prolific efforts funding candidates, Democrats and Republicans alike. Amid all the filings, however, we couldn\u2019t find any records of Trump contributions to Clinton in 2008. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Rubio and Trump on results By Jamie Crawford, CNN Rubio said the following: \u201cThere is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections, there\u2019s no doubt about that, the numbers are there. The numbers also say, two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you, they do not want you to be our nominee.\u201d Based on CNN\u2019s total of the 15 states that have held primaries or caucuses so far, there have been 9,634,058 votes cast for Republican candidates; 6,268,191 votes went for candidates other than Trump, while the remaining 3,365,867 went to Trump. That figure for candidates other than Trump accounts for 65% of total votes going to a candidate other than Trump, which is pretty close to two-thirds of 100%. The numbers he cites are well within the margin of error. For that reason, we rate this as true. Trump said the following of the most recent CNN/ORC poll of the state of the Republican race: \u201cCNN just came out with a poll, a national poll, where he is at 15 (Rubio) and he\u2019s at 14 (Cruz) and I\u2019m at 49.\u201d Trump was correct in saying the latest CNN poll found him with 49% of likely Republican voters based on the sample of voters across the country.  The same poll showed Rubio with 16% of support in the poll, and Cruz had 15% support. Trump was only off by 1% for both Rubio and Cruz, again within the margin of error, so we rate his claim as true. Reality Check: Rubio and Trump on Trump University By Theodore Schleifer, CNN Rubio has argued that Trump\u2019s namesake school, Trump University, is part of an elaborate con by the businessman. A key data point: its rating from the Better Business Bureau. \u201cWe have an \u2018A\u2019 from the Better Business Bureau,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s false,\u201d Rubio shot back, claiming it is actually a D-minus. \u201cIt is right now an \u2018A.\u2019 Once they had the information, it got switched. The only reason it was a \u2018D\u2019 was because we didn\u2019t care, we didn\u2019t give them the information. When they got the information, it became an \u2018A.\u2019 \u201c Trump pledged to \u201cgive\u201d the information proving that his rating had been elevated. As the moderators told him \u2013 and Rubio argued \u2013 the last available rating was indeed a \u2018D-minus.\u2019 The school, now known as the Trump Entrepreneur Institute, currently has no rating: \u201cTHE TRUMP ENTREPRENEUR INITIATIVE IS BELIEVED TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS!\u201d the bureau\u2019s site reads. Media reports at the time say that the school did receive a D- in 2010. And Katherine Hutt, a spokesman for the agency, told Politifact \u201cthat the company\u2019s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.\u201d And the school has long been investigated by state agencies, including a $40 million lawsuit by the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office. Trump\u2019s claim is that the school has an \u201cA\u201d \u201cright now.\u201d That is not true. It currently has no rating, even if that may indeed be because of the lack of information he provided. But Rubio is also incorrect: It is not a D- now, even if it was previously. We rate both Trump and Rubio\u2019s claims as false. CNN\u2019s Lauren Jackson and David Siegel contributed to this round-up.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped questions about whether he and Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner in the presidential race, can work together in Washington House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped questions about whether he and Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner in the presidential race, can actually work together since they are not on the same page on a range of policy issues. \u201cI\u2019ve said 100 times we\u2019re going to be able work with whoever our nominee is, we\u2019re going to be able to present a unified front. That\u2019s my anticipation \u2013 whoever the nominee is going to be,\u201d Ryan told reporters at his weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. He also repeated his policy of not commenting on \u201cwhat\u2019s up and what\u2019s down in the day to day presidential election contest.\u201d \u201cThat primary is well on its way, it\u2019s got a long way to go, but we\u2019re going to be able to work with whoever our nominee is,\u201d Ryan said. The speaker stressed that he and House Republicans would continue to craft a policy agenda for the Republican presidential candidate to pick up once the primary process was over. But it\u2019s unclear whether Trump would even listen to any detailed platform from the House GOP members. Ryan has a long history of promoting free trade, and Trump has railed on the latest Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Trump also recently blamed Ryan, who was the GOP\u2019s 2012 vice presidential nominee, for the party\u2019s loss in that election because of his proposals to overhaul Medicare. Pressed again about Trump\u2019s philosophical differences with his own positions, Ryan again stayed on message. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross these bridges when we get to it but I do believe we will be able to unify as a party and I believe that whoever our nominee we\u2019ll be able to find a way to make a unified front work,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way Congress will have its own ideas so that\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re Republicans, we all have individual ideas and we all gravitate from the same principles an we\u2019ll be applying those principles and offering people a choice,\u201d Ryan added. As House speaker, Ryan will preside over the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland. He told reporters he hasn\u2019t been studying up on delegate math and convention rules, downplaying his role as \u201cceremonial.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders meet for a debate tonight, the first since the Vermont senator won the New Hampshire primary Clinton is expected to energize her base supporter but also reach out to young voters, which have made up a core part of Sanders' support Hillary Clinton built one of the best-organized campaigns in history \u2013 and so far, she has one narrow win and one blowout loss to show for it. Now that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has proven he\u2019s a serious threat to Clinton\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, the race could get even thornier Thursday night when the two meet for their next debate in Milwaukee. Here are five things to watch: Clinton\u2019s first post-New Hampshire move was a swift bid to lock in her support among African-Americans. The campaign dispatched Bill Clinton to Memphis and Chelsea Clinton to Flint, Michigan. It played up an influential state lawmaker\u2019s endorsement in South Carolina. And in her Tuesday night concession speech, Clinton issued a call to \u201cbreak through the barrier of bigotry.\u201d Showing no weakness at all with African-Americans is a crucial part of Clinton\u2019s strategy to calm nervous donors and supporters and eventually grind out a clear delegate lead by proving she appeals to the more diverse national Democratic electorate, while Sanders only plays in overwhelmingly white states. Nightcap: Clinton regroups and refocuses after New Hampshire blowout | Sign up Sanders, meanwhile, is speaking passionately about issues like criminal justice on the stump. He won support in recent days from former NAACP head Ben Jealous and award-winning writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. Clinton\u2019s strength with African-American voters will be tested in South Carolina\u2019s February 27 primary, but first comes Nevada on February 20. Once a sure thing for Clinton, her campaign is now sweating the state \u2013 which offers Sanders a chance to prove his appeal extends south and west before South Carolina even votes. The two both have clear reason to focus on minority voters \u2013 and that outreach will be a key part of their debate-night strategies. The \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d Sanders has called for is playing out in a way he never expected. No candidate in history has had his ability to go on national television and host a 30-second \u201cfundraiser\u201d by asking people to contribute on his website, and raise $6.3 million in 24 hours. But as Sanders\u2019 pitches for free college tuition, Medicare-for-all health insurance and a $15-an-hour minimum wage have gotten more support, Clinton has grown more frustrated \u2013 dismissing Sanders as unable to get the results he\u2019s promising. This presents a key challenge for Clinton: She needs to challenge Sanders on policy. If she casts his supporters as living in a fantasy-land, she risks alienating them \u2013 turning away the young people she needs to win over and putting herself at risk of looking like the embodiment of the \u201cestablishment\u201d she laughs off. Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker How she presses the case that Sanders\u2019 policy proposals are unrealistic will offer perhaps the best insight into whether Clinton is truly retooling her message after losing New Hampshire. The exit polls showed a number of trouble spots for Clinton\u2019s campaign. She lost women. Democratic voters almost unanimously identified Sanders as more trustworthy and in touch with their problems. And she was beaten in every age group except those over 65. RELATED: Key African-American Clinton backers worry campaign not doing enough to reach younger voters Perhaps the most glaring problem Clinton faces is with young voters. By a 5-to-1 margin, they supported Sanders in New Hampshire. That\u2019s the recipe for a loss, if not in the primary, then in the general election, where Democrats need young voters to turn out. Clinton\u2019s surrogates Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem didn\u2019t help by criticizing young women not backing the former secretary of state \u2013 throwing more fuel onto a simmering anger \u2013 as traitors to the feminist cause for supporting Sander. Clinton needs a new approach \u2013 and Thursday night will be her first chance to debut it. Now that he has proven his ability to win states, Sanders will find himself the subject of much more intense scrutiny. It\u2019s partly Clinton\u2019s fault. She didn\u2019t even say his name on the campaign trail for months, and her aides \u2013 while arguing they were bracing for a tough primary battle \u2013 did little to publicly damage Sanders. Now, though, he\u2019ll face harsher media scrutiny and tougher attacks from Clinton\u2019s allies. He\u2019s shown little appetite to savage Clinton on controversies like her private email use and her hesitation at releasing transcripts of her paid speeches, even with Clinton practically daring him to attack. But Sanders\u2019 most valuable political asset is his credibility \u2013 particularly with young voters. How will he react when such a core element of his political being is called into question? Sanders\u2019 focus on income inequality is, at different times, a strength (such as when to the topic of Wall Street reform comes up) and a weakness (when foreign policy dominates the news). But give him this: Voters know exactly why he\u2019s running. The same isn\u2019t always true of Clinton. Clinton speeches often feel like a laundry list of specific policy prescriptions to the problems people face. And her biggest critique of Sanders is that his ideas are unattainable in a real-life Congress. Jim Demers, Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 co-chair and an early 2016 Clinton supporter, says message discipline hurt Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire campaign. \u201cI actually believe we talked about too many issues,\u201d Demers said. \u201cShe had a really broad discussion about every issue there was and Bernie Sanders stayed focused on one message. And that resonated.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign knows it needs to end the muddled messages and find a unifying theme of her candidacy \u2013 a simple, forward-looking explanation of why she is running for president. It\u2019ll be a focus as Clinton retools after New Hampshire, and Thursday night will be her first chance to try it out.",

            "article_content": "Clinton, Sanders made closing arguments to voters one week before Iowa caucuses Clinton: 'You have to have somebody who is a proven fighter' Sanders: 'We need a political revolution' Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on Monday drew their sharpest contrasts yet in hard-hitting final pitches to Iowa voters as the competitive race to win the first in the nation caucuses enters its last week. The Democratic race has often paled in comparison to the rollicking Republican battle. But there was palpable energy at CNN\u2019s town hall as the candidates delivered urgent, passionate pleas for supporters to caucus on February 1. Sanders offered a vigorous performance punctuated by calls for a progressive revolution. Clinton matched him for energy by arguing that only she had been on the front lines of progressive change for decades and uniquely had the multi-tasking skills at home and abroad needed of a President. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it were easy, hey, there wouldn\u2019t be any contest. But it\u2019s not easy. There are very different visions, different values, different forces at work, and you have to have somebody who is a proven fighter \u2013 somebody who has taken them on and won, and kept going, and will do that as President.\u201d READ: Town hall fact check Sanders, going first before an intimate audience of Iowa Democratic voters, looked more at ease than ever in mounting full-frontal attacks on his rival. He hit Clinton hard over her vote for the war in Iraq, her slow pivot toward Democrats who oppose the Keystone Pipeline and a vast Pacific trade pact. In short, he sought to make the case that she might have the most experience but he had the best judgment. Clinton, meanwhile, seemed better prepared than she has been for much of her campaign to parry Sanders\u2019 claims that she is a late comer to the cause of economic inequality, and seized on warm words from President Barack Obama in an interview with Politico released Monday to argue that only she could be trusted to win an election and safeguard his legacy. And there were odd moments of surprise insight into the candidates\u2019 personalities and senses of humor as Sanders related his youthful athletic prowess as a talented elementary school basketball player and Clinton offered a gracious review of Sanders\u2019 widely praised new campaign ad. Bernie Sanders' political career Sanders made the vast gap between the rich and poor and the \u201crecklessness\u201d and \u201cgreed\u201d of Wall Street the centerpiece of his performance, as he warned that the wealthy would have to pay more in taxes. \u201cWe need a political revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are touching a nerve with the American people who understand that establishment politics is just not good enough.\u201d Sanders dismissed Clinton\u2019s political record, seeking to prove he was closer to the Democratic Party base and just as prepared to be President as Clinton. \u201cI voted against the war in Iraq \u2026 Hillary Clinton voted for the war in Iraq,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI led the effort against Wall Street deregulation. See where Hillary Clinton was on this issue.\u201d \u201cOn day one, I said the Keystone Pipeline was a dumb idea. Why did it take Hillary Clinton a long time before she came into opposition to the Keystone Pipeline? I didn\u2019t have to think hard about opposing the Trans Pacific Partnership. It took Hillary Clinton a long time to come on board on that.\u201d He also warned unapologetically that taxes would go up if he is elected President, especially to pay for his Medicare-for-all health care plan. \u201cWe will raise taxes. Yes we will,\u201d Sanders said, but added that American families would be better off overall as they would save money on private premiums. READ: 5 unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan Eight years after she lost Iowa to Obama, Clinton again faces the unappetizing prospect of losing the caucuses to a candidate who has energized young voters and is coming at her from her left. But she responded by making her most effective counter yet to Sanders\u2019 charge that she is out of step with the infectious desire for political change that animates her party, particularly among younger voters. After one young man asked her why voters did not trust her, she said that the only reason she is controversial is because she is a substantive political figure who never gave up. \u201cThey throw all this stuff at me, and I\u2019m still standing,\u201d Clinton said. Then, warming to her theme, she sought to debunk the idea that her long history as a figure of the political establishment eroded her progressive credentials. \u201cI have been on the front lines of change and progress since I was your age,\u201d Clinton told the man in one of her most animated moments of the campaign. \u201cI have taken on the status quo time and time again.\u201d Clinton also said she was \u201creally touched and gratified\u201d by Obama\u2019s warm assessment of her character during the Politico interview, and related how her relationship with her former political rival developed into a close friendship when she served as his first-term secretary of state. She also took a shot at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, rebuking him for targeting Muslims in America and around the world. And showing a softer side, she praised a Sanders\u2019 ad featuring an evocative tableau of U.S life set against the soundtrack of Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s 1960s folk anthem \u201cAmerica.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous, I loved it,\u201d Clinton said, but then quickly pivoted to the crux of her argument: \u201cI believe I\u2019m the better person to be the Democratic nominee and to be the President of this country.\u201d READ: Bernie Sanders confronts the \u2018electability\u2019 question Clinton mounted a staunch defense of her record as secretary of state, telling Democrats worried about her hawkish instincts that military force should only be used as a last resort. She also claimed credit for framing a sanctions regime on Iran that led to a recently concluded nuclear deal and highlighted an Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza she brokered in 2012. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight But Clinton was thrown on the defensive at one point, when she was asked about the controversy over her private email server that has dogged her campaign and is under investigation by the F.B.I. amid claims she recklessly left classified intelligence at risk of being intercepted by foreign spy agencies. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to say it was an error in judgment because nothing I did was wrong,\u201d Clinton said. Long-shot candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, also appeared on stage and argued that he represented a generational change in politics that neither Sanders nor Clinton could match. \u201cLift up a new leader, because you can change the course of this presidential race. You can shift this dynamic on caucus night. I know you can, I\u2019ve seen you do it before,\u201d O\u2019Malley beseeched the audience at the end of his pitch. The latest polls show Clinton and Sanders locked in a tight contest in Iowa. In the most recent CNN Poll of Polls, Sanders edges Clinton 46% to 44% in Iowa, with O\u2019Malley at 4%. And in a new CNN/ORC national poll published on Monday, Clinton led Sanders 52% to 38% with  O\u2019Malley way back at 2%. Though the survey showed a significant cushion for Clinton, her advantage was smaller than at any time since September. The poll showed women, non-whites, self-identified Democrats, and those over age 50 breaking sharply for Clinton. Men, white voters, independents who lean Democratic and younger voters are more likely to support Sanders. The Iowa contest is particularly important to Clinton, who lost the state in 2008, setting in motion Obama\u2019s path to the White House. A victory for Sanders could reshape the entire Democratic race while a Clinton win could quell jitters in her camp and help put her on the path to the nomination. Clinton, however, insisted she wasn\u2019t worried. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the campaign we\u2019ve run and what we\u2019ve put out there before the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough campaign and it should be because it\u2019s the toughest job in the world.\u201d",

The Vermont senator leads Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by 23 percentage points. He also tops Ohio Gov. John Kasich by 21 points and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio by 18 points. Clinton, meanwhile, faces tighter races in hypothetical match-ups against the same Republican candidates. She trails Rubio at 45% to 44%, and ties Kasich at 43%. She leads Christie 45% to 42%, beats Cruz 47% to 41% and tops Trump 48% to 39%. READ: The complete CNN/WMUR poll results New Hampshire, once considered a toss-up state, went twice for President Barack Obama \u2013 he beat Mitt Romney by 6 points in 2012 and John McCain by 9 points in 2008. And Democrat John Kerry bested President George W. Bush narrowly in 2004, though the state tilted in Bush\u2019s favor in 2000. That Sanders outperforms Clinton might not be surprising in New Hampshire: He leads, 60% to Clinton\u2019s 33%, in the Democratic primary, the CNN/WMUR poll found. But the results come as Clinton has made the case that she\u2019s more electable than Sanders, arguing that Democrats should give her the party\u2019s nod to keep Republicans from attacking Sanders\u2019 history as a democratic socialist in the general election. She\u2019s latched herself to Obama\u2019s legacy and cast Sanders\u2019 policy proposals \u2013 particularly a government-run Medicare-for-all plan accompanied by increases in individual income taxes and corporate taxes \u2013 as impossible to enact in the current political climate. The survey of 885 New Hampshire residents who say they plan to vote in the November general election was conducted January 13-18 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Its margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are expected to draw stark distinctions at the Democratic debate Sunday night The debate is in Charleston, South Carolina, near the church where nine people were killed last June It\u2019s a real fight now. First, Hillary Clinton spent months keeping from even uttering Bernie Sanders\u2019 name. Then, the two sparred over Wall Street, gun control and health care in early Democratic debates \u2013 but the punches were soft compared to what Republicans were unfurling in what was long the closer and more exciting primary fight. Now, with the two neck-and-neck in Iowa just two weeks away from the caucuses there, both candidates are squarely focused on each other \u2013 and they aren\u2019t holding back their attacks. Democrats are meeting for their final debate before the Iowa caucuses just a block away from the site of the Charleston church shooting seven months ago. The location lends a new tone to the debate over gun control. It comes as a health care rift between the two candidates is turning bitter, and Sanders is showing a willingness to take his biggest swipes yet at Clinton over her ties to Wall Street. Here are five things to watch when Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley debate Sunday night: Sanders released a new TV ad last week portraying Clinton as an ally of Wall Street who thinks she can \u201ctake millions from big banks and then tell him what to do.\u201d Sanders\u2019 camp said that the ad was just playing up policy differences. But when a New Hampshire voter pressed Sanders about it Thursday night, the Vermont senator alluded to a willingness to throw punches. \u201cIf people are distorting my record, as is the case right now, we are going to deal with it, and I have dealt with it, and we will continue to deal with it,\u201d he said. With new polls showing Sanders either ahead or within striking distance in both Iowa and New Hampshire, he\u2019s wearing a bigger target than ever before. Can a candidate who\u2019s clearly been uncomfortable launching missiles of his own hit Clinton for her paid speeches and big-money donors? Can he reframe Clinton\u2019s attacks over issues such as health care and turn them against her? The answer could set the tone for the two-week sprint to the Iowa caucuses. You\u2019ve heard Clinton hammer Sanders over his 2005 vote to limit gun manufacturers\u2019 liability. Get ready for a new attack: \u201cThe Charleston loophole.\u201d The debate will take place next door to the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where nine people were killed by a gunman during a prayer service in June \u2013 and Clinton won\u2019t be shy about saying Sanders deserves a share of the blame for gun laws that allowed the shooter to obtain his firearm. Here\u2019s the background: Dylann Roof legally purchased the .45-caliber Glock he used in the Charleston church shooting. But his purchase was only allowed because the FBI wasn\u2019t able to conduct a background check within the legally-mandated three-day waiting period. Had that background check been completed in time, Roof, due to a prior drug conviction, would have been denied the firearm. Clinton is blaming Sanders for that three-day waiting period. It\u2019s the result of the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Initially, the bill would have included a seven-day waiting period. But Sanders was among the senators who voted for a National Rifle Association-backed amendment that drastically narrowed that window to just 24 hours. After more negotiations, gun control advocates got that window pushed back up to three days. But they blame supporters of that amendment for having to fight for that three-day waiting period in the first place. It\u2019s not clear that Roof\u2019s purchase would have been blocked if the FBI had four more days. But Clinton already showed she\u2019s willing to tear into Sanders over what gun control supporters are calling \u201cthe Charleston loophole\u201d in an interview with CNN this week. \u201cYou know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not,\u201d she said. \u201cThe killer in Charleston who brought that gun, if they had just spent a little more time, it would\u2019ve been discovered, he should not have been able to buy the gun, because he had a federal record.\u201d This one\u2019s sure to inspire a debate-stage fight: Sanders\u2019 support for single-payer health care versus Clinton\u2019s preference for tweaks to Obamacare. In terms of ideology, Sanders might actually be closer to the Democratic base than Clinton. He supports a government-run Medicare-for-all system, which would end private insurance. A December 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 81% of Democrats support a Medicare-for-all system. Clinton herself told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Thursday she supports universal health care \u201cno matter how you get there.\u201d The problem for Sanders: He hasn\u2019t detailed how much he\u2019d charge Americans in taxes to make it happen. Sanders has said he\u2019ll reveal those details before Iowa votes. He\u2019s also long argued that new taxes to fund a Medicare-for-all system would be dwarfed by the savings Americans would see as a result of ending private insurance premiums. Still, Clinton\u2019s bet is that the details of Sanders\u2019 proposal will be problematic enough for a Democratic electorate that might not be in the mood to scrap President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and fight for something bigger. In the Maddow interview, Clinton said: \u201cTo me, the Affordable Care Act is one of the signature accomplishments, not just of this president, but of the Democratic Party.\u201d Clinton has endured a string of news reports in recent days comparing Sanders\u2019 rise in Iowa to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s in 2008. It\u2019s not just the polls. Clinton has lapsed into 2008-style language, insisting that Sanders can\u2019t wave a \u201cmagic wand\u201d to get his agenda accomplished \u2013 just as she told Obama he couldn\u2019t wave a \u201cmagic wand\u201d then. She\u2019s increasingly focused on an argument she hopes will energize Democratic supporters: Electability. She could make a pitch to liberals that while dating Sanders made sense, they should marry the candidate with a long track record of taking on Republicans. Sanders, though, has a volley of his own prepared: He\u2019s outperforming Clinton against the Republican front-runners in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, which are general election battlegrounds. For Sanders, the challenge he confronts in South Carolina is expanding his base beyond the white, liberal electorates of Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton has worked to make that difficult. She toured South Carolina with former Attorney General Eric Holder, a high-ranking Obama ally, and she has always outperformed Sanders among the minority voters who make up much of the Democratic base beyond the overwhelmingly-white Iowa and New Hampshire. The former Maryland governor has never managed to turn the Democratic primary into a three-way race \u2013 he feels farther now than ever from the center of the action. His polished, generational-change argument has fallen on deaf ears as the left has instead chosen a rumpled 74-year-old who seems incapable of abiding by the political establishment\u2019s rules as its icon. His cash-strapped campaign accepted public financing, which means he has enough money to get through the Iowa caucuses but nowhere near the money to match Clinton and Sanders on the airwaves. What that means: If O\u2019Malley has any tricks up his sleeve, Sunday night \u2013 with a free, national audience and tons of media attention \u2013 is his last, best chance to use them.",

Ryan is used to sitting on the House floor, where he could freely react. Not anymore. \u201cI express myself. I\u2019m an Irish guy, that\u2019s what we do,\u201d joked Ryan, who said his wife Janna warned him against doing so. In a wide-ranging breakfast meeting with television news reporters and anchors, Ryan said he expects the President to \u201clay a lot of verbal traps for us\u201d in Tuesday night\u2019s address. Ryan predicted that the President will use his final State of the Union to help Hillary Clinton, because the Obama legacy depends on a new president continuing his ideals. \u201cFor his legacy to be secure, he has to have a successor from his own party, and from his wing of his own party. Hillary fits the bill. So what is he going to do? My assumption is he will do everything he can to bait us into fights with him to try to make us look like we\u2019re angry reactionaries incapable of winning the Electoral College,\u201d Ryan said. RELATED: Obama hopes to pave way for Clinton with farewell State of the Union The House Speaker said at the end of the day, he believes Obama is nothing more than a liberal demagogue. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have a nice glossy rendition of the last seven years,\u201d Ryan said, adding, \u201cHe never took on this threat of debt. He never proposed to balance the budget. He demagogued us and he never proposed to actually get this debt under control.\u201d Ryan, a longtime proponent of reforming entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security \u2013 changes some Republicans dismissed as too drastic \u2013 criticized the President for not dealing with the issues he says will bankrupt the country if not addressed. \u201cHe had an enormous problem facing this country that he chose to ignore. Now I think he chose to ignore it for ideological reasons more than anything else,\u201d Ryan said. Ryan\u2019s predecessor John Boehner had a complicated relationship with the President. They tried, and failed, to negotiate a so-called \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d in 2011, which resulted in trust issues for years. Ryan did not hold out much hope for getting much done with Obama in the next year. \u201cWe disagree on so much,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think of him as an enemy. I think ideologues, partisans on both sides, think of each other as enemies. Our enemies are the people who plant roadside bombs against our soldiers, or shoot up our boardrooms and community college. That\u2019s our enemy. I just think that he is just a dogmatic ideologue who very much believes in what he is doing and is pretty much opposite of what we believe,\u201d Ryan said flatly. \u201cThe ideology I subscribe to is the one that founded the country \u2013 that built the Constitution. So I do believe that he is taking us away from the Constitution, away from founding principles, away from natural rights,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt is going to be hard to see us getting a lot done when he wants to go so far left,\u201d he said. Ryan tried to stay away from what he called being \u201cbaited\u201d into a discussion of the 2016 presidential election, noting that he only denounced Donald Trump for his call for a temporary ban on Muslims because he felt the need to \u201cstand up for conservatism.\u201d Ryan acknowledged Trump could be bringing more people into the Republican Party. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give him credit for that,\u201d he said. But when asked later by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about Trump\u2019s plan for a deportation force to go door to door and round up Latinos,  Ryan let out an audible groan. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to win the darn nomination, I really don\u2019t,\u201d he said, but was emphatic that the 2016 presidential race must be about ideas, and not personalities. \u201cRepublicans lose personality contests every time,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut Republicans win ideas contests.\u201d Ryan has clearly used his own experience as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012 to think a lot about what it takes for the GOP to win nationally. \u201cWhat I learned \u2013 if you\u2019re starting to have that conversation in late summer/early fall, it\u2019s too late. The cake is baked and the trajectory is kind of locked, so we have to start early,\u201d he said. Ryan argued that the GOP must not just be the \u201copposition party\u201d but the \u201cproposition party.\u201d He said that the GOP must start laying out broad and big ideas now, so that the party has a mandate to win. \u201cWe have to give the country a choice,\u201d Ryan said. As for the very real, at times raw anger among conservative grassroots voters at the GOP in Washington, Ryan insisted that is more pronounced by the primary season, and that in the end Republicans will unite. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real political currency to attacking the establishment as it\u2019s being defined,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI do believe that when we get through the primary season we will have unification of the conservative movement and our party,\u201d he continued. \u201cMost people on our side of the aisle are concerned about another progressive presidency.\u201d Ryan said he does believe Congress has a role in passing a new Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) for fighting ISIS, adding it is the President\u2019s responsibility. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to present Congress with a plan to defeat ISIS. We\u2019re sort of waiting for that,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cNot to pass the buck, but the commander in chief is the one who is supposed to execute foreign policy. It\u2019s the commander in chief\u2019s job to come up with a plan to execute our foreign policy. We\u2019re not supposed to have 435 generals coming up with our strategy. We have opinions but that\u2019s his job.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer contributed to this report.",

Follow him @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Dean Obeidallah: Media should stop giving Trump wall-to-wall coverage of every tweet Even Trump's surrogates at times have had trouble explaining what Trump meant by his tweets, Obeidallah says But not Trump. This thin-skinned, Twitter-obsessed, vindictive President-elect instead can\u2019t stop taking to Twitter to whine about \u201cSNL.\u201d If Trump, however, thinks his whining about \u201cSNL\u201d or comedians mocking him will stop us from doing so, he\u2019s not only wrong, but he\u2019s also inspiring us to step it up even more. Remember Dana Carvey as George H.W. Bush or Will Ferrell as George W.?  Mocking the President is as American as apple pie. It\u2019s that simple. As things stand, Trump tweets and the media chases. It\u2019s like an updated version of Pavlov\u2019s dog, but instead of a dog salivating, it\u2019s the media salivating every time they hear Trump has unleashed another tweet. When he does, the media \u2013 especially cable news outlets \u2013 goes into overdrive, with experts trying to decipher what Trump meant by his latest 140-character musing. Next come the political pundits who speculate over the political potential fallout from the tweet. And before we can ever figure out if Trump is actually signaling a strategic policy change or if he was just bored and felt like tweeting, then he is on to the next series of tweets prompting an identical media reaction all over again. During all this, the American people are increasingly being lulled into a sense that it\u2019s somehow OK for our president to simply tweet policy positions and not be required to give us detailed policy proposals or explanations. We can\u2019t spend the next four years as a nation doing that. Instead the major media outlets should collectively agree to ignore Trump\u2019s tweets. In fact, CNN\u2019s Don Lemon said as much Tuesday, suggesting that news executives agree to not cover Trump\u2019s tweets. Lemon is 100% correct. Trump no doubt prefers tweeting to holding a press conference because there\u2019s no one to challenge him to his face on factual inaccuracies or ask him follow-up questions.  But if the media ignored his tweets, it could compel Trump to actually hold a press conference \u2013 which he hasn\u2019t done since July \u2013 to explain the details of his proposals. Or possibly spur Trump to give a policy speech, complete with supporting data so we can properly evaluate it. Both options are far better than what we are currently getting. Even Trump\u2019s surrogates at times have had trouble explaining what Trump meant by his tweets. For example, just last week Trump tweeted, \u201cThe United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.\u201d Keep in mind that per the Congressional Budget Office we are already spending an estimated $348 billion over the next decade to maintain, upgrade and operate our existing nuclear arsenal. Will Trump push to cut Medicare or other social programs to fund this increased spending? And is Trump really reversing the decades-long effort of the United States to reduce our nuclear arsenal? We are entitled to know answers to such questions. But when Trump surrogate Sean Spicer \u2013 who was recently named White House spokesperson \u2013 was asked on CNN to make sense of this Trump tweet, we got zero details. Instead Spicer served up clich\u00e9s about what Trump meant, like he \u201cwill not take anything off the table.\u201d Did Spicer not have any more specifics? And here\u2019s the worst part \u2013 Spicer stated that Trump plans to use Twitter as president, suggesting that Trump\u2019s tweeting will be \u201ca really exciting part\u201d of his new job as White House press secretary. But while it may be exciting for Spicer, it will be bad for America. We need a president who takes policy issues very seriously. This is not Season 1 of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d but year one of Trump as President of the United States. We need a president who is more concerned with being commander in chief and less focused on being the political version of Kanye West.  Interestingly, even Trump appears aware of the potential problems posed by using Twitter. In an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month, after winning the election, Trump stated that once he\u2019s president, he will be \u201cvery restrained\u201d with using Twitter, adding, \u201cif I use it at all.\u201d So here\u2019s where the media can actually help not just Trump and America, but even itself: Ignore Trump\u2019s tweets on substantive issues. Doing so might push him to hold press conferences to explain his policy pronouncements, while helping the media regain Americans\u2019 trust (something that is at historic lows, in part because of the saturation coverage of Trump\u2019s campaign). Americans \u2013 whether or not they voted for Trump \u2013 need the media to be a trustworthy watchdog. Not treating every Trump tweet like breaking news would be a good start in restoring the country\u2019s faith that it had the ability to be one. \u201cMirror, mirror on the wall, who is Trump\u2019s scariest pick of all?\u201d",

He is the author of \u201cThe Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America,\u201d president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the Working Life podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jonathan Tasini: GOP control in Washington should not be a shock to Democrats The Democratic Party helped to make it happen, Tasini says After Tuesday\u2019s election, Republicans will continue to hold power in 67 of the 98 state chambers, and, for the first time in history, will control every statehouse in the South. Republicans also upped their control of governors\u2019 mansions to 33 by winning races in Missouri, Vermont and New Hampshire (the North Carolina race is still undecided). Finally, notwithstanding tiny gains Tuesday by Democrats in congressional races, Republicans still hold a near-record margin in the House of Representatives (because of the 2010 shellacking in which Republicans gained 63 seats) and will likely increase their slim Senate majority in 2018 when the electoral map appears quite hostile to Democrats. Broadly speaking, the Democratic Party has shrinking power and influence over the shaping of public policy. This new era of Republican control in Washington has startled \u2013 some might say shocked \u2013 many Democrats. However, looking a bit deeper, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise; the party\u2019s national leadership has been a colossal failure for a long time. That makes the choice of who will lead the Democratic National Committee \u2013 and steer the direction of a renewed party \u2013 a matter of survival. And it has only itself to blame. This isn\u2019t simply a reflection of the incompetence of DNC leaders such as Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or the foisting on us of a truly weak presidential candidate. It goes to the core of what the party stands for and the guiding principles of its leaders. We need new leadership, and as Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued persuasively, Rep. Keith Ellison fits that bill. Keith Ellison on how Trump has 'disturbed' Muslims As I wrote this week, for a quarter of a century, the party embraced Clintonomics as a central guiding principle. Clintonomics, boiled down to its essence, is a kinder, gentler neoliberal philosophy: It embraces so-called free trade, deregulation, extols the free market and worships the \u201chonest\u201d financial sector (partly for campaign contributions), all with a light touch of regulation and meek taxes on the wealthy. But that philosophy has been a resounding failure, not just in this country but around the world. Seeds of the revolt against Clinton-like neoliberalism can be found in the many rejections of governments in Europe and elsewhere. And, indeed, that anger, in many instances, has spawned Trump-like racism and bigotry.  When Wasserman Schultz was shown the door (because of her manipulation of the party\u2019s primary contest on behalf of Hillary Clinton \u2013 and because the party lost 910 state legislative seats during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, the names of a number of possible replacements surfaced. Those included elected officials, longtime party activists and some leaders of Democratic-affiliated organizations. Most of them are precisely not the people the party needs. It\u2019s not that former governors, past members of Congress or heads of advocacy groups are not competent. It is that they have either been longtime advocates of Clintonomics or, while the party spiraled downward in loss after loss because neoliberalism-lite alienated voters who had been robbed of their jobs and livelihoods, they sat silently at the DNC or in Washington. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean is now in the race. Dean is running on his past advocacy of a 50-state political strategy and an undeserved reputation as a progressive. I give credit to Dean for speaking up against the Iraq War when, in the wake of 9/11, most Democrats were cowering before George W. Bush. But, on economics, he was a pretty moderate governor who embraced most of the failed principles of Clintonomics. More recently, he\u2019s turned into a classic political insider. He\u2019s been working for a firm that lobbies the health care industry. He is the absolute wrong person to head up the party. Bernie Sanders: New leadership to 'open doors' of DNC Ellison, however, is the right DNC chair to lead the party forward. He represents an urban-suburban district in Minnesota that is quite diverse: two-thirds white, 18% black, 9% Hispanic and 5% Asian. He is a Muslim. In other words, he understands, and can speak to, a huge swath of the public on matters of justice, race and tolerance. Ellison was one of the few elected officials to support Sanders. But more important he rejects the model of the Democrats as a big-donor, Wall Street-driven party. As co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus \u2013 the largest Democratic caucus \u2013 Ellison has espoused for many years the principles that Sanders ran on in 2016, principles I believe would have carried Sanders to the White House had he been the Democratic nominee: Medicare for all, free college tuition, expanded Social Security benefits (in contrast to the hand-wringing, and factually incorrect, \u201ccrisis\u201d rhetoric too many Democrats spew about Social Security), reining in and cutting down the size of the financial sector and a rational foreign policy where diplomacy is paramount.  Some of the more traditional party bigwigs seem to be waking up to Ellison\u2019s vision. Sen. Charles Schumer, perhaps the most visible Democrat with longstanding ties to Wall Street, endorsed him. My hunch is that Schumer, a fairly canny political operative, sees two trends. He came up short in his quest to become majority leader because Democrats did not connect with the economic-based anger coursing through many key states. He also understands that the progressive wing in the Senate caucus \u2013 led by Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown \u2013 is ascendant, and he will need their loyalty to stay in his perch as Senate party leader. The position of DNC chair is not the only important choice facing the party. But, in the aftermath of the recent election, it will send a signal that Democrats have consigned Clintonomics to the sidelines and are moving forward with a different agenda.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. In 2016, likely the hottest year on record, there\u2019s one question US presidential debate moderators had a moral obligation to ask Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: How do you plan to address climate change and rid the economy of fossil fuels? Yet they never did. That\u2019s just unbelievable. We\u2019re already seeing seas rising in Miami, wildfires worsening in the West and deaths related to swollen rainstorms in Louisiana. The effects in the future, if we don\u2019t curb emissions, will be much worse, including drowned coastal cities, supercharged droughts in the Southwest, mass extinction in the natural world and the likely end of the coral reefs. Trump and Clinton couldn\u2019t be farther apart on this issue, with Trump calling global warming a \u201choax\u201d masterminded by the Chinese and Clinton (while not bold enough) saying she will work to curb emissions and build on the progress of December\u2019s Paris Agreement. Everyone knows what the science requires: Zero-net carbon emissions by 2100, at the latest. Neither candidate would get us there, but Clinton would keep walking in the right direction while Trump would run back toward the coal era with eyes closed and ears plugged. This is the most critical issue of our time. Future generations will look back perplexed at why it escaped our focus. I bet millennial voters already feel that way. As an old-ish millennial (I was born in 1982, so I meet Pew\u2019s definition, but barely) I can say the debate moderators and their questions largely failed to address my biggest concerns and those of my peers. Climate change, LGBT rights, education, student debt \u2013 all of that got shortchanged for (repeat) discussions of the national debt, Medicare, Social Security, etc. Debate moderators, of course, have the unenviable task to trying to represent the awesomely diverse patchwork of interests that is the United States. But climate, particularly, is far too pressing for any of us to ignore. More tactically, it\u2019s baffling that the interests of millennials were sidelined when the moderators surely must know we represent the largest age group in the country. Media companies love to pander to our tastes and wallets. So why then would they largely exclude us from these critical conversations about the future of America? Vox\u2019s Brad Plumer identified a few reasons they avoid climate, specifically. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the debate moderators don\u2019t understand what\u2019s at stake. It\u2019s possible they don\u2019t care. Or it\u2019s possible they\u2019re afraid that any question on the topic might seem too partisan. After all, Clinton thinks the issue is pretty serious and has a bunch of proposals to address it, whereas Trump says it\u2019s all a hoax invented by the Chinese. Under the circumstances, even a halfway intelligent question about climate policy would sound \u2018biased.\u2019\u201d Some of those theories also make sense when applied to LGBT rights. I was stunned when Elaine Quijano \u2013 who, at 42, is the youngest debate moderator in decades \u2013 failed to ask the vice presidential candidates about their stances on LGBT issues. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s running mate, voted against legislation to prevent LGBT people from being fired because of who they are (that\u2019s legal in most states); wanted to use government money for \u201cgay conversion therapy\u201d; and called anti-LGBT-hate-crime legislation \u201cradical.\u201d He deserved to be interrogated on those bigoted stances. Maybe moderators, as Plumer suggests, are worried about being labeled partisan for telling it like it is. That\u2019s a shame because we millennials tend see these issues on moral terms. As one of my Facebook friends suggested, perhaps younger-focused issues didn\u2019t come up in the debates because we are in an unprecedented election, with Trump facing allegations of sexual assault and waffling on whether he supports the democratic process. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a normal series of debates so let\u2019s not pretend,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne existential crisis at a time.\u201d That\u2019s a fair point, but there was ample time to address climate, LGBT rights and education. According to Grist, the candidates only spent 5 minutes and 27 seconds on climate and environmental issues \u2013 mostly because Hillary Clinton brought it up on a couple of occasions. Out of 270 minutes, that\u2019s so little time it\u2019s inexcusable. The moderators \u2013 ages 69, 63, 57, 49 and 42 \u2013 largely failed to reflect key concerns of younger voters. In doing so, they missed an opportunity to bring younger people, who are far less likely to vote than older generations, into this process. And they failed hold the presidential candidates accountable for their views on climate, LGBT rights and education \u2013 three key issues that will shape this country many generations into the future.",

He was the policy director of the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and served as Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s chief policy adviser. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Lanhee J. Chen: Donald Trump's tax plan includes some positive, pro-growth reforms But he continues to push for anti-free trade policies that threaten to nullify pro-growth elements of his proposals, Chen says Donald Trump on Thursday re-introduced his plan for economic growth into a presidential campaign that has so far been light on policy. And while the Republican nominee didn\u2019t reveal too many additional details, we now have a better picture of the kinds of economic policy changes he would pursue if elected president. But the reality is that while some of his ideas would certainly improve the economy and be a welcome change from the growth-stifling policies that the Obama administration has pursued for the last eight years, others are either wrongheaded or dangerous, and will likely leave many economic conservatives still skeptical of Trump\u2019s candidacy. Trump reiterated his support for energy and regulatory policies that will fuel economic growth. While many of his policy pronouncements remain vague \u2013 like his support for diverse sources of energy or his desire to put a pause on the issuance of new regulations \u2013 the general direction of  his proposals are pro-growth and consistent with free-market economic principles. Trump\u2019s tax plan, meanwhile, also includes some positive, pro-growth reforms. He says he would pursue reductions in individual marginal tax rates, institute a new cap on deductions for higher-income taxpayers, and sharply cut the corporate tax rate. The deductions cap is particularly interesting because it takes a novel approach to the question of how to raise revenue to help pay for marginal rate reductions. Under the Trump plan, higher-income taxpayers will need to choose between different deductions, like those for charity, mortgage interest, and health care, but will be unable to fully take advantage of all of them. This is sure to be controversial, but rightfully places the onus on taxpayers to allocate a fixed amount to the preferences that suit them best. More dubious is Trump\u2019s claim that he simplifies the tax system \u2013 he isn\u2019t proposing elimination of any of major deductions or credits, and in fact is adding a new child care deduction to the tax code. Trump continues to advocate for anti-free trade policies that threaten to nullify the pro-growth elements of his tax, regulatory, and energy proposals. While he rightfully raises questions about some of the trade policies that countries like China have pursued over the last several years, his solution is to invite a trade war, while turning away from bilateral trade agreements like the recently signed U.S.-Korea agreement, as well as multilateral agreements like NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Although the multilateral trade agreements, in particular, are not perfect, his preference for mercantilist policies would hurt economic growth and ultimately the American worker. Trump has made the political calculation that outright opposition to free trade is a winner in this election cycle. His opponent appears to have made a similar calculation, and has recently become a critic of free trade deals like the TPP.  But as the nominee of the party that is supposed to stand up for free trade and its benefits, Trump\u2019s position on this issue is particularly problematic. The worst element of Trump\u2019s economic plan is something that is missing from it.  Trump\u2019s continued refusal to deal with the coming entitlement crisis, and his failure to present a credible fiscal plan, is inexcusable. Every Republican nominee in recent memory has had a plan to modernize and strengthen both Medicare and Social Security. Trump is the notable exception. On this issue, he has espoused the mindset of the progressive left, whose adherents believe Medicare and Social Security are doing just fine and need not be touched.  Spending on major health care programs (the biggest of which is Medicare) and Social Security are two of the three largest drivers of federal spending over the next ten years. (The third is interest on the national debt.)  In the absence of reform, Social Security benefits will be cut across-the-board by 20 percent in less than 20 years. Medicare\u2019s trust fund will be exhausted in a little over a decade, potentially jeopardizing access to physicians, hospitals, and medical treatments. Policy experts on both the right and the left have concluded that these problems must be addressed now. The only fiscal restraint Trump envisions is the so-called \u201cPenny Plan,\u201d which independent analysts have determined could save about $600 billion over ten years. Unfortunately, the plan only calls for restraints on discretionary spending, which has already been capped by congressional Republicans.  And it does nothing to deal with the big-ticket entitlement spending that is driving our long-term debt problem. Many in the media have turned their attention to \u201cwhether the numbers add up.\u201d But such attention is misplaced. It\u2019s very difficult to make predictions about the impact of major policy changes before they happen \u2013 consider, for example, how far off the mark initial predictions were when it came to Obamacare\u2019s impact on health insurance coverage. The bigger question is whether Trump has serious prescriptions to address the significant economic policy challenges our country faces. In some cases, he does. But in others, he has a lot of work left to do.",

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Whatever the final seat count, the 2016 Australian election has gone badly wrong for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. This was meant to be the election that would award him a resounding mandate and provide sufficient numbers in the combined House of Representatives and Senate to pass key legislation easily. But, at best, Turnbull will be forming a government with only a narrow majority. In a much-less-desirable outcome, he\u2019ll be negotiating with minor parties and independents to form a minority government in a hung parliament. In the worst scenario of all for the Coalition (though it seems less likely at this stage), Labor could form a minority government. Alternatively, Australia may need to go to another election to resolve matters. As when he was previously leader of the Liberal Party, Turnbull\u2019s political judgment is being seriously questioned. The Liberal Party could reasonably have expected the outcome to be better than this. Turnbull remained disciplined and on-message during an (excessively) long campaign, with no more false starts such as the debacles over floating ill-considered GST or state taxation ideas. The impact of Brexit on economic markets should have reinforced Turnbull\u2019s narrative of needing a stable, responsible and business-friendly government in uncertain times. That simple message of stability should have cut through more easily than Labor leader Bill Shorten\u2019s more complex argument that Brexit showed the dangers that can arise when conservative leaders give in to the right of their parties, as well as the need for government policies that protect workers\u2019 wages and benefits. So how did things go so wrong? And what are the implications for Turnbull\u2019s leadership? How Australia turned its back on the world's refugee crisis Election outcomes are decided by multiple factors, including those particular to local electorates. But there were significant problems with Turnbull\u2019s campaign. It is not just that Turnbull was not as comfortable as Shorten when campaigning among ordinary voters. Labor repeatedly raised questions about how comfortable Turnbull was with some of the policy positions he was putting forward. It suggested he had betrayed some of his previous positions on issues from same-sex marriage to climate change in order to placate conservatives in his party. Turnbull strongly denied that his own positions had shifted. Despite this, he went to the election with, for example, his predecessor Tony Abbott\u2019s policy of holding a plebiscite on same-sex marriage \u2013 an idea he had originally opposed. Such issues reinforced the perception that Turnbull had shifted position, and so could also not be trusted when he denied government plans to privatize Medicare or initiate cuts to penalty rates. Electors\u2019 memories of past assurances from Julia Gillard and Abbott that were contradicted in office further reinforced this lack of trust. This was despite criticisms that Shorten was over-reaching by arguing the government was intending to fully privatize Medicare rather than merely substantially cutting benefits and increasing user-pays contributions. Nonetheless, despite the Abbott policy legacies, Turnbull\u2019s own campaign was still somewhat different from a John Howard or a Abbott one. He did not mobilize culture war issues to the extent that his predecessors would have. Abbott\u2019s criticism that \u201cnational security has played almost no part in this campaign\u201d is partly a reflection of this. While Abbott would probably have used the Orlando shooting to highlight the Islamic State \u201cdeath cult\u201d and repeat his arguments about Islam\u2019s need for a reformation, Turnbull had an Iftar dinner with Muslim leaders in which he made far more measured comments, assuring Muslims they were valued members of a multi-faith and multicultural society. \u201cSmall-l\u201d liberals, which Turnbull professes to be, and many security experts will applaud him for this. But social conservatives will use it against him. While Howard and Abbott had campaigned with a combination of neoliberal (free-market) economic policy and social conservatism, Turnbull\u2019s campaign focused more on economic policy. Labor was depicted as big-spending, anti-business and disastrous for economic growth. By contrast, Turnbull promised a bright Australian future if the Liberals were elected, in which an agile and innovative government would encourage industry to generate jobs and growth. The centerpiece of the plan was a tax cut for business, with much made of the opportunities opened up by (Abbott-era) free-trade agreements. Turnbull\u2019s talk of agility, innovation and flexibility in exciting times is designed to encourage an entrepreneurial culture. It sounds more like motivational speaker Tony Robbins than Tony Abbott, and suggests that Turnbull sees exhorting Australian private enterprise to do its best as a major part of the prime minister\u2019s role. This is in turn because he sees the key role of government as being to reduce taxation and other barriers to private enterprise, and to facilitate market-based solutions, rather than for government to intervene more decisively. Could Australia have its sixth prime minister in six years? However, the Liberal Party\u2019s preference for neoliberal, market-based solutions (this predates Turnbull\u2019s leadership though he is a particularly enthusiastic supporter) caused some stumbles. It made the government hesitant to provide extra financial support for areas of Australian industry to avoid job losses. Eventually, the threats to seats in South Australia (particularly Christopher Pyne\u2019s) led to promises of submarines and ships being built in South Australia. Initially the government merely utilized anti-dumping measures (designed to make market competition fairer) to protect steelmaker Arrium. Eventually the government also agreed to fund new equipment. South Australian senator Nick Xenophon was among those who argued that such reluctant and piecemeal support was not enough, and that the government needed a stronger plan to encourage and support Australian manufacturing industry and jobs. More fundamentally, the election result suggests many voters were not convinced by Turnbull\u2019s arguments that the government had a solid plan for jobs and growth. This includes his claims that the benefits of tax cuts to big business would eventually flow through to them. Turnbull had not adequately countered Labor\u2019s arguments for a more socially equitable economic growth, or populist arguments from a range of minor parties and groups, including Xenophon\u2019s. Even if Turnbull does retain the premiership, he will do so in extremely difficult circumstances. His leadership is clearly under major threat. He promised stability in uncertain economic times but may not even be able to offer stability in parliament. He is the leader of a post-Howard Liberal Party in which conservatives had become dominant and found it hard to deal with a small-l liberal leader with more socially progressive views. Issues such as how the same-sex marriage plebiscite is handled will now be even more incendiary within the party. Key Turnbull supporters such as Peter Hendy and Wyatt Roy have lost their seats. Turnbull\u2019s neoliberal support for market forces and public sector cuts has been broadly supported in the Liberal Party since the 1980s, but is apparently no longer so popular with voters. This is an issue that goes beyond Turnbull\u2019s leadership, which the Liberals need to acknowledge. Turnbull faces an increasing protest vote for independents and minor parties. This includes those, such as the Nick Xenophon Team, that have questioned the free-trade agreements that Turnbull sees as central to Australia\u2019s economic development. The Senate seems likely to be even less manageable than it was before the double dissolution. Jacqui Lambie has been returned and Pauline Hanson\u2019s political career has been resurrected. The Senate is also likely to feature colourful senators like Derryn Hinch. Both Lambie and Hanson project themselves as looking after battlers who are economically disadvantaged in today\u2019s Australia, while playing on fear of the \u201cother\u201d. Yet economic stability will be hard to offer in an international economy still not fully recovered from the global financial crisis and now further battered by Brexit and the issues it poses for Europe. Also, a Turnbull government would face major problems as Australia attempts to transition into a technologically advanced manufacturing country. As Turnbull has acknowledged, this includes increasing competition from Asian economies and the unemployment that could result from technological disruption. Yet it is not clear what Turnbull\u2019s solutions would be if market forces fail to deliver. Above all, if returned, Turnbull would need to convince ordinary voters they will have a good life in the exciting future he sees for Australia. His own future depends on it.

Ellis: We wonder what Founding Fathers would have thought about Trump The question is irresistible -- but misguided, Ellis says He asks if Founders could have handled a female or African-American president? Question:  What would the Founding Fathers think of Donald Trump? This is a loaded one, designed to elicit a comparison between now and then that contrasts the debased currency of our current politics with the gold standard of the founding generation. The editors of The New Yorker have already answered the question with a cover on their February 1 issue, showing replicas of George Washington et al. reacting in mock horror at the cartoonish depiction of Trump. One can almost hear late-night comedians tossing off jokes about how our current presidential candidates demonstrate that Darwin got it exactly backward. I\u2019ve seen this movie before. When I was giving talks about my book \u201cFounding Brothers\u201d in 2001, audiences often asked why we had to choose between George Bush and Al Gore in 2000 when, 200 years earlier, voters could choose between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. I found myself saying that, if you knew how dirty the election of 1800 really was, the contrast between now and then would not be so dramatic. This is not to mention the press coverage Jefferson received upon election about his relationship with his former slave, Sally Hemings, which made Bill Clinton\u2019s dalliances with Monica Lewinsky seem like mere peccadilloes. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The presidential candidacy of Trump defies national comprehension, though the Republican establishment, for good reason, is not laughing.  And I have devoted much of my professional career to recovering the founding generation as the most gifted and creative political leaders in American history, who have much to teach us. Trump talks judgment, then cites National Enquirer That said, all efforts to transport them into our time zone are misguided, like trying to plant cut flowers, though the urge to do it is apparently irresistible. Let\u2019s try this together: What would Washington say about our invasion of Iraq? He would not know where Iraq is. Which of the Founders does Ronald Reagan most resemble?  None of them. What would Benjamin Franklin say about the Affordable Care Act? Nothing, because he was already covered by Medicare. Or suppose we shift the questions. What would the Founders think about Hillary Clinton? Well, they were imbedded in a patriarchal world in which a woman\u2019s right to vote, much less run for the presidency, was unimaginable. Or, to push the point even further, what would they say about Barack Obama? That should provoke an interesting conversation, since few of the Founders believed that whites and blacks could live together in the same society once slavery was ended. On both of these scores they have more to learn from us than we from them. One of their enduring legacies, which was awkward in their own day and is anachronistic in ours, is the Electoral College. I\u2019m not sure whether it would help or hurt Trump\u2019s cause, but I\u2019m virtually certain the Founders would nod their approval if we dispensed with electoral votes and chose our presidents in a popular election.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for the past two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman Fellow. Follow him @ijbailey The views expressed are his own. South Carolina's primary for Democratic candidates takes place on February 27 Issac Bailey: Sanders will not beat Clinton in South Carolina with impressive list of endorsements It\u2019s going to be a difficult four (or eight) years for women if Hillary Clinton overcomes her defeat in New Hampshire and goes on to win the presidency. It won\u2019t matter how much she accomplishes, how many lives she improves, what deep-seated problems she solves, or even if she amasses a record that warrants a Top 10 ranking among presidents \u2013 in the society we live it\u2019s going to be tough for women. Sanders\u2019 strong, but not-strong-enough, showing in Iowa \u2013 garnering half the vote in a favorable state doesn\u2019t a revolution make \u2013 can be followed up with a big win in New Hampshire and a respectable loss in Nevada. But it will be the Palmetto State that will determine whether his revolution is real or a pipe dream that will go the way of a supercharged Howard Dean. And the reality is that he faces a daunting task in South Carolina. Black voters will make up more than half of those who will vote in the Democratic primary, and a recent poll had Clinton dominating him in that demographic 79% to 19%. Plus, during the most recent debate in South Carolina, Clinton bear-hugged the legacy of President Barack Obama, who is extremely popular among that group, to help protect that lead. Sanders did himself no favors with his answers about gun control to curb gun violence. His top reason for being lukewarm \u2013 he\u2019s from a conservative, rural state where guns are part of the fabric of the culture \u2013 doesn\u2019t hold water here because like Vermont, South Carolina is conservative and rural, and Democratic voters know there has been too much deference paid to honoring the hunter and sportsman and not enough to preventing a danger worsened by the presence of too many weapons on our streets. Chris Covert, the South Carolina director for the Sanders campaign, told me they are trying to close the gap with Clinton by establishing deep relationships that will last long beyond any particular election cycle. He mentioned how Sanders\u2019 black support doubled over a period of seven weeks and why he thinks that it will only continue to increase. \u201cI feel pretty pleased with where we are at this point,\u201d he told me a few weeks before the votes were cast in Iowa. \u201cThe traditional route is always to go and get as many elected officials as you can \u2026 and we\u2019ve been blessed to get selected elected officials from across the state. But we\u2019ve also gotten the student body presidents of two [historically black colleges and universities]; the president of the Young Democrats of South Carolina, an African-American, and 250 small black businesses. They are helping us support Bernie.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good, but likely won\u2019t put a dent in Clinton\u2019s black support, because she has a similar but longer list. (White South Carolina Democratic voters, meanwhile, seem split between Sanders and Clinton.) If Sanders really wants to compete here, he shouldn\u2019t come back screaming about Wall Street or pointing out that Clinton got paid to give speeches at Goldman Sachs. Even his passion for a $15 minimum wage, while welcome, is unlikely to move the needle because Clinton\u2019s views are not far removed from his. Clinton, Sanders both winners in Iowa Instead, he should remind voters that he is a more likely heir to Martin Luther King\u2019s vision \u2013 Sanders and King marched together and fought for a living wage for all Americans \u2013 than Clinton, who supported her husband\u2019s push to reform welfare, which increased extreme poverty, as well as the bipartisan laws that caused the country\u2019s incarceration rate to skyrocket, a legacy from which black families in South Carolina are still trying to recover. Clinton \u2013 like many white and black Democrats and Republicans \u2013 has evolved from her tough-on-crime history to push for sensible criminal justice reform. But that raises the question of whether voters should focus on her past stances on an issue that is a priority for many South Carolina primary voters or on her embrace of #BlackLivesMatter and the civil rights changes they seek? If Sanders wants to win here, he had better at least force her to explain why she was wrong then and why her evolution should be viewed as sincere today. He should also focus on health care, because it is the one issue that pragmatic voters of South Carolina have seen pragmatism come up short. The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s chief domestic accomplishment, has reduced the ranks of the uninsured by maybe 19 million people nationally, helped close the Medicare prescription doughnut hole, reduced the number of people struggling to pay medical bills and has improved or saved the lives of countless Americans. But its reach has been blunted in South Carolina because it is the result of a necessary compromise. Here, its impact hasn\u2019t been allowed to fully reach roughly a quarter of a million South Carolinians because the Supreme Court gave the state\u2019s Republican governor and Republican-led General Assembly the option to not expand Medicaid, one they happily took. Clementa Pinckney, a South Carolina state senator and pastor of Emanuel AME, where Dylann Roof allegedly killed him and eight other church members, was pushing hard in the General Assembly for a Medicaid expansion before he died, despite the incredible odds against it. The expansion would not only help the working poor, but create an estimated about 44,000 jobs. That dynamic highlights one of the biggest differences between Sanders and Clinton. Sanders has proposed a revolutionary health care plan that would uproot the current system for the dream that is universal coverage. Clinton has called that unrealistic and argues that the best course of action is to strengthen and expand upon the success of the ACA. And from a practical standpoint, her argument makes more sense. No one paying attention to the health care debate of the past six years can deny that even a reform package built upon conservative ideas and liberal principles almost didn\u2019t become law \u2013 and remains under attack because of the illogical state American politics finds itself. Had Democrats followed Sanders\u2019 lead in 2010, the uninsured rate would not now be at an all-time-low. Instead, tens of thousands of Americans would likely still be dying for lack of health insurance, and the sickest among us would still be facing discrimination for the sin of being sick. Even when there was a Democratic president and a House and Senate controlled by Democrats with massive majorities, a modest public option could not pass \u2013 despite the revisionist history some Sanders supporters are now pushing \u2013 as Clinton reminded a debate audience in Charleston. So, on every practical level, Clinton\u2019s vision makes the most sense on health care. Still, in South Carolina, that entirely understandable compromise has meant that at least a quarter of million residents are going without health insurance. Pragmatism has left too many poor people behind in this state even as it has provided a lifeline for millions of others elsewhere. It\u2019s one of the reasons the lawyer for the Walter Scott family, the black man shot in the back by a North Charleston police officer, switched his endorsement from Clinton to Sanders. Ultimately, Sanders will not beat Clinton here with an impressive list of endorsements or going to churches and barbershops and black colleges. If he is to have any chance, he must remind some of the nation\u2019s most pragmatic voters, who have deep affection for this cycle\u2019s most pragmatic candidate, that pragmatism has deadly limits, that revolution is really possible \u2013 and that he is the right man to lead it.

Packard trustee chair in law and a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California. He is the author of \u201cFair Not Flat: How to Make the Tax System Better and Simpler.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Hilary Clinton has proposed raising tax rates on those earning over $5 million a year by 4% Edward McCaffery: The wealthy are actually saving billions in our current tax system It\u2019s silly season for tax policy again: a presidential election year.  Hillary Clinton, under pressure to do or say something about income inequality, has proposed raising tax rates on those earning over $5 million a year by 4%. The plan is reminiscent of the tax policy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who instituted a 79% tax bracket during the Depression in which, legend has it, a single person \u2013 John D. Rockefeller \u2013 resided. (\u201cBecause he can afford it,\u201d FDR was said to have quipped.) Clinton\u2019s proposal would fall on a few thousand households, perhaps, but it is hardly going to make things in America equal.  After all, it is only going to fall on people with reported incomes \u2013 mainly high wage-earners \u2013 and not so much on capitalists like Warren Buffet, who not coincidentally is supporting Clinton. Let\u2019s back up a few weeks. Just before the new year, The New York Times gave us two articles about the state of tax in America. The first was titled: \u201cFor the Wealthiest, a Private Tax System that Saves Them Billions.\u201d The second, published the very next day, seems to contradict the first with its headline: \u201cThanks, Obama: Highest Earners\u2019 Tax Rates Rose Sharply in 2013.\u201d Yet both stories are each perfectly accurate. Neither tells us anything we should not already have known. And of course neither story addresses the 800-pound gorilla in the room \u2013 just like Clinton\u2019s proposal or those New Year\u2019s resolutions that rarely go after our deepest, darkest problems. Let\u2019s consider five simple points to ponder this year. 1. The American tax system is mainly a wage tax This is clearly true of the payroll tax, the Social Security and Medicare \u201ccontribution\u201d system that for over 80% of Americans is the major tax they pay.  But it is also true of the \u201cincome\u201d tax, which does a fairly good job at taxing labor, or wages \u2013 mainly because employers tell the government how much each employee makes on those W-2 forms. But the same system does a very poor job at taxing the gains to capital \u2013 the other source of wealth. 2. Our governments need lots of money Because federal and local governments keep spending more than they take in, they turn to wage taxes. Trying to actually tax capital \u2013 which only the rich have in any significant amount (rather by definition), is highly mobile and easy to hide and comes with much political and economic power \u2013 is hard.  And it takes time. Who has that? So, instead, the U.S. has been increasing its wage taxes, a far easier thing to do, as the government can count on employers to collect and remit the tax (another FDR-era tax policy innovation).  The government can increase taxes by raising rates and/or by closing down \u201cloopholes\u201d available to wage earners. (Hence, the near constant chatter about repealing personal deductions like charitable contributions and mortgage interest). The Obama administration has shepherded some of each tactic through a sometimes cantankerous Congress. As the second Times article points out, the effective tax rates on America\u2019s 400 wealthiest families, which had fallen from 26.4% to 16.7% from the 1990s to 2012, rose to 22.9% in 2013, the first year that the Obama tax increases were in play. This is the same high-end crowd that Clinton is targeting. 3. Really high wage-earners find ways to avoid really high taxes The percentages being discussed are percentages of reported income. The rich don\u2019t report all of their goodies as \u201cincome.\u201d The first Times article does not go into details of the techniques involved, but it is clear that they are being used by high wage earners, such as hedge fund managers, who find ways to have their incomes taxed at lower capital gains rates, and others who take advantage of offshore trusts and elaborate entities to hide the income altogether.  Nothing new here \u2013 and expect more of the same if Clinton\u2019s plan becomes law. Journalist David Cay Johnston published a book over a decade ago titled \u201cPerfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich \u2013 and Cheat Everybody Else.\u201d Johnston helped to illustrate that the tax games of the rich are a constant \u2013 among other things, they make enough money to make complex avoidance strategies worthwhile.  A deeper problem with wage taxes is that rates cannot get all that high, or people stop working or leave the jurisdiction, as Phil Mickelson threatened to do. So we end up with a wage tax at fairly (but not extremely) high rates, virtually inescapable for the vast middle classes with their W-2s but still encouraging games to be played by wealthy wage-earners. 4. Really high wage-earners do not have to go far or think hard to save on taxes It is not that the wealthy are necessarily smarter about taxes than the rest of us. The games come to them. Suppose someone is making $10 million a year, such that he should be paying about $4 million a year in taxes at today\u2019s rates \u2013 $4.2 million under Clinton\u2019s proposal. Some well-credentialed professional explains that she can reduce that tax bill to $2 million. That kind of tax savings leaves plenty of money to share with the professional, who thus has plenty of reasons to make her own market by seeking out the high wage-earner. This is all Capitalism 101 \u2013 where there\u2019s a profit to be had, there will be profiteers to be found.  Which brings us at last to the ultimate point. 5. None of this is relevant to the truly rich, such as Bill Gates or Warren Buffet The truly rich don\u2019t live off salaries.  They live off their capital, the other great factor of production in a capitalist economy. If you already have wealth, you need never pay tax \u2013 any tax \u2013 in America again.  You can play what I call Tax Planning 101 and, unlike high wage earners, you don\u2019t have to pay any professional much or do anything too fancy at all.  You simply buy and hold assets, borrow against their value to finance your lifestyle, and then die, as we all do. Only when the really rich die, their assets go to their heirs with no income tax consequences. President Obama made a sensible proposal in his 2015 State of the Union speech to change this absurdity, by requiring capital gains \u2013 the difference between an asset\u2019s value and its tax \u201cbasis\u201d (typically cost) \u2013 to be taxed on death. That proposal was declared dead on arrival. No serious presidential candidate, including Clinton, has embraced it. So there you have it.  Wage earners are being increasingly taxed.  High wage earners are trying to avoid the taxes, aided by a well-heeled industry of professional tax advisers.  Politicians like Clinton or FDR may make a big splash by attempting to raise tax rates on these high wage-earners, and the advisers will come running to the rich to help them plan around the increased taxes. All the while the 800-pound gorilla \u2013 the fact that the U.S. tax system is highly ineffective at getting at capital or wealth other than wages \u2013 keeps getting ignored. Nothing really changes. Capital wins. It need not go on a diet like the rest of us with standard New Year\u2019s resolutions, and it stays safe from the grasp of politicians who want headlines but don\u2019t want to antagonize their donors. And so stay tuned for more silly proposals that make big headlines but promise little real change. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",
