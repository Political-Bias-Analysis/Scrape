Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Right now, the electoral map looks fairly predictable, with Trump dominating in the South and Biden the Northeast and West Coast. Trump has also picked up the major swing states of Florida and Ohio, but the key battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan are too close to call. So are Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. This was an expected wrinkle, since states are having to add up absentee votes, early votes and day-of votes. While several electoral combinations could make the difference in the race, you\u2019ll want to keep your eye on those Rust Belt states. If the race remains unclear over the next day or so, things could get ugly. Early this morning, Trump attacked legitimate vote-counting efforts and said he would go all the way to the Supreme Court to get \u201call voting to stop.\u201d The Trump campaign has also threatened legal action to curtail counting in Pennsylvania, where the typical late start on absentee ballot tabulations could hold up the process. So far, there haven\u2019t been too many surprises in Senate contests, but the race for control is still on. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham retained their seats, and the parties traded a pair of flips: Democrat Doug Jones was ousted by Republican Tommy Tuberville (yes, the former Auburn football coach) in Alabama, and Colorado\u2019s former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper usurped a Republican Senate seat in his state. In Georgia, the special Senate race between Trump loyalist Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will go to a runoff. Other close races are still going on in Arizona, North Carolina, Maine and Georgia. In the House, prominent Democrats\u00a0Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley all held onto their seats. Some voters had to make other notable decisions for their states: \u2022 Arizona and New Jersey voted to legalize recreational marijuana use, CNN projects. \u2022 South Dakota became the first state to approve both medical and recreational marijuana use on the same day. \u2022 Republican Greg Gianforte will be Montana\u2019s next governor. \u2022 Colorado voters rejected a proposition that would have tightened restrictions on abortion. \u2022 Louisiana voters added language to their constitution stating it offers no protections for a right to abortion or funding the procedure. \u2022 Mississippians approved a new flag design featuring a magnolia and the phrase \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d State leaders decided to replace the old flag, which featured Confederate symbolism, over the summer. While Americans voted, watched and waited yesterday, the US recorded 91,000 new coronavirus cases. That\u2019s the country\u2019s second-highest daily case total ever. More than 50,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with the virus, and those numbers are trending upward in the vast majority of states. Overseas, China and Japan are seeing new spikes, as is India\u2019s capital city of New Delhi. There have now been more than 46 million cases of the virus worldwide. Meanwhile, a study has found that pregnant women are more likely to become severely ill and die from Covid-19. Contracting the virus also puts pregnant women at increased risk for premature delivery, it claims. Hurricane Eta thrashed parts of Central America and is now headed toward the US Gulf Coast as a tropical storm. Eta brought massive storm surges and widespread damage to Nicaragua and Honduras, and ongoing heavy rains could lead to days of life-threatening flash floods and river flooding. The storm is expected to linger in the region for the next few days, dumping even more rain. Then it will travel over the Caribbean and possibly threaten the Gulf Coast and southeastern US by the end of the weekend.

What to know at the polls By yesterday, more than 96 million Americans had already cast ballots in early in-person and mail-in voting. Local election officials are hoping the early crush actually makes today\u2019s proceedings a little smoother. \u2022 Find poll locations, closing times and other info for your state here There\u2019s been some concern that the Trump campaign\u2019s rhetoric about \u201cpoll watchers\u201d may lead to conflicts at some voting locations. Here\u2019s the bottom line: Poll watchers can\u2019t interfere with the voting process, and their conduct is bound by state regulations.

That could mean delays, since Pennsylvania doesn\u2019t even start counting mailed ballots until Election Day. \u2022 If you\u2019re a minute-by-minute kind of election watcher, here\u2019s your go-to page for the latest election news throughout the day \u2022 And you can follow lives updates from CNN all day here Besides who will be president come January, there are a lot of other decisions being made today on the local level, like abortion accessibility and marijuana legality.

Beware trying to guess a state\u2019s outcome by the early returns: The way and order in which states count votes could make it look like one candidate is temporarily leading over another, which is called a \u201cmirage.\u201d \u2022 Here\u2019s how CNN makes election projections \u2022 How to spot red and blue mirages in early results What to know in the coming days If we do have a winner on election night, or soon after, here\u2019s what the next few months will look like. But ultimately, we could be in uncharted territory. Global conflict watchers have warned that the US may see \u201cunfamiliar danger\u201d stemming from the election process. If we don\u2019t have a winner on election night, well, that\u2019s its own conundrum. But remember, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. In 2000, it took until December \u2013 and a whole Supreme Court showdown \u2013 for George W. Bush to officially declare victory. While some states have their own earlier reporting deadlines, federal law allows states to report votes until December 8. So, if we don\u2019t know the winner right away, don\u2019t panic. There are a lot of things that feel unprecedented about this election, but a delay in results isn\u2019t necessarily one of them. Don\u2019t forget your mental health It\u2019s going to be a long election process. Don\u2019t feel like you need to be glued to every second of the proceedings. You voted, you did your part, and your worrying isn\u2019t going to get those votes counted any faster. \u2022 Avoid falling into hours-long Twitter scrolls of doom. Log out and try to focus your mind elsewhere. \u2022 Stay active. Take a walk, do a little yoga or shake out the jitters in a one-person dance party. \u2022 It may sound counterintuitive to the above, but if you\u2019re feeling anxious or sad, allow yourself those emotions. Avoiding negative feelings doesn\u2019t make them go away. It just means they\u2019ll come out sideways later. Call a friend, journal, or yell politely at the sky. \u2022 Here are 50 more ideas for making it through the day, from treating yourself to helping others. Finally, remember to drink some water. Will that help with anything? Who knows. But we\u2019re going to get through this together, and we\u2019re going to do it fully hydrated. France, Germany and Belgium have gone into partial coronavirus lockdown as Europe faces a wave of new outbreaks. The UK and Italy also plan to further tighten restrictions. Canada is getting battered, too. Three weeks after Canadians celebrated their Thanksgiving holiday, the country is seeing a national spike in cases. That may mean Thanksgiving in the US could also become a superspreader event. It only took a day for Eta to grow from a tropical storm to a strong Category 4 hurricane. The slow-moving and rapidly intensifying storm is due to make landfall in Nicaragua this morning, bringing potentially catastrophic damage. Gunmen stormed Kabul University in Afghanistan, killing 19 people including students before police ended the assault. No group has claimed responsibility. It\u2019s the second attack on an educational institution in the city in just over a week after a suicide bomber killed 24 people at a different location at the end of October. At least four people were killed and 14 injured in a terror attack in Vienna, Austria. At least one gunman opened fire in a busy part of the city. Police believe there may have been multiple attackers, but one suspect who was shot dead by police was said to have been \u201cradicalized.\u201d People are using dating apps to reach voters in swing states Here you\u2019re thinking you\u2019ve found a normal person to get socially distanced coffee with, but they just want you for your vote.

Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson has paused the advanced clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in a volunteer. It\u2019s the second Phase 3 coronavirus vaccine trial to be paused in the US, but experts say it\u2019s not entirely concerning or unexpected for adverse effects, even serious ones, to appear in large studies. Meanwhile, several countries like Russia and Germany are seeing record daily numbers of Covid-19 cases, or numbers approaching the early peaks of the pandemic. There\u2019s another second wave to worry about, too: A new report claims there will be another surge of Covid-related mental health devastation as well. Increased isolation and tension, coupled with poor access to taxed mental health treatment systems, could lead to more tragedies like overdoses and suicides. The first day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett featured plenty of fiery moments, but a lot of them revolved around the upcoming election instead of Barrett herself. For instance, all eyes were on VP nominee Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, when she delivered an opening statement criticizing President Trump and Republicans for attacking the Affordable Care Act. Both sides have all but agreed Barrett\u2019s confirmation by the Republican-led Senate is a done deal, so Democrats instead used some of their questioning time to make a pitch to save the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Democrats for bringing up Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith and her association with the Christian group People of Praise, saying it amounted to, as Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said, \u201creligious bigotry.\u201d Progressives are worried that with another religion-led conservative on the bench, abortion rights cases could be dismantled. Early in-person voting has started, and it\u2019s already a mess. A technical glitch at an Atlanta voting supersite and hours-long lines around the state plagued voters in Georgia.\u00a0 Election watchers have long worried that technical problems, along with pandemic protocols and reduced polling staff, will create untenable situations for discouraged voters. California is dealing with another problem: The state\u2019s Republican Party has been asked to remove unofficial ballot drop boxes placed in at least three counties. Such actions are illegal, since only county election officials have the authority to oversee ballot drop boxes. In New York, the NYPD has told all uniformed members to prepare to be deployed for protests before and after the election \u2013 possibly into 2021, if a winner is not promptly and securely decided. Facebook says it will now ban forms of Holocaust denial under its hate speech policy. That\u2019s a reversal for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who previously said that while such content was offensive, it shouldn\u2019t be removed. Facebook has been criticized for an uneven approach to moderating and monitoring hate speech on its platform. Last week, the company said it will ban all pages, groups, and Instagram accounts representing the conspiracy theory QAnon. That was a big move as well, one that fellow social media giant YouTube is seemingly reluctant to follow. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said during a CNN interview that the platform has taken steps to reducing the ways QAnon content is recommended to viewers, but stopped short of saying they would take broader action. Tensions are rising between Greece and Turkey over offshore rights in the eastern Mediterranean. A Turkish ship recently departed to conduct work near the Greek island of Kastellorizo, which is close to Turkey\u2019s southern coast. Greece\u2019s foreign ministry described the development as a \u201cmajor escalation\u201d and a \u201cdirect threat to peace in the region.\u201d Relations between the two countries have been frayed for years due to a variety of disputes including jurisdiction in the Mediterranean and influence over the ethnically split island country of Cyprus.

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris faced off Wednesday night in their only debate of the 2020 election campaign in Utah. The debate covered more topics than last week\u2019s Trump-Biden showdown, but overall, the debate ultimately was about Trump. We asked our viewers around the country for their reaction to the debate. Here\u2019s what they said: Steve, Tennessee \u201cMike Pence won hands down. Kamala Harris\u2019s smirks and scowling and shaking her head when Pence was stating facts she knew were true was unbecoming at best. She ducked too many questions including packing the court and Biden\u2019s health or lack thereof.\u201d Robin Edwards, Logan County, Kentucky \u201cVP Pence acted as if he was the superior person on the stage. He seemed to look down on the two women involved. Then, when it was over, his wife stripped off her mask. As head of the Covid task force, you\u2019d think he would act with some sense. VP Pence acted like his boss, only with more polished words that were not true. He needs to stop the lying.\u201d Nathaniel Cain, Cincinnati, Ohio \u201cWhile both candidates were equal in debate style, Harris (in my opinion) won on the one attribute that decided the 1960 TV debate between Kennedy and Nixon: physical appearance. Harris was calm, smiling and acted very professional while speaking directly to the American people as well as to Pence and Page. Pence on the other hand looked a bit uncomfortable, had a bloodshot eye and (in a viral moment) had a fly land on his hair for two minutes. So, while the issues were important to discuss, their appearance could not be any more different.\u201d Dharmesh, Naperville, Illinois \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We had a (mostly) civil discussion on issues that matter. But that\u2019s nothing to celebrate. I think Harris did slightly better but left out a few punches, namely how the White House outbreak is a microcosm of Trump\u2019s failure to handle the Covid-19 crisis. Pence was largely on the defense all night and did little to give credence to his own administration Covid-19 response \u2013 that\u2019s the most important issue for me heading into this election.\u201d Aletha D., Dowagiac, Michigan \u201cThe debate was an exercise of two very strong opponents. Kamala Harris held her ground yet wasn\u2019t overbearing. She met her goals. Introduced herself as a strong leader. Mike Pence also met his goals and showed a more rational conservative view. I would not be surprised if Trump/Pence gain in the polls a little by his performance. Overall, a strong debate.\u201d Watch: Undecided voters react to last night\u2019s debate Charles, Louisiana \u201cI believe that it is totally shameful that the debate commission allows the Trump administration to rudely ignore the person in charge of the debate and shamelessly interrupt the other person trying to make their point. They allow them to blatantly lie without fact checking. Here\u2019s what should happen. At the two minute mark, their microphones should be deactivated and reactivated when they are asked a question. If they don\u2019t answer the next question and go off on something previous, they lose their turn and the microphone silenced!\u201d Alex, Boston \u201cI was proud to be a Biden/Harris supporter tonight. I do believe that Mike Pence is a decent man, but I also believe that he sold his soul to a devil named Trump. Pence and countless others who were complicit will be judged. There is simply no doubt.\u201d Katelyn Kirkland, Texas \u201cHonestly, I feel like Sen. Harris would have been well within her right to go back harder at VP Pence. I understand her hesitation, as a woman in this country regardless of skin color, but especially for Black women, an aggressive stance or thought process is always heavily criticized \u2013 ironically by the very men who show aggression and \u2018passion\u2019 themselves. Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from this debate for me (which is similar to the takeaway from the presidential debate) is that Trump/Pence refuse to answer the tough questions. The redirecting from each of them and their campaign in general shows that they are unwilling to be truthful and transparent with the American people. They dodge any point-blank questions that should honestly be easily answered by those who either are or seek to lead our country (i.e., Trump on denouncing White supremacy, Pence on climate change.)\u201d Natalie Thornton, Indiana \u201cI don\u2019t believe that either candidate provided informative support to their running mates nor the American public. We are still left with unanswered questions that affect our current quality of life in this country and going forward.\u201d Cathy, Brookline, Massachusetts \u201cPence seemed to lie A LOT. Kamala\u2019s answers were measured and favorable. I would say she won the debate.\u201d VP debate fact check: Daniel Dale selects the lie of the night Tim, Pennsylvania \u201cNo doubt Pence is the more polished debater. Pence made very good points in the contrast between the two tickets. Harris did OK but I can see why she didn\u2019t gain any traction in the primaries.\u201d Sydney Carter, Clarkston, Georgia \u201cI think overall Kamala Harris performed the best; I must admit I wasn\u2019t expecting Mike Pence to do as well as he did. While both made good points, I think overall, Kamala Harris\u2019s points on Covid-19 and health care were her strongest and really pushed her forward. She was gestural and commanding when she spoke and looked directly into the camera and as a voter, that did a lot for me. I also like how agreeable her responses were, the Biden/Harris Campaign is specifically targeted to younger voters and I think her responses reflected that well. She was approachable and personable and as a young voter myself, that made her extremely relatable which in turn will receive votes.\u201d Matt, New Jersey \u201cI voted for Obama in \u201908 and Gary Johnson the last two cycles and have been a fan of some of Trump\u2019s accomplishments but hesitant to support. Tonight did it for me, a clear coherent vision for America\u2019s future and a rational appreciation that this virus could have been much worse. I personally believe by clinging to the radical wing of the party, and strangely resurrecting failed Obama era foreign policy, that she may have pushed voters towards Trump. Because I\u2019m one.\u201d Get all the voting info you need to know for your state with CNN\u2019s voting guide Julie Arcand, Washington State \u201cI thought Kamala Harris was the gentle woman here! She was honest and forthcoming! We must have honesty! How can the vice president claim character and Christianity and lie to us? I am a 53-year-old, well-educated woman diagnosed with a brain tumor and have a severe spine condition. I need insurance that covers pre-existing conditions. And, I need affordable housing! I now have to live on just less than 800 dollars a month in King County, Washington. The same county in which Bill Gates lives. I cannot continue my brain tumor treatment because of Covid-19 and the inability to pay! I will get what Medicare and Medicaid will approve. Pence doesn\u2019t know what it means to suffer and worry about health and finances! Kamala and Biden at least have empathy.\u201d Meneshea, Alexandria, Virginia \u201cI\u2019m not too thrilled that they both dodged two of the questions that I was most interested in hearing responses for: (1) if Roe v. Wade is overturned, how would they want their home states to handle abortion law, (2) have they had discussions with their running mates about succession. Those are important topics for me as a voter, because it has to do with my rights as a woman and there\u2019s a chance that succession could occur if Trump succumbs to the coronavirus and because Trump and Biden are nearing their 80s.\u201d",

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Mike Bloomberg is out. Less than a day after his deeply disappointing Super Tuesday, the media magnate suspended his\u00a0more than half-a-billion-dollar campaign and endorsed \u2026 Joe Biden. Biden, riding a surprise set of Super Tuesday victories, is now the top mark for GOP politicians and those hoping to stop his surge toward a Democratic nomination.\u00a0Senate Republicans are sharpening their investigations involving the former vice president, his son Hunter Biden\u00a0and Burisma, the\u00a0Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Committee members have gotten\u00a0access to classified documents and may subpoena a former Burisma consultant. Some top Democrats, meanwhile, are worried Biden\u2019s momentum could set the stage for a most unwanted repeat of 2016, when\u00a0a clash between an establishment candidate and\u00a0Bernie Sanders divided party support,\u00a0and, well, you know what happened next. The Supreme Court heard\u00a0the first major abortion case brought before its new conservative majority. The case concerns a controversial Louisiana abortion access law that critics say would\u00a0leave just one doctor in the state to perform the procedure. A similar law in Texas was struck down four years ago by the high court, but with its new makeup, this law\u00a0could be upheld. Though the court appeared divided after hours of oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts asked questions that indicated he may be in favor of reversing precedent and allowing new state restrictions on abortion.\u00a0Abortion rights advocates fear the conservative court could gut longstanding precedents, while some states, like Louisiana, are taking advantage of the possibility by passing more restrictive laws.\u00a0The case will be decided by July, just as the presidential race\u00a0heats\u00a0up. Global cases of the coronavirus have topped 95,000 as countries employ new strategies to try to\u00a0contain the spread. Iran, one of the worst-hit countries so far, has announced it is developing a vaccine and is ready to send out test kits. In New York City, about 1,000 people have been asked to self-quarantine after 11 new cases were reported there. Flights have been cut in the US, Italy has closed down schools nationwide, and speculation is mounting as to how Japan will proceed with the Tokyo Olympics, which are less than 150 days away. Meanwhile, India has identified 29 coronavirus cases,\u00a0prompting fears that the world\u2019s second-most populous country could become a viral powder keg.\u00a0Meantime, Britain\u2019s Prince William, who\u00a0made several \u201cjokes\u201d about the coronavirus\u00a0while meeting emergency workers at a reception in Dublin hosted by Britain\u2019s ambassador to Ireland. A prison riot\u00a0in Colombia prompted by coronavirus fears has left at least 23 inmates dead and 83 injured. The country\u2019s Justice Minister Margarita Cabello\u00a0said the incident began with a \u201cmassive and criminal escape attempt\u201d at\u00a0Bogota\u2019s La Modelo prison, one of the country\u2019s largest and most overpopulated prisons. Cabello also said there was unrest in other penitentiary centers around the country. The health and security of prison inmates and prison staff is a growing concern. In Italy, a dozen inmates have died and dozens more have escaped in similar riots and, in the US, there have been several confirmed cases of coronavirus in prison systems across the country. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0has replaced the country\u2019s Prime Minister, saying he hopes the new PM would\u00a0\u201cdo the impossible.\u201d What is the impossible? Zelensky says he wants a government that will serve the people instead of special or corrupt interests. The new appointee, Denis Shmygal, is the country\u2019s third PM in just over six months\u00a0and replaces\u00a0Oleksiy Honcharuk. The outgoing PM got into hot water last month when leaked recordings appeared to capture him\u00a0criticizing Zelensky\u2019s economic policy. Zelensky, of course, is of keen interest to President Trump and the US, as a call between the two leaders was at the center of Trump\u2019s\u00a0impeachment investigation. A military base in Iraq was struck with a second rocket attack in a week, injuring three Americans and several other Iraqi and coalition personnel.\u00a0The Joint Operations Command in the region described the attack as \u201cbrutal\u201d and said the injured Iraqis were \u201call in a critical condition.\u201d Rocket attacks in Iraq have ramped up in recent weeks. Previous attacks on US and coalition forces have been attributed to\u00a0an Iranian-backed group, sparking concern that aggressions in the area could soon boil over again. And now, some good news: The Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s last Ebola patient was discharged,\u00a0marking a new step toward the end of the world\u2019s second-deadliest outbreak of the disease. Health care workers were seen singing and dancing as others gathered to see the patient leave the hospital. A regional director for the World Health Organization praised the tireless efforts of Congo\u2019s medical professionals\u00a0and added that the country must stay vigilant to completely stamp out the disease. An estimated 2,226 people were killed in this outbreak in Congo.\u00a0Four African countries, including Congo, recently licensed an Ebola vaccine, and the WHO says more nations will soon follow suit. Don\u2019t let this trick you into thinking everything\u00a0you say on the internet isn\u2019t preserved, in some way, forever.

Some Super Tuesday results are still rolling in, but it\u2019s already clear Joe Biden was the day\u2019s biggest winner. The former Vice President swept the southern elections, turned in a surprise victory in Texas and even poached a victory in Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts. Biden\u2019s success in yesterday\u2019s contests shows his popularity among key demographics, like African Americans, older voters and white suburbanites. While as of this morning, Biden had secured a commanding majority of the\u00a0delegates up for grabs across 14 states and one US territory, Bernie Sanders leads in California, one of the day\u2019s biggest prizes. If he wins there, it could put his delegate count over Biden\u2019s. Meanwhile, Warren and Michael Bloomberg are facing some harsh disappointments. Warren failed to win a single contest, and Bloomberg limped away with one:\u00a0American Samoa. Tennessee is under a state of emergency after its deadliest tornado day in seven years. At least 24 people were\u00a0killed and dozens more are unaccounted for after storms ripped through the Nashville area. Thousands are still without power, and search and rescue teams are working to locate the missing. The destruction and confusion following the storms led some polling places in the\u00a0state and surrounding areas to\u00a0extend their hours\u00a0to accommodate Super Tuesday voters.\u00a0In recent years, scientists have noticed an increased frequency of tornadoes in the Southeast. In these areas, tornadoes tend to be harder to spot and often come at night, when people are less prepared. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders lobbed attacks at each other during last night\u2019s debate in Washington, but there were two things they did agree on.\u00a0One:\u00a0that women are high on their VP nomination lists. Biden outright pledged to pick a woman for his running mate, while Sanders said he is strongly considering it. Two:\u00a0that they, as Biden said, \u201cfundamentally disagree with this president on everything.\u201d Economic fears over the coronavirus epidemic are starting to manifest into action.\u00a0The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in an attempt to give the US economy a jolt. It\u2019s the first\u00a0unscheduled, emergency rate cut since 2008. Experts are hoping this economic \u201cpanic button\u201d will move leaders in the health sector and the White House to enact more serious policies to stop the virus\u2019 spread and secondary effects.\u00a0Congressional negotiators still haven\u2019t finalized a spending bill to help battle the coronavirus, and its passage hinges on Democrats insisting any vaccine against the virus is made affordable for everyone. Worldwide cases have now surpassed 92,000, with dozens of new cases being reported in the US and Australia. Meantime, Iran will temporarily release 54,000 people from prisons as officials struggle to contain the rapid spread of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East. A prison riot\u00a0in Colombia prompted by coronavirus fears has left at least 23 inmates dead and 83 injured. The country\u2019s Justice Minister Margarita Cabello\u00a0said the incident began with a \u201cmassive and criminal escape attempt\u201d at\u00a0Bogota\u2019s La Modelo prison, one of the country\u2019s largest and most overpopulated prisons.

In Italy, a dozen inmates have died and dozens more have escaped in similar riots and, in the US, there have been several confirmed cases of coronavirus in prison systems across the country. The US has conducted an airstrike against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan as the historic deal between the two entities threatens to fray mere days after it was signed. The breakdown began after reports the Taliban had resumed violence in the country, carrying out 33 reported attacks that killed six civilians and wounded 14 others. Such aggression is\u00a0expressly forbidden by the deal with the US, in exchange for the US reducing its troop presence in the country. President Trump and\u00a0Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator, spoke by phone amid the reports. Hours later, military officials announced the airstrike, which they said was a defensive move to protect a US military checkpoint. A military base in Iraq was struck with a second rocket attack in a week, injuring three Americans and several other Iraqi and coalition personnel.\u00a0The Joint Operations Command in the region described the attack as \u201cbrutal\u201d and said the injured Iraqis were \u201call in a critical condition.\u201d Rocket attacks in Iraq have ramped up in recent weeks. Previous attacks on US and coalition forces have been attributed to\u00a0an Iranian-backed group, sparking concern that aggressions in the area could soon boil over again. Iran has ramped up its production of nuclear materials and\u00a0nearly tripled its stockpile of low enriched uranium since November, according to the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog. The purpose of such an increase is a bit tricky: Low enriched uranium is used for nuclear power plants, not weapons. However, in theory, the increased stockpiles reduce the time the country\u00a0would need to acquire enough weapons-grade material to create a bomb. The increase also puts Iran\u2019s stores of low enriched uranium far\u00a0over the limit set by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the US left in 2018. \u2026 except for the sister.

Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The Pentagon announced that the US has killed a key Iranian military commander in an airstrike at Baghdad International Airport, taking escalating tensions in the region to new heights. Qasem Soleimani, the commander who was killed, was one of the most powerful men in Iran. He was the leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force, which the US\u00a0deems\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization. The Pentagon said this attack was intended to deter future Iranian attack plans on US personnel (you\u2019ll recall this all started when the US retaliated for attacks against US interests in Iraq by Iranian-backed forces). Iran has made it clear that it won\u2019t acquiesce, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calling\u00a0Soleimani a martyr and vowing\u00a0revenge for his death. US\u00a0lawmakers pretty much agreed that Soleimani\u2019s death was warranted, but key\u00a0Democratic leaders expressed deep concern about how the airstrikes were handled and publicized. Presidential candidate Joe Biden said that by boasting\u00a0about the attack, President Trump has \u201ctossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox\u201d that could lead to a devastating new conflict in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Russia offered Iran condolences and called the US airstrike a mistake. Since Iran has all but assured imminent retaliation, some US points of interest are in defense mode: The State Department has urged citizens in Iraq to \u201cdepart immediately,\u201d and parts of\u00a0New York City are getting extra security\u00a0as a precaution. Keep up with developments here. Did you enjoy your break from impeachment stress? That\u2019s almost over. Today, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is due to give his first floor speech of 2020, in which he will try to define the next phase of the saga. He\u2019ll have his work cut out for him: Documents released yesterday under a court order show that an official from the Office of Management and Budget clearly stated President Trump was the one who directly ordered a freeze on aid to Ukraine. This revelation will make it harder for Senate Republicans to protect Trump in a Senate trial \u2013 whenever that might happen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi still hasn\u2019t sent the two articles of impeachment to the Senate, which means the whole process is stalled as she tries to pressure McConnell into negotiating on the terms of a trial. Long story short: Democrats want to call key White House witnesses to testify; Republicans do not. Juli\u00e1n Castro is out. The former\u00a0Housing and Urban Development secretary ended his presidential campaign yesterday after failing to gain traction in the wide and deep-pocketed field of Democratic candidates. The departure of Castro, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, also cuts deep into the diversity of the campaign field. Meanwhile, keep your eyes on that revolving door: Marianne Williamson, a fringe candidate\u00a0in the Democratic race, has\u00a0laid off her campaign staff nationwide. All of this culling and jostling comes a month before the Iowa caucuses officially kick off the campaign season. The Democratic front-runners \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2013 are now burning a path through the all-important swing state, with Elizabeth Warren not far behind. China appears to have been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries for several years as part of what critics fear is a coordinated nationwide effort to control and oppress Muslim minorities. Hundreds of satellite images, photos\u00a0and corroborating accounts from experts and people in the region show entire cemeteries demolished, sometimes with scattered human remains left behind. Many sites appear to have been destroyed in the last two years. The Chinese government has released dozens of notices over the years saying it was relocating the cemeteries, and officials aren\u2019t denying their destruction. China has been under international scrutiny for its treatment of Muslim citizens. The US State Department believes more than 2 million ethnic minority people, including Uyghur Muslims, have been held in a wide network of detention camps since 2017. The 2020 census is coming, and with it, a laundry list of controversies.\u00a0A federal judge has directed the Commerce Department to review and publish documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to include a citizenship question on the census, even though the administration dropped the issue last year after a Supreme Court ruling. The judge said the documents could clarify the impetus for the push for a citizenship question. Previous documents revealed a Republican consultant found a citizenship question would be\u00a0\u201cadvantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites\u201d when it comes to drawing voting lines.\u00a0Meanwhile, new projections suggest the presidential battlegrounds of Florida and North Carolina could make gains in the Electoral College once congressional seats are reorganized according to census results.

            "article_content": "Rev. Josh Saefkow walked across the stage before his congregation at Flat Creek Baptist Church in Fayetteville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, holding up the front page of the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The pastor, an avid news reader, had been saving the paper through 2020, to urge reflection in his final Sunday sermon of the year. \u201cWhat a devastating year this has been,\u201d he said, then turned to 2021. \u201cWe got a little election coming up,\u201d said Saefkow, referring to the January 5 Senate runoffs. Quiet laughter rippled through the pews, as few have been unable to escape the more than $500 million in political advertising blanketing the state. \u201cVote Christian,\u201d urged the pastor. \u201cWe need to vote with the context of scripture in our minds and let it come through the lens of scripture.\u201d While not mentioning by party or name whom they should vote for, congregants told CNN they know who this conservative Baptist pastor was talking about. \u201cI always vote for the candidate who most aligns with my Christian faith. In this runoff especially, I\u2019m voting for the candidates who are pro-life,\u201d said Allison Yates. Those candidates with anti-abortion rights stances, she added, are Republican incumbent Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Churches, especially evangelical churches in Georgia, have been a potent force among the electorate. According to the CNN exit poll from the 2020 election, about one-third of the electorate in November was White evangelical or born-again Christian. Republicans won about 85% of their votes. But Black voter turnout in November, especially in the Atlanta suburbs, helped tip the scale for President-elect Joe Biden, with voter registration groups like the New Georgia Project partnering with churches to reach Black Christian voters. In the runoffs, voter registration groups targeting Black voters have continued to work with churches to hold registration drives and host the Democratic candidates in their parking lots. In the Bible Belt, Georgia remains a state where nearly 80% of its residents identify as Christian, and where politics for preachers on both sides of the political aisle find a natural correlation, especially with the control of the US Senate at stake. Should Democrats flip both Senate seats, Vice President Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving Democrats control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not about being political, it\u2019s about being Biblical,\u201d said Saefkow. \u201cI think it\u2019s advantageous for all us followers of Jesus to elect people who represent our world view. We\u2019ve become more engaged as a church family so we can make an educated decision in the voting booth but also being framed in the scripture.\u201d The pastor said he will not explicitly tell his church members who to vote for, but openly disagrees with both the Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, on issues like abortion. Both candidates support abortion rights. Saefkow takes the sharpest departure with Warnock, in part, because both men share their Christian faith. \u201cI think he\u2019s a gifted orator. I think he\u2019s a gifted communicator,\u201d said Saefkow, \u201cbut not the best student of scripture. It\u2019s not about Rev. Warnock, it\u2019s about what the scripture says. For me, he veers off there, when you look at the issue of life. I think he\u2019s wrong on that.\u201d The issue of abortion is a powerful driver to the ballot box not just for the pastor personally, but for the religious right in Georgia, believes Saefkow. About 40 minutes to the north of Flat Creek Baptist Church, Rev. Vandy Simmons of Antioch AME Church, called out evangelicals for their emphasis on abortion. \u201cWe\u2019re challenging our so-called evangelical brothers and sisters. We\u2019re challenging them to be better. We\u2019re challenging them not to hide behind something called pro-life,\u201d preached Simmons, from his Sunday pulpit. \u201cWhere you\u2019re more concerned about the life you can\u2019t see instead of making provisions for the life that come into this world.\u201d For the parishioners here, attacks on Warnock\u2019s abortion rights position are nonsensical. \u201cAs much as they make an argument about life in the womb, in the midst of this pandemic they\u2019re opposed to wearing face masks. They\u2019re opposed to the guidelines from the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) so therefore, we have had almost 400,000 people that have died,\u201d Bishop Reginald Jackson told CNN. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we\u2019re more concerned about the life in the womb than we are about the lives outside the womb?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cI preach, teach, counsel, advocate against abortion. But at the same time, I believe, ultimately, that is that woman\u2019s decision to make.\u201d Loeffler doubled down on the religious divide during the only televised debate in the Senate runoffs with Warnock. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to be lectured by someone who uses the Bible to justify abortion,\u201d Loeffler began her argument. \u201cListen,\u201d Warnock said as part of a broader response to the attack. \u201cI have a profound reverence for life and abiding respect for choice. The question is, whose decision is it.\u201d Christian Democrats have emphasized health care, economic justice and criminal justice reform. Delivery on those issues lies on whether the coalition that handed President-elect Joe Biden Georgia in November turns out in January. Jackson minced no words on who leads that coalition for Democrats in Georgia, speaking to the congregation at Antioch AME Church on Sunday. \u201cThe eyes of the nation are waiting to see if Black folk are going to turn out for the runoff like you turned out in November,\u201d he said from the pulpit. \u201cAll I want to say to them is come and see.\u201d Jackson oversees nearly 90,000 church members in the Georgia\u2019s 6th Episcopal District of the AME Church. \u201cThere will be huge turnout among Blacks and the church is giving leadership to that effort,\u201d he said of the January 5 election. The message has not been lost on the faithful listening from the pews, only a small and socially distanced congregation allowed into the sanctuary due to Covid-19. Lynnise Gamble, in attendance at Sunday\u2019s service, told CNN, \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing it since before November. We\u2019ve been talking about voting, voting, voting. A lot of people look to the church for guidance and so it\u2019s very important to get that word out.\u201d From the tiered stage of Antioch AME\u2019s sanctuary, a choir of women in ruby red dresses raised their voices in song. \u201cHis plan, His plan for me is victory!\u201d they sang. \u201cThe heat is on, church. We want to be ready, church,\u201d urged the woman at the mic. \u201cBecause the whole world is counting on us to make the Senate blue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "On Friday morning at 8 a.m., Vice President Mike Pence will receive the Covid-19 vaccine, becoming, in the process, the highest-profile politician in the country to do so. For Pence, it will be that rarest of things over these past four years: A moment in which he eclipses, however briefly, President Donald Trump. (Trump isn\u2019t receiving the vaccination yet, because he has already had Covid-19.) Pence, who has built his career on being a steady and reliable conservative, has struggled to find ways to distinguish himself in any meaningful way over Trump\u2019s term because, well, Trump is Trump. Of late, that reality has been a good thing for Pence. The vice president has, largely, avoided being dragged into Trump\u2019s fantasy world in which he won the election but was somehow cheated out of it. As Politico\u2019s Gabby Orr and Nahal Toosi wrote recently: \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic Pence has used to navigate the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency: stay out of the spotlight and insulate himself from his boss\u2019s baseless election-fraud crusade, all while still finding ways to burnish his own credentials and technically toe the party line.\u201d While Trump has been content to largely sequester himself in the White House and tweet conspiracy theories, Pence has been taking many more duties that would have once been the purview of the President. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! And so, it was Pence in Georgia on Thursday campaigning for Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue who are locked in tight runoff races on January 5. It\u2019s the third(!) time he\u2019s visited the state since the election to drum up support for the two GOP candidates. And it was Pence touring a Covid-19 vaccine production facility in his home state of Indiana earlier this week. And it was Pence who led a \u201cLife is Winning\u201d event at the White House on Wednesday to tout the Trump administration\u2019s work on abortion. For Pence, then, this is the longest sustained period of attention he\u2019s had since the early days of the coronavirus task force \u2013 before Trump decided to take over the daily briefings by the group. None of this changes the uncertainty surrounding Pence\u2019s future, of course. If Trump does run again in 2024, as he has indicated, Pence will be forced to the sidelines. And if Trump doesn\u2019t run but endorses one of his offspring as the preferred heir to his political legacy, then Pence will be similarly out of luck. But that\u2019s the unknown future. In the right now, Pence is enjoying the national spotlight in ways he struggled mightily to do over the past four years. The Point: Trump\u2019s disinterest in actually performing the duties of the president has opened the door for Pence. And the vice president has walked through it.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden rarely misses Sunday Mass. So it was notable when the President-elect didn\u2019t attend church on November 29, the first Sunday of Advent and the beginning of the season when Roman Catholics like Biden prepare for Christmas. Biden\u2019s absence was understandable, since just a day earlier he had broken his foot. But the following weekend, Biden was back at his home parish in Wilmington, Delaware \u2013 St. Joseph on the Brandywine \u2013 for Saturday\u2019s vigil Mass. He was there again on Tuesday on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, a holy day of obligation. That\u2019s a level of devotion to regular religious services not seen from recent presidents, who were professed Christians but intermittently attended church or worshipped privately while in office. Donald Trump has not had a habit of attending church services weekly, though he made several appearances at the Episcopal church in West Palm Beach near his resort as well as at various evangelical churches across the country. Barack Obama would go to church for the occasional Christmas or Easter service in Washington or on vacation in Hawaii, but rarely during the rest of the year. And George W. Bush, being a high-profile born-again Christian, tended to worship privately as president at Camp David and intermittently attended church services in Washington, DC, and Texas. But for Biden, who next month will become the second Catholic president in US history, attending weekly Mass is expected to be a fixed part of his schedule. And while it\u2019s unclear whether he will adopt a permanent parish in Washington during his term, Biden\u2019s churchgoing will not only provide a window into his spiritual side. It will also be core to his political brand \u2013 apparent not just in the pursuit of his policy agenda but even in his schedule as President. \u201cFor Joe, faith is both a private devotion \u2013 he prays regularly, he goes to church. But it\u2019s also public. He\u2019s open about and proud that he\u2019s a Catholic,\u201d said Fr. Kevin O\u2019Brien, a friend and spiritual adviser to Biden and his wife Jill. O\u2019Brien, now the president of Santa Clara University in California, was heading up the campus ministry at Georgetown University when he met the Delaware senator more than a decade ago. Biden regularly went to Mass at Georgetown\u2019s chapel or at nearby Holy Trinity parish when in Washington, a practice he continued during his eight years as vice president and which some around him say he\u2019ll continue as president. \u201cJoe\u2019s faith isn\u2019t just part of who he is,\u201d said Sen. Chris Coons, the Democrat from Delaware and a friend of Biden\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s foundational to who he is.\u201d Catholicism is a way of life for Biden. He attended Catholic schools and married his first wife, Neilia, in a Catholic church. He peppers his political speech with quotes from Scripture, Catholic hymns and references to the nuns and priests he learned from in school. More so than any time before in his public life, Biden\u2019s faith was woven into his political message during the 2020 campaign. He fashioned himself as the candidate standing up for morality and decency, fighting for the soul of America and calling on the country to \u201cembark on the work that God and history have called upon us to do.\u201d But it\u2019s much more than a cultural identity for the 78-year-old President-elect. Since childhood, Biden has been a regular at Mass. He frequently worships with family members, often attending with some of his grandchildren in tow. In photos: President-elect Joe Biden While touring across the country in his presidential campaign, Biden would quietly slip into a local Catholic church for Mass \u2013 often coming in a few minutes late or leaving a few minutes early, to avoid the rush. He was even spotted attending daily Mass on Election Day at his parish in Wilmington, Delaware. On the day Biden was inaugurated as Vice President in 2009, he asked O\u2019Brien to preside over a private Mass at Georgetown beforehand. Four years later, O\u2019Brien held another Mass before the second inauguration, this time at the Vice President\u2019s residence. (O\u2019Brien told CNN he is unaware of any plans yet for another private Mass before Biden\u2019s inauguration as President.) These services, said the priest, reflected how important the Catholic faith and ritual were to Biden, particularly on two of the most joyful days of his life. But his faith in Christ and devotion to the church also bolstered Biden during his lowest moments. The most well-known of those were the deaths of Neilia and his daughter Naomi in a car crash and, decades later, the death of his son Beau from cancer. The President-elect, who regularly wears his late son\u2019s rosary on his wrist, has publicly spoken about the role his faith has played in carrying him through grief. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to proselytize, I\u2019m not trying to convince you to be, to share my religious views. But for me it\u2019s important because it gives me some reason to have hope and purpose,\u201d Biden shared earlier this year during a CNN town hall with a grieving pastor who\u2019d lost his wife during the Charleston shooting, explaining that he\u2019d promised his own dying son that he would continue to stay engaged and not retreat into himself. On the eve of John F. Kennedy\u2019s election in 1960, there was still a debate about whether Catholic elected officials might take their directions from Rome and the Pope instead of the US Constitution. Since then, Catholics have become integrated into American public life to the point where Biden\u2019s religious affiliation is just another point in his biography. The last three Speakers of the House have been Catholics, and so are the majority of justices on the Supreme Court. Biden was the first Catholic to serve as vice president. And despite American Catholics initially finding a home in the Democratic Party, they\u2019re now a diverse group politically, especially as the Republican Party has embraced positions on several social issues in line with the church\u2019s teachings. CNN\u2019s exit polls showed Catholics were nearly evenly split, with 52% supporting Biden and 47% supporting Trump. That\u2019s an improvement for Biden over Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance with Catholics four years ago, when she lost them to Trump 50% to 46%. Among conservative Catholics in Washington, Biden\u2019s election has been greeted with caution and suspicion. His support for abortion rights and the Obama administration\u2019s legal fights with Catholic non-profits over providing contraception coverage loom large. Ashley McGuire, a senior fellow at the conservative Catholic Association, said it will be difficult to separate Biden\u2019s liberalism on abortion and contraception from how he\u2019s viewed by Catholics \u2013 especially because of how his campaign emphasized his faith. \u201cIt just sort of highlights even more where he is at odds with the church,\u201d said McGuire. She added that she views Biden\u2019s selection of Xavier Becerra for secretary of Health and Human Services as a direct shot at Catholics. As California\u2019s attorney general, Becerra sued the Little Sisters of the Poor after the Catholic social-services organization won their lawsuit to be granted an exception to the Obama-era HHS mandate that health-insurance coverage include contraceptives. \u201cThe issues where people have been the most divided and where the political left and the political right, and Catholics, have been so split are the issues where that department is going to be involved,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt was his move, and he sort of set a tone that suggests attack. And that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d But not all Catholics are wary of Biden. Days after the election, Pope Francis congratulated him in a phone conversation. And Washington archbishop Wilton Gregory, who was just recently elevated by Francis to cardinal status has said he looks forward to an \u201copen dialogue\u201d with Biden. While some Catholics have said Biden should not receive communion because of his political views, Gregory has said he will not deny the President-elect the sacrament. O\u2019Brien insists that Biden has always recognized a distinction of his personal faith from his political career, even if the former frequently informs the latter. \u201cHis faith is reflective of his compassion and empathy, his commitment to the vulnerable, and his service to the country,\u201d said O\u2019Brien.

Bush attended church at Camp David and intermittently in Washington, DC, and Texas.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday will introduce the scientists and doctors he says will finally defeat the pandemic \u2013 but for now, his team can only watch as a wave of infection and death deepens the crisis he will face after January 20. As Biden will give his most significant preview yet of his plan to tackle the worst health challenge in 100 years, President Donald Trump \u2013 whose dereliction of duty has contributed to the alarming winter surge \u2013 will hold his own pandemic event. He will pitch for credit for the swift development of Covid-19 vaccines and sign an executive order prioritizing their supply for Americans. The dueling events \u2013 one in Biden\u2019s hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and other at the White House \u2013 will showcase the vastly different approaches to the pandemic between Trump and Biden. The President has repeatedly downplayed the disaster as he concentrates instead on false claims that last month\u2019s election was stolen from him. Biden, whose own campaign was an exercise in demonstrating social distancing and masking, is pledging to put science back at the center of the fight against the virus.   In the meantime, the tragedy of the pandemic is being exacerbated by the political vacuum in Washington. Trump, in his last weeks in office, has the power and presidential megaphone that could go a long way toward convincing Americans to take precautions, but has no inclination to do so. Biden has the plans and a fresh team of experts who could make a difference, but he has no real power to shift American behavior and policies until he is inaugurated next month. The President plans to use a vaccine summit to sign an executive order at the White House aimed at prioritizing the shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to Americans over other nations. The administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed deserves some of the credit in the swift development of vaccines. But Tuesday\u2019s event also seems to reflect the President\u2019s relentless focus on using the crisis to advance his own political priorities since senior administration officials boasted that Trump saw the effort as a way of boosting his \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy principle. The impression that the move is more political than strategic was underscored when the head of the government\u2019s vaccine effort, Moncef Slaoui, said on Tuesday he had no idea what the President was planning to do. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t know \u2013 and frankly, I\u2019m staying out of this, so I can\u2019t comment,\u201d Slaoui said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d Slaoui also defended the government following a New York Times story that revealed that officials turned down an offer by Pfizer last summer to sell the US more supplies of its vaccine. Slaoui said that buying more doses at a time when it was unclear whether the Pfizer prototype would work would have been the wrong thing to do and stressed that the strategy was to diversify government bets through a series of potential vaccines. \u201cWe selected six different vaccines to build the portfolio, to manage the risk that some may work and some may not work, but also to ensure that as more than one would work that we would accumulate vaccine doses from this portfolio of vaccines,\u201d Slaoui said. Still, it has emerged in the last few days that previous predictions by administration officials of several hundred million vaccine doses being available by the end of the year will fall well short, leaving states without sufficient inoculations to protect front-line health care workers when they get their first deliveries. Ahead of Trump\u2019s event, Tuesday\u2019s headline are being dominated by coverage of the UK becoming the first country to administer the first vaccines after a rigorous process of clinical trials. Trump had hoped to stage an \u201cAmerica first\u201d victory lap of his own and CNN reported last week he was furious that Food and Drug Administration officials \u2013 who are expected to grant emergency authorization to the Pfizer vaccine this week \u2013 had not beaten the British to the punch. He took this attitude even though the FDA process is considered the global gold standard and officials already face a tough task in convincing many skeptical Americans to take the jab. The coming vaccines from a handful of pharmaceutical giants offer hope that normal life can be restored next year \u2013 though getting them in the arms of tens of millions of Americans will be a huge logistical challenge. There is no doubting, however, that the crisis is quickly getting worse. One expert, Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine, warned Monday on CNN that the US, which is closing in on 15 million Covid-19 infections and a total death toll of 300,000, could soon regularly see 3,000 Covid-19 deaths every day. And America\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Monday that after the projected post-Thanksgiving and Christmas surges kick in, the \u201cmiddle of January could be a really dark time for us.\u201d That means the Biden administration will take office at the most extreme moment of the crisis and will face the task of getting up to speed and managing the hugely complicated operation to roll out tens of millions of vaccine doses. Biden\u2019s appeal to all Americans in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency will likely be even more appropriate given that the current infection levels will likely be dwarfed by the time he reaches the Oval Office. There is also the question of whether millions of Americans who buy Trump\u2019s false claims of a rigged election will be willing to take advice from a President who his mask-disdaining predecessor spent weeks baselessly branding as illegitimate. Here's who could serve in top roles in the Biden administration In Wilmington on Tuesday, the President-elect will unveil a new health team characterized by the kind of scientific rigor that Trump has often disdained during the pandemic. The lineup includes former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, whom Biden plans to nominate for a second spell in the same job, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, whom the President-elect has picked to head the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fauci has accepted an invitation from Biden to stay on as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \u2013 a post he has held since 1984. The globally respected expert will also serve as the Biden administration\u2019s chief medical officer. But some Republicans are already raising flags at the selection of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cI think he will be controversial,\u201d said GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, citing the nominee\u2019s positions on single-payer health care and abortion. \u201cSome of these folks are pretty radical.\u201d The comment raised the possibility that Biden faces a protracted confirmation showdown over his HHS secretary at the darkest moment of the worst public health crisis in 100 years. The profound concern among health experts is all the more acute because there is such good news as more of the potential vaccine candidates that have shown high efficiency come on line. But fatigue over social distancing, the temptation for people to gather during the holiday period and efforts by the President to minimize the seriousness of the threat could cause hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths. \u201cI just can\u2019t help but think, as Americans lose their lives in the coming weeks, none of those people have to lose their lives,\u201d Hotez of Baylor College told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on the \u201cSituation Room.\u201d \u201cIf we could just get them to the other side to get them vaccinated, they could live a long and normal life, and that\u2019s where my priority is right now, especially in the middle part of the country, where people are still defiant of messages \u2026 where many still think Covid is a hoax or deaths are due to other causes.\u201d Most states now require face masks to reduce the spread of Covid-19. These are the ones that don't With leadership missing from the President, the burden of stemming the winter assault from the virus has fallen again to local and state leaders. Many are reintroducing restrictions on indoor dining, on the sizes of gatherings and other measures. California, which is experiencing its worst Covid-19 surge since the start of the pandemic, has imposed a shutdown that will last until after Christmas. \u201cPeople are getting exhausted, they\u2019re getting lonely and they just want it to be over,\u201d California Lt. Gov Eleni Kounalakis told Christiane Amanpour on CNN International. \u201cAnd so what we\u2019re trying to do is really call upon Californians to recognize that this is the most dangerous part of the entire pandemic. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d she said, referring to vaccines. Seeing its own infections spike, Washington, DC, banned contact sports such as football, basketball and hockey on Monday. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said he was considering new restrictions after warning that health care workers were becoming overwhelmed and exhausted as the situation got much more dire. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo basked in praise from Fauci on Monday for his efforts to keep infections down. But the governor warned that his state may again experience the kinds of restrictions imposed during its terrible Covid-19 spring this year, predicting that authorities would soon have to prohibit indoor dining in New York City. \u201cThe frustrations we are seeing here \u2013 we estimate that over 70% of the spread is coming from small gatherings,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about it until I am blue in the face about the apparent safety of being home.\u201d Such closures will inevitably mean a deterioration in already dire economic conditions, with millions of Americans unemployed because of the pandemic and small businesses folding everywhere. This makes it even more vital that Congress finally overcomes its divisions and produces a new Covid-19 rescue plan that will extend expired unemployment benefits and offer relief for businesses. The best short-term hope for those Americans is an effort to fund the government with an interim bill to buy time for more stimulus talks and a broader spending bill before Christmas.",

            "article_content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will deliver remarks in Georgia on Wednesday, less than a month before the state\u2019s Senate runoff elections. According to a notice from the State Department, Pompeo\u2019s address to Georgia Tech will focus \u201con the China challenge to U.S. national security and academic freedom.\u201d Pompeo has pursued a hardline approach to Beijing, and the administration on Monday sanctioned a new tranche of officials over crackdowns in Hong Kong. Pompeo defended the speech as an important foreign policy address and took a shot at his predecessors in an interview on \u201cThe Guy Benson Show\u201d Monday. \u201cI promise you, when Secretary (John) Kerry traveled to Massachusetts or Secretary (Hillary) Clinton traveled to New York, those were coastal elite states. Those were all fine for secretaries to travel to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Mike Pompeo wanted to travel to Georgia, somehow that\u2019s incomprehensible that foreign policy could matter to an enormously capable research institution like Georgia Tech, where I\u2019m going to go speak about that very set of issues, the fact that in America\u2019s research educational institutions today, the Chinese Communist Party is aiming to lobby, to influence, and to steal.\u201d \u201cAnd I want to talk about that. I want to talk about their infiltration at those universities, the things those schools ought to do and indeed must do to protect not only their students but their data,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I want to talk about how China is going about this, why it impacts American national security, and how the Trump administration is pushing back against that.\u201d The top US diplomat\u2019s stop in the Peach State follows stops by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to campaign for Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who face tight races against Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively. The winners of January 5\u2019s runoff election will determine control of the Senate. His travel to Atlanta also comes amid skyrocketing Covid case rates across the country. 4 takeaways from the Georgia Senate debate Pompeo has faced sharp scrutiny, particularly from congressional Democrats, for his active domestic speaking schedule and his involvement in domestic politics. He has shattered past precedent of secretaries of state largely avoiding the domestic political fray, and violated his own State Department regulations by speaking to the Republican National Convention in August. His speech was recorded from Jerusalem during an official, taxpayer funded trip, although the department said they were delivered in his personal capacity and that no taxpayer funds would be used. The Office of Special Counsel launched a probe into whether the speech violated the Hatch Act,  two House Democrats said in late October. In the run-up to the general election in November, Pompeo delivered a number of speeches aimed at domestic audiences \u2013 one at a megachurch in Texas, one to state lawmakers in Wisconsin and a virtual one to a conservative anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion Christian organization in Florida. In early October, two top Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee \u2013 Chairman Eliot Engel and Rep. Joaquin Castro \u2013 called on the State Department to turn over records related to those speeches by mid-October. \u201cWe are concerned that Secretary Pompeo\u2019s actions threaten the institutional integrity and reputation of the State Department, as well as long-standing principles of election fairness,\u201d Engel and Castro said at the time. \u201cTo that end, we urge the Secretary to cease from engaging in any further activity that could be construed as partisan in nature.\u201d Pompeo, who is believed to have presidential ambitions, was also investigated by former State Department inspector general Steve Linick for potential misuse of taxpayer resources prior to his ouster in May. Pompeo repeatedly denied he fired Linick in retaliation, saying he had no knowledge of the ongoing investigations. This story has been updated with comments from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.",

            "article_content": "Illinois State House Speaker Mike Madigan has held his post almost continually since he first won it in 1983. He represents one of the last vestiges of the old party boss system \u2013 a man not terribly well-known outside of the city of Chicago but someone who, arguably, wields more influence than any other single figure in this massive Midwestern state. Which makes the fact that 19 of Madigan\u2019s House Democratic colleagues have come out in public opposition to him being elected to another term as speaker in January absolutely fascinating. Madigan, a man who has managed to float above the reputation of his state and city for corruption now sees himself tied \u2013 at least tangentially \u2013 to a pay-for-play scheme involving the state\u2019s largest electrical utility. In search of answers about how Madigan got here \u2013 and whether he can survive as speaker \u2013 I reached out to Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Explain, briefly the space Mike Madigan has occupied in Chicago Democratic politics for the last several decades. Pearson: Madigan, 78, has been part of the fabric of city and state politics for more than a half century. He was born into the world of ward politics on the Southwest Side in the bungalow belt near Midway Airport where his father was a Democratic precinct captain. He also grew into the political patronage system, holding city jobs while becoming a trusted part of Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s machine. In 1969, he was elected the youngest ward boss in the city at the age of 27. That year, Daley also tapped him to become a delegate to the convention that wrote the state\u2019s 1970 Constitution \u2014 its current governing document \u2014 as well as to keep an eye on another delegate, Daley\u2019s son, the future Mayor Richard M. Daley. In 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since. While city mayors came and went, Madigan continued to accumulate power and jobs through city and county allies, and in 1983 he became House speaker. He has held that post ever since, with the exception of 1995-1997 when Republicans took brief control of the chamber. The year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the \u201cCutback Amendment,\u201d a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third. The real effect was to concentrate power \u2013 and campaign money \u2013 into the hands of the legislative leaders and Madigan proved to be a master fundraiser. Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics \u2013 through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician\u2019s agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren\u2019t offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley. Madigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan\u2019s clout and offer property tax business as recognition. Madigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states\u2019 party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics \u2013 even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican \u2013 such as the suburban \u201ccollar counties\u201d which surround Chicago and Cook County. Cillizza: Madigan is the longest-serving state speaker of the House in the country \u2013 in power for all but two years since 1983. How has he managed to last so long amid so many changes within the Democratic Party? Pearson: On the old \u201cStar Trek\u201d series, there was a 3-D chessboard. Consider Madigan to be the political grandmaster. For much of his career, Madigan was able to outmaneuver political adversaries on issues to the point of either sensing the tide on an issue and getting in front of it, waiting his opponents out or helping to defeat them. But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana. Progressive is still not a word used to describe Madigan. Madigan\u2019s primary goal [is] maintaining power and a Democratic legislative majority. Cillizza: Has Madigan ever faced a real threat to his power? When and why? Pearson: Previously, the only threat Madigan faced to his power, aside from the two years when Republicans held the Illinois House, came under Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and recently defeated one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state\u2019s economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich\u2019s ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children\u2019s hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich\u2019s eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction. Under Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan \u201ccorrupt\u201d and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan\u2019s greatest sources of financial support \u2014 organized labor. The ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities. Rauner lasted one term and lost to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018. Though Rauner has departed the political scene, his heavy spending and daily criticisms of Madigan inflicted serious damage. Once a figure that everyday Illinoisans never knew, Madigan has become viewed as extremely unpopular \u2013 even before the federal investigation in which he has been implicated. Cillizza: Why is this the moment that Madigan appears to be in real trouble in his effort to remain as speaker? Is all his history finally catching up with him? Pearson: Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for Madigan amid the #MeToo movement when he faced issues regarding sexual harassment in both his political and governmental operation. He discarded veteran political operatives including his longtime chief of staff, appointed more women to senior posts and promised to do more to prevent any recurrences. But frustration with Madigan has been building with a younger, more progressive caucus straining under an autocratic style which lets members advance only a few of their bills per session. Then in July, Commonwealth Edison, the state\u2019s largest electrical utility, agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with federal prosecutors in acknowledging its part of a near decade-long bribery and influence scheme, seeking to win Madigan\u2019s favor on legislation by giving jobs and contracts to Madigan\u2019s top allies. On Wednesday, the former CEO of ComEd and once one of the city\u2019s most powerful businesswomen, Anne Pramaggiore, two other utility players and Madigan\u2019s top private sector confidant, lobbyist and former lawmaker Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to charges associated with the scheme. Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the November 3 election said that as they tried to explain their positions on issues, voters repeatedly said their chief interest was what were they going to do about Madigan. Distrust of Madigan was also cited as a factor in the defeat of the governor\u2019s signature agenda item, a proposed state constitutional amendment to change Illinois from a flat-rate income tax to a graduated-rate tax that rises with income, a system similar to the federal government and used by more than 30 states. Opponents, largely funded by business interests, continually raised the question of \u201cdo you trust politicians with more tax money?\u201d The amendment was rejected overwhelmingly by voters in a hugely expensive campaign. Pritzker contends the amendment\u2019s loss is in part due to Madigan and has said he should consider stepping down. US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber\u2019s leadership, also said the party paid a heavy price for Madigan\u2019s leadership after his favored local congressional candidate, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, was defeated by four-term US Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville. Davis tarred Londrigan with ads associating her with Madigan. Madigan had always been viewed on the outside as smart enough to avoid being caught in the city and state\u2019s history of corruption. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He doesn\u2019t have a cell phone or use email. He said he retains sizable support in his caucus and will seek reelection as speaker and doesn\u2019t intend to step down. But in politics, perception caries a great deal of weight and the public perception of Madigan is now being joined by at least 19 members of his expected 73-member majority in the new General Assembly that convenes in January. Rather than a leader, the dissidents consider him a hindrance and a distraction. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIn January the next Speaker of the Illinois state House will be ________.\u201d Now, explain. Pearson: I don\u2019t mean to weasel out here but this is very much an open question. In the past, there were heirs apparent to Madigan should he have stepped down. But Madigan has outlasted them. The women\u2019s caucus is sizable and has now become a political force. The Black caucus in the House has always been influential. Progressives have become a larger factor in the chamber and they will want to be represented. Members of Madigan\u2019s current leadership team want consideration.",

            "article_content": "Progressives led by President-elect Joe Biden will soon take over the White House, but at the Supreme Court, liberalism has reached a historically low ebb. A court that drove liberal social change for decades is now an engine of conservatism. That was evident in a religious liberty dispute over Covid-19 rules last week and is likely to be seen on abortion rights, gun restrictions and possible new Biden regulations, such as to protect the environment and address climate change. The transformation of America\u2019s highest court has been years in the making and clinched by President Donald Trump\u2019s three appointments, most recently Amy Coney Barrett for the late liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Supreme Court's latest ruling exposes personal fissures among the nine justices For the three remaining liberal justices on the nine-member bench, it\u2019s a whole new world of negotiation. Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan constitute a low-odds trio with little leverage. The three justices have shown distinct personal approaches to navigating the changing court. They have different views of when to bargain for half a loaf when a whole is impossible. The question since the confirmation of Barrett is whether much of any loaf will exist for them. Breyer, 82, and Kagan, 60, have skillfully negotiated in the past with Chief Justice John Roberts, 65, who has tried to keep the court from rushing rightward. (Roberts\u2019 own options are now limited by five solid conservative justices to his right.) \u201cA dissent is a failure,\u201d Breyer said recently, explaining why he is often ready to give up something to get something. Sotomayor, 66, is disinclined to compromise and readier to wield a public dissenting opinion calling out her colleagues. Last week, she penned a blunt dissent as the majority rejected New York\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions on churches and synagogues, concluding: \u201cJustices of this Court play a deadly game in second guessing the expert judgment of health officials about the environments in which a contagious virus, now infecting a million Americans each week, spreads most easily.\u201d Sotomayor, whose opinion was joined by Kagan but not Breyer, also pointedly contrasted the majority\u2019s regard for religious groups in the New York dispute with the majority\u2019s 2018 spurning of challenges to Trump\u2019s travel ban on certain majority-Muslim countries. She all but called her colleagues in the majority hypocrites. Earlier this fall, the liberals dissented together in an Alabama dispute over curbside voting. Writing for the threesome, Sotomayor recounted that, \u201cHoward Porter, Jr., a Black man in his seventies with asthma and Parkinson\u2019s Disease, told the District Court: \u2018(S)o many of my (ancestors) even died to vote. And while I don\u2019t mind dying to vote, I think we\u2019re past that \u2013 we\u2019re past that time.\u2019 Election officials in at least Montgomery and Jefferson Counties agree. They are ready and willing to help vulnerable voters like Mr. Porter cast their ballots without unnecessarily risking infection from a deadly virus. This Court should not stand in their way.\u201d John Roberts has heard just about enough of Obamacare for one lifetime The six conservative justices who now dominate are collectively younger than the justices on the left. They are also further to the right than Republican appointees of an earlier era. The most ideologically moderate of the group is Chief Justice Roberts, a 2005 conservative appointed by President George W. Bush. \u201cWe have a court supermajority that is substantially more conservative than the nation as a whole,\u201d said Duke University law professor Neil Siegel. \u201cThe court was already our most conservative since the 1930s,\u201d before the appointment of Barrett, who is 48. \u201cThe chief, who was the center, generally speaking, is one of the more conservative chief justices we\u2019ve had,\u201d Siegel added. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s not going to have the same level of control. Will there be any working center?\u201d An answer is likely to emerge only after a year or so, when the court has moved past much of the Trump turmoil and Barrett has voted on an array of issues. Overall, Trump has had an extensive impact on the US judiciary. In addition to filling three of the nine high court seats, he has named 53 appeals court judges. The Brookings Institution\u2019s Russell Wheeler, who monitors judicial trends, said Trump\u2019s appeals court total constitutes 30% of those judgeships, the highest percentage of any president since Jimmy Carter, who served 1977-1981. Supreme Court conservatives hint at ducking ruling on legality of Trump plan to cut undocumented immigrants from Census At the trial court level, Wheeler said Trump has named 173 judges, 25% of all slots, as of December 1. Senate Majority Leader McConnell, a partner to Trump in judicial selection, promised that no vacancy would be left behind this year. That is the opposite of how McConnell approached the last years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure, blocking appointments so that successor Trump came into office with more than 100 total vacancies. In the sweep of Supreme Court history tracing to the 18th century, the justices were not usually at the forefront of progressive social reform. \u201cA relatively conservative court was the dominant model,\u201d said University of Alabama law professor Tara Leigh Grove. \u201cThe important cases of Brown (v. Board of Education) and Loving (v. Virginia) altered the landscape of thinking about the court.\u201d In those 1954 and 1967 cases, respectively, the court struck down school segregation and a ban on interracial marriage. Other landmarks of the era enhanced privacy and personal liberty, voting rights and criminal justice. Amy Coney Barrett's answers were murky but her conservative philosophy is clear Conservatives criticized these trends \u2013 as the domain of legislatures, not courts \u2013 and voted to limit them but never fully changed the Supreme Court\u2019s path. That is because a sufficient number of centrists remained on the court, despite the many Republican appointments. That pattern has ended. After the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy in 2018, Roberts became the median justice based on the relative ideologies of the nine. With the addition of Barrett, on the far right, that will change. Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh, 55, is likely to sit at the median. During her confirmation hearings, Barrett cast doubt on landmark rulings from the late 20th century revolution in individual rights. She declined to endorse, for example, the 1965 case of Griswold v. Connecticut that established personal privacy rights for couples who would use contraception and that led to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Other conservatives are eager for a new chapter. Justice Samuel Alito, 70, on the bench since 2006, suggested in a fervent speech to the Federalist Society last month that the court should roll back liberal-era milestones, particularly related to religious interests. In a similar vein, Justice Neil Gorsuch, 53, wrote a solo concurring opinion in last week\u2019s New York religion dispute, criticizing dissenters for \u201ccutting the Constitution loose during a pandemic.\u201d Confronting a bolder right-wing majority after Ginsburg\u2019s death, the liberals necessarily have a weaker hand. Kagan and Breyer will certainly press for narrow decisions, as Roberts has done. Arkansas wants to force the Supreme Court's hand on Roe v. Wade In politically charged controversies vivid in the public eye, such as over the Affordable Care Act, a majority might have an incentive to tamp down tensions and avoid breaking ground. Disputes over religion, alternatively, often elicit deep-seated passions and even before this year, a narrow majority was increasingly ruling for conservative Christian groups and others on the religious right. In the past, Kagan showed a talent for building cross-ideological coalitions. The 2010 appointee of Obama was a Harvard law school dean between experiences in the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations. She knows faculty politics as well as the hard-core partisan variety. At an appearance last year at the University of Colorado Boulder, Kagan said, \u201cI definitely do not think compromise is a dirty word.\u201d She regularly tries to reach across divisions on the high court. EXCLUSIVE: Anger, leaks and tensions at the Supreme Court during the LGBTQ rights case Kagan helped steer the court\u2019s decision last June on LGBTQ worker rights and, in 2019, its rejection of the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. When the LGBTQ decision was announced last June, the Wall Street Journal wrote a disapproving editorial with the headline, \u201cAnother Win for the Kagan Court.\u201d That headline hyperbole may not reemerge with the new 6-3 bench. Breyer also has a background in strategic compromise. The 1994 Clinton appointee served as a Senate committee counsel, before becoming a federal appeals court judge. Breyer rarely passes up the chance to recount the mantra of his former boss Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy about sharing credit to achieve a goal. Breyer, who before Covid-era isolation walked the halls and dropped in on colleagues, said he believes in talking out differences when possible and accepting a portion of what he wants to attain a satisfactory majority. \u201cThat is why I don\u2019t like dissents. \u2026 A dissent is a failure,\u201d he told a video audience of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association in November. 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg Breyer\u2019s overall ideology was more moderate than that of fellow Clinton appointee Ginsburg, which likely made it easier for him to work with Roberts to bridge differences. Sotomayor, on the other hand, rivaled Ginsburg for the most liberal justice. The 2009 Obama appointee has rarely shied from dissents that cast shame on her colleagues in the majority. One of her strongest this year occurred in February when the court by a 5-4 vote let the Trump administration begin denying immigrants green cards based on their need for even occasional public assistance, such as food stamps. The administration persuaded the conservative majority to allow enforcement of the new policy, reversing a lower court injunction while the policy was challenged. \u201cIt is hard to say what is more troubling,\u201d Sotomayor, the court\u2019s first Latina justice, wrote, \u201cthat the Government would seek this extraordinary relief seemingly as a matter of course, or that the Court would grant it.\u201d Sotomayor issues scathing dissent in Supreme Court order that could reshape legal immigration In the statement signed alone, she said the court had not been so generous toward death row inmates who asked for emergency stays as execution dates approached. \u201cI fear that this disparity in treatment erodes the fair and balanced decisionmaking process that this Court must strive to protect.\u201d The question for this 2020-2021 session is whether Sotomayor remains mostly alone in heated court battles, or if Kagan and Breyer find the new middle ground a bridge too far. They may, in turn, opt for their own dissents without restraint.",

            "article_content": "As the nation eyes Georgia with its pair of upcoming US Senate runoffs, a victory for Democrats could hinge on the same Black women who helped flip the state blue in the presidential election. Leadership from Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, LaTosha Brown, Nse Ufot and a reliable force of Black female voters who overwhelming voted for President-elect Joe Biden will remain critical to Democrats\u2019 chances of gaining control of the US Senate on January 5. The runoff includes a race between Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and a matchup with GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff. Black female leaders and organizers say years of voter registration drives at churches and community events, and knocking on doors in Black and Latino neighborhoods paid off when Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris won Georgia. And they believe they can do it again. In the next six weeks, Black women said they will use those same strategies in addition to reaching voters who sat out of the general election to help Warnock and Ossoff win their races. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it before and we will do it again,\u201d said Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan voter registration group founded by Abrams in 2014. \u201cNever before in my lifetime have Georgia voters been more important to the state of this nation.\u201d An estimated 5 million Georgians voted in the presidential election, including 1.2 million Black voters, according to the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus. According to exit polls, 92% of Black women in the Peach State voted for Biden. But Warnock and Ossoff could face an uphill battle given Republican voters in Georgia historically turn out in higher numbers for runoff elections, political analysts say. Their Republican challengers are also outspending them by about $109.5 million to $88.2 million as of Friday. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University, said Democrats need to leverage their success in the presidential election to galvanize voters in the Senate runoffs. Part of that strategy requires leaning on Black female leaders and organizers to urge low propensity voters to vote, Gillespie said. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple, it\u2019s just making sure that you actually ask people to turn out to vote,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThey just have to till the same soil that they\u2019ve been tilling for the last decade with hopes that they can reverse the trend of Republicans doing extremely well in elections.\u201d Black female organizers received much of the credit for Biden\u2019s win in traditionally red Georgia with their grassroots efforts in registering new voters in communities of color and fighting voter suppression with voter education. Abrams, a Democrat who narrowly lost to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018, has been lauded for registering some 800,000 new voters in recent years and challenging the state\u2019s election system that allowed voter purges and long lines at predominately Black precincts. Abrams and other Black women have recognized Georgia\u2019s increasing diversity and saw a path to turning the state blue. The state\u2019s share of eligible Black voters grew by 5% between 2000 and 2018, according to the Pew Research Center. The share of eligible Latino voters grew 3% during that same period. Meanwhile, the state lost 10% of eligible White voters. On Thursday, Abrams appeared on the Verzuz music battle between rappers Jeezy and Gucci Mane, watched by at least 1.8 million people, to encourage viewers to vote in the Georgia runoff elections. \u201cRight now, we can at least make sure that everyone shows up to vote so we have two senators (Warnock and Ossoff) to make sure we have Covid response and we\u2019ve got stimulus money coming back to Georgia.\u201d MAP: See 2020 election results Ufot said she has spent the last six years knocking on doors, hosting events and sending out mass text messages to urge young people and people of color to register and participate in elections. The New Georgia Project succeeded in registering 500,000 new voters during that period, she said. Ufot is also encouraging voters to vote by mail and is prepared to challenge any voter suppression efforts. \u201cWe are going into this eyes wide open,\u201d she said. Brown, who co-founded the Atlanta-based Black Voters Matter, has also spent years educating Black voters in Georgia and other southern states about the importance of voting. Brown said the volume of voter turnout, particularly among Black women, in the presidential election was the result of multiple campaigns led by Black women and multiracial coalitions. \u201cI think that Black women were very focused and very determined,\u201d Brown told CNN. \u201cWe were going to do everything within our power to really be able to pull our community along. And really, we showed up not just as voters, but as political strategists.\u201d Georgia Democratic State Sen. Nikema Williams, who was elected to succeed the late US Rep. John Lewis in the 5th Congressional district, said the credit given to Black women for delivering elections to Democrats is long overdue. \u201cBlack women didn\u2019t just start playing a critical role in Democrats winning elections,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBlack women have always been the backbone of the Democratic party but what we are seeing now is people digging into the data and recognizing us for what we have been doing.\u201d Williams said she expects to see a continuation of efforts led by Black women ahead of the presidential election including voter registration events, speaking at sorority meetings and historically black colleges and universities, and talking to voters about what is at stake in the election. Black women, she said, must also reach out to voters who didn\u2019t vote in November to convince them that Biden\u2019s victory proves their vote counts, Williams said. Viola Hardy, a Black woman from Marietta, said she is inspired by the work Black women have done to turn out voters in Georgia. Hardy said she has been posting to social media, making phone calls and sending emails to urge her friends, family members and neighbors to vote in the upcoming runoff. Without control of the Senate, Hardy said it will be difficult for Biden and Harris to address the issues that impact Black women such as abortion rights and equal pay. \u201cI am asking people to do the same thing they did in the general election which is get out and vote,\u201d said Hardy, a 48-year-old old realtor. \u201cWe have our first Black female vice president. If nothing else, let\u2019s show her that we have a voice and that we are speaking up loud and proud so that she can be able to leave a great legacy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eryn Mathewson and David Wright contributed to this report.",

It has been updated to reflect voting outcomes for the ballot measures based on CNN projections. In addition to who will win the presidency, seats in the US Congress and other political offices, voters across the country considered a wide range of ballot questions on Election Day. Here are some of the top issues that appeared on state ballots: Louisiana\u2019s Proposed Amendment No. 1 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Prevent the state courts from declaring abortion restrictions unconstitutional at the state level. Read more here. Colorado Proposition 115 Outcome: CNN projects it to fail. What it would have done: Banned abortion beginning at 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure included exceptions to save the life of the pregnant woman but not for instances of rape or incest. Doctors who continued to perform abortions at 22 weeks could have faced penalties. Read more here. California Proposition 17 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Restore voting rights to persons who have been disqualified from voting while serving a state or federal prison term upon completion of that prison term. California Proposition 22 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Continue to treat ride-hail and delivery drivers as independent contractors with some benefit concessions granted by the proposition. If it doesn\u2019t pass, those workers would likely be considered employees who are entitled to a minimum wage, overtime pay, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance and paid sick leave. Read more here. Arizona Proposition 207 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Allow adults 21 years and older to possess, consume or transfer up to one ounce of cannabis and create a regulatory system for the products\u2019 cultivation and sale. Mississippi Initiative 65 Outcome: CNN has not made a projection. What it would do: Allow physicians to recommend medical cannabis for patients with any of 22 qualifying conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. Mississippi Initiative 65A Outcome: CNN has not made a projection. What it would do: Limit the smoking of medical cannabis to people who are terminally ill, and would leave the future regulatory framework up to the legislature. Montana Initiative 118 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Amend the state\u2019s constitution to establish 21 as the legal age to purchase, possess and consume cannabis. Montana Initiative 190 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Allow adults in the state to possess, buy and use cannabis for recreational use and defined a 20% tax on recreational cannabis. It would also allow people serving a sentence for certain cannabis-related acts to apply for resentencing or records expungement. New Jersey Public Question No. 1 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Amend the state constitution to legalize cannabis for personal, non-medical use by adults 21 and older. South Dakota Measure 26 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Establish a medical cannabis program and registration system for people with qualifying conditions. South Dakota Amendment A Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Legalize cannabis for all adults and require state legislators to adopt medical cannabis and hemp laws. Mississippi Ballot Measure 3 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Approve a new state flag design, after the state Legislature this summer retired its 1894 flag that featured a Confederate battle emblem. The new design was picked out of 3,000 options and features a magnolia flower surrounded by 20 stars, signifying the state\u2019s status at the 20th state. The flag also includes the words \u201cIn God We Trust,\u201d as required by law. Read more here. Oregon Measure 110 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Decriminalize the possession and personal use of all drugs and expand access to addiction assistance and other health services. Read more here. Puerto Rico ballot question Outcome: CNN has not made a projection. What it would do: Record voters\u2019 response to the question: \u201cShould Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?\u201d Statehood is ultimately in the hands of the US Congress. Rhode Island\u2019s State Question 1 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Strike \u201cand Providence Plantations\u201d from the state\u2019s official name. Read more here. Virginia Question 1 Outcome: CNN projects it to pass. What it will do: Make a redistricting commission \u2013 composed of eight members of the General Assembly and eight citizens \u2013 responsible for drawing congressional and state legislative districts. The General Assembly, without the governor, would vote on the districts but couldn\u2019t change them. The state Supreme Court would draw the districts if the redistricting commission failed to do so or the General Assembly didn\u2019t enact them. Under the current state Constitution, the General Assembly and the governor draw the new election districts for the US House of Representatives, the state Senate and the House of Delegates.

            "article_content": "Republican and former NFL player Burgess Owens will defeat Democratic incumbent Rep. Ben McAdams in Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District race, CNN projected Tuesday. McAdams\u2019 loss is at least the ninth one this month for House Democrats, who CNN has projected will retain majority control of the chamber. McAdams conceded the race Monday, saying in a video posted on YouTube that he had called Owens to congratulate him on winning \u201cthis hard-fought and close race.\u201d \u201cMy campaign was centered around a rejection of extremism and the need for leaders who will put the needs of the people they represent before any political party,\u201d the former mayor of Salt Lake County said. \u201cI am deeply humbled by the support I received from so many Utahns who share that vision and want them to know that while we did not prevail, I remain committed to that ideal.\u201d McAdams defeated then-Republican Rep. Mia Love in 2018, who had held the seat since 2015 after her historic win as the first black Republican woman elected to Congress. Owens, a staunch defender of President Donald Trump and a Fox News contributor, thanked Utah voters Monday night in a tweet and said, \u201cI\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to serve.\u201d \u201cI promise to be an open ear for all Utahns and to serve with all I have. Now, it\u2019s time to get to work,\u201d he wrote. He played for the New York Jets and later helped the Oakland Raiders win the Super Bowl Championship in 1981. The Republican campaigned to uphold conservative values, opposing abortion and vowing to protect American\u2019s Second Amendment rights and secure the borders. An internet archive of his campaign website in August showed that he supported a \u201cfull repeal\u201d of the Affordable Care Act and later the website said, \u201cObamacare no longer needs to be repealed, but changes are necessary in the current healthcare plan.\u201d When the change was brought up by McAdams during a debate in October, Owens acknowledged \u201ctweaking\u201d on the site and said he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions, noting that he is a prostate cancer survivor. Owens has opposed NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem to protest police brutality, saying during an interview with Sports Illustrated\u2019s JetCountry.com in June that if league commissioner Roger Goodell allowed Colin Kaepernick to be signed to a team and the kneeling to continue, \u201cI\u2019m willing to not watch the game.\u201d He also said the idea that the US is a systemically racist country is \u201cfalse\u201d and wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial in 2019 that the idea of reparations to Black Americans who are descendants of slavery \u201cdemeans America\u2019s founding ideals.\u201d Trump, who had endorsed Owens, congratulated him on Saturday before CNN called the race, tweeting, \u201cGreat going Burgess, you continue to be a STAR!\u201d Love also congratulated Owens, tweeting on Monday, \u201cHis integrity, leadership, selflessness, and honor are admirable.\u201d CNN has projected that Trump will win Utah, a state he also won in the 2016 presidential election. McAdams \u2013 who was one of 14 House Democrats in May who voted against the HEROES Act, a more than $3 trillion coronavirus relief package that he felt spent too much money \u2013 expressed to CNN in August that he was frustrated with the lack of an agreement with the White House on a coronavirus stimulus deal. During an October debate with Owens, McAdams called for both parties to come to the table and make a deal. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When it comes to health policy, President Donald Trump made it his mission to undo many measures his predecessor put in place. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to do the same. In their four years in office, the Trump administration made sweeping changes that affected the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, abortion and transgender rights, in many cases reversing the efforts of the Obama administration. Most of the measures were done through executive orders and regulation since it was tough to get any bills through Congress, particularly after the Democrats took control of the House after the 2018 midterm elections. How has the Affordable Care Act affected you? Share your story. Biden\u2019s health officials will likely be active, as well, but it will take time for all their actions to take effect. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a massive eraser pen. They\u2019ve got to go through the rule-making process,\u201d said Allison Orris, a former Obama administration official and counsel with Manatt Health, a professional services firm. \u201cThey are going to have to think about what comes first, second and third and be realistic about timing.\u201d Plus, the Biden administration may opt to keep and continue several Trump administration efforts, including shifting to value-based care, rather than paying doctors for every visit and procedure, and increasing access to telehealth, said Ian Spatz, senior adviser at Manatt. The two administrations also share common views on some measures to lower drug pricing, including basing Medicare payments on the cost of prescription medications in other countries and importing drugs from abroad. But Trump officials have not actually put these proposals in place. However, where the two administrations will differ significantly is messaging, Spatz said. While Trump focused on dismantling the Affordable Care Act, Biden will emphasize expanding the law and access to health coverage. Here are seven Trump health care measures the incoming Biden administration is expected to reverse. The Trump administration took the historic step in early 2018 of allowing states to require certain Medicaid recipients to work in order to receive benefits. Eight states have received approval, seven have pending requests and four had their waivers set aside in court, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, work requirements are not in effect in any state currently. The Supreme Court will decide on November 20 whether to consider a case challenging work requirements in Arkansas and New Hampshire. Biden\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary would be able to unwind the approvals, but it is a complicated task, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. The secretary would have to determine whether to withdraw permission for the entire waiver or just certain features. Goodbye and good riddance to Medicaid work requirement waivers. Several of these waivers included other provisions that could make it harder for low-income Americans to retain Medicaid coverage, such as lockouts for non-payment of premiums. And just before Election Day, the Trump administration approved Georgia\u2019s waiver that will allow the state to replace the federal Obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, with a private platform. While secretaries have the power to reverse waiver approvals, it isn\u2019t typical. More common is setting new guidelines for when a waiver comes up for renewal and for new applications. One executive order Trump repeatedly points to is expanding short-term health plans, which typically have lower premiums, but provide less comprehensive coverage and don\u2019t have to adhere to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The President has touted them as a less expensive alternative to Obamacare. In 2018, the administration allowed Americans to purchase these plans for just under a year, reversing the Obama administration\u2019s move that restricted their durations to only three months. \u201cThe short-term plans have important symbolic significance because they restrict coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, which was a prominent political issue in the campaign,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In its first year in office, the Trump administration slashed funds to promote Obamacare open enrollment and to assist consumers with selecting plans by 90% and 84%, respectively. Many Affordable Care Act advocates point to a lack of advertising as a reason why sign ups have slipped in recent years. Trump officials also cut the open enrollment period on the federal exchange to six weeks, half of what it was before. And during the pandemic, the President refused to open up a special enrollment period to allow the uninsured to select policies \u2013 despite insurers\u2019 and even several Republican governors\u2019 requests to do so. The Biden administration is expected to reverse all these measures to curtail Obamacare. Biden has promised to revoke the Trump administration rule barring federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions. Title X serves about 4 million people a year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. It provides funding for projects offering resources including contraception, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and preventive education and testing for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV \u2013 but not abortions. Last year, HHS moved to bar health care providers participating in the program from discussing abortion with patients or offering abortion referrals, prompting multiple federal court challenges resulting in blocks on the rule. In July 2019, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the court\u2019s prior ruling the rule to go into effect despite the ongoing challenge against it. The following month, the court denied Planned Parenthood\u2019s request to reverse its order, prompting the organization to withdraw from the program. The impact of the rule going into effect has been stark. About 900 clinics dropped out of the program by the start of 2020, according to a report by reproductive rights group Power to Decide, citing instances of more limited and expensive services. Additionally, after HHS opted to reassign relinquished Title X funds to other remaining participants, a Kaiser Family Foundation report found gaps in the new coverage. The American Medical Association, the main industry group for doctors, asked the Supreme Court last month to block the rule, citing conflicting rulings after the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court\u2019s block on the rule in September. Biden has vowed to reverse the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, which Trump reinstated and expanded during his tenure. The Trump administration reinstated the measure \u2013 which had previously impacted only family planning assistance \u2013 in 2017 by presidential memorandum and extended it to all applicable US global health funding under the \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance.\u201d Organizations that continued to promote or perform abortions stood to lose all US health aid under the policy \u2013 affecting more than 1,300 global health projects and an estimated $12 billion in US assistance in 2017-2018, according to the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. In September, the Trump administration advanced a proposed regulatory rule to further expand the ban, which already encompasses global health grants and cooperative agreements, to apply to contracts. The rule\u2019s 60-day comment period ended Friday. Based on data from 2013 through 2015, global health funding provided through contracts could account for almost 40% of all funding affected by the expanded rule, Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at Kaiser, said at the time. Initially put in place by the Reagan administration, the policy has been rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republican presidents, most recently retracted by the Obama administration in 2009. Even during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care. The Biden administration is also expected to reinstitute a directive that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. Medicaid funding does not cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is at risk, due to the Hyde Amendment dating back to 1976. In 2018, HHS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors rescinding a 2016 Obama administration directive from April 2016, which warned cuts to family planning providers would break federal law. Trump also signed a bill in 2017 allowing states to withhold federal money from organizations that provide abortion services, including Planned Parenthood. The Trump administration has been particularly hostile toward transgender Americans. Among its most criticized moves was an effort earlier this year to rollback an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender. A federal judge blocked the repeal this summer, ruling it violated a recent Supreme Court decision. Biden\u2019s website specifically refers to the effort and says he \u201cwill defend the rights of all people \u2013 regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity \u2013 to have access to quality, affordable health care free from discrimination.\u201d Biden\u2019s LGBTQ policy plan also says he will work to expand funding for mental health services for LGBTQ Americans and that his administration plans to automatically enroll low-income LGBTQ people in the public option, once it\u2019s created, if they live in rural areas in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden will win Georgia, CNN projected Friday, striking at the heart of what has been a Republican presidential stronghold for nearly three decades. The former vice president is the first Democratic nominee to triumph in Georgia since Bill Clinton did it in 1992. Biden\u2019s victory adds 16 electoral votes to his tally, bringing him to 306 \u2013 matching President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 total. With CNN\u2019s projection that Trump will win North Carolina, the final tally is 306-232, a landslide for the President-elect, who flipped five states and a congressional district in Nebraska from red to blue in 2020. The symmetry provides the President with yet another bitter pill to swallow. Trump has spent years tweeting and talking up his margin of victory against Hillary Clinton \u2013 one that has now been turned on its head in a final, national rebuke of his presidency. Map: See 2020 election results In Georgia, Trump had raced out to an early lead in the counting, but Biden surged ahead as the votes from Atlanta and its suburbs were tabulated. The Democratic ticket\u2019s historic success has been fueled by a grassroots organizing renaissance that rallied a rapidly diversifying electorate and suburbs that are, at once, growing and becoming increasingly inhospitable to Republican candidates. Georgia Republicans have compounded the issue, with state lawmakers refusing so far to expand Medicaid under Obamacare and Gov. Brian Kemp, in 2019, signed a so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d one of the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws. Biden\u2019s success in a traditionally Republican state is the culmination of slow, steady gains there by the party. Two years ago, Democrat Stacey Abrams fell narrowly short in her bid for governor, losing to Kemp by 1.4 percentage points. Her campaign, and the work she\u2019s done since then, has focused on bringing out Democratic voters who had stayed home in previous cycles. That set the stage for Biden, a moderate, to win big in the counties overlapping and outside Atlanta, a city at the heart of the New South. \u201cWe have been working at this for more than a decade. And there have been dozens of organizations and hundreds of people who\u2019ve made this their primary mission,\u201d Abrams told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper this week on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI have been privileged to be able to bring to bear resources, both before the election of 2018 and then the $40 million we were able to spend in 2018 to build a Democratic infrastructure that may not have yielded a victory for me in 2018, but certainly yielded a victory this week.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have been closing the gap on their Republican rivals in recent elections. But none had repeated Bill Clinton\u2019s feat from 28 years ago, when he defeated incumbent George H.W. Bush. Barack Obama came close. Hillary Clinton, in 2016, got closer. Biden completed the project. Sensing opportunity in the final days of the race, vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris, who was joined by Abrams, and Obama both visited the state. Apparently anxious over a shift toward Biden, Trump also touched down in Georgia on the weekend before Election Day. As Biden gained ground in the days after the election, so too did Democratic Senate challenger Jon Ossoff in his campaign to unseat Republican Sen. David Perdue. Neither ended up reaching a majority of all the votes, meaning both their race and the special election for the state\u2019s other Senate seat, are headed to runoffs on January 5. The results of those contests, Perdue against Ossoff in one race and Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock taking on GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler in the other, will determine which party holds the Senate majority next year. Democrats would need to win both to swing the numbers in their favor. Loeffler and Perdue, though, are facing the prospect of running without Trump on the ballot. Still, they are trying to grab on to his coattails by crediting his outrageous, bogus claims of mass voter fraud. The pair even called for the resignation of Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, who refused. Because the presidential race was so close, with Biden up by a little more than 14,000 votes, the state began an audit on Thursday morning. It is due to be completed next week. But the Trump campaign can, even if the margin is unchanged, request a subsequent hand recount.",

            "article_content": "The day after South Carolina\u2019s longtime Republican 1st District flipped blue in 2018, Nancy Mace\u2019s 9-year-old daughter had a question. \u201cHey mommy, when are we going to go after this seat?\u201d she asked Mace, who had just won reelection to the state House. Last week, Mace defeated Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham, becoming one of a record number of women who will serve in the 117th Congress \u2014 and a record number of Republican women who will serve in the House. With races still to be called, at least 141 women will serve in Congress next year, breaking the record of 127 set in 2019, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. That includes at least 116 women in the House \u2014 smashing the record of 102 also set in 2019 \u2014 and 25 in the Senate, although that number could shrink with California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 ascendancy to the vice presidency. The total in the House includes a woman from Iowa\u2019s 2nd District, where two women are running against each other, but because CNN has yet to call the race, it\u2019s not known which party will represent the district. Four of the nine Republican women in the Senate were vulnerable in this year\u2019s elections, but only Arizona Sen. Martha McSally was defeated, while appointed Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler\u2019s fate will be determined in a January runoff. The only non-incumbent woman elected to the Senate is a Republican: former Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. There will be at least six new women of color in Congress \u2014 four Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 including Democrats Cori Bush, who will be Missouri\u2019s first Black congresswoman, and Nikema Williams, who was elected to the late Rep. John Lewis\u2019 seat in Georgia. Based on the races CNN has called, there will be at least two more women of color overall than in the 116th Congress, for a total of 50 so far, in the 117th Congress. But the majority of the 24 non-incumbent women joining Congress in January are White, including 13 Republicans and five Democrats. At least 91 White women will serve in the 117th Congress, up from 79 this year. The upward trend in women overall in the House is a bipartisan story. Democratic women were largely responsible for flipping the House in 2018, setting a new record by electing 35 non-incumbent women. This year, though, it\u2019s Republican women who have made significant gains. After electing only one new Republican woman to the House in the midterms, Republicans this year have elected at least 15 non-incumbent women. That means the number of Republican women in the House will at least double. (Currently there are only 13 women in the House GOP conference, and two of them did not run for reelection.) Democrats are adding nine new women, which balances out those they lost to defeat and retirement, increasing their numbers to 89 for now. \u201cRepublican women are still going to be extremely underrepresented,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cThis year they were really making up for losses,\u201d she added, noting that this time two years ago, there were 23 GOP women. Whereas Democratic women have long been boosted by the pro-abortion rights group EMILY\u2019s List, which stands for \u201cEarly Money is Like Yeast,\u201d Republicans have lacked comparable infrastructure to invest in female candidates. There\u2019s also been an ideological opposition to playing in primaries, especially in any way that would invoke identity politics. That attitude, at least, began to shift after 2018, when New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who had recruited more than 100 women as head of recruitment for the House GOP campaign arm, only to see one of them win, publicly sounded the alarm. She relaunched her leadership PAC for the sole purpose of playing in primaries to help women, which the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee called \u201ca mistake\u201d at the time. But while the campaign committee still does not play in primaries, its leadership acknowledged it had to do better electing diverse candidates \u2014 rallying behind another woman, Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, as the head of recruitment for 2020 \u2014 and now proudly touting female candidates\u2019 success this year. But by far the biggest reason for that success is that more Republican women raised their hands to run than ever before \u2014 in part because they saw what Democratic women did in 2018 \u2014 and more of them won primaries, which has traditionally been the biggest hurdle. \u201cWomen around the country have watched other women before them be successful and realize, \u2018Hey, I can do it,\u2019\u201d said Iowa GOP Rep.-elect Ashley Hinson, who last week defeated Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer, one of the women who flipped a district in 2018. \u201cIt was the perfect storm. We had competitive seats that were winnable and we had incredible women in those districts with prior legislative experience and who knew how to put a campaign together,\u201d said Julie Conway, the executive director of VIEW (or Value in Electing Women) PAC, which has helped elect GOP women to Congress since 1997. Just as Democratic women were in 2018, Republican women this year were well-positioned to take advantage of a favorable environment. \u201cThe only way that could have happened was if it was a better-than-expected year for Republicans, right, and I think it was,\u201d Dittmar said of the gains GOP women were able to make. \u201cBeing the first Republican woman elected to Congress in the state of South Carolina is deeply humbling,\u201d Mace said. \u201cIt reminds me that Democratic women do not hold a monopoly on breaking glass ceilings.\u201d Even with women in Congress breaking records, they will likely represent just over a quarter of the legislative branch. Obstacles remain \u2014 both to women running and winning. Women candidates often receive questions their male colleagues do not \u2014 like who\u2019s going to take care of their kids. For Hinson, out door knocking in her Iowa district, that was a moment to reflect on why she was running in the first place. \u201cThe lady at the door, she thought I should be at home with my children. And I basically said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m setting a good example for them.\u2019\u201d The elected women agree the perspectives they bring to Congress are wanted \u2014 and needed. \u201cThey picked me this time, they know that I\u2019m a mom, I drive a minivan, you know, we have a regular life here in Iowa,\u201d said Hinson, a state representative and former journalist who thinks her communication skills will help her in Congress. Rep.-elect Carolyn Bourdeaux, the only Democrat who has so far flipped a competitive GOP-held district this year, won in the northeast Atlanta suburbs that are now the epicenter of the political battleground with the Senate majority hinging on two Georgia Senate seats. A professor and former budget director for the Georgia state Senate, Bourdeaux first ran two years ago, coming up 433 votes short in a recount against the GOP incumbent who decided not to run again in 2020. \u201cMany people here didn\u2019t even know that there were Democrats in their neighborhood,\u201d she said of the groundwork that that initial race laid. \u201cA lot of women were very much galvanized by Donald Trump, and their concerns over the direction of the country, and the loss of really basic rights \u2013 reproductive rights \u2013 that all of a sudden was on the ballot in a way that it was not before. So being a woman, I think, was helpful in speaking to those issues,\u201d Bourdeaux said. Mace, the South Carolina Republican, finds herself at the opposite end of the political spectrum, but she too feels strongly about bringing her perspective to the House. After dropping out of high school, she worked as a waitress at a Waffle House. In 1996, the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in a decision that required the Virginia Military Institute, a state-funded school, to accept women. \u201cThat decision literally changed my life,\u201d said Mace, who became the first woman to graduate from the Citadel. \u201cFreshman year at the Citadel was a lot like running for Congress,\u201d she said, noting the challenges and the significance of both achievements \u2013 and the way gender impacted her experience. \u201cI mean, you can be tough, but you can\u2019t be a B-I-T-C-H, right? There\u2019s a boundary there as a female candidate that you can only be so tough before you cross that line and people start judging you in a different way.\u201d As a state lawmaker, Mace earned headlines for speaking publicly about her own experience of rape when advocating for an amendment to an anti-abortion measure that would include exceptions for rape and incest. \u201cThe ability to stand up against members of your own party, even when it\u2019s leadership, especially now more than ever is more important to voters,\u201d Mace said. Many of the Republican women who won this year were in competitive districts. Republicans have flipped eight Democrat-held seats, according to CNN projections so far, and women have delivered all but one of those wins. That means they\u2019re likely to face difficult reelections in the future, possibly against Democratic women. That worries Conway of VIEW PAC, who fears that Democratic and Republican women will continue knocking each other out in the most competitive seats every two years. \u201cThe whole idea of having \u2018girl seats\u2019 does not get us any closer to parity,\u201d she said. A record 643 women ran for Congress in 2020 \u2014 583 for the House and 60 for the Senate. That\u2019s double the number of women who ran in 2016, though it has not yet translated to twice as many seats. That is in part because as more women run for office, they are also more often running against each other, both in primaries and general elections. In 2016, women ran against each other in 17 House and Senate general election races, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics. In 2020, that grew to 51 races with women challenging each other. Traditionally the surest way for Republican women to maintain and increase their ranks has been to elect more women in safe seats. At least five women won this year in seats rated Solid Republican by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, a CNN contributor. The answer? Encouraging even more women to run. \u201cI\u2019ve already gotten texts from other women who are interested in running here in Iowa since the election last week,\u201d said Hinson, who praised the mentoring she received from other women in elected office as well as from outside groups like Winning for Women and VIEW PAC, which, because of the pandemic, hosted regular Zoom calls with all of its endorsed candidates so they could get to know each other. (Hinson will continue to get to know her new colleagues virtually since a positive Covid-19 test is keeping her away from in-person new member orientation this week in Washington, DC.) But helping each other may not always come naturally, some said. \u201cWomen are far worse on other women than they are on their male colleagues,\u201d said Mace, reflecting on her experience at the Citadel, in business and in politics. \u201cWomen don\u2019t like to see other women be successful.\u201d \u201cI do feel like it\u2019s gotten better over the years, but I see it more often than not, and it\u2019s true on both sides of the aisle. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always encouraging women to run.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Democrats went into election night feeling good about expanding their majority, but haven\u2019t had the big gains they hoped for so far, with at least five Democrats in seats President Donald Trump won in 2016 losing and several top-targeted Republican seats remaining in GOP hands, according to CNN projections. Democrats failed to win one of their top pick-up opportunities in Texas\u2019 23rd District \u2013 one of the four remaining districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 that are currently represented by Republicans. Tony Gonzales defeated Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, who was running for the seat again after narrowly losing it in 2018, CNN projected Thursday. Democrats suffered losses in South Florida, where they may have been dragged down by Latino support for President Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. Republican Carlos Gim\u00e9nez, the Cuban American mayor of Miami-Dade County, defeated freshman Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, CNN projected Thursday. Mucarsel-Powell had flipped the district in 2018. As mayor, Gim\u00e9nez has had a high profile during the coronavirus pandemic and was widely regarded as one of the best GOP recruits of the election cycle. In the neighboring 27th District, Maria Elvira Salazar, a Cuban American journalist, defeated freshman Democratic Rep. Donna Shalala, who was health and human services secretary under President Bill Clinton. House Democrats were shell-shocked after they watched their party lose seats, meaning they are poised to hold a smaller majority in the next Congress despite the bullish predictions of party bosses in the run-up to the elections. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our act together, we\u2019re going to get creamed in 2022,\u201d one House Democratic member who asked for anonymity said on Tuesday. Republicans ousted Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn, whose upset victory in Oklahoma\u2019s 5th District was a major surprise in 2018 after Trump won the district in 2016. Democrats had hoped that the suburbs outside of Oklahoma City were moving away from Republicans, and the race remained close until the end with both sides pouring in money. But state Sen. Stephanie Bice returned the seat to GOP hands, a notable win for Republicans who have been hoping to increase the number of women in the GOP conference. Republicans will gain another woman in the conference with Michelle Fischbach\u2019s defeat of Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson. The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee represents the district Trump won by the largest margin of any held by a Democrat. An ideological outlier in his party (he voted against impeachment and opposes abortion rights), Peterson scored narrow victories against an underfunded challenger the past two cycles, but this year faced his strongest challenge in years. In Iowa, Republican Ashley Hinson defeated Democratic freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer in the 1st District, another seat Trump carried in 2016 but that Democrats had flipped in 2018. Another Republican woman, Yvette Herrell, knocked off freshman Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small in a rematch in New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District. Both seats are more rural than many of the suburban areas Democrats flipped in the midterms two years ago. Republicans also took back South Carolina\u2019s 1st District, the Charleston-area seat that Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham flipped in 2018 after GOP Rep. Mark Sanford \u2013 an outspoken Trump critic \u2013 lost in his primary earlier that year. While Republicans initially made this Trump district a top target, it had looked less competitive than some others leading up to Election Day. But state Rep. Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, puts it back in the Republican column, scoring another victory for GOP women. The GOP also held onto a number of seats in districts that Democrats had targeted this year and hoped to flip, even in suburban areas that had looked to be moving away from the President. Republican Rep. Ann Wagner, who was viewed as an embattled incumbent in the St. Louis suburbs, defeated Democratic challenger Jill Schupp in Missouri\u2019s 2nd District. In Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District, which CNN has projected for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Republican Rep. Don Bacon defeated Democratic opponent Kara Eastman in a rematch that was widely viewed as more competitive than their 2018 matchup. In Arkansas\u2019 2nd District, Republican Rep. French Hill, who faced a competitive fight for his seat in the Little Rock suburbs, defeated Democrat Joyce Elliott. And in Ohio, GOP Rep. Steve Chabot overcame a well-funded Democratic challenge in the 1st District. Democrats had high hopes for flipping Indiana\u2019s 5th District, just the kind of suburban area they thought was moving away from Republicans, despite backing the President by nearly 12 points in 2016. But Democrat Christina Hale came up short against Republican Victoria Spartz, who will succeed retiring GOP Rep. Susan Brooks in Congress. Republican Troy Nehls kept a Texas seat in GOP hands by defeating Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni in the 22nd District, an open seat that Democrats were targeting this year. When Lauren Boebert, a gun rights advocate who has claimed familiarity with the QAnon conspiracy, scored a surprising upset over GOP Rep. Scott Tipton in a Colorado primary earlier this year, it looked like this seat might be in play for Democrats. But Boebert won the 3rd District, keeping it in GOP hands. Redistricting had improved Democratic prospects in several North Carolina Districts. Democrats flipped two districts that had been redrawn to be much safer for them, with Deborah Ross winning the 2nd District and Kathy Manning winning the 6th District. But Democrats failed to flip the 8th District, where the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund had spent several million dollars to defend GOP Rep. Richard Hudson against Democrat Pat Timmons-Goodson, a former North Carolina Supreme Court justice. Republicans also held on in Virginia\u2019s 5th District, which initially was only expected to flip if Democrats were having a very good night. Still, the race had become increasingly competitive in the fast few weeks, with Democrat Cameron Webb \u2013 who would have been the first Black doctor elected as a voting member of Congress \u2013 far outraising Republican Bob Good, who had defeated the GOP incumbent at a party convention earlier this year. After Democrats won the House majority in 2018, Republicans planned to target Democratic lawmakers who flipped districts Trump had won in 2016. And when the House voted to impeach the President, Republicans vowed that moderate Democrats would pay a price at the ballot box. Democrats, however, were confident that the same health care message that carried them to victory in 2018 would resonate in 2020. With Trump\u2019s poll numbers sagging, amid the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing economic fallout, the political landscape appeared to favor Democrats in the weeks leading up to November 3, with top Democrats projecting confidence that their party would be in a strong position on election night. But on the heels of a better-than-expected night, Republicans said the gains they made and the seats they defended were a sign their strategy worked, despite many Democratic candidates outraising their own incumbents and challengers. \u201cOur message from day one was that the Democrats\u2019 radical socialist agenda is a threat to middle class Americans,\u201d GOP Rep. Tom Emmer, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cOur colleagues on the other side of the aisle and many of you laughed at us,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were criticized for our rhetoric \u2013 at times, I don\u2019t know, maybe some of you think that we were too aggressive,\u201d Emmer continued. Like the President, the NRCC early on tried to brand all Democrats as socialists, but the GOP House campaign committee had also come under criticism, even from some members of their own party, for going too far in mimicking the President\u2019s name-calling, calling New York Democratic Rep. Max Rose, for example, \u201cLittle Max Rose.\u201d \u201cMy background, on a hockey rink, told me that, like a campaign, there\u2019s not too aggressive,\u201d Emmer added. \u201cClearly the voters have agreed with us. And guess what? We\u2019ve focused on the most diverse class of Republican candidates in congressional history.\u201d Republicans have touted their efforts to increase diverse recruits this cycle, some of whom have already won according to CNN projections. At least 12 new Republican women will join the conference \u2013 an increase from after the 2018 midterms, when just one new GOP woman was part of the freshman class. That means that even with two of the 13 Republican women currently in the House retiring at the end of this year, they\u2019re set to see a net increase in 2021. Some Democrats told CNN the party needs to fine-tune its message and begin to push a stronger economic agenda \u2013 or risk losing the majority in the next elections. And others wanted a shake-up in leadership \u2013 namely for Rep. Cheri Bustos, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, to be ousted from her job. Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas said Bustos should step aside after the \u201cbloodbath\u201d the party endured since a number of freshman Democrats may stand to lose their races when the votes are all counted. Bustos is struggling to hang on to her own House seat in Illinois, as CNN has not made a projection in that tight race. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California appears secure in her leadership position despite second-guessing in the ranks, with no challengers yet emerging, lawmakers said. Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi in the past, told CNN on Wednesday he wouldn\u2019t do it again this time. Asked if he thought there should be any changes in leadership, Ryan declined to comment. \u201cI got enough scar tissue on those fights to last me a lifetime,\u201d he said. But Ryan said of the outcome in House races, \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people who are disappointed from top to bottom,\u201d while contending that the party should sharpen its economic message in an effort to appeal to working-class voters. \u201cWe have got to live and breathe in that economic space,\u201d Ryan said. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Voters in two states weighed in on abortion rights on Election Day. Louisiana voters decided to amend the state\u2019s constitution by adding language that expressly states the document offers no protections for a right to abortion or the funding of abortion, and Colorado voters rejected a ban on abortion beginning at 22 weeks of pregnancy, according to CNN projections. The results come as the national fight over the future of abortion law in the US intensifies, and Republicans deepened the conservative tilt of the US Supreme Court last month with the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump sparred on the topic in September, with the former vice president arguing that Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case legalizing abortion, was \u201con the ballot\u201d in 2020. Louisiana voters approved Proposed Amendment No. 1 by 62% to 38%, according to CNN projections. Should Roe be overturned, the amendment would prevent the state courts from declaring abortion restrictions unconstitutional at the state level. The state isn\u2019t the first to amend its constitution this way \u2013 Alabama and West Virginia did so in 2018, as did Tennessee in 2014. The Louisiana ballot measure marked another attempt by the state to restrict abortion. The US Supreme Court struck down in June a Louisiana restriction barring doctors from performing the procedure unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and a decision from a federal appellate court prevented the state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion ban, passed last year, from going into effect. \u201cWe are just so thankful, so happy that women and babies can be supported in this state,\u201d said Angie Thomas, associate director of the Louisiana Right to Life. \u201cWe are really dedicated to moving into a next chapter, which will be where abortion becomes unthinkable because every woman has enough support and love,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cif Roe v. Wade is overturned, then this state is certainly ready to become a pro-life state.\u201d Michelle Erenberg, executive director of Lift Louisiana, a reproductive rights non-profit that\u2019s part of a coalition against the amendment, told CNN that Tuesday\u2019s \u201cresult is deeply disappointing, but this feeling of sadness is temporary.\u201d \u201cAnyone or any organization in Louisiana who fights for reproductive freedom knows that these are hard battles to win,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut we keep fighting because women \u2013 not just those of means but all women and all people who can become pregnant \u2013 deserve the basic right of bodily autonomy and high quality reproductive healthcare, which includes abortion.\u201d In Colorado, voters rejected Proposition 115 by a 59% to 41% vote, according to CNN projections. It would have banned abortion beginning at 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure included exceptions to save the life of the pregnant woman but not for instances of rape or incest. Doctors who continue to perform abortions at 22 weeks would have faced a fine up to $5,000. The results maintain Colorado as one of seven states that do not bar some abortions past a specific point in pregnancy, according to data from the abortion-rights research group the Guttmacher Institute. Data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s office shows that women from more than 30 states have traveled to Colorado to access abortions. \u201cWe\u2019re all sighing a breath of relief this evening,\u201d said Karen Middleton, executive director of the reproductive rights group Cobalt, which was part of a coalition formed in the spring to fight the proposed restrictions. \u201cI am grateful that Colorado voters have once again said no to intrusion on decisions about abortion access,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cColorado will continue to remain a safe haven for people to access abortion care in a moment where we don\u2019t know what might happen at the Supreme Court.\u201d Middleton added, \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this margin helps slow down the idea that they should be running these measures in other states.\u201d Giuliana Day, one of the measure\u2019s co-sponsors, said Tuesday that she was \u201cjust full of gratitude \u2013 it\u2019s been an incredible experience, and the people in Colorado have been so gracious in having these conversations.\u201d \u201cThe results were not exactly what we were expecting, but still, as a community we came together, and we raised awareness about such a critical issue,\u201d she said, adding that she was grateful for \u201call the people and the volunteers that worked so hard for this proposition.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still going to keep fighting,\u201d Day said, calling her cause \u201cthe human rights issue of our lifetime.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. David Perdue could not have thought his campaign would end like this. With more than 3.8 million people having already voted in Georgia, the Republican is in a dead heat with a Democratic opponent less than half his age, in a state represented by conservatives for decades. Republicans now fear that the state\u2019s two Senate seats are in danger of flipping, amid changing demographics, party infighting and President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity during the coronavirus pandemic. In the final days of the campaign, Perdue is acting like a candidate on the run. He abruptly pulled out of a high-stakes debate scheduled for Sunday, choosing to instead campaign with Trump. On TV, Perdue is pumping big bucks into ads defending himself from attacks that he sought to profit off the coronavirus crisis. And he has faced criticism from Democrats for mocking Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 first name at a Trump rally, which his campaign said was a simple mispronunciation, even though they have served in the Senate together for three years. Perdue has warned for months that the state is up for grabs. But the first-term senator is increasingly showing signs of frustration in the final weeks of the campaign. As he barnstorms the state on his campaign bus \u2013 with his picture next to the slogan, \u201cThe Original Outsider\u201d \u2013 Perdue has offered scant details about his whereabouts to the press. After CNN learned that he was appearing in a parking lot in this small town in central Georgia, his supporters tried to physically block a reporter from asking questions, while putting signs up in front of a photographer\u2019s camera to try to prevent him from shooting the event. These Senate and House races have become more competitive for Democrats in final sprint to Election Day When asked why he wasn\u2019t disclosing his schedule to the press, Perdue declined to explain. \u201cThat\u2019s a campaign question,\u201d he told CNN. Perdue didn\u2019t respond to another question on whether he regretted mispronouncing Harris\u2019 name, criticized Democrat Jon Ossoff as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the Democratic agenda, and stepped onto his bus. This week, Ossoff attacked Perdue in personal terms, telling CNN that the senator\u2019s butchering of Harris\u2019 name was \u201cunquestionably\u201d racist. In their second and final debate on Wednesday evening, Perdue, a 70-year-old former Fortune 500 CEO, dismissed Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, for not knowing how to create or keep a job. Ossoff called the senator a \u201ccrook\u201d who was \u201cfending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading\u201d while attacking \u201cthe health of the people\u201d that he represents. Perdue snapped back that the Democrat had worked for \u201cthe mouthpiece of terrorism and Communist China\u201d \u2013 claims Ossoff called \u201cridiculous.\u201d At the end of the debate, Perdue was asked if there was anything he wanted to correct in this campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough time,\u201d said Perdue. Republicans in Georgia are facing a perfect storm that puts the White House and its two GOP-held Senate seats at risk. Trump is historically unpopular. The state\u2019s suburbs are becoming more diverse. The Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination of Joe Biden, the epitome of the establishment, has stifled the GOP cry that socialism is invading America. The coronavirus pandemic tanked the economy, Trump botched the response, and the state prefers Biden to handle the crisis, according to a Monmouth University poll. The other Senate race in Georgia, featuring an intraparty feud between appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler and GOP Rep. Doug Collins, has also damaged the Republican brand. Loeffler and Collins have tried to outdo each other in touting their ties to Trump in a state where he is less popular than he was four years ago. And they have bashed each other as insufficiently conservative, potentially weakening whoever makes it to a January runoff election against Rev. Raphael Warnock, the leading Democratic candidate. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip, one week from Election Day Some Republicans in Washington predicted Collins\u2019 entry into the race would hurt the party. In private conversations earlier this year, top Senate Republicans warned the White House about the risks of a contested race for Loeffler\u2019s seat. But White House officials made clear that convincing Trump to help clear the field would fall on deaf ears because the President thought he would resoundingly win the state, which he believed would help down-ticket Georgia Republicans, according to a source familiar with the discussions. But Republicans in these Georgia Senate races are now all neck and neck with their Democratic opponents, who outraised them in the last financial quarter. Republicans have had to spend heavily on the two Senate races \u2013 over $100 million \u2013 compared to over $69 million from Democrats, according to Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has spent more in Georgia than in any other state. \u201cObviously the situation is complicated by having two Republicans in the race,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Thune told CNN. \u201cIt would have been nice if (Collins) had sort of allowed Loeffler to have a clear field there. But that\u2019s not the way it worked out.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee has accused Collins of putting his personal ambition ahead of preserving a seat central to the Senate majority. In an interview, the congressman pushed back on that accusation. \u201cI\u2019d ask them to actually figure out how to get outside the Beltway and come understand Georgia, and that\u2019s what the issue (is) here,\u201d Collins told CNN outside a Steak \u2018n Shake in Dublin, Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019re not putting this seat in jeopardy.\u201d Collins\u2019 race is a special election without a primary. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who appointed Loeffler to the seat, resisted efforts to create one. Instead, all candidates are on the ballot on Tuesday \u2014 and the top two finishers will go to a January runoff if no one reaches the 50% threshold. Since Collins and Loeffler are competing to get into the runoff, they are courting conservatives and Trump supporters rather than the swing voters who will ultimately decide the winner. Georgia senator 'not familiar' with Trump Access Hollywood tape Loeffler has tried to portray herself as the true Trump loyalist, boasting of a \u201c100 percent\u201d pro-Trump voting record. She has refused to criticize the President, even when asked about his past comments bragging of sexual assault, saying she wasn\u2019t familiar with the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. She recently announced the support of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative House candidate who promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory and made a string of bigoted comments, but whom Trump has called a \u201cfuture Republican star.\u201d Loeffler has even taken on her own WNBA team, the Atlanta Dream, over the players\u2019 support of Black Lives Matter. The senator dismissed concerns that she was turning off moderate voters in an interview, saying she had the \u201cmomentum in this campaign.\u201d When asked if she would disavow QAnon, Loeffler said: \u201cYes, I disavow it. I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d Trump, of course, is in part to blame for putting Perdue\u2019s and Loeffler\u2019s seats at risk. He won the state by five points in 2016, but is now even with Biden in the polls. The coronavirus has killed about 8,000 people and infected over 358,000 in Georgia, giving voters a reason to yearn for change. But neither Collins nor Loeffler has criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t quibble,\u201d Collins said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t go back and forth with him on his response, I think he said what he believes, and I think we\u2019re seeing that actually played out in America.\u201d View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Collins, who led the Republican defense of Trump during the House impeachment, has forced Loeffler at this late stage of the campaign to continue focusing on the party\u2019s base voters rather than those in the middle. The senator told CNN on Wednesday that there are \u201cno\u201d issues on which she disagreed with the President. Biden is strong enough in the state that neither Warnock nor Ossoff could describe how they would differ from him, but both expressed in interviews a willingness to be independent. \u201cI\u2019m running against somebody who said that she\u2019s 100% with Donald Trump. I think that\u2019s a bizarre thing for anybody running for the Senate to say,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cI\u2019m 100% with the people of Georgia.\u201d Late last year, Kemp appointed Loeffler to fill the seat left by Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned over health concerns. Loeffler, who is married to New York Stock Exchange CEO Jeff Sprecher, was an appealing choice because she could self-fund her campaign in 2020 and when the seat is up for reelection in 2022, as well as potentially play to the diversifying suburbs, especially women voters. Loeffler and Sprecher have spent over $20 million on her Senate race this year. But instead of trying appeal to those moderate suburban voters, she\u2019s locked in a race to the right. Collins has attacked Loeffler for strongly backing Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential campaign, and for co-owning the Dream, which partnered with Planned Parenthood for an event a couple years ago. Loeffler has retorted that she has been endorsed by a number of prominent anti-abortion groups and \u201cwill always defend innocent life.\u201d In her speech in Buford, Georgia, Loeffler repeatedly criticized Collins, trying to tie him to Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling him \u201cone of the most liberal Republicans in the US House of Representatives.\u201d The event was held indoors with roughly 70 people \u2013 many of whom were maskless \u2013 and in defiance of state rules prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people. Collins, who has criss-crossed the state and held gatherings with pockets of voters, has been unsparing in his criticism of Loeffler, characterizing her as a fake conservative. \u201cIt seems like Senator Loeffler is trying to make it sound like I have a moderate voting record, which nobody will actually believe,\u201d he told CNN. Collins brought up Loeffler\u2019s stock trades ahead of the market downtown, which drew scrutiny because she was privately briefed by the administration on the coronavirus outbreak before the market nosedived. He noted that Loeffler had criticized his career as a defense attorney. \u201cShe got accused of insider stock trading,\u201d said Collins. \u201cI guess attorneys are good at that point. Aren\u2019t they, Senator Loeffler?\u201d The candidates are planning for the race to head to a runoff election in January, since no one is likely to surpass 50% of the vote. Collins told a crowd in Dublin that when he comes back around Christmas he likes \u201ccranberry sauce with a little berries inside.\u201d He added, \u201cCan y\u2019all make sure we have something?\u201d Unlike the divide between the Republicans, Democrats have been campaigning as a unity ticket, with both Ossoff and Warnock appearing together along with the rapper Common at an outdoor event with masked supporters in the Atlanta suburbs. The strategy could be particularly effective for a Georgia electorate sharply defined by race. Around 30% is Black, which is overwhelmingly liberal, and over 60% is White, which is overwhelmingly Republican. The police killing of George Floyd again inserted the issue of racial justice into the Senate campaigns. Over the summer, Loeffler sparked a backlash when she wrote to WNBA commissioner that she \u201cadamantly\u201d opposed the Black Lives Matter movement. Some players wore t-shirts that said, \u201cVote Warnock.\u201d While Loeffler has campaigned on standing with law enforcement, and bashing the defund the police movement, the Democrats have aligned themselves with Black Lives Matter. At the Jonesboro rally, Ossoff noted that Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old Black man, was fatally shot this year while jogging in his state, making \u201ca mockery of equal protection under the law.\u201d Former state House of Representatives Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who ran for governor in 2018, has led voter registration efforts aimed at those who she says have been targeted by voter suppression efforts, particularly people of color. But the effort has also drawn in new transplants, and young people, who the state began to automatically register in 2016 when they apply for a driver\u2019s license. The population of Latinos and Asians has also swiftly increased; Between 2017 and 2018, Forsyth County \u2013 north of Atlanta \u2013 saw the fastest-growing Asian population of any US county with more than 20,000 people. In 2018, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath flipped a House seat in the northwest Atlanta suburbs for the first time in 40 years, and Democrats are aiming to flip another seat northeast of the city in 2020. Dr. Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, said that almost half of the new voters are under 35, and that almost two-thirds are people of color. Georgia has a record 7.6 million registered voters, a million more than it had in 2016 and about 1.6 million more than in 2014, when Perdue first ran for the Senate, according to Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State office. At the Slutty Vegan restaurant on Tuesday, Ossoff told CNN that \u201cthe whole world is watching Georgia.\u201d \u201cThis is the top battleground state in the country,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "She is only 48 and could easily serve more than three decades on the Supreme Court. But no matter how long Justice Amy Coney Barrett sits on the bench, the conditions under which she started are not likely to fade soon from the nation\u2019s memory. Barrett begins her Supreme Court tenure one week before Election Day after a rushed appointment and amid controversy from risky White House ceremonies. She faces a raft of voting-related appeals, along with a notable absence of bond-building rituals with colleagues because of Covid-19. That complex dynamic is likely to shape Barrett\u2019s immediate image in the public eye and perhaps influence how she approaches cases and the eight other justices. Supreme Court rejects Democratic attempt to extend Wisconsin mail-in voting deadline Her Senate vote of 52-48 was one of the closest in history and her benefactor, Donald Trump, is one of the most divisive presidents ever. Barrett\u2019s appointment, to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was pushed through the Republican-controlled Senate in a mere month. Her sheer presence on a new 6-3, conservative-liberal bench could transform the law in America for a generation, affecting abortion and religious rights, LGBTQ protections, and the scope of federal regulatory control over the environment, workplace safety and consumer protection. And Trump made it plain that he wanted Barrett in place quickly because the high court could decide a crucial case or cases that would affect the outcome of the election between him and former vice president Joe Biden. Already, several challenges to voting rules in key states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina are pending before the court. On Monday night, Trump praised Barrett\u2019s \u201csterling character\u201d and \u201cimpeccable credentials.\u201d \u201cJustice Barrett made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written not legislate from the bench,\u201d Trump said. Barrett will complicate John Roberts' goal of keeping the Supreme Court out of politics In turn, Barrett vowed to be fair and independent. \u201cThe oath that I have solemnly taken tonight means at its core that I will do my job without any fear or favor and that I will do so independently of both the political branches and of my own preferences,\u201d Beyond election disputes in upcoming days, Barrett will confront immediate cases over the future of the Affordable Care Act and 2020 census practices that would affect the allocation of congressional seats. Guests at Monday night\u2019s investiture were required to wear masks to help protect against the coronavirus. A month earlier, as Trump first unveiled the Barrett nomination in a Rose Garden ceremony, such precautions were absent, and at least a dozen attendees were infected by the virus. Justice Clarence Thomas, a fellow conservative, administered the constitutional oath of office to Barrett. And his appearance without Chief Justice John Roberts and the full contingent of associate justices marked a contrast from 2018 when all sitting justices attended the White House investiture for the newly confirmed Brett Kavanaugh. Trump\u2019s remarks throughout the Kavanaugh investiture stoked some justices\u2019 usual resistance to participate in such White House-organized investitures. Trump began that October 2018 event by boasting of the full court\u2019s presence and then publicly apologizing \u201con behalf of our nation\u201d to Kavanaugh for \u201cterrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure.\u201d Trump was referring to the accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers in suburban Maryland. Kavanaugh denied the accusations. White House holds swearing-in ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett Traditionally, justices\u2019 swearings-in were held at the Supreme Court, and in recent decades the justices struggled with how to respond to presidential invitations. They are loath to be props for a president but do not want to appear to insult a new colleague. Justice John Paul Stevens, who died last year, wrote in his 2011 book, Five Chiefs, that he was particularly put off at the Ronald Reagan White House ceremony for Anthony Kennedy in 1988. \u201c(T)he president participated with remarks that welcomed his new appointee as a judge who would follow the law rather than make it up. I thought the president\u2019s remarks were both offensive and inappropriate and therefore decided not to attend similar ceremonies at the White House in the future.\u201d But Stevens said he overcame his unwillingness in 2005 to swear in Roberts as chief justice at the George W. Bush White House. Stevens was the senior justice at the time, and he \u201cconcluded that a refusal to participate would have been widely misinterpreted as manifesting disapproval of his appointment.\u201d Mixing with the President and his supporters could be especially fraught on the eve of the election. Filings in state ballot disputes have been arriving daily on the justices\u2019 doorstep, as Republicans and Democrats jockey for advantage in the November 3 election, largely over state measures related to the pandemic, for example, extending deadlines for mail-in ballots. Trump's taxes, election and abortion cases await Amy Coney Barrett in her first week The cases have exposed deep fissures among the justices. Shortly before the White House investiture began, in fact, the (still) eight-member Supreme Court ruled along bitter ideological lines in a Wisconsin election case. The justices by a 5-3 vote rejected a lower court order, supported by Wisconsin Democrats, to allow mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to six days after the election. In the majority were Roberts, Thomas, Kavanaugh and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. They faulted the district court judge who extended the deadline for intervening as Roberts wrote, \u201cin the thick of election season.\u201d Dissenting were liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Writing for those dissenters and referring to other Supreme Court action rejecting pandemic-related measures, Kagan said, \u201cAs the COVID pandemic rages, the Court has failed to adequately protect the Nation\u2019s voters.\u201d Still pending, and likely to be reviewed by a new Justice Barrett, are cases from other battleground states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Last week, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on an emergency request from Pennsylvania Republicans related to deadline extensions for mail-in ballots. As the case returns, the possibility exists that Barrett could break that tie to side with the GOP challengers. Barrett will be able to assume her duties on cases Tuesday after Roberts administers the judicial oath, a private event scheduled to occur at the Supreme Court. (The constitutional oath, administered by Thomas on Monday, is taken by all federal officials.) Under the text of the judicial oath, a new member of the bench promises to \u201cadminister justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich.\u201d A court spokeswoman said on Monday that the usual courtroom ceremonies for a new appointee would occur at a future date. The building has been closed to the public since March, and most justices have been working remotely, some far from Washington. For the newest justice, the atmosphere surrounding Covid-19 will likely mean postponement of the other rituals and personal gestures within the columned structure that usually foster relationships among the nine. Amy Coney Barrett was grilled on these election issues Roberts, for example, took new Justice Kagan on a private tour of the court\u2019s inner chambers in 2010. He began with the robing room, where the nameplate of Kagan\u2019s predecessor (Justice Stevens) was still on one of the nine individual wooden lockers. When they returned, Roberts had made sure her nameplate was affixed to her new locker. The justices usually hold a \u201cwelcome\u201d dinner for their newest member: in 1991, when Thomas joined, it was a black-tie affair, with Justice Antonin Scalia taking charge of the details; in 2006, when Alito came on, colleagues arranged an appearance by Phillie Phanatic, mascot of Alito\u2019s favorite baseball team. Postponement of such customs may be no small thing in an institution that runs on tradition and bonds of community and that retired justice once described as having its own \u201clanguage and ethic and etiquette.\u201d Yet whatever loss Barrett may feel, her colleagues would share it. Some justices said through this spring and summer that they missed the structured routines, the handshakes before their conference sessions and the lunches together after morning oral arguments. They have been hearing cases via teleconference. They have been also holding their private justices-only sessions, where they decide which appeals to take up and vote on cases already heard, by telephone, too. That alone eliminates one notable role of the junior justice. By tradition, the newest associate justice is responsible for opening the conference-room door when someone knocks to deliver a requested reference book or a forgotten pair of reading glasses. The junior justice is also responsible for taking notes of court business at these sessions. It is not known whether Barrett will be initially absolved from such note-taking duties during the telephone conferences. She will, however, win a reprieve of one of the traditional junior-justice tasks until the pandemic subsides, membership on the cafeteria committee. The cafeteria is closed.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. It\u2019s E-7 to the Covid election. There are staggering numbers to report on both American voters and American Covid patients as the country hurtles toward an election and into a Covid surge. Days to election: 7 as of Tuesday Election ballots already cast: > 60.7 million More people have voted already with a week left until Election Day than voted early in all of 2016. Read more. Covid infections, 7-day average: 68,767 It\u2019s the most infections the US has ever had in that time period. Full stats. Frightening state-specific Covid stories: Utah ICUs may have to ration care In El Paso, they\u2019re moving Covid patients to a children\u2019s hospital after calling for additional refrigeration at morgues. The spike in infections is not from testing \u2013 Trump continues to say (like he did in Pennsylvania today) the spike is because of increased testing. That\u2019s either a lie or ignorance. How could it be ignorance at this point? CNN\u2019s fact check here. Stunning admission \u2013 White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union the White House isn\u2019t even trying to contain Covid at this point. They\u2019re just waiting for a vaccine. Watch it. Mandate masks - First Dr. Anthony Fauci over the weekend and now former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb have called for more consideration of a national mask mandate. Vaccine timeline \u2013 Expect a vaccine in December, but no wide availability \u2018til next spring. That\u2019s been a pretty consistent guess from experts. Political timeline \u2013 Reminder: President Donald Trump will be in office for more than two months after Election Day so, regardless of what voters choose, there\u2019s unlikely to be forceful Covid leadership at the national level during this fall surge. So will it be a mandate for masks or a mandate against requiring them? We\u2019ll see. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spent the better part of the last few years either blocking Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominees or jamming Donald Trump\u2019s through. He seems to understand that Senate majorities and presidencies are subject to the fickle whims of those frustrating voters, while the federal judiciary, and in particular the Supreme Court, jobs last a lifetime. With that in mind, I think there are two ways to view this quote from Sunday\u2019s procedural vote that guaranteed Amy Coney Barrett a Supreme Court seat. The quote: \u201cWe\u2019ve made an important contribution to the future of this country,\u201d McConnell told his colleagues. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019ve done over the last four years will be undone, sooner or later, by the next election. Won\u2019t be able to do much about this, for a long time to come.\u201d What \u201cnext election\u201d probably means to McConnell: He probably meant to be oblique, referring to the next election (and a change in power?) as something that will either happen now or later. What \u201cnext election\u201d actually sounds like: But the way he phrased it sure made it sound like he\u2019s not very optimistic about retaining at least some Republican foothold on power come January. What will be undone? Separately, he talks as if there\u2019s been a massive number of GOP accomplishments. The biggest, by far, piece of legislation he could be referring to is the GOP tax cut bill. Democrats will have their eye on undoing some of those tax cuts, which Republicans enacted without any eye to balancing the budget. Democrats will try to use the proceeds to enact new programs. But I digress. A reference to current events: The other interesting element here is that he\u2019s arguing Democrats won\u2019t be able to change the GOP-nominated majority (now 6-3!) on the court for a long time to come. McConnell is a man who pays attention, so there\u2019s zero chance he\u2019s not read in on this idea that Democrats could move to change the size of the Supreme Court and dilute the GOP-nominated majority, something Republicans are banking on motivating their voters in the future. My interpretation of McConnell\u2019s line here is: Bring it. But again, McConnell seems to be eying the next election as much as this one. A win. But for what? The last thing I\u2019ll point out is the extreme tribalism of McConnell\u2019s comment. The court should not, in his view, represent the values of a changing country. It should represent the conservative values McConnell likes \u2013 the longer the better. In the us vs. them game in his head, he just won big, regardless of what happens to his majority next week. An election of margins \u2013 Even small-seeming shifts are going to be extremely important when the country is this split and the coronavirus has voters on edge. Faith Karimi talked to Black voters in Georgia and around the country about why they appear to be turning out in stronger numbers than four years ago. Read her report. Democrats\u2019 early vote advantage narrows \u2013 CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen has looked at data from Catalist over the past week and found the edge for registered Democrats in early voting has narrowed. Note: There\u2019s no guarantee a registered Democrat or Republican voted for Trump or Biden, so this is not hard stuff. What\u2019s the data? Over the past week, the Democratic advantage has dropped by 13 points in Nevada, 12 points in Florida, 11 points in North Carolina, 7 points in Colorado and 5 points in Pennsylvania, according to voting data from Catalist. Democrats also saw smaller drops in Arizona and Iowa. A smaller lead is still a lead. Democrats are still ahead in those states. In Nevada, about 44% of all votes cast so far are from registered Democrats, and only 33% from Republicans. The gap is even more substantial in Pennsylvania, where Democrats currently make up about 70% of all ballots already cast. What\u2019s it mean for the campaigns? Democratic leads mean Biden\u2019s campaign can fine-tune its mobilization operation and focus on voters that haven\u2019t cast ballots yet. Trump\u2019s campaign will therefore face a heavier lift next week to get behemoth turnout on Election Day, experts say, and there could be other variables at play, like bad weather or long lines that discourage voting. Will this year break turnout records? There are, even in high turnout years, a shocking number of eligible Americans who don\u2019t vote. The high water marks (1964 >63% and 1908 > 65%) are still well below 70% participation. There\u2019s a lot to suggest this year\u2019s turnout will eclipse the 60.1% we saw in 2016. Why are people more engaged? Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza: People believe now \u2013 more than in recent memory \u2013 that a) there are major differences between the two major parties and b) the identity (and party) of the election winner will have a profound effect on the future of the country. Read more. Ballots facing rejection \u2013 CNN\u2019s Curt Devine reports: Thousands of mail-in ballots in Florida could be thrown out due to missing or mismatched signatures, and ballots from Black and Hispanic voters make up a disproportionate level of those affected, according to data obtained and analyzed by Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. As of Sunday, 14,863 vote-by-mail ballots had been flagged for rejection in Florida \u2013 nearly .5% of all mail-in-ballots cast in Florida so far, Smith told CNN. Reminder: 112,911 votes, or about 1.2%, separated Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in Florida in 2016. 18 US states require voters to be contacted if there\u2019s an issue with their mail-in ballot. Check your state here. Floridians have until two days after the election to \u201ccure\u201d those issues by correcting mismatched or missing signatures. Disparity in ballot rejection \u2013 Black and Hispanic voters have had .7% of their returned mail-in ballots flagged, compared to .3% from white voters, according to Smith. Young voters are even more disproportionately affected \u2013 18- to 23-year-olds have had 1.2% of their mail-in ballots marked for potential rejection. \u201cMost represent ballots cast by eligible voters\u2014voters who would very likely have their ballots count had they voted in person\u2014that are rejected for a technical issue,\u201d Smith said. Few cures so far \u2013 Orange County, Florida, Supervisor of Elections Bill Cowles told CNN on Friday that only 357 ballots out of 1,685 ballots that have faced rejection in his county for signature issues have been cured. He said if ballots have signature errors, his office \u201cimmediately\u201d reaches out to the voters who cast them based on the contact information they provided, so he doesn\u2019t understand why some voters don\u2019t promptly cure their ballots. \u201cThey are getting multiple contacts from this office encouraging them to do it.\u201d Benefits outweigh risks \u2013 Mark Earley, supervisor of elections for Leon County, Florida \u2013 which includes Tallahassee \u2013 said that although he recognizes the number of rejections statewide can potentially be significant, he believes the benefits of mail-in ballots vastly outweigh the risks of signature-related rejections. Earley said vote-by-mail \u201chelps the turnout much more than it potentially disenfranchises.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really tired of people saying this is a big threat to vote-by-mail\u2026 The fractions are so minute,\u201d Earley added. \u201cMore people probably get a flat tire driving to the polls.\u201d There\u2019s officially (or about to be, depending on when you read this) a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett. She\u2019ll be sworn in Monday night by Justice Clarence Thomas and apparently be feted at the White House, despite the odd optics of soon potentially taking up election-related cases and the odd history of the fact that the White House even announcing her nomination was a Covid super-spreader moment. Vice President Mike Pence had to skip her confirmation vote due to the Covid outbreak in his office. Cases she\u2019ll immediately face \u2013 From CNN\u2019s digital live experience: Trump taxes case: The justices are primed to decide soon whether a New York prosecutor will get access to Trump\u2019s financial documents from January 2011 to August 2019, including his tax returns. Pennsylvania ballot extensions: Republicans in Pennsylvania asked the Supreme Court on Friday to block a ballot receipt extension that would allow them to be counted if they are received within three days of Election Day \u2014 even if they do not have a legible postmark. Minnesota congressional election date: A Republican candidate for Minnesota\u2019s 2nd Congressional District is asking the justices to intervene in a case concerning whether his election takes place on November. 3 or on February 9, after the recent death of Legal Marijuana Now Party candidate Adam Weeks caused the contest to be moved to next year as required by state law. Mississippi abortion case: As abortion rights backers and opponents spar over whether Barrett\u2019s confirmation would mean the end of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision, the justices will consider Friday whether to hear a case that could directly consider the precedent. The case pertains to Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, which Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law in 2018. The law made exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there\u2019s a \u201csevere fetal abnormality,\u201d but not for incidents of rape or incest. A federal judge in Mississippi struck down the law in November 2018, and the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling late last year. Republicans have attacked Democratic calls to expand the size of the Supreme Court as court \u201cpacking.\u201d But they\u2019ve embraced it in a number of states to suit their political needs.

            "article_content": "Amy Coney Barrett is preparing to join the Supreme Court as the justices are ready to take action on a number of important petitions before them, including several related to next week\u2019s election. Barrett will solidify a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court and will be able to participate in the court\u2019s action on the petitions, potentially giving Republican litigants an additional ally as the justices review the various requests. Here is a look at the major petitions awaiting Barrett: The justices are primed to decide soon whether a New York prosecutor will get access to Trump\u2019s financial documents from January 2011 to August 2019, including his tax returns. Last July, the Supreme Court, voting 7-2, rejected the President\u2019s broad claims of immunity from a state criminal subpoena seeking his tax returns and said that as president he was not entitled to any kind of heightened standard unavailable to ordinary citizens. The justices sent the case back to the lower court so that the President could make more targeted objections regarding the scope of the subpoena. Trump\u2019s lawyers told the lower courts that the subpoena was overbroad and issued in bad faith, but the courts once again rejected those arguments. Senate to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee a week ahead of Election Day An appellate court ruled earlier this month that \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that these are anything but run-of-the-mill documents typically relevant to a grand jury investigation into possible financial or corporate misconduct.\u201d Trump\u2019s personal lawyers then took the case back to the Supreme Court, urging the justices to put the lower court ruling on hold while the justices considered whether to take up the appeal. If the justices deny the request, the subpoena can go forward although the documents will be shielded from public release because of grand jury secrecy rules. Republicans in Pennsylvania asked the Supreme Court on Friday to block a ballot receipt extension that would allow them to be counted if they are received within three days of Election Day \u2013 even if they do not have a legible postmark. The lawyers acknowledged in the brief that the Supreme Court was divided 4-4 on an emergency stay request on the issue last week, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the liberals to allow the extension. It takes five justices to grant the Republicans\u2019 request, making Barrett\u2019s vote critical in the new request. The GOP is now asking the justices to formally take up the case, put it on an expedited schedule and decide the issue before Election Day. Barrett will complicate John Roberts' goal of keeping the Supreme Court out of politics \u201cBecause the election is imminent, these questions must be answered immediately. Absent quick action by this Court, Petitioner\u2019s appellate rights \u2013 as well as this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the case \u2013 could be lost,\u201d lawyers for the Republicans argued in the filing. Former acting Solicitor General Donald Verrilli is representing the Democrats and urged the justices to deny the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cextraordinary and unjustified request for expedition\u201d and allow Pennsylvania \u201cto hold its federal elections under existing rules.\u201d One case that appeared to be awaiting Barrett was announced minutes before the Senate vote Monday. It concerned petitions from Wisconsin Democrats, who were asking the justices to allow the counting of ballots six days after the election and whether Covid-19 vulnerable voters and others in the state could secure replacement mail-in ballots by email. A federal appeals court had ruled earlier this month in favor of Republicans, holding that ballots could be counted only if they are received by Election Day. A 5-3 Supreme Court agreed. Supreme Court rejects Democratic attempt to extend Wisconsin mail-in voting deadline In asking the Supreme Court for relief, lawyers for the Democrats argued that the \u201cconfidence in Wisconsin\u2019s electoral process will be shattered if tens of thousands of valid, timely cast absentee ballots are not counted because they arrived two or three days after the election due to mail delays and other factors beyond the voters\u2019 control.\u201d But a lawyer for the Republican-led state legislature said that state laws were \u201cexceedingly generous\u201d and fell squarely within \u201cits broad authority to keep or make changes to election rules to address Covid-19.\u201d Republicans in North Carolina are asking the Supreme Court to block a nine-day extension of the counting of ballots if they are received by Election Day and reinstate a three-day extension established by the legislature last June. A federal appeals court had allowed the nine-day extension that was set by the State Board of Elections amid the pandemic, as part of a legal settlement. \u201cThe extension simply makes it easier for more people to vote absentee in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed over 200,000 Americans,\u201d the appeals court ruled. Republicans challenged the State Board\u2019s action arguing that it had tried to \u201crewrite of the election code\u201d and  usurp the authority of the General Assembly that had only allowed the three-day extension. In court briefs, Republican lawyers said that the state board\u2019s decision \u201cundermines the equal protection rights of voters, and is already causing the voter confusion and chaos.\u201d A Republican candidate for Minnesota\u2019s 2nd Congressional District is asking the justices to intervene in a case concerning whether his election takes place on November 3 or on February 9, 2021, after the recent death of Legal Marijuana Now Party candidate Adam Weeks caused the contest to be moved to next year as required by state law. In a filing submitted on Monday, lawyers for Republican Tyler Kistner argued the court should issue a stay for a preliminary injunction issued by a lower court that reinstated the November election for his race, saying if the election takes places next week, both voters and Kistner will suffer \u201cenormous and irreparable injury.\u201d \u201cBy changing the rules in the middle of the election, and thereby subjecting voters to different rules on the basis of when they cast their ballots, the injunction violates basic equal-protection principles and severely injures the affected voters and public interest,\u201d the lawyers wrote. Kistner is challenging Democratic Rep. Angie Craig in the race. As abortion rights backers and opponents spar over whether Barrett\u2019s confirmation would mean the end of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision, the justices will consider Friday whether or not to hear a case that could directly challenge the precedent. The case pertains to Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, which Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law in 2018. The law made exceptions only for medical emergencies or cases in which there\u2019s a \u201csevere fetal abnormality,\u201d but not for incidents of rape or incest. A federal judge in Mississippi struck down the law in November 2018, and the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling late last year. But in supplemental briefs filed Thursday, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch referenced the last Supreme Court case heard by the court, a Louisiana regulation involving hospital admitting privileges. Roberts\u2019 concurring opinion, appearing to walk back precedent on how courts should analyze the benefits and the burdens of a particular abortion law, had been interpreted differently by different circuit courts, she argued. \u201cThis case remains an ideal vehicle to promptly resolve both that question and the first question presented \u2013 the contradictions in this Court\u2019s decisions over use of \u2018viability\u2019 as a bright line for measuring pro-life legislation,\u201d Fitch wrote.

            "article_content": "Voters in two states are weighing in on abortion restrictions this November, considering whether to approve a set of ballot issues as a national fight intensifies over the future of abortion law in the US. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump sparred on the topic in September, with the former vice president arguing that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court case legalizing abortion, was \u201con the ballot\u201d in 2020. But as Republicans look to deepen the conservative tilt of the high court with the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, voters in Louisiana and Colorado voters will directly consider questions on the future of abortion access in their states. 2020 ballot questions: What states are voting on besides the US presidential election Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race In Louisiana, voters will decide whether to amend the state\u2019s constitution to add language that expressly states the document offers no protections for a right to abortion or the funding of abortion. Should Roe be overturned, Louisiana\u2019s Proposed Amendment No. 1 would prevent the state courts from declaring abortion restrictions unconstitutional at the state level. In Colorado, voters will consider Proposition 115, which would ban abortion beginning at 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure includes exceptions to save the life of the pregnant woman but not for instances of rape or incest. Doctors who continue to perform abortions at 22 weeks could face a fine up to $5,000. Colorado is one of seven states that does not bar some abortions past a specific point in pregnancy, according to data from the abortion-rights research group the Guttmacher Institute. Data from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\u2019s office shows that women from over 30 states have traveled to Colorado to access abortions. Those out-of-state abortion-seekers show \u201cthat care needs to be shored up in other states so that it\u2019s more accessible, but also that Colorado is important in the landscape of abortion access nationally,\u201d Elizabeth Nash, the interim associate director of state issues at Guttmacher, told CNN. Louisiana\u2019s ballot measure, meanwhile, exemplifies how there are \u201ca lot of layers to how they have developed their labyrinth of restrictions,\u201d she said. The Louisiana ballot measure marks another attempt by the state to restrict abortion. The US Supreme Court struck down in June a Louisiana restriction barring doctors from performing the procedure unless they had admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, and a decision from a federal appellate court prevented the state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion ban passed last year from going into effect. Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel at Americans United for Life, pointed to the Supreme Court case in which Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court\u2019s liberal justices to strike down the Louisiana law but also left the door open to more state limits on abortion. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful (the Supreme Court will) continue to do is to hand this back to the state so that states can decide what\u2019s appropriate for them, that we\u2019ll see lawmakers and more states doing this kind of thing,\u201d she said. State Sen. Katrina Jackson, an anti-abortion Democrat who co-sponsored the Senate bill that ultimately landed Louisiana\u2019s constitutional amendment on the ballot, told CNN that she was moved to act after the Kansas Supreme Court ruled last year that the state\u2019s constitution ensured a right to an abortion. If a state constitution is interpreted as ensuring a right to an abortion, she argued, it could then be interpreted to ensure a right to a state-funded abortion. Jackson said that she has promoted the amendment on social media and by traveling around the state, and that many anti-abortion groups and churches have backed it. Supporters, Jackson said, realize that they won\u2019t be able to ban abortion in Louisiana at this point because of Supreme Court rulings. \u201cBut where we do stand is we don\u2019t recognize the right to it, and therefore we do not fund abortion in our state \u2013 and that\u2019s the entire goal of this amendment,\u201d she said. Angie Thomas, associate director of the Louisiana Right to Life, said that the group\u2019s campaign supporting the amendment has included TV commercials, a website, social media advertising and yard signs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really getting the word out about exactly what this amendment does, exactly what it doesn\u2019t do and just encouraging people to vote for it,\u201d she said. Abortion rights supporters have warned the measure could have serious consequences. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about changing the constitution to strip people of the right to abortion, we\u2019re also really talking about what that means for survivors of rape and incest,\u201d said Michelle Erenberg, executive director of Lift Louisiana, a reproductive rights nonprofit that\u2019s part of a coalition against the amendment. \u201cWe\u2019re also talking about what that means for \u2026 the criminalization of people who may be seeking to self-manage an abortion if they can\u2019t access a legal abortion in the state of Louisiana anymore.\u201d Erenberg said she worries that Barrett\u2019s nomination means abortion rights advocates won\u2019t be able to rely on the Supreme Court to strike down anti-abortion laws. \u201cTo me it feels like maybe there was some complacency among people in Louisiana, that, \u2018Oh, the Louisiana politicians can pass these crazy laws, but you know, they\u2019ll be stopped in court,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell that may not necessarily be the case.\u201d Steffani Bangel, executive director of the New Orleans Abortion Fund, called the amendment \u201ca slippery slope,\u201d outlining possible scenarios in a world in which Roe is overturned. \u201cThe reality is that people in our communities are going to suffer in ways that are immeasurable because abortion doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said. For co-sponsor Giuliana Day, the 22-week abortion ban on the Colorado ballot represents a year and a half of community activism since she first learned the state didn\u2019t have a time limit on abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible mobilization of people that are on fire about Proposition 115,\u201d Day said, referencing \u201can army of volunteers.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been getting together in the communities and delivering flyers and information, because the main thing is to inform people.\u201d The ballot measure comes on the heels of a slew of other states\u2019 bills last year that tried to limit abortion to various time frames. Day said the Colorado measure has \u201cno relationship\u201d to other states\u2019 full abortion bans or bills pertaining to fetal personhood. Day called Colorado\u2019s lack restrictions on abortions past a specific point in pregnancy \u201cone of the darkest secrets in the state,\u201d and said that to her and fellow supporters, Proposition 115 is \u201cthe human rights issue of our lifetime.\u201d The campaign has gained support from anti-abortion Democratic groups and over 160 health care workers, Day said, adding that she\u2019s optimistic it will pass. But opponents of the measure see the ban as a potential threat to abortion seekers\u2019 health \u2013 and abortion access in states nationwide. Karen Middleton, executive director of reproductive rights group Cobalt, said her organization and several others formed a coalition in the spring to fight the proposed restrictions. They\u2019ve used TV, digital media, emails, texts, phone calls and direct mail. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to talk to voters and really get a message, our message, in front of them about how harmful this could be, we believe it will move in our favor. We believe we will be able to defeat this, but it is very close to call,\u201d she said. Several high-profile Democratic Colorado politicians have opposed the measure, including Gov. Jared Polis, Sen. Michael Bennet, and Senate candidate and former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Middleton criticized the ballot measure\u2019s lack of exceptions for rape and incest and said that regarding the exception in instances of life or death, \u201cif you\u2019re making a life or death decision, the life of the mother is already at extreme risk.\u201d Colorado, she said, could be a test case for anti-abortion ballot initiatives in other states. \u201cIf they think they can be successful, they will then run it in lots of other states,\u201d Middleton said of abortion opponents. \u201cSo we really see from a national perspective, access to care is critical.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski announced Saturday that she will ultimately vote yes on Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. \u201cI believe that the only way to put us back on the path of appropriate consideration of judicial nominees, is to evaluate Judge Barrett as we would want to be judged \u2013 on the merits of her qualifications. And we do that when that final question comes before us. And when it does, I will be a yes,\u201d Murkowski said on the Senate floor. The Alaska Republican had been keeping her decision private and had previously said that she did not believe the Senate should be taking up a Supreme Court nomination this close to the election. Murkowski\u2019s announcement comes just one day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cut off debate and set up a final confirmation vote for Barrett to take place just eight days before the election. McConnell\u2019s move sets up a Sunday afternoon procedural vote to break a Democratic filibuster and then a final confirmation vote, likely Monday evening. Only one Republican \u2013 Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is facing a competitive reelection fight \u2013 is expected to vote against the confirmation due to concerns that it\u2019s too close to the election to consider a nominee. All Democrats are expected to vote against the nomination, though Republicans still have enough votes to confirm Barrett. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the nomination to the full chamber, over the boycott of Democratic committee members, who put in their seats pictures of individuals affected by the Affordable Care Act. Unable to stop the confirmation, Democrats have resorted to theatrical tactics instead to spotlight their anger. Democratic senators on Friday forced a rare closed session so members could privately discuss their concerns about the process. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wanted the closed session in order to have a \u201ccandid conversation\u201d about the push to confirm the nomination. \u201cI believe the Senate majority is on the precipice of making a colossal and historic mistake by rushing this nomination through the Senate only eight days before a national election,\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech before making the motion to employ the extraordinary move. Barrett\u2019s confirmation proceedings will amount to one of the quickest for a Supreme Court nominee in modern times \u2013 just more than a month since she was chosen to fill the seat of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 and comes despite the GOP refusing to even have a hearing for President Barack Obama\u2019s pick in 2016 because they argued it was too close to the election. But Republicans, arguing the situation is different now with the GOP in control of both the White House and the Senate, have rallied behind Barrett in their push to shift the court further to the right. If confirmed, Barrett would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority, a shift that could usher in sweeping changes to health care, abortion, voting and gun rights.

            "article_content": "The US has joined a group of largely repressive governments in co-sponsoring an international declaration that challenges the right to an abortion. The Geneva Consensus Declaration, sponsored by Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, and Uganda and signed by more than 30 countries during a virtual international ceremonial on Thursday, aims, among other goals, to affirm the \u201cstrength of the family and of a successful and flourishing society\u201d and \u201cto express the essential priority of protecting the right to life,\u201d according to the agreement. It also states that countries are committed to reaffirming that there is \u201cno international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of States to finance or facilitate abortion.\u201d The signing of the nonbinding declaration comes days ahead of the 2020 presidential election and as the President, who has taken a strong stance against abortion during his time in office, continues to emphasize his support for tighter abortion restrictions. Countries that also signed the declaration include Belarus, where there have been mass protests and large-scale arrests following a disputed election against the 26-year-rule of President Alexander Lukashenko, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Poland, Kenya and United Arab Emirates. Many of the countries involved have actively suppressed human rights. Poland, which has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, is facing backlash over a court ruling that moves the country toward a near-total ban on abortion. Cameroon, a signatory on the declaration, was removed by the US from receiving trade preference benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2019 after allegations of human rights violations. Uganda has long sought to criminalize homosexuality. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called the declaration \u201can historic document stating clearly where we as nations stand on women\u2019s health, the family, honoring life, and defending national sovereignty,\u201d because \u201cit is the sovereign right of every nation to make their own laws in regard to abortion, absent external pressure.\u201d \u201cThe declaration is much more than a statement of beliefs; it is a critical and useful tool to defend these principles across all United Nations bodies and at every multilateral setting using language previously agreed to by member-states of those bodies,\u201d Azar said Thursday during the signing ceremony. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who, along with Azar, has frequently opposed abortion rights, praised the declaration and said under President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, the US has \u201cdefended the dignity of human life everywhere and always.\u201d In September, the Trump administration proposed a rule that would expand a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions. The US has also spoken out against mentions of \u201creproductive health\u201d to the United Nations, including at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019 when Azar urged world leaders to not include terms such as \u201creproductive health and rights\u201d when expanding access to health care. In May, the Trump administration called for UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to remove any references to reproductive health and abortions from the UN\u2019s humanitarian response plan to the coronavirus pandemic to \u201cavoid creating controversy.\u201d Amnesty International condemned the international declaration, tweeting Friday that it is \u201canother giant step backwards for reproductive rights globally.\u201d Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the announcement of the declaration. \u201cThe Geneva Consensus Declaration attempts to undermine bedrock human rights agreements and women\u2019s health and reproductive rights here at home and around the world,\u201d Cardin said.

            "article_content": "Senate Judiciary Democrats, facing criticism from the left that they have not done more to question the legitimacy of the Supreme Court confirmation proceedings for Amy Coney Barrett, plan to take the extraordinary step of boycotting a key committee vote on Thursday. Republicans said they can still hold the committee vote Thursday and advance the nomination even if Democrats boycott the proceedings, though the act is a sign of the partisan rancor over the election year nomination to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Democrats hardball move comes amid dissatisfaction from some liberal groups over their handling of the nomination, with Sen, Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, in particular singled out for praising Republican chairman\u2019s stewardship of the proceedings. Democrats say they plan to fill the seats Thursday with pictures of people impacted by the Affordable Care Act, part of the Democratic strategy for tying Barrett\u2019s nomination to a threat posed to President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, which is scheduled to be before the Supreme Court the week after Election Day. \u201cThis has been a sham process from the beginning,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Judiciary Democrats in a statement released Wednesday. \u201cWe will not grant this process any further legitimacy by participating in a committee markup of this nomination just twelve days before the culmination of an election that is already underway.\u201d Asked if the Democratic boycott is simply just a stunt, Schumer told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019re not giving a quorum they need to provide. The rules require it.\u201d Under Senate Judiciary Committee rules, nine members of the panel, including two members of the minority party, must be present \u201cfor the purpose of transacting business.\u201d But Republicans say Senate rule 26 supersedes the Judiciary Committee requirements. That rule says that \u201cno measure or matter or recommendation shall be reported from any committee unless a majority of the committee were physically present.\u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said the GOP is moving forward no matter what, setting up a Monday confirmation vote by the full Senate, amounting to one of the quickest confirmation proceedings in modern times by pushing the nomination through in just over a month. It comes despite the GOP\u2019s refusal to move on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee eight months before the 2016 elections. \u201cShe deserves to be reported out, and she will be reported out,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cShe deserves better than this. The political system is broken. I get that. Plenty of blame to go around.\u201d Democrats\u2019 extraordinary move will rob them of an opportunity to deliver speeches opposing the nomination on Thursday. But Barrett would ultimately get approved by the panel on a 12-0 vote. They say that the GOP will break the rules if they advance her nomination Thursday with no minority members present, though they acknowledge there is little they can do to stop it. \u201cApparently they have no intention of following the rules,\u201d said veteran Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and former chairman of the committee. \u201cI\u2019m old school, I keep my word. They don\u2019t keep their word.\u201d The announcement of the boycott comes after Senate Democrats have been sharply criticized by some of their liberal supporters for not taking a tougher line with Barrett and adding legitimacy to the process during Barrett\u2019s hearings last week. In particular, Feinstein came under scathing criticism when she praised Graham for his handling of the confirmation process. Feinstein\u2019s comments infuriated Democrats and liberal activists who had been seeking to mount a unified attack over proceedings they deemed a sham. Two progressive groups, including the abortion-rights lobby NARAL, demanded she be removed as the top Democrat on the committee, while GOP leaders have repeatedly highlighted her comments as they race to get Barrett confirmed eight days before Election Day. \u201cI\u2019ve had a long and serious talk with Sen. Feinstein,\u201d Schumer told reporters Tuesday when asked if he was looking to make changes atop the powerful committee. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it right now.\u201d Feinstein would not comment to CNN when asked Wednesday if she would seek the chairmanship of the committee if Democrats take the Senate majority. \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to that,\u201d she told CNN when asked twice if she wanted the position.

            "article_content": "Senate Democratic leaders on Tuesday pointedly refused to say if they supported California Sen. Dianne Feinstein staying in her post as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sidestepping questions about the veteran party elder after she praised Republicans\u2019 handling of the confirmation proceedings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Feinstein\u2019s comments, praising Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham last week after four days of confirmation hearings, infuriated Democrats and liberal activists who had been seeking to mount a unified attack over proceedings they deemed a sham. Two progressive groups, including the abortion-rights lobby NARAL, demanded she be removed as the top Democrat on the committee, while GOP leaders have repeatedly highlighted her comments as they race to get Barrett confirmed eight days before Election Day. On Tuesday, the top two Senate Democrats would not say if they had confidence in Feinstein. \u201cI\u2019ve had a long and serious talk with Sen. Feinstein,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters when asked if he was looking to make changes atop the powerful committee. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it right now.\u201d Asked by CNN after his news conference if he had confidence in Feinstein, the New York Democrat would not say, referring to his remarks from his news conference. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, who typically engages in extended exchanges with reporters, also refused to comment to CNN about Feinstein. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment,\u201d Durbin said when asked if he had confidence in her stewardship on the panel. Appearing later on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper,\u201d Durbin tried to avoid weighing on Feinstein but ultimately seemed to take issue with Feinstein\u2019s comments praising Graham at the end of the hearings. \u201cI thought her opening statement and questions were good throughout,\u201d Durbin said of his longtime colleague. \u201cI sat next to her throughout the hearing. I stayed in the hearing during the four days. I think the Democrats really presented a powerful case. The shot at the end may have been misleading as to what the rest of the committee felt about this.\u201d Feinstein, 87, has come under growing scrutiny about her role atop the panel given her more genteel style of politics while serving on perhaps the most partisan committee in all of the Senate. But as the oldest senator in the chamber, she also has faced growing questions in the Capitol about whether she can handle the responsibilities of the job. Removing Feinstein from the post won\u2019t be an easy task. The Senate operates on a seniority-based system and Feinstein \u2013 who has had a long career, has served on the panel for roughly a quarter century and is revered by many of her colleagues \u2013 would be the first woman to serve as chair of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats gain control of the chamber in next month\u2019s elections. Yet Schumer would be under pressure from the left to not give her the chairmanship of the committee, and he likely will face calls to cut a deal and give her a spot atop another influential panel instead. During last week\u2019s confirmation proceedings, Feinstein did criticize the GOP\u2019s unusually fast time frame pushing for Barrett\u2019s confirmation, and she did challenge Barrett to explain her views on abortion rights, gun control and health care, among other issues. Yet she also repeatedly praised Barrett and her family, irking fellow Democrats, who said such comments helped soften Barrett\u2019s image and portray her as a sympathetic nominee. Democrats were particularly incensed at Feinstein\u2019s remarks at the end of the hearings, where she turned to Graham and said: \u201cThis is one of the best set of hearings that I\u2019ve participated in.\u201d She shook Graham\u2019s hand and later hugged the Republican, who is battling in South Carolina to survive reelection in one of the toughest Senate races of his career. When approached in the Capitol on Tuesday, Feinstein declined to comment on Schumer\u2019s remark. Several Judiciary Committee Democrats also would not engage about the controversy. Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who sits on the panel, said Feinstein and the rest of the Democrats at the hearing made clear \u201cthe danger\u201d that Barrett poses to the Affordable Care Act, among other issues. \u201cAt the end, Dianne was being gracious.\u201d Asked if she had confidence in Feinstein staying in the post, Hirono said: \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it.\u201d \u201cI understand how angry many Democrats are about the Barrett confirmation, I share that anger, but I frankly think folks are taking it out on her (Feinstein),\u201d Sen. Chris Coons said Wednesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d The Delaware Democrat, who also sits on the panel, argued that the \u201canger\u201d should be \u201cmore appropriately focused at the Republicans who are driving through this extreme nominee, who is unqualified to serve because of her extreme views.\u201d Asked if he wants Feinstein to remain the top Democrat on the committee, Coons replied, \u201cI have a lot of respect for Sen. Feinstein and her long record of leadership. And I think this is an issue that\u2019s best worked out by the caucus.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Judge Amy Coney Barrett submitted written responses to scores of questions from Senate Judiciary Committee members Tuesday night ahead of her expected confirmation to the Supreme Court next week. Barrett repeatedly declined to discuss voting rights, coronavirus and the 2020 election, presidential pardon power, abortion, the Affordable Care Act and other issues that could appear before the Supreme Court in the coming months. In response to a question from Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, mirroring a contentious moment during the hearings, Barrett again declined to say whether she believes \u201csystemic racism\u201d does or does not exist. Top Democrats refuse to stand by Feinstein after she praised GOP handling of Barrett hearings \u201cI believe that racism persists in our country but, as I explained at the hearing, whether there is \u2018systemic racism\u2019 is a public policy question of substantial controversy, as evidenced by the disagreement among Senators on this very question during the hearing,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cAs a sitting judge and judicial nominee, it would be inappropriate for me to offer an opinion on the matter.\u201d As with her two days of sparring with senators last week. Barrett does not offer specific answers to questions, citing the possibility of ongoing litigation and that some queries raised public policy controversies or \u201cabstract legal issues or hypotheticals.\u201d In her responses, Barrett repeated a version of an answer to questions about previous Supreme Court rulings nearly 40 times. \u201cIt would not be appropriate for me to opine further on this question; as Justice Kagan explained, it is not appropriate for a judicial nominee to \u2018grade\u2019 or give a \u2018thumbs-up or thumbs-down\u2019 to particular cases,\u201d she repeatedly states. READ: Written responses by Amy Coney Barrett to questions from senators The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to advance Barrett\u2019s nomination Thursday, and the full Senate vote to confirm her to the bench is expected next Monday. Continuing another key theme from last week, Barrett declined to say whether a 1965 Supreme Court ruling striking down a Connecticut law that made it a crime to provide contraception to married couples was settled law. The ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut that personal decisions between spouses were covered by a constitutional right to privacy became a foundation of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. Hear Amy Coney Barrett's tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201cAs I said at my hearing, because Griswold lies at the base of substantive due process doctrine, an area that remains the subject of ongoing litigation, I cannot opine on it,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cBut I do not think Griswold is in danger of going anywhere.\u201d On the climate crisis, Barrett drew criticism from Democrats when she would not say if she agrees with the scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. Several times in her written responses, Barrett says her views on the issue aren\u2019t relevant to her job as a judge. \u201cIf a case comes before me involving environmental regulation, I will carefully review the record and apply the relevant law to the facts before me,\u201d Barrett states in a response to Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. John Roberts sides with the liberals on mail-in voting but things may change once Barrett arrives Barrett also said at several points that the Supreme Court had recently described \u201cclimate change\u201d as \u201ccontroversial\u201d and a \u201csensitive political topic.\u201d She said it therefore would not be appropriate \u201cto opine further on any subject of political controversy.\u201d She cited a 2018 case in which the conservative court majority had overturned a nearly 40-year-old Supreme Court ruling that had allowed unions to gather dues even from nonmembers for collective-bargaining activities. That opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, at one point asserted, \u201cUnions can also speak out in collective bargaining on controversial subjects such as climate change, the Confederacy, sexual orientation and gender identity, evolution, and minority religions.\u201d",

It\u2019s two weeks to Election Day \u2013 that\u2019s Tuesday, November 3. And it\u2019s two days from the final presidential debate \u2013 that\u2019s Thursday, October 22. It\u2019s modified with some rule changes and plans to mute each candidate\u2019s microphone during initial replies. Read here. Joe Biden is mostly off the campaign trail, preparing for the debate. Melania Trump is off the campaign trail, without getting back on it. She\u2019s canceled a scheduled campaign event due to lingering Covid symptoms. President Donald Trump is everywhere \u2013 In the past week he\u2019s held events in Pennsylvania -> Iowa -> North Carolina -> Florida -> Georgia -> Michigan -> Wisconsin -> Nevada -> Arizona. That includes double-header rallies on Friday, Saturday and Monday. He\u2019ll be in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, in Erie County, which flipped from supporting Barack Obama to supporting him in 2016. He\u2019ll be in North Carolina again on Wednesday. He\u2019ll need both states again if he\u2019s going to win 270 electoral votes. (Keep reading for more on that.) Trump doesn\u2019t discuss Covid much at the rallies, but he\u2019s consistently pushed the idea it\u2019s about over. Or we\u2019re rounding the bend. Remember when he said it would be done by Easter? Now public health officials are warning Americans against Thanksgiving gatherings. Here\u2019s a very long timeline of Trump predicting the end of Covid. What he does talk about: Hypothetically soliciting bribes from Exxon. I would say \u201cjokes\u201d here because he seemed to be using a hypothetical. Exxon wasn\u2019t laughing. The company immediately said its CEO had no contact like this with Trump. Trump, uncorked, says things like this. We should still take note of them. His words: \u201cSo I call some guy, the head of Exxon. I call the head of Exxon, I don\u2019t know, you know. I\u2019ll use a company,\u201d Trump said. \u201d \u2018Hi, how you doing? How\u2019s energy coming? When are you doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits, huh? OK. \u2026 I\u2019d love you to send me $25 million for the campaign.\u2019 \u201d Read more. There\u2019s no filter on what\u2019s coming out of his mouth. If there\u2019s a strategy in stoking his base and shocking everyone else, there\u2019s nothing new in it. If it\u2019s a strategy at all. Key ruling for Pennsylvania votes. The US Supreme Court ruled Monday (with John Roberts as the swing vote siding with liberal justices) that absentee ballots in Pennsylvania can be counted after Election Day even if they don\u2019t have legible postmarks. Swan song for swing votes. It\u2019ll be a much different court when Amy Coney Barrett arrives, notes CNN Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic. But here\u2019s the argument by a notable conservative formal federal judge that because of a decision in 2009, Barrett should recuse herself to avoid the appearance of impropriety after Trump gave her something of value. The decision is up to her. Texas can ignore thrown-out ballots. A federal appeals court decision in Texas says the state doesn\u2019t have to give voters the chance to fix, or \u201ccure,\u201d rejected mail-in ballots. 32 million+ early votes and counting. It\u2019s possible that between 20% and 25% of Americans who will vote have already voted. More than 32 million have cast ballots. \u201cAmerica is under attack from Trump.\u201d Among those who already voted is retired Adm. William McRaven, the former head of US Special Forces. He oversaw the Osama bin Laden raid. He describes himself as an anti-abortion rights and pro-Second Amendment conservative in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece and was even more pointed in a CNN interview, explaining why he had voted for Joe Biden. McRaven\u2019s announcement comes after Trump explained last week why he had retweeted a conspiracy theory that the bin Laden raid was a sham. What about elected Republicans? We\u2019ve heard this story so many times. There\u2019s a big difference between a retired general, no matter how conservative he is, and elected Republicans, who are accountable to voters. This story by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Alex Rogers examines the quiet uneasiness of Republicans on Capitol Hill who wish Trump would stop attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci and focus on Biden. You can bet that if Trump loses, these folks will speak their minds a lot more freely. The quiet angst of Republican politicians has become something of a cliche in Washington.",

            "article_content": "Democratic senators recognized early on that there was little they could do to stop Republicans from rushing to confirm Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. So this week, they spent her hearings with an eye on Election Day, opting to avoid overly aggressive exchanges that could hurt their candidates, and cautioning over and over again that Barrett could undermine the Affordable Care Act, inserting their most potent political issue \u2013 health care \u2013 into the fight. But in the end, Democrats offered a mixed message over the process, with some top senators praising the handling of the hearings at the same time as characterizing it as a \u201csham.\u201d Four days of hearings culminated with the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, gushing over Chairman Lindsey Graham\u2019s \u201cfairness\u201d in the hearings. After the hearings concluded, Feinstein told Graham, who is in a tough race against Democrat Jaime Harrison, \u201cThis is one of the best set of hearings that I\u2019ve participated in,\u201d and hugged him. Some on the left were apoplectic about her approach over the four days. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Sen. Feinstein to step down from her leadership position on the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who now runs the liberal group Demand Justice, which has spent hundreds of thousands on TV ads opposing the Barrett nomination. \u201cIf she won\u2019t, her colleagues need to intervene.\u201d On Friday, the influential abortion-rights group NARAL also said the committee needs new leadership. \u201cAmericans\u2013whose lives hang in the balance\u2013deserve leadership that underscores how unprecedented, shameful and wrong this process is,\u201d NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement. Feinstein, she said, \u201cfailed to make this clear and in fact offered an appearance of credibility to the proceedings that is wildly out of step with the American people. As such, we believe the committee needs new leadership.\u201d Feinstein, 87, and a Judiciary Committee member for about a quarter century, has faced increased criticism from liberal activists, and questions from some of her allies about her ability to serve as the top committee member. Democrats on the committee have mostly supported her remaining in the post, given her respected and influential tenure in the body. And at the hearing, she did offer pointed criticisms at Republicans over the expedited timeframe \u2013 and challenged Barrett to explain her views on abortion rights, gun control and health care, among other issues. Yet, she repeatedly praised Barrett and her family, prompting some Democratic concerns that she was painting a nominee who could shift the court markedly to the right in a favorable light. The issue will likely continue to fester if Democrats retake the majority and the chairmanship of the committee is at stake. Asked for comment, a Feinstein spokesman referred questions to a statement the senator issued Thursday evening saying she would vote against the Barrett nomination and arguing that the Democrats accomplished their \u201cone goal\u201d to show what a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court could mean for health care and abortion rights. \u201cThe Senate is structured so the majority had absolute control over this process,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cWhen Republicans signaled they\u2019d move ahead in the face of all objections, the only thing we could do was show this nominee would radically alter the court, and we accomplished that.\u201d Yet Democrats defended their strategy and said their cautious tactic this week was deliberate. They were eager to avoid giving Republicans any additional ammunition in the final stretch of a campaign that polls show favors them winning both the White House and even the Senate. In the end, Democrats argued, they made their case effectively. \u201cI think we raised all of the tough issues, and we raised them in a pretty hard-hitting way, but we didn\u2019t shout and pound the table,\u201d said Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Their strategy, they said, was to make the deliberations less about Barrett\u2019s character or religion \u2013 and more about the issues at stake with her confirmation that may resonate with voters. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who also rankled activists by praising Graham for his \u201cfairness,\u201d said this week that the nomination was not just about Barrett, but \u201cabout the Affordable Care Act, and whether it\u2019s going to be there when Americans desperately need it in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d Judiciary panel slates October 22 vote for Barrett as witnesses weigh in at fourth day of hearings \u201cI think that\u2019s why the Supreme Court nomination is different than any in history,\u201d he added. \u201cI believe the American people are starting to feel the same.\u201d Republicans responded by reminding voters of the flaws of that 2010 law, blaming it for higher insurance premiums, and warning that Democrats want to pass single-payer health care. But they recognized that they were playing defense. Graham, who is in the toughest reelection race of his career, told Barrett at one point that the hearings had been \u201cmore about Obamacare than it has you.\u201d Barrett declined to say how she would vote on particular cases, citing a precedent by her potential predecessor, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to give \u201cno hints, no previews, no forecasts\u201d to the committee. But Democrats repeatedly pressed her to share her views \u2014 on health care, voting rights, climate change, abortion, gun control, the election and more \u2014 to paint her as someone who was unwilling to provide her thoughts on critical issues. Barrett declined to answer many of their questions. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker asked on Tuesday whether every president should commit to the peaceful transfer of power. Barrett initially replied that the senator was trying to draw her into a political dispute between the President and his opponents. After he pressed, she touted the country\u2019s nonviolent practice of electing its leaders. Democrats were keenly aware of the optics, and largely avoided interrupting Barrett or talking over her, a common occurrence in high-profile hearings. Not long after GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa charged that members had been disrespectful on Wednesday, Booker interrupted Barrett, and then asked her to forgive him. Barrett said it was fine and Booker joked that he\u2019s learning from Ernst how to be \u201cIowa nice.\u201d Barrett laughed. It was a far cry from the emotionally charged battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the court, after he fended off allegations of sexual assault in intense hearings just weeks before the 2018 midterms. The end result, some Democrats say, made reelection for Democratic senators in red states much harder. Democratic Senate challengers shatter money records, boosting their hopes of flipping chamber from Republicans It\u2019s unclear whether Barrett\u2019s nomination will help Republican or Democratic Senate candidates. But ActBlue, the online portal for Democratic candidates, reported that it raised $70.6 million on September 19, the day after Ginsburg\u2019s death, breaking its single-day record. Republican strategists, however, claim that the fight over the nomination will help their party overcome the drag from the top of the ticket. Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, recently told CNN that Barrett is \u201can extraordinarily impressive woman who, if she has any political impact, will help Republicans in close races.\u201d \u201cWe know it\u2019s entirely possible for Republican senators running for reelection to run ahead of the President,\u201d said Ayres. \u201cThe question is, \u2018how far ahead of the President can they run?\u2019\u201d Republicans like Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley sought to portray Democrats as anti-Catholic, after her faith became a flashpoint in her 2017 confirmation proceedings for her current position on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cThe dogma lives loudly within you,\u201d said Feinstein back then. But Democrats declined to discuss her religion in that manner this week. How conservative Catholics became supreme on GOP's court \u201cWe made a point of not asking about religion,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI think we focused on the issues \u2013 not on theatrics.\u201d Vulnerable Republican senators on the committee took their time defending themselves from Democratic attacks on health care. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis charged that the left\u2019s Medicare-for-all proposal \u201ccould be Medicare for none.\u201d Ernst ticked off provisions of a recent Senate Republican bill addressing the pandemic, including relief for the unemployed, small businesses and schools. Graham seemed to suggest that Barrett would vote to uphold the ACA in an upcoming case because of a judicial principle known as severability. There\u2019s evidence to suggest that Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election in part due to his pledge to fill the seat left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, which remained vacant because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. Their argument at the time was that it was an election year, and the next president should decide the Supreme Court nominee. Hogue told CNN that Democrats took control of the issue in the 2018 midterm elections, after Republicans blocked Garland and Trump nominated Kavanaugh to fill the seat left by the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who still voted to uphold abortion rights. Hogue said that Democrats realized \u201cwe better actually start to focus on the court because it\u2019s being stolen from us.\u201d Republicans and Democrats believe that Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor, will give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, influencing a wide array of issues involving the day-to-day lives of Americans. Republicans blocked a motion from Democrats to indefinitely postpone the proceedings on Thursday, dismissing their charges of hypocrisy and concerns that millions of Americans were already voting for president. McConnell said Republicans planned to confirm Barrett by the end of the month. \u201cWe have the votes,\u201d he said. The Senate has taken half the average time to consider her nomination. If confirmed, and able to serve as long as Ginsburg, the 48-year-old Barrett will sit on the court for nearly four decades. This story has been updated Friday with NARAL\u2019s statement calling for new Democratic leadership on the Judiciary Committee. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden said President Donald Trump bears blame for the alleged domestic terrorist plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, pointing in a speech Friday to Trump\u2019s calls on Twitter to \u201cliberate Michigan\u201d in the wake of the Democratic governor\u2019s coronavirus-related restrictions. Describing the alleged plot, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscience of every American. Every American.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset,\u201d adding, \u201cWhen the President tweeted, \u2018liberate Michigan,\u2019 \u2018liberate Michigan,\u2019 that\u2019s the call that was heard. That was the dog whistle.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments, as he campaigned in Michigan on Friday alongside Whitmer and Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, who is facing a competitive reelection, came the week after the FBI revealed it had uncovered an extremist group\u2019s plot to kidnap Whitmer at the state Capitol. The alleged scheme included plans to overthrow several state governments that the suspects \u201cbelieve are violating the US Constitution,\u201d including the government of Michigan and Whitmer, according to a federal criminal complaint. After the alleged plot was revealed, Trump continued to attack Whitmer and did not explicitly denounce the group behind the alleged plot. Biden also condemned Trump for his response to White supremacists rallying in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 \u2013 a moment the former vice president has long said led him to decide to run against Trump. \u201cHate never goes away; it hides,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need to be clear from the President on down in this country: There is no place for hate in America.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments came in a speech that largely focused on health care, a message he and other Democrats have highlighted in the 2020 race\u2019s closing days \u2013 much as they did in 2018, when Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to repeal Obamacare led to a Democratic wave that gave the party control of the House of Representatives. Biden on Friday accused Trump and Senate Republicans of \u201ccourt-packing,\u201d saying their push to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court before the election is an effort to undo the Affordable Care Act. Biden\u2019s comments showed how he is trying to flip a question he has ducked in recent days \u2013 whether he would seek to add seats to the Supreme Court to diminish the 6-3 conservative majority that will exist if Barrett is confirmed \u2013 on Republicans by focusing on health policies that a right-leaning court could undo. \u201cThat\u2019s what the court-packing going on now is about,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGetting rid of Obamacare is why they are racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake about it, Trump has made it clear from the beginning \u2026 he wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he\u2019s made that incredibly clear as well.\u201d Biden highlighted popular tenets of the Affordable Care Act, including requiring insurance companies to allow children to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26, requiring insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions and prohibiting insurers from capping their lifetime payments. Biden cited Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to repeal Obamacare and replace it over the last decade. Trump has promised a less expensive alternative to Obamacare that would keep its mandate for coverage of those with pre-existing conditions, but has not offered any details about how he would do so. \u201cIf I have the honor of becoming your president, we\u2019ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do,\u201d Biden said. His comments came the day after Biden was pressed in an ABC town hall over whether he supports adding seats to the Supreme Court \u2013 as some progressives have said Democrats should \u2013 in the wake of the GOP\u2019s push to confirm Barrett to fill the seat of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, four years after Senate Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for the final 11 months of former President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. Biden said Thursday night he is \u201cnot a fan\u201d of court-packing, but whether he ultimately changes his mind \u201cdepends on how this turns out\u201d and \u201cif there\u2019s actually real, live debate on the floor\u201d of the Senate about Barrett\u2019s confirmation. If that does not take place and Republicans rush to confirm Barrett before the election, he said, \u201cI\u2019m open to considering what happens from that point on.\u201d Biden committed to taking a clearer position on court-packing before the election, after seeing how the confirmation process plays out. But he also said he was hesitant to take a specific position at this stage because he wants attention to focus on what confirming Barrett and handing conservatives a 6-3 Supreme Court majority would mean for abortion rights, health care, LGBTQ rights and more. \u201cIf I answer the question directly, then all the focus will be on, what\u2019s Biden going to do if he wins, instead of if it is appropriate what is going on now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a thing the President loves to do, which is always take our eye off the ball.\u201d CNN\u2019s Christina Carrega\u2019s contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On ABC, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was explaining his plan to raise taxes on people making more than $400,000 per year. On NBC, President Donald Trump was equivocating about the existence of a satanic cult of pedophiles. The problem with their town halls, which were drastically different in tone and substance: Americans could only pick one to watch. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race. With the second presidential debate scrapped in the wake of Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis, the two candidates instead agreed to nationally televised town halls, with Biden taking questions from voters in Philadelphia and Trump doing so in Miami. The two are scheduled to debate just one more time. Here are five takeaways from the dueling town halls: No hour has better illustrated the alternate reality in which Trump exists than Thursday\u2019s 60-minute town hall. Trump claimed the science is still out on wearing masks, despite the universal view of health experts \u2013 including within his own administration \u2013 that it can mitigate the spread of coronavirus. He refused to say whether or not he believed Democrats were running a satanic pedophile ring, shrugging when pressed and saying only, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d He claimed with no evidence that ballots with his name on them had been found in garbage cans. And he would not affirm that a conspiratorial tweet he retweeted claiming Osama Bin Laden is still alive is false, saying, \u201cPeople can decide for themselves.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get that,\u201d moderator Savannah Guthrie said after that last equivocation. \u201cYou\u2019re the President, not somebody\u2019s crazy uncle.\u201d Contained within Trump\u2019s regular venues of conservative television and Twitter, the upside-down world in which he exists sometimes loses its impact. But in front of everyday voters, his answers appeared wildly detached from any accepted version of reality. Voters deciding between Trump and Biden find themselves choosing less between two candidates than two entirely opposite planets. Since leaving the hospital, Trump has been dialing into friendly outlets to recount his ordeal and trash Biden. Over the past week, he\u2019s phoned Fox News or Fox Business five times, along with chats on Newsmax and Rush Limbaugh. The warmth of a conservative safe space is where Trump has thrived for most of his presidency. When he emerged onto NBC\u2019s set, things felt much colder. A lawyer by training, Guthrie would not let up when Trump evaded questions about his coronavirus diagnosis, whether he was tested the day of the last debate, his stance on white supremacy, his views on QAnon or his view of mail-in voting. Trump was conducting a town hall instead of a debate by choice; he pulled out of a second face-off with Biden when the Commission on Presidential Debates insisted it be virtual. But the result was 20 minutes of contentious live grilling with only himself in the spotlight \u2013 a rarity for a President who sticks mostly to a friends in conservative media. Without a rival on the stage, Trump was alone in fielding the questions. And he had no opponent to pepper with his own attacks. Instead, Trump found himself on the defensive and increasingly angry \u2013 including scoffing at a question Guthrie asked by calling her \u201ccute.\u201d It\u2019s the type of performance some of Trump\u2019s advisers had hoped to avoid, recognizing it is that type of behavior that has turned off women voters and senior citizens. During one of the commercial breaks, Trump\u2019s strategic communications director Alyssa Farah came out and spoke to Guthrie before joining other aides to speak with the President. Trump appeared more moderated when answering questions from the town hall participants. But the ease of conducting four years of friendly interviews became clear when it came time for his final question: Why should voters give him a second term? Instead of laying out what he\u2019d do differently, Trump listed only what he\u2019d accomplished so far and concluded with: \u201cNext year is going to be better than ever before.\u201d The contrast between the candidates\u2019 approaches and their town halls\u2019 topics was dramatic \u2013 especially when confronted with controversial remarks they\u2019d made in the past. One clear window into Biden\u2019s tactics in a town-hall setting, with voters pressing him one-on-one, came when a young Black man recalled the former vice president\u2019s flip comment to radio host Charlamagne tha God that if someone was struggling to decide between supporting him and Trump, \u201cyou ain\u2019t Black.\u201d \u201cBesides \u2018you ain\u2019t Black,\u201d the man asked, how could Biden convince Black voters to take part \u201cin a system that has failed to protect them?\u201d Instead of addressing his controversial remark, Biden delved into a several-minutes-long litany of policy specifics aimed at helping Black people. On his list: Tripling Title I funding for low-income schools; helping first-time homebuyers with a $15,000 credit for downpayments so that low-income families can begin to build wealth; $70 billion in new funding for historically Black colleges and universities; and government-backed loans for young Black entrepreneurs. Asked if he\u2019d heard enough, the young man responded, \u201cUh, I think so.\u201d Then Biden offered to continue their conversation after the town hall ended. It was one of a number of long-winded answers from Biden on Thursday night, and underscored Biden\u2019s style and his efforts to use the town hall to focus on how his plans would affect ordinary Americans. It\u2019s the implicit contrast Biden has long sought to offer voters: Sobriety in the face of Trump\u2019s bombast, and a connection to the concerns of low- and middle-income Americans who he says have been ignored by Trump. Trump campaign senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp tweeted during Biden\u2019s town hall that watching it \u201cfeels like I am watching an episode of Mister Rodgers Neighborhood.\u201d That was exactly the tone Biden was aiming for. Biden didn\u2019t clarify his position Thursday night on the push by some progressives to add seats to the Supreme Court \u2013 but he said he would do so before the election. Pressed on an issue he has largely ducked since Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill the seat of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Biden said he is \u201cnot a fan\u201d of court-packing, but whether he ultimately changes his mind \u201cdepends on how this turns out\u201d and \u201cif there\u2019s actually real, live debate on the floor\u201d of the Senate about Barrett\u2019s confirmation. If that does not take place and Republicans rush to confirm Barrett before the election, he said, \u201cI\u2019m open to considering what happens from that point on.\u201d Biden said he would take a clearer position on court-packing before the election, after seeing how the confirmation process plays out. But he also said he was hesitant to take a specific position at this stage because he wants attention to focus on what confirming Barrett and handing conservatives a 6-3 Supreme Court majority would mean for abortion rights, health care, LGBTQ rights and more. \u201cIf I answer the question directly, then all the focus will be on, what\u2019s Biden going to do if he wins, instead of if it is appropriate what is going on now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a thing the President loves to do, which is always take our eye off the ball.\u201d Ever since Trump entered Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, two of the persistent unanswered questions about his diagnosis have been what his lung imaging showed and whether he tested negative ahead of the first presidential debate. His physician, Dr. Sean Conley, repeatedly refused to say when pressed directly, saying it was a matter of patient confidentiality. Trump\u2019s other aides have shrugged off the testing question, claiming they didn\u2019t want to look backwards. Pressed Thursday on the same issues, Trump was similarly evasive. But his non-answers were telling. Asked directly if he was diagnosed with pneumonia, Trump said no \u2013 but acknowledged his lungs had been affected. \u201cThey said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected,\u201d he said. It was the first acknowledgment, beyond revealing he\u2019d required supplemental oxygen, that the President\u2019s lungs had been impacted. Trump claimed he \u201cdidn\u2019t do too much asking\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have much of a problem with the lungs,\u201d but added that \u201cobviously I felt there was something missing.\u201d Asked later when his last negative test was before his Covid diagnosis, Trump tried to avoid the question, saying he was tested very often. But he was pressed on if he tested negative on the day of the first presidential debate, to which he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even remember.\u201d His answer affirmed what sources have told CNN: that the testing regimen long touted by the White House as their main coronavirus mitigation measure wasn\u2019t nearly as extensive as they claimed.",

            "article_content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote to advance the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on October 22, setting up her confirmation by the end of the month. \u201cThis is an outstanding nominee,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday. \u201cWe have the votes.\u201d \u201cThis whole business of confirming judges has been, I think, the most important thing we\u2019ve done,\u201d he added. At the fourth day of Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings, Democratic senators moved to indefinitely delay the proceedings because millions of Americans are voting for the next president. They argued that there\u2019s never been a Supreme Court justice nominated this close to the election and confirmed before it. The Senate has taken half the average time to consider the nomination. \u201cShe has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a nomination in an election year after the month of July, and the purpose of doing it is simply to have a justice on the Supreme Court, as the President said, to decide the election, and to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Republicans disagreed, saying that a Republican president and a Republican-led Senate confirming a conservative justice on the Supreme Court is compliant with the Constitution and the Senate\u2019s history. \u201cThe precedent is clear,\u201d said Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cIf the President and Senate are of the same party, the Senate, in all but extraordinary circumstances, confirms that nominee.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that Democrats should try to win elections if they wanted to confirm Supreme Court justices. \u201cY\u2019all have a good chance of winning the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the polls are going to be.\u201d \u201cThank you for acknowledging that,\u201d Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota interjected. The Senate Judiciary committee also heard from witnesses on Thursday, who offered competing arguments over the Supreme Court nomination. They hailed from an assortment of backgrounds. The Republicans\u2019 witnesses spoke to Barrett\u2019s legal credentials, while Democrats chose witnesses that told their personal experiences grappling with the sweeping issues that come before the Court. Two Republican-tapped witnesses, Randal Noel and Pamela Roberts from the American Bar Association\u2019s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, explained why the American Bar Association found Barrett to be \u201cwell qualified\u201d to serve on the high court. Saikrishna Prakash, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, retired Judge Thomas Griffith, who sat on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Laura Wolk, who was a student of Barrett\u2019s at Notre Dame Law School, and Amanda Rauh-Bieri, who clerked for Barrett on the 7th Circuit, all also testified in Barrett\u2019s favor. The Democratic witnesses brought a mix of expert voices and personal stories to discuss hot-button issues including protections provided under the Affordable Care Act and access to abortion. Stacy Staggs, a mother of 7-year-old twins who have multiple pre-existing conditions, and Dr. Farhan Bhatti, the CEO of Care Free Medical, respectively warned that Barrett could undermine the 2010 health care law in an upcoming case and testified to the benefits of it. Crystal Good, who obtained an abortion as a teenager, testified to the importance of reproductive rights, while Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said Barrett posed a threat to civil rights protected under the Constitution. The witness testimonies capped a week of hearings in which Barrett repeatedly decline to preview how she would rule in particular cases. Beyond health care and abortion, Democrats have questioned Barrett on her positions and writings on gun rights, voting rights and whether she would recuse herself on election disputes involving the President. But Barrett has repeatedly declined to engage with the senators\u2019 questions, citing a standard by the justice she would replace, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to not discuss cases that she could decide. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Judiciary Democrats attempted Thursday to indefinitely delay the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, arguing that they\u2019ve had \u201cinadequate\u201d time to review her nomination after CNN\u2019s KFile found additional talks Barrett gave were not listed on her Senate paperwork. \u201cI believe that this rush sham process is a disservice to our committee. She has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Blumenthal pointed to the new reporting surfaced by CNN\u2019s KFile on Wednesday that public calendars from the University of Notre Dame\u2019s law school, where Barrett was a law professor, show at least seven additional talks from 2004 to 2013, including one with the law school\u2019s anti-abortion group, were not listed on her paperwork submitted to the committee. CNN\u2019s KFile could not independently confirm Barrett\u2019s participation in the events, only that they were listed on Notre Dame\u2019s public calendars. \u201cThe consequence of this rushed process is that we have given inadequate scrutiny to this nominee. I move to delay these proceedings so that we can do our job and ask, again, for all the documents,\u201d Blumenthal said Thursday. Despite a tense debate with their Democratic colleagues, however, the panel\u2019s Republicans rejected the attempt to delay Barrett\u2019s nomination until after the election. The committee\u2019s GOP had \u202adecided earlier Thursday to set an October 22 committee vote to advance Barrett for a full Senate vote. CNN had reached out to Barrett\u2019s chambers for comment about the omissions, but they did not respond. Barrett is required to disclose to the Senate Judiciary Committee all public talks she has given in her professional career, a committee staffer has said. The White House told CNN on Wednesday that Barrett had been \u201cnothing but transparent with the committee.\u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont also referred to CNN\u2019s reporting in his argument for Barrett\u2019s nomination to be delayed, saying that \u201crecords of her undisclosed speeches and materials continue to pour in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that Judge Barrett intentionally failed to disclose all these records in the committee. But normally we have enough time to then go back and find ones that they did fail to,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m absolutely suggesting that the mad rush to confirm her has, predictably, bogged them up with that.\u201d Barrett has already faced questions over initially failing to disclose some talks she gave while a law professor at Notre Dame. CNN\u2019s KFile reported last week that Barrett initially did not reveal two talks she gave in 2013 hosted by two anti-abortion student groups on paperwork provided to the Senate. Following CNN\u2019s reporting last week, Barrett submitted supplemental paperwork to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. At her hearing on Tuesday, Barrett said those initial omissions were an oversight due to the large volume of material she had to \u201cfind and remember\u201d over 30 years.

            "article_content": "Thousands of people, some braving hours-long waits, glitches and politically motivated obstruction, are flocking to cast early ballots and writing the story of a pandemic-era election that may change how America votes. Heavy turnout at early voting centers in Georgia and Texas comes as many voters elsewhere take advantage of mail-in ballots, defying President Donald Trump\u2019s misleading attempts to cast the election as the most corrupt in history. Another of the President\u2019s many misinformation efforts \u2013 his claim that the Obama administration spied on his team \u2013 suffered a serious blow on Tuesday when it emerged in a Washington Post report that a Justice Department probe into one key aspect of the conspiracy theory will end without even a public report. The candidates should have been making last minute preparations for the second presidential debate on Thursday night. But a drama initiated by the President\u2019s diagnosis with Covid-19 caused the cancellation of the event after the President refused to take part in a virtual version \u2013 then demanded the reinstatement of the clash when he recovered. Instead, Trump and Biden will take part in dueling town halls on NBC and ABC respectively. The arrangement may be a disservice to voters since they will only have one final chance to see the candidates on stage together on October 22. But given the President\u2019s constant interruptions in the first debate, the format may actually allow a more forensic examination of each candidate\u2019s positions. It is also certain to trigger the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star\u2019s obsession with television ratings. Inspirational scenes of eager voters, in some cases in Georgia waiting eight hours to exercise their democratic rights, reflected enthusiasm on both sides at a raw moment in US history at the tail-end of a tumultuous presidential term.   Voters are facing the most difficult circumstances imaginable given the health emergency. Confidence in the election is also being challenged by court battles in a handful of states arising from apparent GOP efforts to complicate early balloting that Democratic voters prefer. There are also infrastructure problems \u2013 for example the registration portal in Virginia crashed on Tuesday on the last day when citizens can sign up to vote. Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden mostly concentrated Tuesday on winning votes rather than on how they will be counted. The President corralled another large crowd in defiance of his own government\u2019s social distancing recommendations as the pandemic takes a dark turn. He is now promising multiple rallies per day \u2013 potentially risking the health of his supporters and making it likely they will spread Covid-19 into their communities as the predicted fall spike in infections takes hold. Trump shuns opportunity to change tack on coronavirus approach Trump\u2019s trip to Pennsylvania Tuesday highlighted the state\u2019s potential role as a kingmaker on November 3 and forthcoming rallies in Iowa, North Carolina and Georgia show he\u2019s playing defense across swathes of territory he won in 2016. Trump made a clumsy attempt to repair his support with women and suburban voters in Johnstown, a gritty Keystone State coal town where he ran strongly four years ago and which is receptive to his populist economic message and claims Democrats like Biden are to blame for an exodus of jobs. \u201cSuburban women, will you please like me? Please. I saved your damn neighborhood. OK?\u201d Trump said, referring to his claims that Democrats would allow outsiders \u2013 i.e. people of color \u2013 to invade suburban areas. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The President\u2019s event as usual featured few masks, little social distancing and open defiance of the reality of the pandemic. His decision to crank up the pace of rallies also dismayed public health experts, after the government\u2019s top infectious diseases specialist Dr. Anthony Fauci warned on Monday that packed political rallies were \u201casking for trouble.\u201d \u201c(This is) even beyond asking for trouble. It is very self-destructive and actually very destructive behavior,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor College of Medicine\u2019s National School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cIdeally, you don\u2019t hold in-person events at this point. The numbers are going up, they are going up pretty precipitously,\u201d Hotez told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Biden followed Trump\u2019s footsteps from the day before in Florida, another potential pivot state, seeking to accelerate the President\u2019s ebbing support among seniors and to bash him over Covid-19. \u201cTo Donald Trump, you\u2019re expendable. You\u2019re forgettable. You\u2019re virtually nobody,\u201d Biden told seniors in Pembroke Pines, trying to capitalize on polling that has shown him with a double digit lead among a crucial demographic that votes in reliably heavy numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant reckless Covid response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history, the only senior Donald Trump cares about \u2013  the only senior \u2013 is senior Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said. And later Tuesday night, in a move that certainly won\u2019t help the President improve his standing with senior citizens, Trump suggested in a tweet that Biden be admitted to a nursing home. Biden\u2019s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, used her turn at Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court hearing to drive home warnings that the conservative judge\u2019s confirmation would help destroy the Affordable Care Act. Send us your stories about voting issues \u201cPeople are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d Harris told Barrett, hitting another election talking point by warning the judge could also help the Court overturn Roe v. Wade, which enshrined the right to an abortion. Democrats have little chance to stop Republicans ramming the nomination, which will enshrine a 6-3 conservative majority on the Court, through the Senate before the election. But they are using the hearings to drive home their messages that health care is not safe in Trump\u2019s hands. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling With 20 days to go before the election, Biden leads CNN\u2019s national Poll of Polls by 11 percentage points. He is also ahead in most swing states, leaving the President seeking a last-minute comeback. Both parties have been trying to convince voters to cast ballots early, given that crowds at polling places on Election Day could pose a serious health threat given the extraordinary circumstances shaping this election. By noon on the first day of early voting Tuesday in Texas, 50,000 ballots had already been cast in 122 early voting locations in Harris County, which includes the city of Houston. More than 20,000 votes were registered in Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth, according to county officials. In Georgia, a traditionally red state in which Biden is making a strong push, some voters lined up for up to eight hours on the first day of early voting on Monday. A total of 126,000 early votes were cast on Monday alone. Long lines were not the only annoyance, however. Technical problems slowed voting at one super site in Atlanta, heightening tensions in a state blighted by accusations of attempts to make it difficult for voters, especially African Americans, to vote. More than 10.5 million Americans have already voted in the general election, according to an analysis of voting information in 41 states from CNN, Edison Research and Catalist. And more than six million of those ballots come from the 16 states rated most competitive by CNN this cycle. In 2016, some 130 million Americans voted in the election, and turnout is expected to be high this time around. Polling shows that Democrats prefer to vote early or by mail and Republicans, perhaps partly owing to Trump\u2019s incessant assaults on mail-in voting, are more likely to vote in a traditional manner on Election Day. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map The circumstances of this election are unique, given the public health emergency that has already killed more than 215,000 Americans. But the new habits that Americans are making in how they vote could outlast the pandemic. At the same time political acrimony is also building over a series of apparent attempts by Trump\u2019s campaign and Republicans to complicate an early voting process favored by Democrats. An appeals court ruling in Texas on Monday night upheld GOP Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s directive allowing only one ballot drop box location per county. The move leaves Harris County, with a population of 4.7 million, massively underserved. It also means some Texans face long car rides to drop off ballots. California officials meanwhile tried to force Republicans to remove unofficial drop boxes that they say do not benefit from the security and chain of custody required for official drop boxes. In Pennsylvania, a judge over the weekend denied an effort by the Trump campaign and the Republican Party to make ballot drop boxes in the commonwealth unconstitutional. The entire Virginia voter registration system crashed Tuesday on the last day to register. A federal judge re-opened voter registration in the state through Thursday. And a federal judge has rejected Florida\u2019s bid to extend its own voter registration deadline. The wrangles over voting in these and other states threaten to play into the President\u2019s attempts to cast doubt on the probity of an election that he appears to be in danger of losing and which he may challenge in court if he loses after refusing to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power.

            "article_content": "Democrats and Republicans both sought to get a better understanding about how Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett may rule on a challenge to the Affordable Care Act that the high court will hear next month, dancing around the key legal issues surrounding the case. For the second and final day of questioning directly to Barrett in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the health care law was a dominant topic on both sides of the aisle thanks to the looming November case the Supreme Court will hear on a Republican effort to strike down the law \u2013 not to mention Election Day less than three weeks away. LIVE UPDATES: Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing Day 3 Barrett answered questions from Republicans and Democrats on the committee for nearly nine hours on Wednesday \u2013 with a couple of delays due to technical problems in the hearing room \u2013 after an 11-hour session on Tuesday. The Senate Judiciary Committee is moving briskly through Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings, which will conclude on Thursday, putting the GOP-led panel on track to vote on her nomination next week. The Senate is planning to vote on her nomination by the end of the month. Both Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, asked President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee about the legal doctrine of \u201cseverability,\u201d or whether the entire law can stand if one part of it is deemed unconstitutional, during Barrett\u2019s second day of questions before the committee on Wednesday. It\u2019s a concept that could play a key factor in the case from Republican attorneys general and the Trump administration that seeks to strike down the Affordable Care Act case next month. They argue the entire law, commonly known as Obamacare, should be struck down because the law\u2019s individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional. Barrett explained to Feinstein, a California Democrat, that severability was like a game of \u201cJenga.\u201d \u201cIf you picture severability being like a Jenga game, it\u2019s kind of like, if you pull one out, can you pull it out while it all stands? If you pull two out, will it all stand?\u201d Barrett asked. \u201cSeverability is designed to say well would Congress still want the statute to stand even with the provision gone?\u201d Graham, during his questioning of Barrett, seemed to suggest he thought that the Affordable Care Act could be saved because of severability, saying the doctrine\u2019s \u201cgoal is to preserve the statute if that is possible.\u201d \u201cFrom a conservative point of view, generally speaking, we want legislative bodies to make laws, not judges,\u201d Graham said, before asking Barrett, \u201cWould it be further true, if you can preserve a statue you try to, if possible?\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s the law folks,\u201d Graham responded. The challenge to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law from Republican state attorneys general and the Trump administration has become a central issue in this year\u2019s election in part due to Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Democrats have focused their arguments during Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings on the way the law has provided care for individuals. Graham, who is facing a tough reelection fight this year, raised the severability argument as part of his criticism of the health care law, while noting overtly that \u201cObamacare is on the ballot.\u201d But Senate Republicans, who back the lawsuit to kill the law, have backed away from that implication in the lead-up to Election Day. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is also up for reelection, said during his debate Monday that \u201cno one believes\u201d the Supreme Court will strike down the entire law. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, noted at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that the Trump administration\u2019s legal position is for the court to throw out the entire law. At the start of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the third in the four days scheduled, Graham noted the fact that Barrett\u2019s confirmation is on a fast-track. He compared Barrett to Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, saying Barrett was an historic pick for conservative women as the first female nominated to the high court who is \u201cunashamedly pro-life.\u201d Just as they did during Tuesday\u2019s lengthy questioning, Democrats sought to pin down Barrett on a number of topics she could hear in the future, including voting rights and even the prospect that Trump could try to pardon himself. Democrats again tried to pin down Barrett\u2019s views on abortion and the legal issues surrounding Roe v. Wade. Several Democrats asked Barrett whether she agreed with the 1960s Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck down a Connecticut law that made it a crime to provide contraception to married couples. The ruling that personal decisions between spouses were covered by a constitutional right to privacy was cited in Roe v. Wade. Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, pressed Barrett on the ruling, but she said she couldn\u2019t discuss it, while arguing it was nevertheless settled law that no legislature would seek to change. \u201cI think that it\u2019s an academic question that wouldn\u2019t arise but it\u2019s something that I can\u2019t opine on particularly because it does lie at the base of substantive due process doctrine which is something that continues to be litigated in courts today,\u201d Barrett said. Several Democrats pushed Barrett on whether she agreed with notable dissents from the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Barrett clerked for and has called a mentor. Barrett argued on Tuesday she shared Scalia\u2019s philosophy but would be a different judge, though she declined to engage on whether she agree with Scalia\u2019s writings on several occasions. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, came to Barrett\u2019s defense during his questioning of the nominee, accusing Democrats of demeaning her by suggesting she agreed with all of Scalia\u2019s opinions. \u201cMaybe we can put to rest this attempt to constantly leverage the worst interpretations of Justice Scalia\u2019s philosophy, misrepresentations, and attribute them all to you, as if you are the same person,\u201d Hawley said. For the second day, Democrats continued with their questions of Barrett on numerous contentious legal issues, questioning her positions and writings on gun rights, voting rights and whether she would recuse herself on election disputes involving the President that might reach the high court. Repeatedly, Barrett declined to engage with the senators on key issues, citing a standard named for the confirmation hearing of the justice she would replace, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, not to discuss cases that she could be hearing in the future. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pressed Barrett on whether she agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote in his 2013 opinion striking down a key part of the Voting Rights Act that \u201cvoting discrimination still exists, no one doubts that.\u201d Barrett wouldn\u2019t engage on the question. \u201cAny opinion that I would express, and I don\u2019t mean to signal that I disagree with the statement either, what I mean to say is I\u2019m not going to express an opinion because these are very charged issues,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThey have been litigated in the courts so I will not engage on that question.\u201d Later, Harris asked Barrett if she accepted that coronavirus is infectious and if smoking causes cancer, and she agreed. But when Harris then asked whether climate change is happening and is threatening \u201cthe air we breathe,\u201d Barrett said she could not answer because it was about \u201ca very contentious matter of public debate.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point clear that you believe it\u2019s a debatable claim,\u201d Harris responded. Other Democrats ran into similar responses from Barrett. Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, asked Barrett about whether a president has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to pardon himself. How Jaime Harrison's campaign could spend $57 million before Election Day Barrett said she agreed that \u201cno one is above the law,\u201d but she declined to discuss the prospect of a self-pardon. \u201cAs far as I know, that question has never been litigated. That question has never arisen,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThat question may or may not arise, but it\u2019s one that calls for legal analysis of what the scope of the pardon power is. So because it would be opining on an open question, when I haven\u2019t gone through the judicial process to decide it, it\u2019s not one in which I can offer a view.\u201d She once again avoided answering a question on whether the President could delay the date of the November election, arguing it was a hypothetical. Klobuchar touched on another legal controversy ahead of the election, asking Barrett whether mail-in voting was essential for millions of Americans in the middle of the pandemic. Barrett did not engage, also saying she did not recall if she had previously voted by mail. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter of policy on which I can\u2019t express a view,\u201d Barrett said. On questions about health care, Democrats have focused on Barrett\u2019s criticisms of Roberts\u2019 2012 ruling to uphold Obamacare, which she made before she was appointed to the federal appeals bench in 2017, arguing they are a sign that she would try to overturn it. Leahy pushed Barrett on her writings further on Wednesday, asking whether she had ever spoken out or written in defense of the Affordable Care Act, given her well-documented criticisms. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never had occasion to speak on a policy question,\u201d Barrett responded. Republicans have defended Barrett and her qualifications for the high court, accusing Democrats of trying to score political points by attacking her over health care. Republicans hit back at Democrats over the calls to respond to Barrett\u2019s confirmation occurring so close to an election by adding seats to the Supreme Court next year, should Joe Biden win the White House and Democrats take control of the Senate. \u201cWe have seen repeatedly Joe Biden and Kamala Harris refuse to answer whether they would pack the court,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Monday that he\u2019s \u201cnot a fan\u201d of court-packing, providing his clearest position on an issue he has sought to avoid discussing following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of court-packing, but I don\u2019t want to get off on that whole issue,\u201d Biden told CNN affiliate WKRC in Cincinnati. \u201cI want to keep focused. The President would love nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would, in fact, pack the court or not pack the court.\u201d Last week, Biden told reporters he would not address the issue until after the November 3 election, but his comments Monday go further than when he has demurred in his recent answers on the issue following the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Ginsburg. With the Republican-controlled Senate likely to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s third Supreme Court justice, creating a solid 6-3 conservative majority, some progressive members of the Democratic Party have floated the idea of expanding the size of the high court \u2013 and adding liberal justices \u2013 should Biden win and Republicans lose control of the Senate. Some of those in the progressive wing of the party see adding seats to the court as the only way to protect landmark decisions like the one made in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion in the US. Biden, a former longtime senator, is an institutionalist who has centered his campaign on a return to normalcy and civility. Polls show he is winning over moderates, and he is hesitant to give Trump any new ammunition to link him to his party\u2019s progressive wing. As the so-called court-packing concept has increasingly entered the fray in recent weeks, both Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, have refused to answer questions about their positions on it, including during their respective debates with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. During the primary, Biden was consistent in his opposition to court-packing. He said during a Democratic presidential debate last October that he \u201cwould not get into court-packing,\u201d adding, \u201cWe had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.\u201d He reiterated his position and this rationale when a voter asked him about his position on expanding the court during a town hall in Iowa later in December. He also told the Iowa Starting Line earlier this year that he opposed court-packing because Democrats will \u201clive to rue the day.\u201d For her part, Harris would not answer questions from Pence when he pressed her on the issue during their debate last week, with the vice president saying, \u201cYou gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\u201d \u201cThe American people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, the straight answer is, they are going to pack the Supreme Court,\u201d Pence claimed at the debate. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett declined to preview how she would rule on potential cases as she faced questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, seeking to portray herself as an independent judge without an agenda. \u201cI\u2019ve made no commitment to anyone, not in this Senate, not over at the White House, about how I would decide any case,\u201d said Barrett. Barrett, who would replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said Tuesday that she shared the same judicial philosophy as the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who she clerked for in the 1990s and pioneered the practice of adhering to legal text and the original intentions of those who drafted the Constitution. But she made clear to distinguish herself from her mentor. Democrats grill Barrett on health care and abortion as Trump pick refuses to say how she'll rule \u201cI want to be careful to say that if I\u2019m confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett,\u201d she said. Here are some takeaways from the first day of questioning. Barrett repeatedly declined to give her views on high-profile, contentious issues like abortion rights and the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. She was repeatedly asked about her views of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case establishing a constitutional right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed its central holding in 1992. \u201cI don\u2019t have any agenda,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cI have no agenda to try to overrule Casey. I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come.\u201d \u201cI will obey all the rules of stare decisis,\u201d she later added, referring to the principle of adhering to past cases. After posing a series of questions on the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion rulings, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said it was \u201cdistressing not to get a straight answer\u201d from Barrett. Barrett also rejected Democratic senators\u2019 questions on the Affordable Care Act, citing Ginsburg\u2019s response to answering hypothetical questions during her hearing in 1993. \u201cNo hints, no previews, no forecasts,\u201d said Barrett. Democrats, however, were undeterred, repeatedly raising the upcoming case and warning the law is in danger. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin put up a chart showing state by state how many Americans would lose their insurance if the court terminated the 2010 health care law after it hears a case on November 10. Chief Justice John Roberts and the court has twice ruled to uphold the law. But Republicans in Congress have since stripped out the individual insurance mandate, a component that Roberts deemed a tax that was crucial to the law\u2019s constitutionality. In 2017, Barrett wrote that he had \u201cpushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\u201d McConnell says 'no one believes' Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare despite Barrett confirmation Barrett acknowledged on Tuesday that she did \u201ccritique\u201d Roberts\u2019 reasoning, but attempted to assure Democrats by saying that the court\u2019s upcoming case concerns a different legal doctrine known as severability, or whether the entire law can stand if one part of it is deemed illegal, even though the Trump administration is seeking to strike down the entire law. \u201cI am not hostile to the ACA,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Barrett added later on. \u201cI\u2019m just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law.\u201d Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley directly asked Barrett if she had committed to the President \u201cor anyone else\u201d that she would vote to take down the Affordable Care Act if confirmed to the court. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she responded. \u201cI was never asked, and if I had been, that would have been a short conversation.\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham used his opening statement to defend the Republicans\u2019 opposition to Obamacare, a day after Democrats highlighted their constituents\u2019 reliance on the law for their health insurance. \u201cIf it were up to me, bureaucrats would not be administering health care from Washington, people in South Carolina would be running health care,\u201d said Graham, who is running for reelection in a close race. \u201cThe difference between analyzing a lawsuit and having a political argument is fundamentally different.\u201d How you know Lindsey Graham is starting to panic Grassley said that Democrats \u201cmisrepresent or claim to know\u201d Barrett\u2019s views on the constitutionality of the 2010 health care law, but are \u201cpeddling\u201d a \u201ctotal fiction\u201d while \u201cpainting\u201d Barrett as \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201con a mission to scrap the health care law.\u201d \u201cFrankly, that\u2019s absurd,\u201d said Grassley. \u201cNot only is Judge Barrett a mother of seven, she has children with preexisting medical challenges of their own,\u201d said the Iowa Republican. \u201cNo one on this committee, or anyone, has any right to suggest that she doesn\u2019t care about access to health care or protection for the vulnerable.\u201d Last month, Trump said he thought the election would \u201cend up in the Supreme Court,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s very important that we have nine justices.\u201d Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy asked \u202aBarrett if she would commit to recusing herself from any case related to the November elections. She declined. \u201cI commit to you to fully and faithfully applying the law of recusal, and part of that law is to consider any appearance questions,\u201d said Barrett. \u201cI will apply the factors that other justices have before me in determining whether the circumstances require my recusal or not, but I can\u2019t offer a legal conclusion right now about the outcome of the decision I would reach.\u201d Barrett declines to commit to recusing herself from a Trump election case Barrett later added: \u201cI certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.\u201d Barrett initially declined to say whether every president should commit to the peaceful transfer of power, saying that a question from New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker drew her into a political dispute between the president and his opponents. \u201cTo the extent that this is a political controversy right now, as I said, I want to stay out of it and I don\u2019t want to express a view,\u201d said Barrett. But after Booker pressed, Barrett touted the country\u2019s nonviolent practice of electing its leaders. \u201cOne of the beauties of America from the beginning of the republic is that we have had peaceful transfers of power, and that disappointed voters have accepted the new leaders that come into office,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true in every country, and I think it is part of the genius of our Constitution, and the good faith and goodwill of the American people, that we haven\u2019t had the situations that have arisen in so many other countries \u2026 where those issues have been present.\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris, speaking in the early evening, criticized Republicans for rushing to confirm Barrett rather than passing additional legislation to address the coronavirus pandemic and continued the Democrats\u2019 line of questioning on the upcoming Obamacare case. Harris said that Republicans have realized that the Affordable Care Act is \u201cworking too well, and helping too many people to repeal it without facing serious political consequences.\u201d \u201cBut what are they doing? After suffering the backlash they provoked by targeting the law in Congress, they decided instead to circumvent voters and try to strike down the Affordable Care Act through the courts,\u201d she added. Harris then then ticked off the numbers of Americans in Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Iowa who could lose their insurance if the law was struck down \u2013 all states where Republican Judiciary Committee members are running for reelection. While Barrett did not provide a preview of how she would rule on potential cases, she openly discussed her personal life and the nomination process. She noted her family owns a gun, that she plays the piano and described her decision with her husband Jesse to adopt two children from Haiti and raise them along with her other five children. In response to other questions, she also called racism and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation \u201cabhorrent,\u201d and recounted watching the video of the police killing George Floyd with Vivian. Amy Coney Barrett says police killing of George Floyd was 'very emotional' for her family \u201cWe wept together in my room,\u201d she said. Barrett also gave a surprisingly candid response to a question from Graham on how it felt to be nominated for the Supreme Court of the United States. Barrett said that she tried \u201ca media blackout for the sake of my mental health,\u201d but is \u201caware of a lot of caricatures that are floating around\u201d of her and her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret to any of you, or to the American people, that this is a really difficult \u2013 some might say excruciating \u2013 process,\u201d she said. \u201cJesse and I had a very brief amount of time to make a decision with momentous consequences for our family. We knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked. And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it because what sane person would go through that if there wasn\u2019t a benefit on the other side?\u201d She said the \u201cbenefit\u201d would be her commitment \u201cto the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court and dispensing equal justice for all.\u201d Before the hearing, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said on a call with reporters that Senate Democrats \u201chave no magic panacea\u201d to block the nominee. Republicans are well aware. Graham said on Tuesday afternoon he didn\u2019t think that Barrett\u2019s performance impacted Republicans\u2019 plan to confirm her by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by the demeanor of the committee \u2013 really good, hard-probing questions but respectfully delivered,\u201d said Graham. \u201cI think the judge has done a good job. So, so far so good.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information from the hearing.

            "article_content": "Endangered Senate Republicans have a new running mate in the battle to keep their narrow majority: Amy Coney Barrett. As President Donald Trump\u2019s standing has deteriorated, they are aligning themselves closely with his Supreme Court nominee, hoping their aggressive push to confirm her to the bench before Election Day will be enough to energize their base, fill their campaign coffers and overcome the drag at the top of the ticket. At Tuesday\u2019s confirmation hearing, Republicans in tight races in North Carolina, Iowa, Texas and South Carolina were quick to rally to Barrett\u2019s defense and are signaling they\u2019ll vote to confirm her to the court just days before the November election. Republicans are calculating that getting Barrett on the bench will overcome backlash from voters, given that polls show clear majorities believe that the winner of the November 3 elections should make the lifetime appointment \u2013 and the fact the Republican senators all took the opposite stance in 2016, when they opposed advancing President Barack Obama\u2019s pick because, they said, March of that year was too close to Election Day. Takeaways from Day 2 of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings \u201cIt\u2019s not a close issue in South Carolina \u2013 for liberal judges or conservative judges, overwhelmingly conservative judges,\u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham told CNN. \u201cI think that resonates with South Carolinians.\u201d At the hearing, Texas Sen. John Cornyn received praise from his supporters after asking Barrett to hold up a blank notepad to show that she wasn\u2019t referencing any notes in her testimony. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d Cornyn said. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst pointed out, \u201cI am pro-life,\u201d while giving Barrett a chance to push back on Democrats\u2019 line of questioning. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis read off a list of tweets attacking Barrett in an apparent attempt to stoke outrage at her treatment by her critics. And Graham defended his own health care position while noting he was being swamped by outside money in his race. And with polls showing Trump losing in nearly every battleground state, Republicans say they need to run ahead of the President in their states \u2013 and they hope Barrett\u2019s nomination will give them a boost down the final stretch. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to outperform him in the state,\u201d Cornyn told CNN when asked about Trump. \u201cI think it reminds people it does make a difference who is president,\u201d Cornyn said of the Barrett hearings. \u201cHe made a generational mark on the judiciary with our help \u2013 and people understand that\u2019s important. I think that could well help him, and I\u2019m proud to support the President\u2019s nominee.\u201d With the GOP clinging to its 53-47 majority, Democrats see a growing number of pickup opportunities across the country and are campaigning hard on the economic hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic. And on Tuesday, Democrats were careful to avoid letting the confirmation hearings devolve into ugly moments that could give the GOP fresh ammunition in the final three weeks of the campaign. Graham sets the stage for Barrett's quick confirmation as hearings get underway \u201cThey are just hell-bent on getting this done as fast as possible, and that\u2019s because at least four of them are in death-defying reelection campaigns,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said Tuesday after the hearing. \u201cThey want to get out of town as fast as they can.\u201d Perhaps nowhere has the dynamic been more pronounced than with Graham, who is locked in a dead heat in his bid for reelection in South Carolina, and reversed his past opposition to moving on a Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year to now leading the charge to get Barrett to the bench at a lightning-quick pace. Virtually everywhere Graham goes he mentions the Supreme Court fight, whether it was in a question about the coronavirus during his Senate debate earlier this month or on Fox News as he mentions Barrett\u2019s confirmation and pitches for dollars in the next breath while he reads off the name of his campaign website. \u201cI\u2019ve been following my race pretty close, probably closer than most. I\u2019m working hard. I\u2019m being challenged unlike any other time,\u201d Graham said Tuesday night. \u201cI like where I\u2019m at.\u201d In Barrett\u2019s second day of hearings on Tuesday, Graham was quick to link the proceedings to his race, subtly referencing his Democratic foe, Jaime Harrison, who has broken fundraising records in the contest after raising a staggering $57 million in the last quarter alone. Graham joked to Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse that \u201cme and you are going to come closer and closer about regulating money.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on out there but I can tell you there\u2019s a lot of money being raised in this campaign,\u201d said Graham. \u201cI\u2019d like to know where the hell some of it\u2019s coming from.\u201d The art of the dodge: Amy Coney Barrett's 11 hours in the Senate hot seat In his opening remarks Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary chairman sought to blunt Democratic attacks that Barrett would shift the Supreme Court further to the right and undermine the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf it were up to me, bureaucrats would not be administering health care from Washington, people in South Carolina would be running health care,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIf it were up to me, we would get more money under Obamacare than we do today; 35% would not go to three states, and sick people would be covered.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s the political debate we\u2019re involved in a campaign in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fate will be left up to the people of South Carolina.\u201d He also played up his relationship with the President, mentioning their golf outings, and said he didn\u2019t know if Trump was listening before praising his nominee as highly qualified and \u201cone of the greatest picks President Trump could\u2019ve made.\u201d Asked later about the propriety of mentioning his campaign, Graham said it\u2019s \u201cpretty appropriate for me to respond to political attacks in a political way.\u201d \u201cI thought it was fair for me to say my position is there\u2019s a better way for South Carolina,\u201d said Graham, who noted that Democrats mentioned three different times during Monday\u2019s hearing the impact Barrett could have on his state if she joined a conservative majority to strike down the Affordable Care Act. And it happened on Tuesday as well. Democrats repeatedly warned that Barrett would threaten the health care of America, one of their main campaign attacks against Republicans. The court will hear arguments on the landmark health care law\u2019s constitutionality a week after Election Day. Democrats grill Barrett on health care and abortion as Trump pick refuses to say how she'll rule Durbin said Tuesday that in South Carolina, 242,000 people would lose their insurance coverage if the Affordable Care Act were eliminated and coverage for 2 million in the state with preexisting conditions would be threatened. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential nominee, ticked off the numbers of Americans in Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Iowa who could lose their insurance if the ACA were struck down, mentioning the states where Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee are running for reelection. Tillis, one of the most vulnerable Republicans, spent much of his time in the hearing fending off health care attacks and defending Barrett. He said the left\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal \u201ccould be Medicare for none.\u201d He said that while \u201cwe need to protect everyone,\u201d the ACA had failed in containing costs and in its promise that \u201cif you like your doctor you can keep it.\u201d Tillis also attacked Democrats on abortion, saying that his granddaughter had been born three weeks premature and they would support a \u201cradical policy that would allow the right to take that child away.\u201d The senator, who recently tested positive for coronavirus, also put into the record a letter from his doctor that he had \u201cfully complied\u201d with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, though he has yet to say if he has now tested negative. Cornyn, a former head of the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, said of the Barrett nomination\u2019s impact on the battle for the majority: \u201cI think everything is a little different by the state.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019ll probably be a fundraising bonanza for my opponent,\u201d he told CNN on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett brought no prepared notes to her Senate hearing on Tuesday and, at the prompting of a Republican senator, held up a blank notepad on her desk. Supporters circulated a photo to highlight her agile intelligence and to show, as the Republican National Committee put it, that she offered senators \u201ca master class on the Constitution.\u201d But that empty notepad also provided a metaphor for how Barrett came ready to give away nothing of her legal thinking and offered a master class of a different sort. Takeaways from Day 2 of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings As Barrett declined to answer substantive questions from Senate Judiciary Committee members, she deftly gave little material for any probing follow-up. She offered short, minimal answers and, unlike past nominees, avoided elaborating on some general legal principles. Her pattern \u2013 in a confirmation ritual known for bobbing and weaving \u2013 was reinforced by the pattern of many senators. Republicans and Democrats engaged in lengthy speeches designed more for the election season and their political agendas, than true scrutiny of the nominee who would succeed liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and possibly transform the Supreme Court for a generation. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz spent nearly his entire 30-minute allotted time expounding on his own legal views and then said, \u201cJudge Barrett, I\u2019m not going to ask you to respond to any of that. But I do want to shift to a different topic, which is a bit more about you personally, your background.\u201d His question: \u201cDo you speak any foreign languages?\u201d She said the French she studied in school was rusty. \u201cHow about music, do you play any instruments?\u201d Cruz then asked. Piano, Barrett said, quipping with Cruz about their children\u2019s piano lessons. McConnell says 'no one believes' Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare despite Barrett confirmation Barrett, who is on her way to a swift confirmation by the Republican-dominated Senate, was nothing if not patient throughout. Her expression barely shifted, with eyes focused, lips pursed, a portrait of seriousness. She kept her hands in her lap and rarely gestured. Only in a few instances did she sound defensive, as when Connecticut Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal tried to pin her down on her legal position on Roe v. Wade, in light of personal statements she had made against abortion. As Blumenthal pressed her to say whether she believed the 1973 milestone that gave women nationwide a right to abortion was correctly decided, she said, \u201cWhat I said was that Roe held that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy, that (the 1992) Casey reaffirmed that holding and indeed many cases after Casey have affirmed that holding again \u2026  So I think we might be talking past each other because the statements that I signed were statements of my personal beliefs.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, affirming Roe, said government may not put an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman seeking an abortion. She told senators she sets aside her personal beliefs and preferences as she decides cases. Antonin Scalia's legacy looms over the Amy Coney Barrett hearings Barrett also declined to give her views on the 2015 gay rights landmark, Obergefell v. Hodges, that declared same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. She declined to comment on the Trump administration\u2019s current litigation to eviscerate the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which brought new health coverage to more than 20 million Americans. She minimized her past criticism of Supreme Court rulings, from 2012 and 2015, upholding Obamacare. \u201cI have no hostility to the ACA or any other law,\u201d she said. At several points she invoked a mantra from Ginsburg\u2019s 1993 Senate hearings when she vowed not to give any hints about her possible rulings once on the high court. But Ginsburg had notably commented on abortion rights in 1993, saying the constitutional right to end a pregnancy was \u201ccentral to a woman\u2019s life, to her dignity.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a decision that she must make for herself,\u201d Ginsburg told senators in her 1993 hearing. \u201cAnd when government controls that decision for her, she\u2019s being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.\u201d The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare The replacement of Ginsburg with Barrett will transform the bench into a 6-3 conservative majority and offer the potential to return America\u2019s high court to another era, rolling back guarantees for individual rights, such as abortion, and reversing government regulatory efforts, such as over the environment, labor and public safety. Barrett, who would be Trump\u2019s third appointee to the court, told senators that she would bring \u201cno agenda\u201d to the bench. \u201cI have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come,\u201d she said. Senators have long faced frustration in drawing out answers from Supreme Court candidates. And nominees have long struggled with how to answer without saying anything that would breach judicial independence or, more immediately, cost them votes toward confirmation. \u201cThe approach was to avoid giving specific responses to any direct questions on legal issues likely to come before the court,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in 1981 as a Reagan administration lawyer assisting with the nomination of Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, \u201cbut demonstrating in the response a firm command of the subject area and awareness of the relevant precedents and arguments.\u201d Notable dissents from Judge Amy Coney Barrett When Roberts himself was before senators in 2005, he addressed legal principles at length without revealing specific positions \u2013 with memorable assertions such as, \u201cJudges are like umpires. Umpires don\u2019t make the rules, they apply them \u2026 Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.\u201d Roberts was more willing to expound on his view of the legal concept of \u201cstare decisis,\u201d under which the justices adhere to their precedents. He said some cases could be reversed over time as justices chipped away at the cornerstones of a case, weakening its principle. Yet Roberts added, \u201cI do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness.\u201d In her past writings, Barrett has suggested traditional adherence to precedent should not tightly bind justices in situations when a justice might regard a precedent as inconsistent with his or her interpretation of the Constitution. \u201cIf a question comes up before me about whether Casey or any other case should be overruled,\u201d Barrett told California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein Tuesday morning, \u201cI will follow the law of stare decisis \u2026 applying it as the court has articulated it, applying all of the factors: reliance, workability, being undermined by later facts in law. \u2026 I will follow the law.\u201d Really, Sen. Cruz? This is what you asked Judge Barrett Barrett was elusive on whether she would recuse herself from cases involving the 2020 election \u2013 an area of inquiry because Trump has suggested he might need her vote. \u201cI think this will end up at the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said last month about the possibility of a presidential ballot controversy. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very important that we have nine justices.\u201d To Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, Barrett said she would weigh the circumstances of individual cases as she decided the recusal issue. \u201cI can\u2019t offer a legal conclusion right now about the outcome of the decision I would reach,\u201d she said. Barrett then added, \u201cI have had no conversation with the President or any of his staff on how I might rule in that case. It would be a gross violation of judicial independence for me to make any such commitment or for me to be asked about that case and how I would rule. I also think it would be a complete violation of the independence of the judiciary for anyone to put a justice on the court as a means of obtaining a particular result.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett said she had made no commitments to the President or anyone else about how she might rule on a case aimed at dismantling the Affordable Care Act or on a potential dispute in the upcoming presidential election. Barrett vowed that she had not discussed specific cases, like the upcoming challenge to the Affordable Care Act, with Trump or anyone else when she was nominated to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death threw the Senate into a pitched election-year confirmation battle that could swing the court in a more conservative direction. \u201cAbsolutely not. I was never asked, and if I had been that would\u2019ve been a short conversation,\u201d Barrett said at Tuesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing when she was asked whether she had committed to vote to repeal the health care law. But during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, which lasted more than 11 hours, Barrett repeatedly declined to answer questions from Democrats on how she might rule on a range of topics, from the Affordable Care Act to Roe v. Wade and the high court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. She also declined to say whether she would consider recusing herself from potential upcoming cases, including election disputes. \u201cIt\u2019s distressing not to get a straight answer,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said after posing a series of questions to Barrett on the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark abortion rulings. Feinstein pressed Barrett to explain whether she agreed with the late Justice Antonin Scalia that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. Barrett, however, invoked Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s answer that she wasn\u2019t going to grade precedent. \u201cI completely understand why you are asking the question, but again I can\u2019t pre-commit, or say yes, I\u2019m going in with some agenda, because I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t have any agenda,\u201d Barrett said. Takeaways from Day 2 of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings The back-and-forth between Democrats and the nominee kicked off a lengthy two days of questioning. Democrats sought to elicit answers from Barrett on a number of controversial topics the Supreme Court could take up, including abortion, gun rights, voting rights, same-sex marriage and, in particular, health care. The Supreme Court will hear a case on November 10 on whether to strike down the Affordable Care Act, which means Barrett could be on the bench if Republicans are successful in confirming her before Election Day, November 3. The legal challenge to former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law loomed over Tuesday\u2019s hearing: Democrats raised the care that the Affordable Care Act has provided to individuals, continuing their theme from Monday, while Republicans attacked the law. The presidential election and the upcoming health care case loomed over Tuesday\u2019s hearing. In the evening, the Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, a California senator who is on the committee, attacked Trump and Republicans for turning to the courts when they failed to repeal the health law themselves. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and all its protections hinge on this seat and the outcome of this hearing,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd I believe it\u2019s very important the American people understand the issues at stake, and what\u2019s at play.\u201d Throughout the day, Barrett pushed back on Democrats\u2019 arguments that her previous criticism of Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate in 2012 was a sign of how she would potentially rule in next month\u2019s case. She said that her writing then was in an academic setting and argued that it had no bearing on the upcoming challenge the law. \u201cI am not hostile to the ACA. I\u2019m not hostile to any statute that you pass,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI apply the law, I follow the law, you make the policy.\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, argued that her criticism of Roberts over the health care ruling was a key indicator of her views, prompting Barrett to object to the assertion. \u201cI am not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she responded. \u201cI\u2019m just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law.\u201d Republicans sought to head off the Democratic criticisms of the legal effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham kicked off Tuesday\u2019s hearing with a sustained attack on health care law. \u201cFrom my point of view, Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe want something better. We want something different.\u201d Frequently, Barrett fell back on a standard that\u2019s been attributed to Ginsburg, whom Barrett would replace, not to discuss specific cases because they could come before the court. Under questioning from Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, Barrett would not say whether she would recuse herself from cases involving the 2020 election. Leahy argued Barrett should recuse herself, if confirmed, because Trump has said he\u2019s moving a nomination forward because the election is likely to go before the Supreme Court. \u201cI have made no precommitments to anyone,\u201d Barrett said, arguing the court had a legal process to consider recusal. \u201cI can\u2019t offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process.\u201d Later, Barrett said she hoped \u201call members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.\u201d Barrett also declined to say whether the Constitution gave Trump the authority to postpone the date of the election. Doing so would require an act of Congress, but Barrett declined to weigh in, saying that doing so would make her \u201cbasically a legal pundit.\u201d She also declined to discuss questions about what constitutes voter intimidation. And she responded to a question from Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey about Trump refusing to accept a peaceful transition by saying she didn\u2019t want to get pulled into the \u201cpolitical controversy.\u201d Barrett apologized on Tuesday for a comment she made early in the hearing saying she would never discriminate \u201con the basis of sexual preference,\u201d a term that implies being gay or lesbian is a choice. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean and, you know, would never mean to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cSo if I did, I greatly apologize for that. I simply meant to be referring to Obergefell\u2019s holding with respect to same-sex marriage.\u201d All 22 senators on the committee will have another chance to question Barrett on Wednesday in a 20-minute second round of questions. Outside witnesses will testify on Thursday, and Graham has said the committee is expected to vote on Barrett\u2019s nomination on October 22, setting up a Senate floor vote one week before the election. Graham walked Barrett through her judicial philosophy in the opening round of questions. Barrett explained that she shared a philosophy with Scalia, whom she clerked for, but she argued she would not be an identical justice if she is confirmed. \u201cIf I\u2019m confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so because originalists don\u2019t always agree.\u201d Graham asked Barrett whether she owned a gun, which she said she did. \u201cDo you think you could fairly decide a case even though you own a gun?\u201d Graham asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she responded. Partisan battle lines over Barrett\u2019s nomination were quickly drawn on Monday during the first day of hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee as Democrats and Republicans offered up sharply divergent narratives of the high court fight to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg\u2019s death. In opening statements delivered on Monday, Republican senators praised Barrett\u2019s judicial qualifications in glowing terms and emphasized her capability as a working mom, while Democrats warned that health care protections and the Affordable Care Act are at stake, and under threat, in the nomination fight. Republicans, who hold the Senate majority, are moving quickly to fill the vacancy with their sights set on confirmation ahead of Election Day. Democrats, in the minority, have limited options at their disposal to fight back. But they have been preparing a plan of attack that will focus squarely on issues they believe will resonate with voters while excoriating Republicans for rushing the nomination, an effort designed to avoid a spectacle that could damage their efforts to win back the Senate majority and the White House. While Democrats couldn\u2019t get Barrett to weigh in on the Roe v. Wade decision, they pressed her to explain past criticisms of the abortion rights ruling that conservatives \u2013 and the President \u2013 have sought to overturn. Leahy asked Barrett about an ad she signed that was published in 2006 in the South Bend Tribune describing the legacy of Roe v. Wade as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d pushing her on the views of the group that sponsored the ad, saying the group  believes that in vitro fertilization (IVF) is equivalent to manslaughter. \u201cDo you agree with them that IVF is tantamount to manslaughter,\u201d Leahy asked. Barrett said that she had signed the statement \u201con the way out of church,\u201d because it was consistent with the views of her church. \u201cIt simply said we support the right to life from conception to natural death,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cit took no position on IVF.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, tried to draw on Barrett\u2019s previous writings on \u201csuper precedent,\u201d or Supreme Court precedents that are so well settled there\u2019s no legal debate over them. Barrett would not say that Roe v. Wade fell into that category. \u201cThe way I was using it in the article that you\u2019re reading from was to define cases that are so well settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn\u2019t fall in that category. And scholars across the spectrum say that doesn\u2019t mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively it does mean that it\u2019s not a case that everyone has accepted and doesn\u2019t call for its overruling.\u201d The panel\u2019s Democrats did not take up questions about her religion, as they\u2019ve made clear they want to steer clear of questions about whether Barrett\u2019s devout Catholic faith will impact her views, an issue that arose during her 2017 confirmation hearings to sit on a federal appeals court and prompted an uproar among Republicans. Republicans emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications to be appointed to the high court. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who like Graham is up for reelection this cycle, made a point for Barrett to display the empty notepad sitting in front of her, showing she was answering senators\u2019 questions without using notes. Cornyn and the other Republicans also emphasized Barrett\u2019s view that the legislative branch makes policy and judges only interpret the law. \u201cI think part of the rationale for courts adhering to the rule of law and for judges taking great care to avoid imposing their policy preferences is that it\u2019s inconsistent with democracy,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cNobody wants to live in a court with the law of Amy, I can ensure you my children don\u2019t even want to do that. So I can\u2019t as a judge get up on the bench and say, \u2018You\u2019re going to live by my policy preferences because I have life tenure and you can\u2019t kick me out if you don\u2019t like them.\u2019\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice known for his rigid conservatism and wicked turn of phrase, might appreciate that his specter lurks over the Amy Coney Barrett hearings. It recalls one of his most memorable lines, as he took issue with a controversial standard for state aid to religious schools. He likened a decades-old rule \u2013 criticized by justices but never overruled \u2013 to \u201csome ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in his grave and shuffles abroad \u2026 frightening the little children and school attorneys.\u201d Scalia was not a man of ambiguity. His views were black and white. Like President Ronald Reagan who appointed him to the high court in 1986, he was a defining figure who inspired legions of young conservatives who held him up as a model of judicial brilliance, including Barrett. 5 takeaways from Monday's Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett \u201cI felt like I knew the justice before I ever met him, because I had read so many of his colorful, accessible opinions,\u201d Barrett, who clerked for Scalia in 1998 and 1999, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. \u201cMore than the style of his writing, though, it was the content of Justice Scalia\u2019s reasoning that shaped me. \u2026 A judge must apply the law as written, not as the judge wishes it were.\u201d At the White House on September 26, Barrett said of Scalia, \u201cHis judicial philosophy is mine too.\u201d Tuesday, Barrett emphasized, however, that she would not be a carbon copy of the late justice. \u201cI want to be careful to say that if I\u2019m confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so because originalists don\u2019t always agree and neither do textualists.\u201d Senate Democrats regard the Scalia philosophy as a path to the diminishment of individual rights and have warned of the continuing rightward turn of the Supreme Court. Scalia\u2019s approach was the exact opposite, in fact, of that of pioneering civil rights Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Barrett would succeed. During Scalia\u2019s nearly 30-year tenure (1986-2016) he promoted \u201coriginalism,\u201d a doctrine that looks to the framers\u2019 understanding of the Constitution in the 18th Century. No one can recuse Amy Coney Barrett from a Trump election case but herself In his view, that meant no abortion rights but a robust Second Amendment. He believed in strong executive power and little regulation of money in elections. He voted consistently against gay rights and angrily dissented when the justices in 2015 declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Irreverence was his signature. \u201cGet over it,\u201d he told audiences for years after the 2000 Florida election case of Bush v. Gore. Scalia voted with the narrow majority in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush over Vice President Al Gore. When Scalia refused to recuse himself from a 2004 case involving his friend and duck-hunting partner Vice President Dick Cheney, the justice wrote a 21-page public memo defending himself. In a university appearance around the same time, he closed his defense before students with the memorable: \u201cQuack, quack.\u201d Scalia was famously friendly with Ginsburg \u2013 something several Republican senators noted on Monday. She said he was one of the few people who made her laugh. Ginsburg added of Scalia in one interview, \u201cI love him. But sometimes I\u2019d like to strangle him.\u201d 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg He could never convince Ginsburg to adopt his judicial approach, but he influenced a generation of right-wing students. In the early 1980s as a law professor at the University of Chicago, Scalia was faculty adviser to the newly founded Federalist Society, begun by students at the Chicago campus and at Yale University. Scalia\u2019s reputation grew as did the Federalist Society, and in the years after his 2016 death, his presence continued to loom, embraced by President Donald Trump. Scalia\u2019s wife, Maureen, has been invited to the White House on multiple occasions and was in the Rose Garden for the September 26 unveiling of the Barrett nomination. In her academic writing before joining the bench, Barrett noted Scalia\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, in 2012 and 2015 dissenting opinions. Scalia wrote in the 2015 case, \u201cWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare,\u201d referring to the acronym for the Supreme Court of the United States, as he contended the justices essentially rewrote the law to uphold it. Also during that term ending in June 2015, Scalia\u2019s last full session before his death, the justices declared a right to same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court hasn't been this conservative since the 1930s Scalia derided the reasoning of Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, particularly its opening references to liberty, and had this jab for the four liberals who formed the gay-marriage majority: \u201cIf, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \u2018The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\u2019 I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\u201d A new court has emerged since Scalia died four years ago, with two Trump appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. And now Judge Barrett, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, stands ready to shift the court even more to the right, even more in Scalia\u2019s image.",

            "article_content": "The first day of confirmation hearings for President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett featured plenty of fiery speeches \u2013 many of them aimed at next month\u2019s presidential election rather than the nominee herself. Democrats focused more on the Affordable Care Act, and Trump\u2019s backing of a lawsuit that would invalidate the law \u2013 a hearing scheduled for November 10. Republicans defended the decision to confirm Barrett so close to the election and sought to preempt any questions about her Catholic faith, mainly by criticizing Democratic comments from 2017. In fact, viewers might be forgiven if they forgot at times that this was a Supreme Court confirmation rather than a political convention. Here are five takeaways from day one of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings: Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham acknowledged the elephant in the room at the outset of a four-day confirmation hearing process: Nobody\u2019s mind on the committee is going to be changed by what transpires in the Senate hearing room. Democrats argue Barrett threatens Obamacare at confirmation hearing while GOP touts her abilities \u201cThis is probably not about persuading each other, unless something really dramatic happens,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAll Republicans will vote yes, and all Democrats will vote no.\u201d As a result, both sides have a clear eye to the election three weeks away as they debate the Supreme Court nominee \u2013 and as they will question Barrett over the next two days. Four Republicans on the committee, including Graham, are up for reelection next month. And Sen. Kamala Harris of California is the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. Democrats put their clear focus on the threat Obamacare faces when a Republican-led, and Trump-backed, case to strike it down goes before the Supreme Court just a week after the election. The message that health care was at risk for millions of Americans was one that helped Democrats win over voters during the 2018 election and take back the House. Republicans, meanwhile, went after Democrats for attacks on Barrett, and in particular her faith \u2013 while frequently citing the bitter 2018 fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, which helped Republicans in several 2018 Senate contests in red states. \u201cWe all watched the hearings for Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d said Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. \u201cIt was a freak show. It looked like the Cantina Bar scene out of Star Wars.\u201d Democrats showed a united front and an organized, perhaps surprising, message with posters scattered across their half of the dais showing the faces of people who relied on the Affordable Care Act for their health care. A Democratic committee aide said the decision to use personal stories stemmed from an effort to to make Barrett\u2019s confirmation as tangible to people as possible that focused on \u201cthe real-life effects of a Justice Barrett\u2019s decisions.\u201d Kamala Harris, the tenacious former prosecutor, faces a complicated role as she questions Barrett Democrats feel the health care angle, stressing Trump\u2019s efforts and the impact of gutting Obamacare, is a clear political winner. Democratic leaders, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on the strategy, according to sources familiar with the discussions. \u201cThey are trying to get a justice onto the Court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Harris said of Republicans. \u201cIf they succeed, it will result in millions of people losing access to health care at the worst possible time in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d Democrats also used their health care argument to hit Trump on the Covid-19 pandemic, another key Democratic message heading into the November election. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made a personal appeal after her husband tested positive for coronavirus earlier this year. \u201cHe ended up in the hospital for a week on oxygen with severe pneumonia, and months after he got it, I find out the President knew it was airborne but he didn\u2019t tell us,\u201d Klobuchar said. Asked about the Democrats\u2019 unity after the hearing, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin responded: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit surprising yeah?\u201d Republicans in their opening statements criticized Democrats for previous questions about Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith and for stories about her association with the Christian group People of Praise. \u201cThere are places where this committee has acted like it\u2019s the job of the committee to delve into people\u2019s religious communities. That\u2019s nuts,\u201d said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. American Bar Association rates Amy Coney Barrett as 'well qualified' At Monday\u2019s hearing, however, it was only the Republicans, not Democrats, discussing religion. Barrett also nodded to her religion in her opening statement, saying she believes in the power of prayer. Still, Republicans had plenty of fodder from past hearings to knock Democrats over, including Barrett\u2019s 2017 confirmation hearing for the federal appeals court, such as when the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said, \u201cthe dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, accused Democrats of a \u201cpattern and practice of religious bigotry.\u201d The criticisms tied to faith were more about the two days of questions to follow than the opening day speeches, as Democrats are likely to press Barrett on Roe v. Wade and other abortion cases. Hawley criticized Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, for saying a previous Supreme Court case, Griswold v. Connecticut, which allowed married couples the right to obtain and use contraception, was in danger of being struck down. Hawley claimed that the reference was \u201canother hit at Judge Barrett\u2019s religious faith, referring to Catholic doctrinal beliefs.\u201d But it\u2019s a case that has been raised repeatedly at judicial confirmation hearings. Three Republican senators have tested positive for coronavirus over the past two weeks, throwing into doubt what appeared to be a sure-thing confirmation. That danger for Republicans appears to have passed, for now, but the coronavirus threat still loomed over the hearing, as two of the Republicans who tested positive are on the Judiciary Committee. What Amy Coney Barrett could mean for Obamacare One of those senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, spoke remotely at Monday\u2019s hearing. He has said he expects to be there in person on Tuesday. The other senator who tested positive, Mike Lee of Utah, appeared in person on Monday, saying he had been cleared by his doctor to attend. Democrats attacked Graham for moving forward with the hearing despite the positive tests \u2013 and not requiring tests for all senators on the panel. \u201cThis hearing itself is a microcosm of Trump\u2019s dangerous ineptitude in dealing with the Covid pandemic,\u201d charged Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat. Graham defended the hearing, saying that strict health protocols were being followed, arguing he was going to work to do his job just like millions of Americans. The setting meant no members of the public could attend, a break from normal confirmation hearings, and senators were spread out across the cavernous hearing room. The pandemic-era hearing also meant one other notable distention: Barrett was wearing a black mask throughout the senators\u2019 opening statements. Other Supreme Court nominees have needed to keep a straight face while they are often attacked, but Barrett\u2019s expressions were masked. Monday\u2019s hearing ended with Barrett\u2019s own opening statement, where she discussed clerking for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and what her background would bring to the court, including that she would be the first mother of school-aged children to be a justice and the only sitting justice who didn\u2019t graduate from Harvard or Yale Law School. Barrett generally discussed her legal philosophy, which reflects that of Scalia, her mentor and a conservative anchor of the high court for years. \u201cThe policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people,\u201d Barrett said. Barrett's confirmation could lead to the Supreme Court taking rare action on gun rights She also touched on the discussion surrounding her religion at the conclusion of her statement. \u201cI believe in the power of prayer, and it has been uplifting to hear that so many people are praying for me,\u201d Barrett said. Monday\u2019s hearing was a day of scripted rhetoric with speeches from senators and the nominee. The real action begins Tuesday with questions. Senators will each get a half-hour to question Barrett on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats alternating turns. Then they will get another 20 minutes for a second round. With 22 senators on the panel, both days will go into the evening, representing Barrett\u2019s toughest test before her confirmation to the high court.

            "article_content": "Listening to Republican Sen. Josh Hawley during one of the most heated moments of Monday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, a bystander might have thought Democrats had spent the day attacking Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith. \u201cWhen you tell somebody that they\u2019re too Catholic to be on the bench, when you tell them they\u2019re going to be a Catholic judge, not an American judge, that\u2019s bigotry,\u201d the Missouri Republican said. \u201cThe pattern and practice of bigotry from members of this committee must be stopped, and I would expect that it be renounced.\u201d But the only members who spent significant time on Barrett\u2019s faith during the hearings on Monday were the Republicans. Hawley at one point even suggested that a key court precedent related to Roe v. Wade should be off-limits, deeming it a veiled attempt to discuss her religion. Democrats argue Barrett threatens Obamacare at confirmation hearing while GOP touts her abilities Committee Democrats see Barrett\u2019s faith as a third rail, to be avoided at all costs, especially after missteps during her confirmation hearing for a federal appeals court three years ago. For them, Monday\u2019s hearing was not even so much about her record as it was about the upcoming election, GOP hypocrisy and the Affordable Care Act. Why then did the Republicans keep referring to attacks on her religion? One key reason is that conservatives already feel emboldened about the Supreme Court\u2019s direction when it comes to religious liberty. Last term, the court moved decisively to the right on the issue, allowing more religion in public life. And if Barrett is confirmed quickly, she will hear a major religious liberty case on November 4 brought by a Catholic foster agency that was denied a government contract because it refused to work with same-sex couples. The agency, Catholic Social Services, sued under the First Amendment. Religious conservatives want to use the case to overturn major precedent and loosen restrictions on the use of taxpayer funds to support religion. American Bar Association rates Amy Coney Barrett as 'well qualified' But there is another reason for Hawley\u2019s comments that goes to the confirmation process in general. \u201cSupreme Court confirmation hearings are political theater, especially on the first day, when senators make their opening statements,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University. \u201cDemocrats are obsessing about the ACA, and Republicans are preemptively striking Democrats for attacking Judge Barrett\u2019s religion.\u201d Hawley\u2019s complaints were rooted in an exchange in 2017, when Barrett appeared before the committee for her confirmation to the lower court. Back then, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, pressed Barrett on her writing about faith and the law during the years she spent as a professor at the University of Notre Dame. In a tense exchange, the senator questioned whether the judicial nominee could separate her Catholic views from her legal opinions. \u201cThe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for years in this country.\u201d The exchange invigorated and emboldened religious conservatives, who said Barrett had been a victim of anti-Catholic bias. It also put Barrett on the conservative map, and soon after, supporters of religious liberty began pressing for her to be added to President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court short list if a vacancy were to arise. On Monday, Republicans seized on that exchange. \u201cThere\u2019s no religious test to serve on the Supreme Court. Why? Because the Constitution says so,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. \u201cThis committee has acted like it\u2019s the job of the committee to delve into people\u2019s religious communities. That\u2019s nuts,\u201d said Nebraska\u2019s Sen. Ben Sasse. \u201cBecause in this committee, and in this Congress, and in this constitutional structure, religious liberty is the basic truth, and whatever you or I or Judge Barrett believe about God isn\u2019t any of the government\u2019s business.\u201d Hawley also talked about questions that Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii had asked Brian Buescher, who was up for a seat on the US District Court for the District of Nebraska in 2018, about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization founded in 1882. \u201cFor those watching at home, that\u2019s right, you heard me correctly,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThe Democratic nominee for vice president of the United States, who has questioned past nominees who\u2019ve come before this committee about their membership in Catholic fraternal organizations.\u201d 5 takeaways from Monday's Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett As for Barrett, she brought up her religion herself, never shying from the topic. \u201cI believe in the power of prayer,\u201d she told the senators, \u201cand it has been uplifting to hear that so many people are praying for me.\u201d Throughout the day, the focus on Democrats\u2019 part was largely the future of the Affordable Care Act, a case that will be heard by the Supreme Court \u2013 and maybe Barrett \u2013 a week after the election. And while the they talked about the possibility of invalidating the entire sprawling law amid the pandemic, there are more narrow ways the court could rule, by severing more controversial portions but allowing other provisions to stand. Antonin Scalia's legacy looms over the Amy Coney Barrett hearings Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, agreed that religious liberty is \u201cfoundational to our civics and our republic.\u201d He said his side of the dais would focus not on Barrett\u2019s faith, but on what\u2019s she written and what she has said. He expressed particular concern about the possibility that the court\u2019s new conservative majority might overturn long-settled precedent. He mentioned a 1965 case called Griswold v. Connecticut establishing that married couples have a right to obtain and use contraception in the privacy of their own homes as well as Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, which legalized abortion nationwide. His comment triggered a fierce reaction from Hawley. \u201cI just heard my colleague, Sen. Coons, make a reference to an old case, the Griswold case, which I can only assume is another hit at Judge Barrett\u2019s religious faith, referring to Catholic doctrinal beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing I\u2019m talking about, and this is the sort of attacks that must stop,\u201d Hawley concluded. Griswold comes up in most every confirmation hearing because its legal underpinnings concerning the right to privacy surfaced again in Roe v. Wade. Roe is almost 50 years old, but it remains a central focus of the fight to confirm justices to the Supreme Court, and is usually discussed in the context of Griswold in these hearings. In fact, during the 2017 Barrett hearing, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana asked her about it. Amy Coney Barrett's record of advocating for limits to abortion rights \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a right to privacy in the Constitution? I mean, when Griswold came down and you read it, what did you think? Did you say, \u2018This is a well-reasoned opinion, and I agree with it?\u2019 \u201d he asked. Coons declined to respond directly to Hawley\u2019s attacks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to help Sen. Hawley run for president,\u201d Coons said. \u201cI mean my focus today was on the concerns that I\u2019m hearing from Delawarians, which was that there is a Supreme Court case a week after the election where the Affordable Care Act is at risk.\u201d Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said: \u201cSenate Republicans are focusing on a false ruse to try to distract from the fact that health care access for millions and other civil rights are at stake with this nomination.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood Votes launched two voter guides on Thursday that seek to highlight the reproductive rights records of candidates nationwide and target young voters and voters of color, as part of a campaign to mobilize voters in the midst of a Supreme Court vacancy fight that could have profound implications on the future of abortion rights. The guides have been in the works since earlier this year, Amanda Matos, Planned Parenthood Votes Director of Constituency Campaigns, told CNN. But their release comes as politicians and activists on opposing sides of the abortion debate gear up for a contentious fight over filling the seat of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the weeks leading up to the election. President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the seat, federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett, has expressed views at odds with abortion rights and would likely help further cement a conservative majority on the court. The potential addition of another Trump appointee to the court could put the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, at stake. Following Ginsburg\u2019s death last month, anti-abortion groups including the Susan B. Anthony List and Students for Life also went into action. The Susan B. Anthony List has put money behind a digital ad campaign in support of Barrett, while Students for Life launched its own mobilizing effort. Planned Parenthood Votes spent $350,000, according to Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, Planned Parenthood\u2019s director of state media campaigns, on the production and promotion of both voter guides, as part of the organization\u2019s $45 million budget for 2020. That overall budget covers \u201clarge-scale grassroots organizing programs and targeted canvass, digital, television, radio and mail programs,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in announcing the initiative last year. The group\u2019s national voter guide allows users to type in their address and see the corresponding state and federal races they can vote on. It provides candidates\u2019 stances and, if applicable, voting records on reproductive rights issues. \u201cBecause it includes down ballot races, it\u2019s also ensuring that states that might not be considered hotspots for the presidential (election) are still getting the same access to information for their state races or federal races,\u201d Matos said. The guide, she said, will be advertised on Facebook. The youth voter guide, geared towards young voters and voters of color, will be released in 10 states, according to Lee-Gilmore. Many of them are 2020 battlegrounds: North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Georgia, Texas, Arizona and Colorado. When voters from those states enter their address, the guide shows the federal and state races they can vote in and compares candidates on multiple issues including abortion, climate change, health care, minimum wage, education and LGBTQ rights. While talking with young voters and voters of colors in the 10 states, Planned Parenthood Votes found that \u201creally what\u2019s resonating with them right now are the intersectional issues,\u201d Matos said. \u201cWe knew the way to make sure that young voters have access to equal information about how and when and who to vote for, we have to include cross-movement issues,\u201d she added. The guide will also allow voters to create a mock-up to help them fill out their actual ballots. The youth voter guide\u2019s promotion will be unique to each of the states, with advertising efforts focused on Instagram, Matos said. Planned Parenthood Votes\u2019 goal in the voter mobilization landscape, Matos said, was increasing access to information, especially to those who may not have previously had access to it. \u201cOftentimes campaigns are not talking to young voters or young voters of color because they\u2019re considered low propensity,\u201d she said, adding that it was often \u201cbecause they\u2019re facing voter suppression or because they\u2019re young or they\u2019re facing other barriers.\u201d When asked whether she included the Biden presidential campaign in that description, Matos declined to speak about any specific campaign. This year\u2019s effort also comes following a slew of anti-abortion bills coming out of state legislatures in 2019, as well as a key Supreme Court abortion decision in June that struck down a Louisiana abortion restriction while seeing Chief Justice John Roberts in a concurring opinion leave the door open to more state limits on abortion. \u201cIt is really key for Planned Parenthood Votes to get out information to voters all across the country, not prioritizing one race over the other, especially because we know it\u2019s state politicians that often have the power to impact everyone\u2019s access to essential reproductive healthcare,\u201d Matos said, adding that \u201c2020 has been a year that definitely has pushed reproductive rights to be even more at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Matos\u2019 response to a question about the Biden campaign and to specify that Planned Parenthood Votes launched the guide.",

            "article_content": "Partisan battle lines were clearly drawn on Monday when the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to fill the seat of the late liberal icon, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, got underway in a bitterly divided Senate with Election Day just weeks away. Sharply divergent narratives emerged in opening speeches as Republican senators praised Barrett\u2019s judicial qualifications in glowing terms and emphasized her capability as a working mom, while Democrats warned that health care protections and the Affordable Care Act are at stake, and will be under threat, if the confirmation succeeds. The hearing already appears on track to be a firestorm as Republicans push forward with almost unprecedented speed and Democrats look for ways to draw out the process for the lifetime appointment. Meanwhile, across the street at the Supreme Court, the remaining eight justices, who have just begun a new term, find themselves, and the court, once again in an unwelcome political spotlight. One after another, Republicans used their time at the hearing to highlight Barrett\u2019s qualifications to be appointed to the high court. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, described Barrett as \u201cin a category of excellence,\u201d saying that she is \u201chighly respected,\u201d and \u201cwidely-admired for her integrity.\u201d Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who like Graham is up for reelection this cycle, told Barrett during the hearing, that \u201cfolks with widely different judicial philosophies agree that you are brilliant, respectful, kind.\u201d Cornyn also indicated that his constituents have expressed admiration at how Barrett balances her career with taking care of her family. \u201cJudge, there\u2019s a question that comes up in my discussions with my constituents that\u2019s really more basic and more personal: They want to know how you do it? How do you and your husband manage two full-time, professional careers and at the same time take care of your large family?\u201d Cornyn said, adding, \u201cI bet there are many young women, like my own two daughters, who marvel at the balance you\u2019ve achieved between your personal and professional life.\u201d Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing: Day 1 Democrats, in contrast, were united in warning that Barrett\u2019s confirmation stands to jeopardize health care access and protections \u2013 a central part of the strategy they have so far employed in fighting the nomination. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, argued that \u201cthe stakes are extraordinarily high\u201d in the fight over the vacancy, adding, \u201cmost importantly, healthcare coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination.\u201d Democrats framed the issue in personal terms, sharing concerns from constituents and, in some cases, opening up about their own health conditions. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said that his constituents are deeply concerned over what the confirmation could mean. \u201cThey\u2019re scared, Judge Barrett. They\u2019re scared that your confirmation would rip from them the very health care protections that millions of Americans have fought to maintain, and which Congress has repeatedly rejected eliminating,\u201d he said. Leahy went on to say, \u201cThey\u2019re scared that the clock will be turned back to a time when women had no right to control their own bodies and when it was acceptable to discriminate against women in the workplace. They\u2019re scared that at a time when we\u2019re facing the perilous impacts of climate change, bedrock environmental protections are going to be eviscerated, and they\u2019re scared that your confirmation will result in the rolling back of voting rights, workers\u2019 rights, and the rights of the LGBTQ community to equal treatment.\u201d Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii opened up about her own battle with cancer. \u201cAccess to health care saved my life,\u201d Hirono said, adding that a diagnosis of kidney cancer \u201ccame as a total shock.\u201d \u201cSerious illness can hit anyone unexpectedly - it did for me, and when it does, no one should have to worry about whether they can afford care that might save their life,\u201d she said. In a preview of the bitter battle ahead, Graham warned, \u201cthis is going to be a long, contentious week, I would just ask one thing of the committee: to the extent possible, let\u2019s make it respectful, let\u2019s make it challenging, let\u2019s remember the world is watching.\u201d The chairman acknowledged that the rapid confirmation timeline taking place in an election year, but defended the process. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unconstitutional about this process. This is a vacancy that has occurred through the tragic loss of a great woman and we\u2019re going to fill that vacancy with another great woman. The bottom line here is that the Senate is doing its duty constitutionally,\u201d he said. Feinstein agreed with Graham\u2019s sentiment that the hearing should be respectful, saying that Democrats \u201cfeel the same way.\u201d Feinstein, however, argued that Republicans should not be pushing ahead with the nomination, referencing how Senate Republicans blocked consideration of Merrick Garland after his nomination by former President Obama. \u201cI believe we should not be moving forward on this nomination, not until the election has ended and the next president has taken office,\u201d she said. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who tested positive for coronavirus at the beginning of the month, attended the hearing in person. \u201cSenator Lee is back,\u201d Graham noted at the start of the hearing, saying that he has been cleared by his physician and welcoming him back. Lee delivered his opening statement while in the committee room without wearing a mask. On Twitter, he posted a letter from the congressional attending physician stating that he has \u201cmet criteria to end COVID-19 isolation.\u201d The hearings will serve as a touchstone for the bases of both parties, highlighting the potential of a hard-right turn that could last for decades in areas such as abortion, religious liberty, LGBTQ rights and the Second Amendment, distracting voters from the realities of Covid-19 and leaving liberals to contemplate new tools, including adding seats to the Supreme Court, to staunch their wounds. Barrett, who sat through contentious hearings just three years ago for her seat on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, delivered her opening statement at the end of the first day after being sworn in. \u201cThe policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people,\u201d Barrett told senators, adding, \u201cThat is the approach that I have strived to follow as a judge on the 7th circuit.\u201d Her straightforward statement reflects a conservative legal philosophy shared by her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and others who believe that courts can\u2019t sweep in to solve all of society\u2019s woes. She makes clear that she believes some issues are better handled by the political branches, which mirrors what conservative justices said in dissent when the high court cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. Nodding to the divisive Kavanaugh hearings, Barrett admitted to some trepidation about accepting the nomination. \u201cThe confirmation process \u2013 and the work of serving on the Court if confirmed \u2013 requires sacrifices, particularly from my family,\u201d the mother of seven said. She also pointed out in her statement that she would bring diversity to the court, in part because every current justice attended an Ivy League school. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame, she would also be the first mother with school-age children to serve on the bench. Mindful that she is vying for the seat of Ginsburg \u2013 a feminist icon \u2013 Barrett praised the late justice for \u201cthe path she marked and the life she led.\u201d Left unsaid was the fact that the two women are ideological opposites. She ended her statement with a flourish \u2013 highlighting her faith and the fact that she believes in the \u201cpower of prayer\u201d and has been uplifted to hear that so many people are \u201cpraying for me.\u201d A nominee\u2019s opening statement often sets the tone for the start of the hearing. Following Barrett\u2019s statement, the committee adjourned until Tuesday for when the grilling is expected to begin. Before even reaching substantive constitutional questions, Democrats are expected to ask Barrett whether she will recuse herself from any election-related litigation that reaches the high court. Although it\u2019s a long shot, it is always possible the Supreme Court will once again be called upon to decide the election. \u201cI think this will end up at the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said at a recent White House event. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very important that we have nine justices.\u201d Barrett is likely to avoid the question, but if she is confirmed it will be her own choice whether to recuse. Democrats during Monday\u2019s hearing turned the focus on the Affordable Care Act. A week after Election Day, the justices will hear the most important case of the term and decide whether to invalidate the entire law. The decision could strip millions of their health care during a pandemic. Critics of Barrett will point to some of her previous writings, before she took the bench, where she expressed skepticism about the reasoning Chief Justice John Roberts used back in 2012 to uphold the law under the taxing power. \u201cChief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power. \u201cHad he treated the payment as the statute did \u2013 as a penalty \u2013 he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress\u2019s commerce power,\u201d she said. The challenge before the court now is different, but it rests in part on Roberts\u2019 original opinion. Democrats will also seize on positions Barrett took before she was a judge, on Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion. Unlike other recent nominees, there is a significant paper trail detailing Barrett\u2019s views on abortion, and Roe, as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. She signed a petition, for example, with other faculty, for a paid advertisement reaffirming the school\u2019s commitment \u201cto the right to life\u201d and criticizing Roe. \u201cIn the 40 years since the infamous Roe v. Wade decision over 55 million unborn children have been killed by abortions,\u201d the ad reads. In 2006, she added her name to a list of \u201ccitizens of Michiana\u201d who signed a \u201cright to life ad\u201d sponsored by a group that opposes abortion that appeared in the South Bend Tribune. The ad from the Saint Joseph County Right to Life calls for putting \u201can end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restor(ing) laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\u201d Late Friday night, Barrett released a supplement to her Senate questionnaire, including the ad and outlining previously undisclosed talks she gave in 2013 to anti-abortion students groups after CNN\u2019s KFile reported their existence. In 2016, before taking the bench, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the core case \u2013 Roe\u2019s core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion \u2013 I don\u2019t think that would change,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics \u2013 I think that would change.\u201d At her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, she was pressed on whether her own personal convictions would impact how she applies the law. \u201cIf there is ever a conflict between a judge\u2019s personal conviction and that judge\u2019s duty under the rule of law, that it is never, ever permissible for that judge to follow their personal convictions in the decision of the case rather than what the law requires,\u201d she said. Her critics point to two opinions from her time as a judge. In both she voted to rehear cases where a smaller panel of judges ruled against abortion restrictions. That desire to take another look at the laws leads her critics to believe she would have voted to uphold those restrictions. Barrett also voted with the majority in an opinion upholding a \u201cbubble zone\u201d ordinance in Chicago, which bars abortion opponents from approaching someone within 8 feet in the vicinity of a clinic if the purpose is to engage in protest. Her critics note, however, that even though she voted in favor of supporters of abortion rights, the opinion makes clear the lower court was bound by Supreme Court precedent. Last term, four conservative justices urged the court to take up a Second Amendment case, yet by the end of the term they had declined to do so. That suggests there wasn\u2019t the necessary five votes. Now, if Barrett is nominated, she could be that vote. In one decision, Kanter v. Barr, she dissented when her colleagues upheld a law barring convicted felons from possessing a firearm. The language she used in the opinion tracked closely with language used by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. Like Thomas, Barrett suggested that lower courts are thumbing their nose at Supreme Court precedent to uphold gun restrictions treating the Second Amendment like a \u201csecond class right.\u201d In the upcoming hearings Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, has vowed to make her views \u201cfront and center\u201d to show how \u201cJudge Barrett\u2019s extremist, hard-right views of the Second Amendment will do real harm to real lives in real ways.\u201d Barrett does not have a robust record on same-sex marriage, but in a 2016 speech at Jacksonville University made while she was still a law professor, she laid out both sides of the debate. She framed it as a  \u201cwho decides\u201d question. That is very similar to how Roberts framed the issue when he dissented in the landmark 2015 case Obergefell v. Hodges, which cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. He said the issue would have been better handled by the political branches. Speaking broadly, Barrett was asked about the future of the court in the speech and she seemed to align herself with Roberts\u2019 thinking. \u201cThe \u2018who decides\u2019 question,\u201d she said, \u201cis really important to me \u2013 I worry a lot about that \u2018who decides\u2019 question, about our decisions, and my voice being taken away.\u201d Many of Barrett\u2019s critics fear that on the bench she will greenlight Trump\u2019s policies if he wins another term. In one immigration-related case, she dissented when her colleagues temporarily blocked a Trump administration rule that puts green card holders at a disadvantage if they access public services.

            "article_content": "With Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings underway, many Democrats will be eagerly awaiting Kamala Harris\u2019 turn as the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s star prosecutor, hoping she can create one of those pin-drop moments that made her an irresistible pick to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. But as this week\u2019s proceedings approached, close allies of the California senator cautioned that viewers tuning in shouldn\u2019t expect those kind of fireworks from the vice presidential candidate. This time, Harris is playing a much more complex dual role, a Judiciary Committee member valued by her party for her courtroom skills, but also the running mate of a Democratic presidential nominee who has condemned the divisive, angry politics of Washington and is promising to be a president to people all political persuasions. In her opening statement on Monday, Harris did not even mention Barrett\u2019s name, instead accusing President Donald Trump and Republicans of threatening the health and safety of millions of Americans with their effort to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, telling the story of a child named Myka whose parents were hit with enormous health care costs after she was diagnosed with a \u201ccongenital heart defect.\u201d She also argued Barrett could undo the legacy of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Barrett would replace. Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing: Day 1 During her four years on Capitol Hill, Harris\u2019 star rose through her sharp interrogations of a long parade of Trump administration nominees \u2013 most notably when she stared down Kavanaugh in 2018 and asked him whether he could think of any laws giving government the power to make decisions about the male body. The judge stared at the table before him, then glanced back at the senator with an uncertain, \u201cuh \u2026\u201d visibly uncomfortable as she waited for his answer, her eyebrows arched. \u201cI\u2019m happy to answer a more specific question,\u201d he replied, looking for a rhetorical lifeline. \u201cMale versus female,\u201d she answered flatly \u2013 letting his discomfort dangle in the air of the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing Room. The moment went viral, once again thrilling the Democratic faithful, and proving how Harris, the former district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California, could electrify a hearing room. But this is different moment in time and unlike two years ago, the Supreme Court nominee this time is also not a former fraternity brother who faced serious accusations of sexual assault (which he denied). Instead, she is an accomplished University of Notre Dame law professor who has juggled caring for her seven children with her duties on the 7th Circuit US Court of Appeals. Twenty-two days before the election, Democratic senators, including Harris, are cognizant that there are political risks to appearing too partisan or aggressive, particularly when questioning a female nominee, who proved to be a calm and collected presence during her 2017 confirmation hearing for her federal appeals court appointment. This isn\u2019t \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, an antagonistic person with a troubled past,\u201d one source familiar with Harris\u2019 preparations said. \u201cRather than focusing on the person and the nominee, she\u2019ll focus more on the policy.\u201d Debbie Mesloh, Harris\u2019 longtime adviser, noted that during Harris\u2019 years as a prosecutor, her specialty was picking juries \u2013 \u201ctaking a deep dive into personalities and understanding how that might show up in the courtroom\u201d and adjusting her strategy to fit her audience and the different dynamics in each courtroom. Those skills will come into play in her questioning of Barrett, Mesloh said. \u201cKamala is disciplined enough to know what\u2019s going to be most effective and she doesn\u2019t have just one way of approaching things,\u201d Mesloh said. \u201cShe can be that type of hard litigator like we saw with Kavanaugh, but that\u2019s not her only way and it\u2019s not the only tool that she can use.\u201d While Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was uncertain, there is little doubt that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has the votes to usher Barrett onto the Supreme Court before Election Day, provided members of his conference are not kept away from Washington because of coronavirus, which recently infected three GOP senators. With many independent voters watching, Democrats also want to avoid unleashing the kind of conservative fury they stirred up back in 2017 when California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, now the top Democratic member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned whether Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith would affect her decisions on the court, uttering a phrase that became a call to arms for religious conservatives when she said \u201cthe dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d During the morning session, many Democratic senators showed pictures of Americans with pre-existing conditions, telling their stories and arguing that striking down the Affordable Care Act would have devastating consequences. At the same time, the Democratic Party clearly wants a fierce confirmation battle that will inspire passion in their voters and rev up turnout ahead of the November election, by showing the real-world consequences of how Americans\u2019 lives could change once a 6-3 conservative majority is solidified on the Supreme Court. It will fall to Harris to thread that needle. Mirroring the argument of the Biden campaign, she argued Monday morning that Barrett\u2019s confirmation could mean that more than 20 million people could lose their health care and more than 100 million people could lose their protections under the Affordable Care Act. (The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments one week after the November election in a case where a coalition of Republican attorneys general and the Trump administration are asking the court to strike down the law.) \u201cRepublicans finally realized the ACA is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThat\u2019s why President Trump promised to only nominate judges who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act \u2026 They are trying to get a justice onto the court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Harris noted that Ginsburg \u201cdevoted her life to this fight for equal justice\u201d and \u201cadvocated for human rights and equality,\u201d adding that the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade could be at stake if Barrett is confirmed. Ginsburg\u2019s \u201clegacy and the rights she fought so hard to protect are in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said. Harris previewed her strategy with her handling of questions about Barrett during her debate with Vice President Mike Pence last week, when she immediately pivoted from Barrett\u2019s record to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to push through her confirmation. She criticized Republicans for holding the hearings while millions of Americans have already voted and will soon be voting. Harris said she would always \u201cfight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body,\u201d but made her pitch mostly about what she cast as the harmful goals of the Trump administration. She criticized Republicans\u2019 decision to rush through confirmation hearings at the same time that millions of Americans are voting. She said she would always \u201cfight for a woman\u2019s right to make a decision about her own body,\u201d but spoke primarily not about Barrett\u2019s past decisions but about the goals of the Trump administration. \u201cIt should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President Michael Pence,\u201d Harris said of a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion. GOP and Democrats draw battle lines in Barrett hearing Similarly with health care, she spoke of Barrett as part of a court that could provide the culmination of the longstanding crusade by the Trump administration and Republicans to overturn the Affordable Care Act. \u201cLiterally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be, in the future, a preexisting condition because you contracted the virus, Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Harris said during the debate. \u201cThis means that there will be no more protections if they win for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you\u2019re under the age of 26, you can\u2019t stay on your parents\u2019 coverage anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cThe contrast couldn\u2019t be more clear. They\u2019re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Though one of Harris\u2019 goals will be to use her line of questioning to elicit the human impact of the court\u2019s rightward shift, she has still done extensive preparation to get steeped in Barrett\u2019s writings, opinions and judicial philosophy, settling in this past weekend with a thick briefing book of those documents as she crafted her questions. But health care will be her main focus, several strategists familiar with her preparations said, noting that was a central issue that drove Democrats and independents to the polls in 2018, helping to turn out enough voters to flip the House to their party\u2019s control. This year, in the middle of the pandemic, the potential loss of health care coverage is an even more salient issue for millions of Americans. Moreover, it\u2019s no longer an abstract threat, since it\u2019ll be before the high court one week after the election. Democrats will be looking to Harris to make that case in a way that galvanizes voters to support her ticket and those of Democrats in all the down-ballot races.

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, spoke at the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett Monday remotely from her Senate office. Read Harris\u2019 remarks as prepared for delivery: Mr. Chairman, this hearing has brought together more than 50 people to sit inside a room for hours while our nation faces a deadly airborne virus. This committee has ignored commonsense requests to keep people safe \u2013 including not requiring testing for all members \u2013 despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee. By contrast, in response to this recent Senate outbreak, the leader of Senate Republicans rightly postponed business on the Senate floor this week to protect the health and safety of senators and staff. For the same reasons, this hearing should have been postponed. The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facilities workers, janitorial staff, congressional aides, and Capitol Police at risk. Not to mention, that while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills, the Senate should be prioritizing coronavirus relief and providing financial support. The American people need help to make their rent or mortgage payments. We should provide financial assistance to those who lost their job, and help parents put food on the table. Small businesses need help. As do the cities, towns, and hospitals that this crisis has pushed to the brink. The House bill would help families and small businesses get through this crisis, but Senate Republicans have not lifted a finger for 150 days to move that bill. Yet you are determined to rush a Supreme Court confirmation hearing through in just 16 days. Senate Republicans have made it crystal clear that rushing a Supreme Court nomination is more important than helping and supporting the American people who are suffering from a deadly pandemic and economic crisis. Their priorities are not the American people\u2019s priorities. But, for the moment, Senate Republicans hold the majority in the Senate and determine the schedule, so here we are. The Constitution entrusts the Senate with the solemn duty to carefully consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Yet the Senate majority is rushing this process and jamming President Trump\u2019s nominee through the Senate while people are actually voting. Just 22 days before the end of the election. More than nine million Americans have already cast ballots and millions more will vote while this illegitimate committee process is underway. A clear majority of Americans want whomever wins this election to fill this seat. And my Republican colleagues know that. Yet they are deliberately defying the will of the people in their attempt to roll back the rights and protections provided under the Affordable Care Act. And let\u2019s remember: In 2017, President Trump and Congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, but people from all walks of life spoke out and demanded Republicans stop trying to take away Americans\u2019 health care. Republicans finally realized the ACA is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work. That\u2019s why President Trump promised to only nominate judges who will get rid of the Affordable Care Act. This administration, with the support of Senate Republicans, will be in front of the Supreme Court on November 10th to argue that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down. That\u2019s just 29 days away. That\u2019s a big reason why Senate Republicans are rushing this process. They are trying to get a justice onto the Court in time to ensure they can strip away the protections in the Affordable Care Act. If they succeed, it will result in millions of people losing access to health care at the worst possible time in the middle of a pandemic: 23 million Americans could lose their health insurance altogether. If they succeed, they will eliminate protections for 135 million Americans with preexisting conditions like diabetes, asthma, heart disease or cancer. A list that now includes over seven and a half million Americans who contracted COVID-19. Insurance companies could deny you coverage, or could sell you a plan that won\u2019t pay a dime toward treating anything related to your preexisting condition. If the ACA is struck down, you will have to once again pay for things like mammograms, cancer screenings, and birth control. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. And young adults will be kicked off their parents\u2019 plans. These are not abstract issues. We need to be clear about how overturning of the ACA will impact the people we all represent. For example, Myka, who is eleven years old and lives in Southern California. Myka enjoys being a Girl Scout, reading, ice-skating, eating pasta, and baking. Her mother says the only reason Myka is able to live her life as she does now is because the Affordable Care Act guarantees that her health insurance can\u2019t deny coverage or limit her care because it\u2019s too expensive. You see, Myka has a Congenital heart defect. She goes to multiple specialists throughout the year and gets an MRI with anesthesia every six months. At just eleven months old, Myka\u2019s family had already hit $500,000 in medical expenses. Her biannual MRI costs $15,000 a session. If Republicans succeed in striking down the ACA, insurance companies will be able to deny coverage to children with serious conditions. Children like Myka. And parents, will be on their own. No one should face financial ruin to get their child, spouse, or parent the care they need. And no family should be kept from seeing a doctor or getting treatment because an insurance company says the treatment is too expensive. In America, access to health care shouldn\u2019t be determined by how much money you have. Access to health care should be a right. Myka and millions of others who are protected by the ACA know this is fundamentally what is at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. And there\u2019s more at stake. Throughout our history, Americans have brought cases to the Supreme Court in the ongoing fight for civil rights, human rights, and equal justice. Decisions like Brown v. Board of Education, which opened up educational opportunities for Black boys and girls, Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman\u2019s right to control her body, and Loving v. Virginia and Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized that love is love, and that marriage equality is the law of the land. The United States Supreme Court is often the last refuge for equal justice when our constitutional rights are being violated. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life to this fight for equal justice. She defended the constitution. She advocated for human rights and equality. She stood up for the rights of women. She protected workers. She fought for the rights of consumers against big corporations. She supported LGBTQ rights. And she did so much more. But now, her legacy and the rights she fought so hard to protect are in jeopardy. By replacing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with someone who will undo her legacy, President Trump is attempting to roll back Americans\u2019 rights for decades to come. Every American must understand that with this nomination, equal justice under law is at stake. Our voting rights are at stake. Workers\u2019 rights are at stake. Consumers\u2019 rights are at stake. The right to safe and legal abortion is at stake. Holding corporations accountable is at stake. And so much more. Mr. Chairman, this hearing is a clear attempt to jam through a Supreme Court nominee who will take health care away from millions people during a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 214,000 Americans. We must listen to our constituents, protect their access to health care, and wait to confirm a new Supreme Court justice until after Americans decide who they want in the White House. Thank you.",

            "article_content": "Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s fast-track Supreme Court confirmation goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday as the raucous fight over Barrett\u2019s nomination spills into public view for a week\u2019s worth of hearings. The hearings represent Democrats\u2019 best chance to poke holes in Barrett\u2019s record and try to cast doubt on President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee in the minds of Republicans \u2013 or if that\u2019s not possible, at least score political points on health care three weeks before the election. The stakes are high for a surprise confirmation fight following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that has the potential to shift the ideological makeup of the court for a generation, and the tensions are a powder keg on all sides. But as the recent coronavirus outbreak from the White House shows \u2013 which infected two members of the Judiciary Committee, throwing the confirmation process into doubt \u2013 the rapid timeline Republicans have traced leaves little margin for error. Barrett's confirmation could lead to the Supreme Court taking rare action on gun rights For Republicans, a smooth hearing will put Barrett on the glide path to be confirmed before Election Day over the fierce objections of Democrats, who charge the GOP is using a double standard after refusing to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee in 2016. Opening statements from senators and Barrett are scheduled for Monday, with lawmakers questioning Barrett on Tuesday and Wednesday. Outside witnesses for and against the nominee will testify Thursday. Here\u2019s what to watch for during the hearings this week: If the Senate voted on Barrett\u2019s nomination this week, she\u2019d have the votes to be put on the Supreme Court. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. While two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, say they are opposed to confirming a Supreme Court nominee so close to an election, every other Republican appears to be lining up to support Barrett. No Democrats are considering backing her. But that doesn\u2019t mean unforeseen surprises won\u2019t emerge in her nomination, whether it\u2019s from her background or out of the hearings this week. Amy Coney Barrett initially failed to disclose talks on Roe v. Wade hosted by anti-abortion groups on Senate paperwork The White House and Senate Republicans are rushing Barrett\u2019s nomination to get her over the finish line before Election Day, a timeline that leaves little wiggle room. As a result, the vetting process was accelerated \u2013 and in some cases was incomplete. CNN\u2019s KFile reported on Friday that Barrett failed to disclose two talks she gave in 2013 hosted by two anti-abortion student groups on paperwork provided to the Senate. After the story published, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a supplemental update to Barrett\u2019s committee questionnaire that included the lecture and seminar, as well as a paid advertisement she signed that criticized Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed support for Notre Dame\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the right to life.\u201d The missing speeches aren\u2019t likely to change the mind of any Republicans. But it leaves open the possibility there\u2019s more that could come out \u2013 both Republicans and Democrats still have the 2018 battle royal over Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation seared in their memories. Two of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah, tested positive for coronavirus after they attended Barrett\u2019s Rose Garden announcement at the end of last month, and a third Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, tested positive soon thereafter. The trio of positives threw what appeared to be a smooth confirmation into doubt. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham did not alter the hearing schedule, which begins this week and could have Barrett confirmed by the end of the month, although senators may attend Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings virtually. Tillis said last week in a Fox News interview he expected to appear virtually on Monday and then in person when the question-and-answer sessions begin on Tuesday. Republicans start to distance from Trump Still, the infections that spread through the White House and Republican circles \u2013 and to Trump himself \u2013 are a reminder that Republicans\u2019 timing could be upended if any additional senators test positive. Graham, notably, would not take a coronavirus test before his Senate debate that was scheduled for Friday. The South Carolina Republican argued his opponent, Democrat James Harrison, was trying to change the rules. But Graham\u2019s critics noted that he did not want to test positive with this week\u2019s hearings looming \u2013 as the chairman\u2019s absence would almost surely end the chance for a Senate confirmation vote before November 3. Even if Democrats are fighting a losing battle to stop Barrett\u2019s confirmation, the public attention on the Supreme Court hearings gives them an opportunity to push a health care message that helped them win the House in 2018 \u2013 and they hope will help take back the Senate and White House next month. The Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the Affordable Care Act a week after the election in a case brought by Republican state attorneys general and the Trump administration, meaning Barrett could hear the case. Democrats say the case threatens care for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions, a popular protection included in the Affordable Care Act. What Amy Coney Barrett could mean for Obamacare A CNN poll released earlier this month found that 57% of Americans surveyed now favor Obamacare (up from 50% in 2017), and that 61% do not want the Supreme Court to overturn it. Barrett, then a University of Notre Dame law professor, wrote in a 2017 law review essay criticizing the way Chief Justice John Roberts saved the Affordable Care Act in 2012. \u201cChief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power.\u201d She continued, \u201cHad he treated the payment as the statute did \u2013 as a penalty \u2013 he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress\u2019s commerce power.\u201d While Trump has claimed he will protect pre-existing conditions, he has not put forward any plan to do so despite months of pledges that a health care plan is coming any day now. Democrats are also likely to use the hearings to highlight the threat they say Barrett\u2019s nomination poses to abortion rights. Trump has pledged to nominate justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade, but when Democratic presidential nominee Biden argued that Barrett would take away abortion rights at last month\u2019s debate, Trump responded, \u201cYou don\u2019t know her view on Roe v. Wade.\u201d Amy Coney Barrett's record of advocating for limits to abortion rights Even if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t overturn Roe, both her supporters and detractors alike say it\u2019s clear that her confirmation would cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court to limit abortion access. While Democrats are going to press Barrett on both health care and abortion from as many angles as they can think of, she\u2019s unlikely to say much about how she would rule on such cases, just as nominees before her have avoided doing. When Barrett came before the Judiciary Committee during her 2017 confirmation to sit on a federal appeals court, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said of Barrett, \u201cthe dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d That statement has been resurfaced by Republicans and Democrats alike ahead of the confirmation hearings, and Republicans have been quick to attack Democrats for going after Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith. Republicans have been hitting Democrats over criticism of Barrett\u2019s religion in the leadup to the hearings, including Vice President Mike Pence criticizing Sen. Kamala Harris, a Judiciary Committee member, at last week\u2019s vice presidential debate. \u201cThe ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett\u2019s faith are a disgrace,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted last week. Democrats on the committee say they want to steer clear of questions about whether Barrett\u2019s devout Catholic faith will impact her views, focusing instead on issues they hope will resonate with voters. Democrats are cognizant of the fact that the brawl over Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation in the run-up to the 2018 midterms hurt several Senate Democrats in red states, and they want to avoid giving Republicans any wedge issues with control of the Senate up for grabs next month. If Barrett is nominated to the Supreme Court before Election Day, it means she could be on the bench when the high court hears a potential case that decides the electoral fate of the president who nominated her. Democrats have demanded that Barrett recuse herself from any election-related cases involving the presidency, given how close she was nominated to the 2020 election. Trump has already linked the quick confirmation of Barrett to the potential for the Supreme Court to play a role in the 2020 election, which he has falsely claimed will be rigged or stolen from him. No one can recuse Amy Coney Barrett from a Trump election case but herself \u201cI think this will end up at the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said of the election last month. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s very important that we have nine justices.\u201d This week\u2019s hearings will give Democrats a chance to publicly seek a commitment from her not to involve herself in election disputes. But in the end, the question of recusal would be solely up to Barrett herself. And it\u2019s unlikely they will succeed. \u201cI specifically asked her to recuse herself,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said last week after speaking to Barrett. \u201cShe made no commitment on recusal.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Phil Mattingly, Clare Foran, Joan Biskupic and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When Judge Amy Coney Barrett delivers her opening statement on Monday to the Senate Judiciary Committee, she\u2019ll focus on how her family, an upbringing modeled on service and faith and her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, influenced her opportunity to be nominated to the Supreme Court. Barrett, who clerked for Scalia, will say it was his \u201creasoning\u201d that shaped her and that his \u201cjudicial philosophy was straightforward: A judge must apply the law as written, not as the judge wishes it were,\u201d according to a copy of the statement released Sunday in advance of the hearing. The late justice, she is expected to say, taught her more than just law and he was \u201cdevoted to his family, resolute in his beliefs, and fearless of criticism.\u201d Throughout her legal career, Barrett says in the prepared remarks, she resolved to maintain the same perspective as Scalia. \u201cThere is a tendency in our profession to treat the practice of law as all-consuming, while losing sight of everything else. But that makes for a shallow and unfulfilling life,\u201d Barrett says, according to the copy of her remarks. \u201cI worked hard as a lawyer and a professor; I owed that to my clients, my students, and myself. But I never let the law define my identity or crowd out the rest of my life.\u201d What to watch in the Amy Coney Barrett hearings Nominated by President Donald Trump last month to the nation\u2019s highest court to fill the vacancy on the bench following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett will praise the late justice for opening doors \u2013 even though the two women are ideological opposites. What to watch in the Amy Coney Barrett hearings \u201cI have been nominated to fill Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat, but no one will ever take her place,\u201d Barrett will say. \u201cI will be forever grateful for the path she marked and the life she led.\u201d For all the reasons that Trump sees Barrett as a potential successor to Ginsburg, Democratic senators and liberal advocates have long been poised to oppose her, warning particularly that she could roll back abortion rights and invalidate the Affordable Care Act. Barrett, the mother of seven children, was a finalist for the Supreme Court spot that went to Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. She is a proven conservative with a compelling personal story. \u201cI am used to being in a group of nine\u2014my family. Nothing is more important to me, and I am so proud to have them behind me,\u201d she is set to say of her husband and seven children. The federal appellate judge and Notre Dame law professor will note that her husband of 21 years, Jesse, has been \u201ca selfless and wonderful partner at every step along the way.\u201d Heaping praise on her husband, Barrett will continue, \u201cI am far luckier in love than I deserve.\u201d No one can recuse Amy Coney Barrett from a Trump election case but herself She also is set to explain that her parents \u201cmodeled for me and my six siblings a life of service, principle, faith, and love,\u201d recounting a time when she was preparing for a spelling bee and her dad boosted her confidence by singing: \u201cAnything boys can do, girls can do better.\u201d That moment, Barrett will say, \u201cspelled my way to victory.\u201d She will note she received similar encouragement from her teachers and professors in college. The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Barrett will run from Monday through Thursday as Republicans push to confirm her to the Supreme Court before Election Day.

            "article_content": "Judge Amy Coney Barrett initially failed to disclose two talks she gave in 2013 hosted by two anti-abortion student groups on paperwork provided to the Senate ahead of her confirmation hearing to become the next Supreme Court justice. Barrett, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, gave the talks \u2013 a lecture and a seminar \u2013 in 2013 in her capacity as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. The seminar was co-sponsored by the school\u2019s Right to Life club and constitutional studies minor, and the lecture was held by the law school\u2019s Jus Vitae club. CNN\u2019s KFile found advertisements for two lectures on social media and in a weekly Notre Dame faculty newsletter. Late on Friday night, hours after this story published, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a supplemental update to Barrett\u2019s committee questionnaire that includes the lecture and seminar, as well as a paid advertisement she signed that criticized Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed support for Notre Dame\u2019s \u201ccommitment to the right to life.\u201d The release came after CNN asked the White House about the advertisement earlier on Friday. It is not known what was said in the two events, though both centered on abortion court cases. In a separate instance, CNN\u2019s KFile found a publicized talk that Barrett gave to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade \u2013 a seminar Barrett disclosed in her Senate paperwork \u2013 was removed by the university from YouTube in 2014. A school spokesman told CNN the video is now lost. Supreme Court won't require in-person dispensing of abortion drug for now Barrett\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court would strengthen its current conservative majority \u2013 creating a 6-3 bloc of conservative justices \u2013 and could limit abortion access. Barrett\u2019s initial failure to disclose the two events also raises questions about whether the questionnaire is complete or whether there will be any consequences from the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees her confirmation hearing. Past chairmen of the powerful committee have halted the nomination process after judicial nominees omitted information in their Senate paperwork but under committee Chairman Lindsey Graham that scenario is unlikely. The committee has slated a hearing for Barrett on October 12 in an effort to confirm her by the full Senate before the election. Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department this week that said Barrett did omit materials concerning Roe v. Wade and asked if Barrett omitted any more materials after the National Review reported that Barrett signed a letter on a \u201cright to life\u201d ad in 2006 that called for the end of the landmark legal decision. White House spokesperson Judd Deere told CNN in an email, \u201cJudge Barrett submitted her lengthy Senate Judiciary Questionnaire, spoke with an overwhelming majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and continues to be transparent throughout her confirmation process. She looks forward to answering questions from the Senators next week.\u201d A spokesperson for the Senate Judiciary Committee told CNN \u201cit is a very normal practice\u201d for Supreme Court nominees to update their questionnaire, noting that several current Supreme Court justices also supplied updated copies. Justice Breyer reminisces about RBG, ducks questions about Barrett CNN reached out multiple times to Barrett through her law chambers but did not get a response. While Barrett\u2019s association with anti-abortion groups has come under scrutiny \u2013 including signing a Right to Life ad in 2006 \u2013 little has been examined about her work with anti-abortion groups at Notre Dame. Barrett gave the talks hosted by the anti-abortion student groups while she was also a member of the Notre Dame chapter University Faculty for Life, which staunchly opposes abortion. In 2016, the group sent a letter asking the university to rescind an award honored to then-Vice President Joe Biden in recognition for his work as an American Catholic. The group called it \u201ca scandalous violation of the University\u2019s moral responsibility (as the American bishops wrote in 2004) never to honor those who act in defiance of fundamental moral principles about the sanctity of life\u201d and attacked his views on abortion. In April 2013, Barrett gave a small hour-long seminar \u201cfor students on changes to law and life for women after Roe v. Wade\u201d entitled \u201cBeing a Woman After Roe.\u201d According to a copy of the Facebook event advertising the seminar, spots were limited to 15 students. A student publication promoted the event as an informal seminar, small group setting in which students can learn more from faculty members who oppose abortion. \u201cThe Right to Life Seminar Series was begun as an opportunity for students and professors to discuss a variety of issues related to human life and dignity,\u201d an advertisement for the event reads. Democrats look to avoid giving GOP fresh election-year material in Supreme Court spectacle The conservative judge also did not disclose that in November 2013 she spoke to Jus Vitae, the law school\u2019s Right to Life club, on \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s Abortion Jurisprudence.\u201d The law school advertised the lecture as focusing on Roe v. Wade and the cases that followed it, including cases that were being litigated on the lower courts at that time. The lecture Barrett did disclose was entitled \u201cRoe at 40: The Supreme Court, Abortion, and the Culture War that Followed,\u201d taking place in January 2013 and open to the university community. It was co-sponsored by the university\u2019s Constitutional Studies minor. However, video for the lecture, which CNN\u2019s KFile found on the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine was advertised by the school as being available on YouTube, was removed by the user in 2014, according to a YouTube spokesperson. Of 11 lectures publicized as available to watch on the school\u2019s event, only Barrett\u2019s was removed from YouTube. After CNN inquired to obtain video of the event, a university spokesperson, Dennis K. Brown, told CNN, \u201cWe have checked with the organizer of the event [sic] have no information on what has become of the video of that lecture.\u201d Several on-campus publications covered the event and Barrett\u2019s remarks at the time. The Observer, Notre Dame\u2019s student newspaper, wrote that Barrett said, \u201dI think it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn Roe as curbed by [Planned Parenthood v.] Casey. The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand,\u201d she said. The Irish Rover, a student publication covering Catholic identity, quoted Barrett as saying, \u201cwhether or not Roe gets overturned is irrelevant,\u201d saying the question of abortion would return to the state level and could still be legal in certain states. As Barrett gave talks on abortion to groups associated with the on-campus Right to Life groups, Barrett was also a member of the university\u2019s chapter of the University Faculty for Life from the group\u2019s founding in 2010 until 2016, according to her Senate paperwork. Notre Dame president faces university backlash following Covid-19 diagnosis While she was a member of the group, the group unanimously passed a resolution for a letter calling on the university to rescind an award given to then-Vice President Biden because of his beliefs on abortion. \u201cNotre Dame claims to award the Laetare Medal \u2018annually to an American Catholic in recognition of outstanding service to Church and society,\u2019\u201d the letter reads. \u201cBut our Faculty for Life Chapter agrees with Bishop Kevin Rhoades that the awarding of the Laetare Medal to Vice-President Biden is a scandalous violation of the University\u2019s moral responsibility (as the American bishops wrote in 2004) never to honor those who act in defiance of fundamental moral principles about the sanctity of life.\u201d The faculty letter attacks Biden\u2019s position on abortion for not wanting to \u201cimpose\u201d the Catholic Church\u2019s teachings on abortion upon a woman or a doctor, supporting the death penalty and for rejecting \u201cthe truth that human life begins at conception.\u201d It also states that public officials like Biden have \u201can especially grave duty to preserve\u201d life. This story has been updated to add that Barrett\u2019s questionnaire was updated with these documents after the story published.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats are preparing a plan of attack against Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to focus squarely on issues they believe will resonate with voters while excoriating Republicans for rushing the nomination, an effort designed to avoid a spectacle that could damage their efforts to win back the Senate majority and the White House. Democrats are cognizant of the political fallout two years ago on some of their vulnerable members from red states after the Senate devolved into the most politically charged battle over a Supreme Court nominee in a generation \u2013 the GOP push to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court \u2013 just weeks before the 2018 midterms. Now with Election Day less than a month away, and with control of the Senate hanging in the balance, Democrats are plotting a careful, methodical case against Barrett \u2013 hoping voters will side with them over issues like health care that are central to their minds in the 2020 campaign. The fear, according to Democratic senators and top party strategists, is that Barrett hearing will devolve into an ugly affair that will give Republicans a wedge issue to stave off deep losses at the polls next month. \u201cI think the Democrats will be very professional,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin, the lone Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh in 2018 and survived his reelection in conservative West Virginia that year. \u201cThey understand how Brett Kavanaugh went off the rails.\u201d As part of that effort, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say they want to steer clear of questions about whether Barrett\u2019s devout Catholic faith will impact her views, an issue that arose during her 2017 confirmation hearings to sit on a federal appeals court and prompted an uproar among Republicans. Instead, Democrats want to center on issues like defending the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic and their argument that the winner of the November 3 election should select the nominee, a position that polls show clear majorities of voters support. As they\u2019ve prepared for next week\u2019s confirmation hearings, multiple aides and members say Democrats on the committee have made the decision not to focus on Barrett\u2019s affiliation with People of Praise, a small, multi-denominational Charismatic Christian group that was founded in the 1970s and believes that members should make a \u201ccovenant\u201d and \u201clifelong promise of love and service to fellow community members,\u201d according to its website. While Barrett is Catholic, her affiliation with the group has become the subject of several stories in recent days \u2013 all of which Democrats on Capitol Hill have been silent on. Senate GOP, setting aside Covid-19 fears, on track for quick Barrett confirmation this month \u201cI don\u2019t intend to question her on her personal views or her private religious views. I don\u2019t expect my colleagues to either,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday during a call with reporters when asked if he planned to talk with Barrett about her faith. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, another Democrat on the Committee, also said that he believed it would be inappropriate to push Barrett to discuss her religion and the impact it would have on her rulings as a judge. \u201cI have no intention of asking Amy Coney Barrett about her religious faith or any issues concerning religion,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI believe that questions should be directed to the nominee\u2019s judicial philosophy.\u201d Whether Democrats stick to that plan remains to be seen. It\u2019s still possible that Democrats could go off script or push Barrett on what role her religious faith might play in her decisions \u2013 particularly on abortion-related cases that come before the court. The Kavanaugh and Barrett proceedings are not the same. Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault \u2013 and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified under oath about her recollection of a harrowing episode from their high school days. Kavanaugh furiously denied the allegations, and Republicans rallied to his defense before narrowly winning enough votes for his confirmation. Meantime, Barrett would be the first nominee confirmed after July in a presidential election year \u2013 and the proceedings are moving much faster than typical Supreme Court hearings with Republicans eager to get her on the bench ahead of the elections. Moreover, President Donald Trump has said he needs a ninth justice on the court to rule on any election disputes, an issue bound to be a flashpoint during the hearings. With the explosive confirmation hearings of Kavanaugh a recent memory, Democrats are heading into next week\u2019s hearing with a simple plan: avoid controversy and don\u2019t delve into Barrett\u2019s personal beliefs. Members are looking to focus their arguments on Barrett\u2019s past writings, public comments and judicial record when it comes to workers\u2019 rights, gun rights, abortion and health care. \u201cShe\u2019s a radical. She is seeking a position on the Supreme Court in order to legislate out of existence background checks,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on a call Thursday. It was soon after Barrett was nominated that Democrats settled on their strategy to focus on the Affordable Care Act. Democratic leaders and members of the Judiciary Committee concluded that health care would be the best way to frame the fight over her nomination with the Supreme Court scheduled to hear arguments on an ACA case just the week after the election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, former Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also had a conversation and agreed on the strategy, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Republicans are already making clear they won\u2019t stand for any questions about her religious faith. Indeed, the issue came up during Wednesday night\u2019s debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris, who is Biden\u2019s running mate and also sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cAnd our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others, we hope she gets a fair hearing,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd we particularly hope that we don\u2019t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\u201d Harris responded by saying that the nominee to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat should be chosen by the winner of the elections, and added: \u201cJoe Biden and I are people of faith. And it\u2019s insulting to suggest we would knock anyone because of their faith.\u201d Indeed, Democrats see other issues to make their case against her nomination \u2013 including abortion rights. Democrats are expected to push Barrett on why she did not disclose she had signed her name to a 2006 newspaper ad in the South Bend Tribune sponsored by the St. Joseph County Right to Life calling the decision of Roe v. Wade \u201cbarbaric.\u201d One Democratic aide closely involved in the planning for the hearing told CNN that discussions on Barrett\u2019s religion would \u201cdistract\u201d and risk putting Democrats on the defensive. Democrats are looking to avoid a repeat of a moment from Barrett\u2019s 2017 confirmation for the 7th Circuit where Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, questioned whether Barrett could separate her religious views from her enforcement of the law. \u201cI think in your case professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is the dogma lives loudly within you,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThat\u2019s of concern.\u201d For their part, Republicans have already been charging that Democrats are imposing a religious test on Barrett as a nominee, pointing to Feinstein\u2019s past comment and those of Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois who asked Barrett in 2017 if she considered herself an orthodox Catholic. The issue came up in the 2017 hearings because of a 1998 law article she had co-written, which said: \u201cThe Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to the death penalty places Catholic judges in a moral and legal bind.\u201d In that hearing, senators in both parties questioned her about the article. In a recent interview, Durbin defended that line of questioning at the time. \u201cShe raised the issue,\u201d Durbin said, pointing to her law review article. \u201cShe was questioned by four different senators: two Democrats, myself included, and two Republicans. What did she mean by this? Ordinarily, you would never raise the question of religion in a hearing,\u201d But Republicans are ready for Democrats to invoke her faith. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted Wednesday that \u201cthe ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett\u2019s faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers.\u201d Democrats have been planning for a potential Supreme Court vacancy since May, according to another Democratic aide working closely on the confirmation hearings, with Schumer\u2019s office spending months looking at potential procedural tools that were available to them and consulting with outside consultants on tools available to them to slow down the process. But Democrats recognize there is little they can do to ultimately stop the nomination, unless four Republicans vote against her or if senators can\u2019t return to vote because they\u2019ve been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Schumer, a New York Democrat, has rejected GOP criticism that Democrats are playing politics with Barrett\u2019s faith, arguing that \u201cno Democrat has attacked Barrett over her faith. It\u2019s a diversion because they don\u2019t want to address the issues including health care and Roe v. Wade.\u201d But if Democrats do raise concerns about her religious views, they are likely to get backlash from even some in their own party. In his meeting with Barrett last week, Manchin, himself a practicing Catholic, told her that he hopes no one uses her religious views to question her views. \u201cAnd I would chastise anyone who did that,\u201d Manchin told CNN.",

            "article_content": "Two top Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee have asked the State Department to turn over records related to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s recent domestic speeches ahead of the presidential election. The top US diplomat has delivered a number of speeches in the past several weeks aimed at domestic audiences \u2013 one at a megachurch in Texas, one to state lawmakers in Wisconsin and, most recently, a virtual one to a conservative Christian organization in Florida. \u201cIt is concerning that the Secretary is suddenly crisscrossing the country at taxpayers\u2019 expense to speak with state legislators and private groups and that these events appear to be increasing in frequency as the November 3rd election approaches,\u201d said Reps. Eliot Engel and Joaquin Castro. \u201cThe nexus of speeches about the Secretary\u2019s personal religious beliefs, to a swing-state legislature accompanied by a former senior Republican party official, and at a paid-access event for an anti-abortion advocacy group, to the Secretary\u2019s official duties as America\u2019s lead diplomat is unclear and possibly illegal.\u201d Rep. Engel agrees to drop Pompeo subpoena now that he has Biden documents In a letter to Undersecretary of State Brian Bulatao and acting legal adviser Marik String, the Democrats asked that the department turn over the latest guidance on Hatch Act compliance and \u201cany and all records reflecting legal guidance sought by or provided to the Secretary in connection\u201d to the Texas, Wisconsin and Florida speeches, as well as \u201cany and all records related to communications between the White House and Department of State regarding Secretary Pompeo\u2019s potential participation in events connected with the campaign to re-elect President Trump.\u201d They asked that the records be provided to the House Foreign Affairs Committee by October 12. \u201cWe are concerned that Secretary Pompeo\u2019s actions threaten the institutional integrity and reputation of the State Department, as well as long-standing principles of election fairness,\u201d Engel and Castro said. \u201cTo that end, we urge the Secretary to cease from engaging in any further activity that could be construed as partisan in nature.\u201d A State Department spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s job is to lead the State Department in executing on the foreign policy priorities President Trump has established to serve the American people. Communicating our mission directly to the American people is one of the most important ways of strengthening it.\u201d A timeline of Trump and those in his orbit during a week of coronavirus developments \u201cThe Department takes all Congressional oversight seriously, though the unilateral characterization of official travel as \u2018political trips\u2019 seems to reveal a less than serious tone to this oversight request,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Department will still review it carefully and consider what accommodations, if any, can be put in place to cooperate with Congress, which is the process the Department follows on all Congressional oversight requests.\u201d Pompeo has shattered past precedent of secretaries of state largely avoiding the domestic political fray, and violated his own State Department regulations by speaking to the Republican National Convention. Castro launched an investigation into the speech in August. His most recent remarks were delivered virtually to the Florida Family Policy Council on Saturday \u2013 a month ahead of Election Day. In his speech, Pompeo touted the administration\u2019s record in the Middle East, its anti-abortion foreign policy moves, and its religious liberty efforts \u2013 all keystone issues for conservative evangelical voters.",

            "article_content": "By nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump took the first step Saturday toward solidifying a 6-3 conservative majority on the high court, a shift that could usher in sweeping changes to health care, as well as abortion, voting and gun rights. But the moment also served as an overture to female voters as Trump tries to address a historic gender gap in the polls. As Barrett spoke in the Rose Garden before an audience that included her seven children \u2013 as a nominee, Trump noted, who could become the first mother of school-aged children to serve on the high court \u2013 she showed how challenging it will be for Democrats to vilify her as a frightening figure who would join the court\u2019s conservative majority in rolling back abortion rights and stripping Americans of their health care protections. The federal appellate judge, who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in the late 1990s, was introduced Saturday evening by Trump as a woman with a \u201ctowering intellect\u201d and \u201cunyielding loyalty to the Constitution\u201d whom he chose because she is one of the \u201cnation\u2019s most brilliant and gifted legal minds.\u201d In her own speech, Barrett skillfully conveyed the attributes of her judicial philosophy that have endeared her to conservatives. But she also touched on elements of her own biography as a \u201croom parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner\u201d that seemed intended to make her a relatable figure to the key voting bloc of suburban independent and Republican-leaning women who could be unnerved by her conservative views on abortion and health care. The Supreme Court hasn't been this conservative since the 1930s At a ceremony that the White House choreographed as a near replica of the 1993 event where then-President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the 48-year-old judge spoke in reverent terms of the liberal icon she would replace, stating that she would be \u201cmindful of who came before me.\u201d Barrett noted that Ginsburg began her career \u201cat a time when women were not welcome in the legal profession,\u201d yet \u201cshe not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them.\u201d In a tacit plea for bipartisanship before the contentious confirmation hearings that will begin on October 12 and that Republicans hope to have wrapped by Election Day, Barrett spoke of her admiration for how the friendship between Scalia, who she called her mentor, and Ginsburg showed \u201cthat arguments \u2013 even about matters of great consequence \u2013 need not destroy affection,\u201d a standard she said she has applied in her own personal and professional relationships. But Barrett also unequivocally cast herself as an acolyte of Scalia, a conservative firebrand who was defined by his \u201coriginalist\u201d approach to interpreting the Constitution, stating that he had \u201can incalculable influence\u201d on her life. \u201cHis judicial philosophy is mine too \u2013 a judge must apply the law as written,\u201d Barrett said of Scalia. \u201cJudges are not policymakers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\u201d   Trump and his allies hope that the nomination, and the President\u2019s recognition of Barrett\u2019s balancing act as an accomplished jurist and working mother, could help the President win back some of the conservative women who he has alienated with his leadership style and handling of the pandemic. But it is difficult to predict whether Trump\u2019s pick will have a definitive impact on the presidential race because Americans hold such firmly defined opinions of Trump and there are few persuadable voters left. Barrett\u2019s conservative credentials and the rightward swerve of the high court, however, could hurt the reelection prospects of vulnerable Senate Republicans, who are struggling to solidify their hold on the GOP base without alienating independent-minded, socially-liberal voters. Democrats quickly sought to re-center the conversation Saturday evening on the threats that a 6-3 conservative court could pose to the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights, while Republicans tried to keep the focus on Barrett\u2019s compelling personal story, as a woman who is balancing her duties on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals with the care of her young children, including two children she and her husband adopted from Haiti and one born with Down syndrome. Former Vice President Joe Biden, along with many other Democratic leaders, focused on the most immediate challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Oral arguments are scheduled one week after the election in a case brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general and the Trump administration, who argue that the law\u2019s individual mandate is unconstitutional and there are legal grounds for striking down the law in its entirety. \u201cPresident Trump has been trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act for four years. Republicans have been trying to end it for a decade. Twice, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Barrett, he said, \u201chas a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act. She critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion upholding the law in 2012.\u201d View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling The former vice president argued that the Senate should not act on Trump\u2019s nomination of Barrett until \u201cafter the American people select their next president and the next Congress,\u201d claiming that the American people are currently voting \u201cbecause their health care hangs in the balance.\u201d Biden noted that medical complications from Covid-19 have created a new set of pre-existing conditions, protections for which could disappear if the ACA is struck down. But polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which has tracked public opinion on the health care law since its passage in 2010, shows that the country is still divided over the Obama-era healthcare law. Their survey earlier this month found that only about half of Americans (49%) hold a favorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 with more than 80% of Democrats backing the law, compared with 48% of independents and 16% of Republicans. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that will hold Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings, said Barrett would \u201cundo (Ginsburg\u2019s) legacy and erase everything she did for our country.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s hand-picked successor to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s seat makes it clear: they intend to destroy the Affordable Care Act & overturn Roe,\u201d Harris said on Twitter, referring to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that affirmed the right to an abortion. \u201cThis selection would move the court further right for a generation & harm millions of Americans.\u201d Trump favors overturning Roe vs. Wade. Barrett has suggested opposition to abortion rights, but like most conservative judicial nominees, has been cautious in her answers about the case. During a 2013 lecture at Notre Dame, she said she thought it was \u201cvery unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn (Roe v. Wade),\u201d adding that \u201cthe fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand.\u201d Notable dissents from Judge Amy Coney Barrett In an extended back-and-forth on Roe with California Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2017 during her confirmation hearings for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett told the Democratic senator she did not want to comment about her agreement or disagreement with any one Supreme Court precedent, because she said she would commit, if confirmed to the appellate court, to \u201cfollow unflinchingly all Supreme Court precedent.\u201d When pressed on how she evaluated the precedents related to Roe, she offered a narrow answer about how she viewed her role as an appellate judge: \u201cRoe has been affirmed many times and survived many challenges in the court,\u201d Barrett said during that 2017 hearing. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more than 40 years old, and it\u2019s clearly binding on all Courts of Appeals. And so it\u2019s not open to me or up to me, and I would have no interest in, as a Court of Appeals judge, challenging that precedent. It would bind.\u201d But for now, Democrats seem most focused on Barrett\u2019s potential impact on health care coverage as an issue that could animate a broader group of voters, at a time when many are already casting their ballots by mail. They are also hoping to avoid the mistakes their party made during the 2017 hearing, when Feinstein\u2019s probing questions about how Barrett\u2019s Catholic faith might affect her judicial opinions made the Notre Dame professor a hero to religious conservatives who argued that Democrats had showed anti-Catholic bias. The highly-charged policy debates that will emerge during Barrett\u2019s upcoming confirmation hearings \u2013 which are also expected to focus on how she would handle election disputes as the President makes his baseless claims about voter fraud \u2013 carry the most potential damage for endangered GOP senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona, who are trying to shore up their support within Trump\u2019s base while also appealing to suburban moms, many of whom favor abortion rights. On the flip side, some in the GOP have argued that the nomination process could help Republican senators in red states like Alaska, Kansas and South Carolina who are being targeted by Democrats this year. 2020 Senate race ratings While CNN polling has shown that nearly six in 10 Americans believe that the winner of the presidential election in November should choose the justice who replaces Ginsburg on the high court, there is no definitive data yet to show whether Trump\u2019s choice has been more animating to conservatives or progressives \u2013 and whether it will actually move votes at the margins. But much of politics is about perception. And in the case of judicial nominees, their bearing and demeanor in these high-pressure appearances can often influence voters\u2019 opinions as much as their writings and opinions. With her adroitly tailored speech and her promise to serve all Americans during her debut on Saturday, Barrett proved that she will be a formidable adversary for Democrats in the weeks to come.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett continues the GOP\u2019s remarkable streak of selecting Catholic jurists for the Supreme Court and underscores the enduring impact of the alliance between conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants, which has transformed the Republican coalition. If the Senate confirms Barrett to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that would mean all six Supreme Court justices appointed by Republican presidents were raised Catholic. Two of them \u2013 Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first nominee \u2013 later attended Protestant churches as adults, although Thomas subsequently reverted to Catholicism. This consistent tilt in Republican nominees for the high court is especially remarkable because Catholics represent a smaller share of the GOP\u2019s electoral coalition than both mainline and especially evangelical Protestants; those evangelicals are by far the party\u2019s largest religious faction, according to annual studies by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute. And yet every Republican president since Ronald Reagan has looked mostly to conservative Catholics, rather than to those two other groups, in choosing candidates for the highest legal prize the party can bestow. \u201cYou have a situation where the evangelicals have been outsourcing their judicial appointments to conservative Catholics,\u201d says Randall Balmer, a professor of religion at Dartmouth University, who has written extensively on the history of evangelical political activism. The Catholic dominance in these selections, many observers say, simultaneously reflects an ideological convergence and an institutional divergence. The ideological convergence is that conservative Catholics, including those in the legal field, have displayed as much commitment to conservative social causes, particularly banning abortion, as evangelical Christians. The institutional divergence is that there is a vastly stronger legal network \u2013 from well-respected law schools to judicial clerkships to lower court appointments \u2013 to provide conservative Catholics with the credentials required to obtain a Supreme Court nomination than exists for evangelical Protestants. The Republican tilt toward Catholics over evangelicals \u201chas to do, in really simple terms, with supply and demand,\u201d says Joshua Wilson, a political scientist at the University of Denver and co-author with Amanda Hollis-Brusky of \u201cSeparate But Faithful,\u201d an upcoming book on conservative Christians in the legal world. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a robust pool of evangelical Protestant lawyers and judges, whereas you do have a robust pool of conservative Catholic judges and lawyers and academics.\u201d   While this pattern of high court appointments testifies to the solidity of the political bond between socially conservative Catholics and evangelicals, it also underscores the choices that have limited the GOP\u2019s appeal to more culturally moderate voters. Many close observers of Republican politics say that one critical reason evangelicals have been comfortable with GOP presidents picking so many Catholic justices is that they believe they share the evangelicals\u2019 desire to overturn or curtail Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision creating a nationwide legal right to abortion; Barrett, whose writings have signaled she might be open to overturning or severely retrenching Roe, could provide the decisive vote to do so. But polls have consistently found that a solid 60% or more majority of Americans want abortion to remain legal. In a Pew Research Center survey last year, support for legal abortion ranged from four-fifths of adults unaffiliated with any religion to nearly two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and three-fifths of White mainline Protestants; even a slight majority of White Catholics supported legal abortion, according to detailed results provided by Pew. Among the major religious groups only a majority of evangelical Protestants (nearly four in five) thought abortion should be illegal in most circumstances. Success for conservatives in ending the legal right to abortion at the court could produce a sharp recoil at the ballot box, particularly among younger voters and most women. Until Reagan\u2019s election, only about half a dozen Catholics had ever been confirmed to the Supreme Court. Reagan named two more \u2013 Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. But they didn\u2019t dominate his decision-making: He also chose Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, a Protestant, and tried to nominate Robert Bork (a Protestant who later converted to Catholicism) and Douglas Ginsburg (who was Jewish). Bork was rejected by the Senate and Ginsburg withdrew his nomination, which ultimately led to Kennedy\u2019s confirmation. George H.W. Bush, the next GOP President, picked Thomas, an African American who was raised Catholic, and David Souter, a little-known state judge from New Hampshire, who was an Episcopalian. George W. Bush placed two more Catholics on the Court: John Roberts and Samuel Alito, though Alito\u2019s nomination came only after bipartisan opposition forced Bush to withdraw his choice of Harriet Miers, a longtime legal adviser who was an evangelical Christian. Trump has now chosen three justices raised Catholic: Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett. Over this same period, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, the two Democratic presidents, won confirmation for three Jewish justices (Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Ginsburg) and one Hispanic Catholic (Sonia Sotomayor); Obama also nominated Merrick Garland, who is Jewish, but the Republican-led Senate refused to consider his appointment in 2016. All of the Catholic GOP appointees have won widespread support among evangelical Christians. Prominent social conservative groups led by evangelicals have quickly rallied for Barrett. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, for instance, has framed questions about Barrett\u2019s association with conservative Catholic groups as a \u201cstartling level of anti-Christian bias.\u201d Previewing what\u2019s likely to be a major GOP theme throughout the confirmation process, Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, two staunch social conservatives, reinforced the message with tweets on Saturday that sought to portray Democratic criticism of Barrett\u2019s views as an attack on her faith. The language from Perkins, an evangelical minister, is especially revealing because it shows how religious conservatives now almost all unite Catholics and conservative Protestants under the same joint banner of \u201cChristian.\u201d That testifies to the enduring success of the religious and political alliance that has transformed the GOP coalition and reordered American politics more broadly. Tension between Protestants and Catholics had been a feature of American political and social life since the first large-scale arrival of Catholics in the US in the decades before the Civil War. Evangelical Protestant denominations were especially dubious of Catholics, particularly in politics: It was to an audience of Southern Protestant ministers in Houston that John F. Kennedy, the only Catholic President, delivered his famous speech in 1960 declaring his independence from the church. Even liberal mainline Protestants in those years raised alarms about growing Catholic political influence, notes Robert P. Jones, CEO and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute.   \u201cIn the 1950s and the 1960s the big battle lines were really between Protestants and Catholics; that was the big culture war fight,\u201d says Jones, author of the new book \u201cWhite Too Long,\u201d a history of American Christianity\u2019s relationship with White supremacy. \u201cIf you were Protestant and you married someone who was Catholic, that was a big deal mid-century.\u201d Politically in those years, Catholics leaned mostly, though not entirely, Democratic while Protestants divided: Northern mainline Protestants were the backbone of the Republican Party, while Southern evangelical Protestants, like the rest of the region, \u201cvoted the way their daddy shot\u201d and reliably supported Democrats against the Republicans who had prosecuted the Civil War. These alignments started to scramble in the 1960s as a White backlash against the civil rights movement moved both more Northern Catholics and Southern evangelicals to the GOP. Social issues that emerged during the 1970s \u2013 particularly the conservative backlash against Roe, but also the first stirrings of the movement for gay rights \u2013 drove cultural conservatives in both groups closer together, while simultaneously loosening the GOP\u2019s hold on mainline Protestants. As Ballmer has written, the final sparks that ignited the modern wave of evangelical Protestant political activism were efforts by Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration to revoke tax-exempt status from racially segregated religious schools. One political visionary, more than any other, midwifed the electoral truce between conservative Catholics and evangelicals. The late Paul Weyrich, though a Catholic from Wisconsin, worked for years to encourage more culturally conservative Southern evangelical ministers to engage in politics and to shift their allegiance to the GOP, as the Democratic Party more consistently tilted left on social issues through the 1970s. It was Weyrich (who also co-founded the Heritage Foundation, for years the right\u2019s premier think tank) who, by most accounts, coined the phrase \u201cthe Moral Majority\u201d and helped to convince fundamentalist minister Jerry Falwell to found that landmark religious right organization. Despite the long years of doctrinal and social conflict between Catholics and evangelicals, Ballmer says, \u201cI think [Weyrich] thought that the common ground was the sense of moral decay in society, and if he could form what he called a moral majority \u2013 and then he actually used that term in his correspondence, lowercase letters \u2013 he could transform the nation. And he was right.\u201d   Years of demographic decline since then hardened the alliance Weyrich conceived, Jones says. \u201cAs the number of White Protestants began to shrink, they brought in White Catholics to this conservative Christian movement,\u201d he says. The alliance, he adds, \u201cgot welded on as the Christian right picked up momentum and essentially needed more foot soldiers than White Protestants could provide at that stage in the game.\u201d Both White Protestants and Catholics have steadily diminished as a share of the nation\u2019s population as America has grown more racially and religiously diverse, with people of color representing a growing proportion and more Americans than ever identifying as secular or unaffiliated with any religious tradition. Just since 2006 in Public Religion Research Institute data, Whites who identify as Catholic or mainline or evangelical Protestants have each fallen by about 5 percentage points as a share of the population; together they now compose only a little over two-fifths of American adults, compared with nearly three-fifths then. But those three communities remain the dominant groups inside the Republican coalition, with evangelical Christians (at 28%), mainline Protestants (21%) and Catholics (16%) still comprising about two-thirds of the party\u2019s supporters, according to 2019 data from the Public Religion Research Institute. (By contrast, those three groups make up only a little more than one-third of Democrats, who rely much more than Republicans on both non-White Christians and Americans of all races who don\u2019t identify with any religious tradition.) Donald Trump has now become a hugely consequential president White Catholics have become a reliable Republican constituency in presidential elections. Since 1980, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 is the only Democratic nominee to have carried them, according to exit polls. In 2016, Trump won just over three-fifths of them, the best performance for any GOP nominee since at least 1980. But evangelical Protestants are an even more steadfast GOP group: Trump won about 80% of them, and previous Republican nominees attracted nearly as many. And while the Pew Research Center\u2019s validated voters study found that many White Catholics drifted back toward Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, evangelical Protestants still gave Republican candidates more than four-fifths of their votes. Public Religion Research Institute polling earlier in September found Trump\u2019s favorability among White evangelicals was nearly 20 percentage points higher than his ratings among White Catholics. All of these electoral measures of the GOP\u2019s reliance on evangelical Protestants only underscores the striking nature of the Catholic dominance in GOP Supreme Court nominations. Few involved in the selection process over the years have discussed why Republicans favor Catholics so often, and those who have portrayed it as essentially a large-scale coincidence. In an email, for instance, Karl Rove, the top political adviser for George W. Bush, told me that religion was irrelevant in Bush\u2019s picks. \u201cThat Roberts and Alito were Catholics was known but not a factor in their appointment, either for or against,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTheir judicial philosophy, character, record on the Federal bench, relative youth, even geography were discussed as considerations, not their religious affiliation. Identity politics concerns (\u2018we better get an evangelical because they are 28% of our coalition and none of the last three Republican appointees have been evangelicals!\u2019) was not considered by 43.\u201d Political scientists who have studied the conservative legal movement say the principal explanation for the disparity isn\u2019t happenstance but a deep institutional disparity: Conservative Catholics have built a much stronger pipeline for producing potential judicial nominees than evangelical Protestants have. Over decades, Catholics have established vastly more well-respected undergraduate colleges and universities than evangelical Protestants have, which has allowed more of their graduates to obtain entry to the top-tier Ivy League law schools, led by Harvard and Yale, that have become indispensable for Supreme Court nominations.   Even at the law school level, institutions controlled by conservative Catholics \u2013 principally Notre Dame Law School, where Barrett taught \u2013  have vastly more prestige than Regent and Liberty, the overtly evangelical law schools attached to universities created by televangelists Pat Robertson and the late Jerry Falwell. In their upcoming book, Hollis-Brusky and Wilson cite data from the American Bar Association showing that the share of recent Notre Dame Law School graduates serving as judicial clerks, an important step on the path toward later judicial appointments, was twice as high as for either of those evangelical institutions. While Notre Dame prides itself on its identity as a legal farm team for the right, Wilson says, for Regent and Liberty, \u201cI think it would be impossible \u2026 in the foreseeable future for a graduate of one of those schools to be appointed to the Supreme Court. It\u2019s too much of a leap.\u201d At the top of the conservative legal pyramid, even the Federalist Society, a group that exerts enormous influence over Republican judicial selection, is headed by a conservative Catholic, Leonard Leo. Wilson says it\u2019s possible that more evangelical Protestant judges will advance through the Republican pipeline over time. The Alliance Defending Freedom, perhaps the leading legal arm for social conservatives, runs a legal fellowship (for which Barrett has served as an instructor) that marks, in its words, \u201cexceptional Christian law students\u201d for advancement on the right; although the group is extremely secretive about its activities (the alliance did not respond to a request for comment), Wilson says that eventually it may position more evangelical conservatives for judicial careers that could culminate in a Supreme Court appointment. But that day, if it comes, almost certainly remains many years away. For now, Barrett\u2019s nomination continues the striking trend of Republican appointments and would ensure a majority of conservative Catholics on the Supreme Court even if one excludes Gorsuch. That majority would stand as an enduring monument to the alliance of culturally conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants who have won control of the GOP. Yet that same conservative court majority may also serve to isolate and limit the Republican Party\u2019s appeal in a country growing more racially and religiously diverse. Already, according to Public Religion Research Institute data, fewer than three in 10 adults younger than 30 identify as White Christians. The GOP is installing a court majority whose views may collide explosively over the coming decade with the dominant perspective among millennials, Generation Z and the younger generation behind them on questions ranging from abortion to racial justice, climate change and gay rights. Replacing Ginsburg with Barrett on the Supreme Court represents a triumphant moment for the conservative social and legal movements. But if the court majority cemented by Barrett alienates the rising generations who will represent the nation\u2019s largest voting bloc by the middle of this decade, that judicial victory could turn to electoral ash.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said he did not discuss specific cases \u2013 including the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision which affirmed the legality of a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion \u2013 with Judge Amy Coney Barrett before nominating her to the Supreme Court. And the President declined to say whether he would like to see the ruling upheld or struck down by the high court despite his previous comments on the case. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was for me to discuss that with her because it\u2019s something she\u2019s going to be ruling on,\u201d Trump said in a pre-taped \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview that aired Sunday. The President said it is possible that Barrett, a conservative federal appeals court judge, could move to overturn Roe if confirmed but did not make a prediction as to whether she would. Democrats have based much of their opposition on the likelihood that Barrett would rule to limit abortion rights as well as undermine the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf you look at her past actions, rulings, I guess maybe she would be in that category that you mentioned, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can say this: that she is certainly conservative in her views and her rulings. We\u2019ll have to see how that all works out. I think it will work out.\u201d Amy Coney Barrett's debut shows she will be a tough adversary for Democrats Trump on Saturday said he is nominating Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court, setting off a fierce partisan battle in the waning days of a hotly contested presidential election. Asked specifically in the interview if he would like to see Roe overturned, Trump didn\u2019t directly answer but pivoted to why he hadn\u2019t discussed the issue with Barrett.  As a follow-up when Trump was asked if he thought a 6-3 conservative leaning court, with three of his picks sitting as justices, would potentially rule on an issue related to the Roe ruling, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible. And maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they\u2019d give it back to the states. You just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Trump has stacked the federal bench, but he's not winning many election court battles Trump said in 2016 that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade \u201cautomatically\u201d if he appointed enough conservative justices, as he is poised to do now in his first term. Without being asked, Trump also noted that he has been \u201csurprised\u201d by some of the high court\u2019s rulings since successfully installing two conservative justices without providing further detail. \u201cI\u2019ve been surprised by some of the rulings we\u2019ve already had over the last year. You think you know somebody, and then you get rulings that are a little bit different than you think could happen, so you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said. Amy Coney Barrett, a proven conservative with a compelling personal story Barrett\u2019s nomination comes at a critical time in history, as the President openly questions the integrity of the upcoming election and has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power in the event he loses. He\u2019s repeatedly said that the Supreme Court needed to have all nine seats filled ahead of Election Day, in case the court needed to weigh in on the legality of mail-in ballots being sent to Americans across the country during the pandemic. Several weighty cases also loom, should she be confirmed as swiftly as Republicans hope, including one that could determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act.

            "article_content": "Democrats on Saturday night launched their case against federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, saying support for her confirmation was equivalent to a vote to end the Affordable Care Act. In a rush of statements following Barrett\u2019s Rose Garden introduction, top Democrats put the fate of the law \u2013 and its popular protections for patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 front and center. They also made frequent reference to the coronavirus pandemic, and the chaos that could arise from stripping health insurance options from millions of Americans in its midst. From the Democratic presidential ticket on down, criticism of Barrett repeatedly circled back to what has been a political winner for the party: health care \u2013 and the backlash to Republican efforts to dismantle the ACA, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policy achievement. Republicans have signaled plans for a quick Supreme Court confirmation process. Here's when it could happen. \u201cPresident Trump has been trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act for four years. Republicans have been trying to end it for a decade. Twice, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional,\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice president, said in a statement. \u201cBut even now, in the midst of a global health pandemic, the Trump Administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d Biden made specific reference to some of the lingering tolls of the illness, including scarring of the lungs and heart damage, describing those complications as \u201cthe next deniable pre-existing condition.\u201d Democrats have been weighing a number of options in how they plan to frame their opposition to Barrett\u2019s nomination. Her writings on abortion rights, and the expectation among most liberals and many conservatives that she would side with a decision to undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade, were also cited by a number of Democrats on Saturday and in the run-up the White House ceremony. Republicans\u2019 decision to move forward with the nomination, in defiance of the logic of their blockade of Obama\u2019s pick, Merrick Garland, in 2016, has been woven into Democrats\u2019 initial argument against Barrett. California Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden\u2019s running mate and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings, made only one passing mention of the nominee in her own statement. \u201cRepublicans are desperate to get Judge Barrett confirmed before the Supreme Court takes up this case in November and millions of Americans will suffer for their power play,\u201d she said. Harris took aim at Trump, too, saying the President had effectively created a \u201clitmus test\u201d for his Supreme Court nominees: \u201cDestroy the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with preexisting conditions and overturn our right to make our own health care decisions.\u201d That message was echoed in the words of the Senate\u2019s top-ranking Democrats: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Washington Sen. Patty Murray. Schumer was the most direct, drawing a straight line between Barrett\u2019s confirmation and the fate of the ACA.   \u201cThe American people should make no mistake\u2014a vote by any Senator for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions,\u201d Schumer said. Murray echoed Schumer in a series of tweets. \u201cPresident Trump has told us repeatedly what he wants in a justice: a jurist who above anything else is committed to gutting health care through the courts and ending safe, legal abortion in the United States of America,\u201d Murray tweeted. \u201cMake no mistake, a vote to confirm a Supreme Court nominee who meets President Trump\u2019s tests is a vote to take away people\u2019s health care and vital rights.\u201d Durbin tied the health care argument to Democratic complaints of Republican hypocrisy over the timing of the process, which GOP leaders hope to wrap before Election Day. \u201cIt is clear why Republicans have reversed their position from 2016 about giving the American people \u2018a voice\u2019 in filling an election year vacancy,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cThey want another vote on the Supreme Court for their lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act \u2013 eliminating health insurance for millions, ending protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and raising costs for millions more \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d The health care-centered argument bridged ideological factions within the party. The campaign of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sent an email to supporters with the subject line, \u201cConfirming Amy Coney Barrett will be the end of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in a series of tweets, called the nomination \u201cillegitimate\u201d and described GOP efforts to push through her nomination as the capper on a \u201ca decades-long assault on our judiciary by billionaires and giant corporations to tilt the courts for the rich and powerful.\u201d But Warren, too, returned to health care, writing, \u201cWe know Trump will pick a Supreme Court nominee who will deliver the death blow to the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions of people during a deadly pandemic. We know it because he\u2019s already in Court demanding this.\u201d The two Democratic senators from the crucial swing state of Nevada also highlighted the Affordable Care Act in their reactions to Trump\u2019s announcement. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said she was \u201ccertain,\u201d based on her study of Barrett ahead of her 2017 confirmation to the federal bench, that the nominee \u201cwould be the deciding vote that rips away protections for preexisting conditions for over one million Nevadans, and millions of Americans.\u201d \u201cNot only does Judge Barrett support the President\u2019s plan to dismantle our nation\u2019s health care law and eliminate reproductive freedoms,\u201d said Sen. Jacky Rosen, \u201cbut the rush to confirm her nomination clearly violates the precedent that Senate Republicans set just four years ago for filling a Supreme Court vacancy.\u201d Democrats have been careful, though, not to make mention of Barrett\u2019s faith, worried that their opposition could be used as fodder for Republican claims of anti-Catholic bias. Still, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 earlier on Saturday \u2013 tweeted a video clip suggesting just that. \u201cToday the assault may be on Catholicism,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cBut tomorrow, no religion will be safe from the same attacks  And then the message will be clear, if you want to serve in public office, especially on the highest court in the land, only those willing to hide or deny their faith need apply.\u201d In his comments to camera, Rubio referenced the now infamous line of questioning from California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said of Barrett at her 2017 hearing, \u201cthe dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d That comment roiled Catholic conservatives and led Republicans to accuse Democrats of imposing \u201creligious tests\u201d on judicial nominees. Democrats, this time out, appear determined to steer clear of the headlines that followed.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to write his name in history, to leave a presidential legacy that can\u2019t be erased no matter what happens on November 3. And now he has it. With his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court \u2013 and her likely confirmation by the Senate by the end of next month \u2013 Trump will have personally chosen one-third of the members of the nation\u2019s highest court and reshaped its ideology for decades to come. Assuming Barrett is confirmed, Trump will have appointed more Supreme Court justices in his first term than any president since Richard Nixon, who appointed 4 between 1969 and 1971. And that is in addition to the more than 200 appointments Trump has made to lower courts during his first term in office.   It\u2019s not too much to say that, with a major helping hand from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell of Kentucky, Trump has remade the judicial branch \u2013 from top to bottom \u2013 in a way that his predecessors can only dream of.  And that, even if former Vice President Joe Biden beats Trump in 38 days time, it ensures that the 45th president will be remembered (for good and for ill) by partisans for a generation or more. \u201cI\u2019m going to be up to 280 judges very soon,\u201d Trump told Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in May 2020. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever had that. Two hundred and eighty. You know? Nobody\u2019s ever had that.\u201d Trump added that federal judicial opening are \u201clike golden nuggets.\u201d Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, himself acknowledged the impact of a president\u2019s ability to appoint judges for a lifetime \u2013 all the way back in 1991. Notable dissents from Judge Amy Coney Barrett \u201cThe decision will affect what happens in this country long after Senator Biden is gone, long after President Bush is gone, long after President Reagan\u2019s administrations are forgotten,\u201d Biden said in a 1991 speech. \u201cIf  [David] Souter, God willing, lives as long as the average age of the Court now, he\u2019ll be making landmark decisions in the year 2020. I\u2019ll be dead and gone in all probabilty.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That\u2019s especially true given the age of Trump\u2019s three appointees \u2013 and their ideological makeup. Barrett, at 48, would be the youngest justice on the court, followed by fellow Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch, at 53, and Brett Kavanaugh, at 55. The next youngest justice is Obama appointee Elena Kagan, at 60. But then comes Chief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, who is 65 years old. Three of the four youngest justices therefore will have been appointed by Republican presidents, with the three youngest all put on the high court by Trump. Trump selects Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court And then there is the ideological shift. When Trump moved into the White House in January 2017, the Supreme Court had four justices appointed by Republican presidents (Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four justices appointed by Democratic presidents (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan). The ninth seat, vacated by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February 2016, had been left unfilled \u2013 as Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama\u2019s pick for the seat: Merrick Garland.   Trump moved quickly, putting Gorsuch into the Scalia seat \u2013 swapping a conservative for a conservative. Then when swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, who long rankled conservatives with his liberal rulings on issues like gay marriage and abortion, announced his retirement in the summer of 2018, Trump chose Kavanaugh, another reliably conservative justice for the opening. (Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation fight, defined by allegations of sexual misconduct as a teenager, was the ugliest in modern memory; he was confirmed with just 50 votes.) But it is in his latest pick that Trump will truly bend the ideology of the Supreme Court. RBG was, without question, the leading liberal on the bench. She will now be replaced by someone, in Barrett, who clerked for Scalia, and has long been a favorite daughter of the conservative legal community. Assuming Barrett is confirmed \u2013 and McConnell appears to have the votes to make it so \u2013 the court will have a clear 6-3 conservative majority, with Roberts, who has been the key swing vote of late on major issues including the constitutionality of Obamacare, made somewhat less vital. (Vice President Mike Pence called Roberts a \u201cdisappointment to conservatives\u201d last month.)   That is a massive shift that has both near term (the Court is set to again consider the legality of the Affordable Care Act on November 10) and long term (legalized abortion) implications. For Trump, that long-tail effect means that even if he loses to Biden this fall, his legacy (and name) will carry on \u2013 as the man who tilted the courts to conservatives. (I would argue Trump will also be remembered for his botched handling of the coronavirus, which has left more than 200,000 Americans dead.) Which is what Trump has always longed for. It\u2019s why he makes ridiculous rhetorical claims about how his administration has done more in its first fill-in-the-blank-years than any administration ever. It\u2019s why he compares himself favorably to out greatest presidents \u2013 including Abraham Lincoln. (\u201cI\u2019ve always said I can be more presidential than any president in history except for Honest Abe Lincoln, when he\u2019s wearing the hat,\u201d Trump said in 2019. It\u2019s why Trump was baffled that George Washington didn\u2019t name Mount Vernon after himself. (\u201cIf he was smart, he would\u2019ve put his name on it,\u201d Trump said, according to Politico. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.\u201d) And it\u2019s why he has repeatedly expressed interest in his head being added to Mount Rushmore. (\u201cEvery single president on Mt. Rushmore \u2013 I\u2019d ask whether or not you think I will someday be on Mt. Rushmore,\u201d Trump said in 2017. \u201cBut here\u2019s the problem: If i did it, joking, totally joking, the fake news media would say he believes he should be on Mt. Rushmore. So I won\u2019t say it.\u201d (Note: He did say it.) What\u2019s ironic is that, for all of his efforts to make himself someone who will be remembered after he is gone, Trump\u2019s legacy will be one that just sort of happened to him. Senate Republicans refusing to seat Garland opened the door for Trump to nominate Gorsuch. Kennedy\u2019s retirement, over which Trump had zero control, gave him the chance to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. And, finally, the death of RBG, after she had repeatedly battled cancer and vowed to stay on the court until after the 2020 election, has handed Trump that rarest of all opportunities: A meaningful ideological shift for decades to come. Trump\u2019s legacy \u2013 or at least a piece of it \u2013 is now secure. Even if he didn\u2019t do much to secure it.",

            "article_content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is slated to keynote a gala event for a conservative Christian organization in Florida \u2013 an appearance that comes a month before Election Day and may violate legal and ethical guidelines. Not only is the top US diplomat advertised as the featured guest at the Florida Family Policy Council\u2019s 15th Anniversary Gala on October 3, a \u201cpersonal visit with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u201d is included with a $10,000 table sponsorship. Tickets to a VIP reception featuring Pompeo are included in $5,000 and $3,000 table sponsorships and $500 VIP tickets, according to the organization. This could be a breach of federal regulations, according to Don Fox, former acting director and general counsel for the US Office of Government Ethics (OGE). \u201cThere is a provision in federal regulations that prohibits executive branch employees from misusing their office for private gain, and that includes the private gain of any other entity to include in a non for profit,\u201d said Fox. Mike Pompeo traveled with Reince Priebus on his plane to Wisconsin this week \u201cIf Pompeo were speaking at, you can imagine, any other kind of gala event, and basically anybody could just buy a ticket at general admission, that would be one thing,\u201d Fox explained. \u201cBut when there is a premium placed on personal access to the secretary, I think that does cross a line in terms of ethics restrictions, because now you\u2019re buying personal access to a cabinet member, and that goes for the benefit of this non for profit organization and doesn\u2019t matter what the non for profit is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe line that\u2019s crossed is this is actually buying personal access to him,\u201d Fox told CNN. Beyond the question about paid access, Fox said there is also the matter of whether speaking at a specific event aligns with the secretary of state\u2019s mission. \u201cThere is sort of an appearance question that he and his staff and frankly the ethics staff ought to kind of weigh about \u2013 is this in the best interest of the Department of State, and the United States government to appear in an event like this,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe appearance of any kind of impropriety\u201d factors into whether the invitation should be accepted at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to imagine what this organization\u2019s legitimate interests are in US foreign policy,\u201d Fox said, noting that if he were the top US diplomat\u2019s ethics adviser, he\u2019d question whether Pompeo should participate. According to its website, the mission of the Florida Family Policy Council (FPPC) is \u201cTo Protect and Defend Life, Marriage, Family and Liberty Through Education, Advocacy and Empowerment.\u201d It is anti-abortion and argues that \u201c(r)eligious liberty around the country is being threatened by radical LGBT activists who will not stop until they force all Americans to approve, support and celebrate their lifestyle.\u201d FPPC says it \u201cis one of 38 state-based policy councils around the country associated with Focus on the Family, Alliance Defending Freedom and Family Research Council.\u201d Pompeo spoke on Tuesday with the Family Research Council\u2019s President Tony Perkins at the conservative Values Voters Summit. He has addressed a number of events focusing on religion and has been outspoken about his personal religious beliefs during his tenure as secretary of state. The State Department did not respond to questions about Pompeo\u2019s involvement in the organization\u2019s anniversary gala. FPPC President John Stemberger told CNN Saturday that the organization had invited Pompeo to appear months ago and he is not being compensated in any way. They do not plan to use any official seal on the podium when he speaks or any official backdrop other than the one with the FPPC logo on it, Stemberger said. The funds raised from the event \u201cwill go to support the work of our organization,\u201d he said. The FPPC event is exactly one month ahead of Election Day and is Pompeo\u2019s second appearance in a battleground state in almost as many weeks. House Democrat opens investigation into Pompeo's RNC speech Fox said the proximity to the presidential election is \u201ca background that you can\u2019t ignore.\u201d Pompeo has shattered past precedent of secretaries of state largely avoiding the domestic political fray, and violated his own State Department regulations by speaking to the Republican National Convention. On Wednesday, he met with business leaders and lawmakers and delivered remarks in the Wisconsin state senate. The State Department defended it as \u201can important policy speech to the Wisconsin State Senate on why state legislators across our country must be vigilant against the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s malign influence at the subnational level.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from FPPC President John Stemberger.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats say they will press President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee to commit to recuse herself if the justices hear a case that could impact the outcome of the fall elections, a request that could become a major flashpoint amid Trump\u2019s persistent attacks on the legitimacy of the elections. Trump in recent weeks has amped up his rhetoric about the elections, provoking alarm that he\u2019s trying to undercut a foundation of democracy and hang onto power through a court fight. He\u2019s regularly alleged the election will be \u201crigged,\u201d asserted there will be mass voting fraud by mail \u2013 something his own FBI director disputes \u2013 while refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. He\u2019s said he believes a case over the election results will wind up before the Supreme Court.   So as Democrats prepare for high-stakes confirmation hearings over Trump\u2019s nominee, who would likely swing the ideological balance sharply to the right, they plan to press the potential next justice to commit to not voting in any case that could impact the outcome of the presidential race. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a senior Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the quick process to confirm a nominee before Election Day \u201cridiculous\u201d and said the nominee, if confirmed, should recuse herself from a case affecting the election \u2013 even as the White House insists such a recusal is not necessary. \u201cWhoever sits on the seat is going to be terribly conflicted because no matter what they do people are going to be watching,\u201d Leahy told CNN on Friday. The forthcoming clash comes as Democrats are beginning to prepare their strategy for confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s nominee, who will be announced on Saturday. All indications are that Trump will pick federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett, who was approved by the Senate largely along party lines to her current spot after contentious exchanges with Democrats during her confirmation hearing three years ago. Typically, it takes two to three months to go through Supreme Court confirmation proceedings in the Senate. But this time, Senate Republicans are gearing up for the nominee to be confirmed by the end of October, amounting to one of the quickest proceedings in modern times. Democrats weigh how to handle Trump's potential Supreme Court pick after past flap over Barrett's faith Hoping for a swift confirmation, the White House is setting up courtesy meetings with senators even before the nominee has been announced. But Democrats are furious at the rush to confirm the nominee after the GOP refused to take up then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick in 2016 by arguing in March of that year it was too close to an election. And several Democrats told CNN they won\u2019t bother meeting with Trump\u2019s nominee now over their concerns with the expedited process. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good use of her time or my time,\u201d Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said when asked if he would meet with the nominee. Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee, added: \u201cI\u2019ve said that all of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, whatever they have to say to me would be under oath.\u201d With Trump needing 51 votes in a chamber occupied by 53 Republican senators, the nominee almost certainly will be confirmed by the GOP-led Senate, barring any missteps at the hearing or controversies that may emerge. That means Democrats have one major chance to paint the nominee unfavorably and potentially scuttle her chances during the hearings, which are tentatively scheduled to begin the week of October 12. The Democrats\u2019 focus will in large part be on health care, including the nominee\u2019s views on abortion rights, as well as the Affordable Care Act given that a GOP-led challenge to the law will be heard just a week after Election Day. But Democrats plan to spotlight the arguments the President himself has been making in recent weeks over the fairness of the November 3 elections and the likely court fights that will ensue. Democrats, both on and off the Judiciary Committee, said that the nominee must make it clear she would not get involved in a case dealing with a President who had just nominated her to the lifetime position. As they rally behind Trump's pick, GOP senators struggle to explain refusal to move on Obama's nominee And since it is up to each justice to make his or her own decision on recusal, Democrats say getting a commitment during the confirmation hearing will be crucial. \u201cNo one nominated in this process will be viewed as impartial,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who was his party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2016, said Friday. \u201cThat person sadly cannot be viewed as impartial on matters dealing with the presidential election \u2013 especially after the President said he\u2019s got to get a ninth justice on the court to resolve these likely election disputes.\u201d Kaine added: \u201cI think in order to avoid an appearance of bias, you have to recuse yourself.\u201d But the White House and Senate Republicans say that\u2019s unnecessary, arguing that all nominees have ties to the president who nominated them \u2013 including the one Trump will announce on Saturday. Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Thursday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was asked if the nominee would have to recuse herself \u201cgiven the process that\u2019s unfolding right now.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cI mean no more than anybody that was confirmed under President Barack Obama or George Bush or anybody else recusing themselves.\u201d Meadows insisted that so far during the vetting process, questions about the elections \u201care not part of the process.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans argue a full slate of justices is needed before November 3 to help resolve any election disputes and avoid a 4-4 tie where the lower court ruling would stand. \u201cIf there\u2019s a court challenge to the election, it will be decided in court \u2013 and the loser of the challenge will accept the results,\u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, told CNN. \u201cI promise the American people, if there\u2019s litigation over the election, which there probably will be, because it\u2019s the highest court of the land, whatever they decide, I will accept.\u201d But asked about concerns that Trump is seeking to fill the seat to help tilt a court challenge to the election toward him, Graham simply said: \u201cWe need a full court.\u201d Democrats say that has given them plenty reason to worry. \u201cI think at this point, there\u2019s a direct conflict of interest,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who also signaled he wouldn\u2019t meet with Trump\u2019s nominee before a confirmation vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a total abuse of power for the President to be handpicking a justice who could play a role in that decision on his behalf.\u201d Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said a judge \u201cshould not only avoid impropriety but the appearance of impropriety. I can\u2019t image a higher appearance of impropriety than a judge appointed by a President as a judge in a case involving the President\u2019s election.\u201d King added: \u201cIf they do things like make a decision within weeks of their appointment that is favorable to the person that appointed them, that undermines public confidence in the courts. And public confidence is all the courts have at the end.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden has nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to pick a Black woman. Now, the nomination process enters a new phase. There will be hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin. Activist groups and senators will pore over Jackson\u2019s record. Usually the candidate is a judge \u2013 and Jackson sits on the federal appellate court in Washington, DC \u2013 but there\u2019s no requirement in the Constitution that the person be a judge or even a lawyer. That\u2019s just the recent custom. Read more about Jackson\u2019s personal history and legal record from CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue. The confirmation process timeline varies. For instance, with the 2020 election bearing down and the likelihood they would lose control of the Senate, Republicans pushed through Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination in lightning speed \u2013 less than a month. Before that, the last nomination to proceed to confirmation in less than two months was Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s back in 1993. These things usually take months. But Democrats may well lose control of the Senate in the November midterm elections, so they\u2019ll work to move this process along. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to the Barrett timeline as a model, according to CNN\u2019s reporting. It takes 51 votes in the Senate \u2013 a simple majority. Republicans are adamant about maintaining a 60-vote threshold for legislation. But they actually nuked the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees during the Trump administration, so confirmation takes only a simple majority. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a 50-50 tie, which is a real possibility in these partisan times. There are 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with Democrats. It\u2019s a split chamber. Overwhelming support for nominees, regardless of their political views, used to be routine. Breyer is seen as a liberal justice but he was confirmed 87-9. That kind of bipartisanship has not been seen in recent years. None of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees received more than 54 votes. Keep an eye on the more moderate Republicans, like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has shown himself to be perfectly willing to buck the party line. Democrats will also need to consider other potential wild cards in the Senate. Voting rights is sure to be a key issue as Democrats make that one of their top priorities heading into the 2022 midterm elections and after a raft of decisions by the current court. Abortion has previously been a key issue during nomination battles. The current court seems poised to either overturn or drastically scale back Roe v. Wade. The list goes on. A Supreme Court justice\u2019s term is for life! Or until he or she retires. That\u2019s been interpreted as giving the justices life tenure. Breyer was 56 when President Bill Clinton picked him in 1994. Most justices are in their late 40s or early 50s when they\u2019re nominated. Jackson is 51. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who were appointed by Trump, are both in their early to mid-50s. Barrett is 49. If she serves until she\u2019s 87 like Ginsburg, she would be on the court for almost 40 years. The average length of a Supreme Court tenure has grown a lot. Harvard Business Review did an actuarial analysis in 2018 and argued the average tenure over the next 100 years will grow to 35 years. It was 17 over the previous 100 years. That also means there will be fewer and fewer of these nominees, which is why Democrats had been itching for Breyer to retire while they control the White House and the Senate. Strategically. Justices have increasingly tried to time their retirements. Republican-appointed justices tend to wait for Republican presidents \u2013 like Anthony Kennedy, who retired in 2018, allowing Trump to pick his successor. Breyer had been under intense pressure from Democrats to retire now, when Democrats hold the White House and the Senate. Ginsburg tried to pick her moment, and it backfired horribly for her political allies. She wanted the first female President to pick her replacement, so she declined to retire during the Obama administration, hoping that Hillary Clinton would get to name a successor. Instead, Ginsburg died on the bench with just enough time for Trump to appoint a successor. Now, a woman\u2019s right to an abortion is likely to be curtailed by the more conservative court she left behind. The same thing could have happened with Antonin Scalia, the Republican-appointed justice who died at the end of Obama\u2019s term. But because then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to even allow a hearing on Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia, the court\u2019s conservative majority was protected. We live in a republic, where the Electoral College picks the President and senators confirm Supreme Court justices. And we are, increasingly, governed by people who represent a minority of Americans. That will continue on the court for a long time. In 2020, CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein wrote a very thoughtful piece on this undemocratic element of US democracy. A lot of Democrats think it should. They would like to either expand the size to dilute the influence of the conservative majority or impose term limits to create more turnover. A commission appointed by Biden found near consensus for imposing term limits on justices, and suggested adding justices to the nine-member Supreme Court would be more controversial. The White House has not endorsed any specific reform plan. The Constitution gives Congress the ability to set the makeup of the court. And its words have been interpreted to give justices life terms. But the actual words are different, saying justices shall serve during times of \u201cgood behavior.\u201d It doesn\u2019t list a term or an end date, so one has never been applied. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it couldn\u2019t. But how this would be accomplished would be up for debate. Here\u2019s the relevant language from Article III: The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. This could more easily be accomplished. The size of the court went up and down pretty regularly during the first 100 years of the US. But it\u2019s been set at nine since the 1860s. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried and failed to expand the court to 15 justices in the 1930s. Several Democrats, notably Pete Buttigieg, were pushing a similar idea during the last presidential primary. The most important Democrat right now, Biden, has said he opposes it. Supreme Court vacancies are usually more of a motivator for Republican voters than for Democratic ones. That may not be the case now that Republican-appointed justices have such a strong majority. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "Just hours after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last Friday, Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins took to Twitter to offer his, um, thoughts. \u201cRIP to the more than 30 million innocent babies that have been murdered during the decades that Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended pro-abortion laws,\u201d tweeted Collins. \u201cWith @realDonaldTrump nominating a replacement that values human life, generations of unborn children have a chance to live.\u201d RIP to the more than 30 million innocent babies that have been murdered during the decades that Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended pro-abortion laws. With @realDonaldTrump nominating a replacement that values human life, generations of unborn children have a chance to live. Days later, Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R), who Collins is challenging for the seat this fall, launched an ad comparing her conservatism favorably to that of Attila the Hun. \u201cDid you know Kelly Loeffler was ranked the most conservative Senator in America,\u201d says a woman in the commercial. \u201cYep, she\u2019s s more conservative than Attila the Hun,\u201d replies a man. Cut to a guy dressed up like Attila (I guess), grunting out orders to an underling that include \u201celiminate the liberal scribes.\u201d It's true. pic.twitter.com/Yea3phqB2s Those twin moments are (somewhat shocking) proof that there is no such thing as \u201ctoo extreme\u201d in the race to be the next Republican Senator from Georgia. Attack RBG\u2019s views on abortion rights literally hours after she\u2019s died? FINE!  Compare yourself to an ancient warrior legendary for his barbarity? VERY COOL! (Sidebar: Collins went after Loeffler for the Attila the Hun comparison \u2013 but not for the reasons you think. \u201cFYI Attila the Hun was an open-borders globalist who killed Christians and practiced postnatal abortion,\u201d he tweeted.) Loeffler and Collins are also both relentlessly touting their ties to Trump in the race. The \u201cAttila\u201d ad ends with a narrator touting Loeffler\u2019s \u201c100% Trump voting record\u201d while Collins has taken to calling himself \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s top defender and preferred pick in this race.\u201d (Trump initially urged Gov. Brian Kemp to appoint Collins to the seat vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson.) What this race to the ideological right makes clear is that both Collins and Loeffler believe that the sort of tough-guy, performance conservatism that Trump has pioneered over the past five years is the way into the hearts (and votes) of Republicans in Georgia. (It\u2019s worth noting that Georgia is also the state that has produced Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican candidate for Congress who has made her name nationally with her embrace of QAnon and a Facebook image in which she is holding a gun next to images of Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib.) The race to be the most Trump-y between Loeffler and Collins is, at the minute, quite close. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll released this week showed Loeffler leading the way with 23.5% followed by Collins at 20.5% and Rev. Raphael Warnock (D) at 20.3%.

Because the seat is technically a special election to serve out the remaining years on Isakson\u2019s term, all candidates \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 will appear on the same \u201cjungle primary\u201d ballot on November 3. If no one gets 50% of the vote, which is likely in the crowded field, the top two vote-getters advance to a January runoff for the seat. Both Loeffler and Collins believe that if they can make that runoff, they would be likely to win \u2013 given Georgia\u2019s traditional GOP tilt. (The Peach State is moving toward Democrats, however, and is considered a swing state in the presidential race this year.) That both of them believe the only way to win over Republican voters is to try to out-Trump the other speaks to just how dominant a force the president has become in GOP politics \u2013 even as his overall approval numbers and chances of being reelected in November have slipped badly.",

            "article_content": "In a tense exchange between Amy Coney Barrett and Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2017, the California Democrat sharply questioned whether the judicial nominee could separate her Catholic views from her legal opinions. \u201cThe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you,\u201d Feinstein pointedly said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for years in this country.\u201d The exchange became a rallying cry for Republicans \u2013 and quickly put Democrats on the defensive as the GOP accused them of creating a religious litmus test for President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to sit on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats said the exchange was in reference to Barrett\u2019s own writings on the topic that had prompted questions from both parties \u2013 and concerns from progressives that she would chip away at abortion rights. Now Barrett appears to be the front-runner for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. And Democrats are beginning to discuss how to avoid such pitfalls when they face off against the President\u2019s nominee in confirmation hearings as soon as next month, recognizing that\u2019s likely their lone shot at derailing a conservative jurist who could tilt the ideological balance of the court for decades to come. \u201cI never really focused on religious beliefs. They are really, in my view, irrelevant to her qualification,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who\u2019s a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday. \u201cEverybody\u2019s entitled to believe or practice and worship as they like. My focus is on substantive issues.\u201d But asked if her religious views should be off-limits if Barrett comes before the committee again, Sen. Mazie Hirono said: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cLook, it wasn\u2019t her religious views \u2013 it\u2019s anybody\u2019s views that they bring to their decision making,\u201d said Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who\u2019s also a member of the committee. \u201cSo they keep telling us that none of the things they wrote or said yesterday should infringe on their decision, but how can we be assured that they can be objective? \u2026 Why should we say you get a lifetime appointment so that you can reflect your ideological agenda in your decision making?\u201d Asked if she would pursue that line of questioning again, Feinstein declined to say: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go there.\u201d She added, \u201cLet\u2019s wait till she\u2019s nominated,\u201d when asked how Democrats would target a Barrett nomination. The debate underscores the challenge facing Democrats as they try to nail down the right strategy to battle a nomination that appears to be on the glide path to confirmation on the backs of Republicans. On private conference calls in the aftermath of the death last week of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Democrats have had a wide-ranging discussion about their plans and tactics. Overwhelmingly, they believe they must focus their message on how the new nominee would jeopardize the health care of millions, with the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court and persistent court challenges against abortion rights. They also believe they should focus on what they view as a blatant power grab by the GOP to jam a nominee through on the eve of a national election, contradicting the Republican refusal to move on President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee eight months before the 2016 election. And increasingly, Democrats are trying to steer clear of talk that they would change the makeup of the Supreme Court by adding seats to it if they take the Senate majority this fall, with some arguing that gives the GOP ammunition in the battle for control of the chamber. \u201cI\u2019m not for retaliatory moves,\u201d said Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, the Democrats\u2019 most vulnerable senator this cycle, pushing back on calls to add seats to the court. He wouldn\u2019t say if he would oppose a Trump pick no matter what. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who also faces voters in November, said: \u201cNo\u201d when asked if she backs adding more seats to the court if Democrats take the majority. \u201cI think the important thing right now is that people need to make our Republican colleagues and the Trump administration aware \u2026 if they believe, as I do, that they should let the election go forward and the next president, whoever that is, nominate the nominee to the Supreme Court,\u201d Shaheen said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and progressive firebrand, sidestepped questions when asked if she favored adding seats to the Supreme Court. \u201cWe need to talk about what\u2019s at stake now: What\u2019s at stake in the lives of millions and millions of families,\u201d Warren said Tuesday. Others declined to weigh in. \u201cWith the mask, I can\u2019t even hear you,\u201d Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona told a reporter within earshot when asked about her views on adding seats to the court, as she walked onto an elevator. When Barrett was confirmed to her current post, just three Democrats voted for her \u2013 Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, who lost his race in 2018. But Kaine and Manchin told CNN on Tuesday that they would vote against Barrett now if she gets the nomination, over concerns about the GOP effort to confirm a nominee with less than two months before Election Day. Asked why he had voted for Barrett in 2017, Kaine said: \u201cI think I needed a reason to vote no. So I voted yes because she had a distinguished record and, watching her performance at the committee, I think she was entitled to her position based on her record.\u201d But Kaine added that if she\u2019s nominated now, \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for a nominee of an illegitimate process. And I don\u2019t care who it is. It could be Aaron Judge or Judge Judy, I\u2019m not gonna vote for somebody that\u2019s put up in an illegitimate process.\u201d Manchin told CNN: \u201cI\u2019d be no on everything. From a standpoint it\u2019s just wrong. \u2026 This is the poster child for hypocrisy right now.\u201d But he had a warning for his party when asked about the Feinstein-Barrett exchange from the previous hearing. \u201cI\u2019m Catholic, OK?\u201d Manchin said. \u201cReligion should not play a part. \u2026 I don\u2019t know why that was ever brought up. And she\u2019s, she believes what she believes; I believe what I believe.\u201d Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have yet to discuss their strategy in depth given that Trump has yet to name his pick, but they are already familiar with Barrett\u2019s record. Indeed, Barrett\u2019s past writings are bound to come up. In the hearing, Democrats and Republicans questioned her about a 1998 law article she had co-written, which said: \u201cThe Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to the death penalty places Catholic judges in a moral and legal bind.\u201d \u201cIt seems to us, then, that the proper approach to this kind of case morally and legally \u2013 is for the observant Catholic judge to recuse himself after trial and before the sentencing hearing,\u201d the article said. \u201cIt would probably be appropriate to give the parties prior notice that he intends to do so if the trial ends in conviction.\u201d Dick Durbin of Illinois, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the second-ranking Senate Democrat, defended that line of questioning on Tuesday, noting that senators in both parties had questions about that article. \u201cShe raised the issue. She was questioned by four different senators: two Democrats, myself included, and two Republicans. What did she mean by this? Ordinarily, you would never raise the question of religion in a hearing,\u201d Durbin said. At the hearing, Barrett testified that her religious beliefs would not interfere with her rulings as a federal judge. But Democrats, including Feinstein, were not convinced, worried that Barrett\u2019s views meant that she would strike against abortion rights as a federal judge. And some Republicans seem to agree about her views on abortion. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has said his support for a Supreme Court justice is contingent on whether the nominee believes Roe v. Wade is \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d said Barrett meets that test. \u201cI think she meets that standard,\u201d Hawley said. The topic is bound to dominate hearings if Barrett gets the nod. But Democrats are arguing they have to tread carefully around the topic of faith. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who\u2019s on the committee, said Tuesday that \u201ca person\u2019s religious views or background should not make any difference so long as it\u2019s clear that they can leave that personal background at the robing room door, and give impartial justice to whomever is before them irrespective of whether the personal religious views might dictate something different than the law.\u201d When the hearings happen, Durbin said, Democrats need to \u201ctake care that we respect the Constitution, that we ask her probative questions, respectful questions and make certain the American people understand where any nominee stands.\u201d The GOP decision to press ahead with the nomination despite taking the opposite view four years ago has prompted some Democrats to call for a much harder line and to shut down the Senate by effectively grinding business to a halt. But party leaders don\u2019t think that will work. \u201cI\u2019ve been around here a few years,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cYou can slow things down, but you can\u2019t stop them. And there comes a point when we would use whatever tools we have available. But ultimately there will be a vote.\u201d CNN\u2019s Rebecca Grandahl, Daniella Mora, Ali Zaslav, Austen Bundy and Dominic Torres contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. More Americans have now died of Covid than of five wars combined. Or, the US Covid deaths are the equivalent of US deaths on 9/11 occurring every day for 66 days. Or, the US has suffered an average of 858 deaths every day since February 6, the date of the first known US coronavirus death. Or, Covid is now the second-leading cause of death in the US this year, behind only heart disease. Read more here. Many, many more deaths are on the way. Prediction models, which fluctuate, currently suggest the US could see 180,000 more deaths by the end of 2020 \u2013 380,000 deaths total. If fatalities approach that level, they\u2019ll far eclipse even Civil War battle deaths. Infectious disease expert and government official Anthony Fauci said at the Citizen by CNN conference on Tuesday that he\u2019s concerned about the country not having control of the virus\u2019 spread ahead of a winter season that could exacerbate it. \u201cThe idea of 200,000 deaths is really very sobering, and in some respects, stunning,\u201d he told CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta. Fauci argued that the country is in a pivotal moment to slow the spread right now with simple measures \u2013 frequent hand washing and wearing masks, the same as the recommendation has been for months \u2013 before winter comes, when people spend more time inside and transmission could increase. \u201cWe do have within our capability \u2013 even before we get a vaccine, which we will get reasonably soon \u2013 we have the capability by doing things that we have been speaking about for so long, Sanjay, that could prevent the transmission, and by preventing transmission, ultimately preventing the morbidity and mortality that we see,\u201d Fauci said. He added that he\u2019d like to see the US go into the fall and winter months \u201cat such a low level that when you have the inevitable cases, you can handle them.\u201d Yet President Donald Trump says Covid affects virtually nobody. Rather than publicly mourning, Trump was arguing this week that Covid affects \u201celderly people with heart problems\u201d and very few other people. \u201cIt affects virtually nobody. It\u2019s an amazing thing,\u201d he said in Ohio. Somebody should show him this story about a 28-year-old Houston OB-GYN who caught Covid in July and died just recently. Or he could read this story about a study suggesting Black and Latino people are twice as likely to test positive. Oh, and watch video from Trump\u2019s event where an Ohio elected official, Secretary of State John Husted, encouraged Trump supporters to wear MAGA masks. They booed him. Football loves masks, though. The NFL, of all organizations, is all in on face coverings. It\u2019s fining coaches and teams more than $1 million for failing to wear masks Sunday. The CDC posted, and then abruptly removed, guidance on its website about the airborne transmission of the virus in gyms and restaurants. An official told CNN the guidance was not ready for publication. And here\u2019s an interesting story: why efforts by US colleges and universities to open up have gone so poorly. Trump routinely seeks to downplay the effect of Covid. He also routinely seeks to downplay the fact that Russia is trying to interfere in US elections again. When FBI Director Christopher Wray said during congressional testimony that Russians are actively trying to interfere in the election to hurt Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump actively disputed Wray in a series of tweets. If you were wondering which man to believe, check out this reporting from The Washington Post that the CIA has assessed that Vladimir Putin is probably orchestrating Russia\u2019s efforts. The CIA assessment reported by the Post also names a pro-Russian Ukrainian parliamentarian, Andreii Derkach, as spreading false information about Biden among US lobbyists, lawmakers, news outlets and an unnamed person tied to Trump\u2019s campaign. Derkach is known to have ties to Rudy Giuliani. Read more here. We said to keep an eye on Mitt Romney as a possible third Republican to oppose the election-year effort to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a conservative Supreme Court justice. On Tuesday the senator from Utah said he\u2019ll join his party and move forward with the nomination, all but guaranteeing Trump\u2019s choice a vote. And why not? Romney is a social conservative. This nominee will be a social conservative. He would be betraying his fellow conservatives in Utah, to some extent, by allowing a liberal justice on the court. Elections do have consequences and we\u2019ll be living with the 2016 President and the 2018 Congress until January. A more legitimate gripe is that Republicans said one thing in 2016 and are saying the opposite thing now. It\u2019s nakedly politics. But they\u2019re politicians. Hypocrisy can be part of the job description when you\u2019re looking for a way to vote the way your constituents want you to. This will only increase efforts to overhaul the courts now that a 6-3 conservative majority will be in place for 30 years. Amy Coney Barrett has emerged as Trump\u2019s preferred choice. What could Democrats do? End the filibuster for everything. One remedy for Democrats would be to win control of the Senate, end the filibuster and pass some legislation. Heck, they could pass a law legalizing abortion nationally. Or they can pass a health care law with 51 votes. And if people don\u2019t like it, Republicans can try to win back Congress and the Senate. The permanently conservative court is about to be the new reality, because barring the complete implosion of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans have the votes. The Supreme Court fight could alter the playing field in key Senate races headed into Election Day. Take Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, who has said she won\u2019t vote for a court nominee this year. That could alienates base Republican voters at a time when she was already one of the most endangered Senate Republicans. Republicans have a three-seat majority, but they\u2019re likely to pick up a seat currently held by Doug Jones in Alabama. That means Democrats need four seats elsewhere to get a 50-50 Senate and five to win a majority. CNN is using Senate race ratings from the website Inside Elections this year. As Terence Burlij writes: According to Inside Elections, six Republican-held Senate seats currently rate as Tilt Democratic or Toss-up. In Arizona, Sen. Martha McSally is running against Democrat Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, meanwhile, is facing off against former Gov. John Hickenlooper in a Democratic-leaning state. Both contests are rated Tilt Democratic. The four Toss-up races are all seats with Republican incumbents. They include Iowa, where Sen. Joni Ernst is running against businesswoman Theresa Greenfield; Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins is facing a tough challenge from state House Speaker Sara Gideon; Montana, where Sen. Steve Daines is running against Steve Bullock, the state\u2019s two-term incumbent governor; and, North Carolina, where Sen. Thom Tillis is matched up against Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and Army reservist. Check out our ratings and play with the map here. The city is in a state of emergency and access to downtown has been restricted ahead of a grand jury report on whether charges should be brought against police officers in connection with the killing of Breonna Taylor. Separately, six Louisville officers are under internal investigation.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his new Supreme Court nominee at 5 p.m. on Saturday, claiming that the country will need all nine justices in order to decide on the legality of mail-in ballots following the November elections. Judge Amy Coney Barrett has emerged as Trump\u2019s overwhelming favorite to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, according to several people familiar with the deliberations. Barrett was back at the White House Tuesday for a second day in a row, according to two sources familiar. The sources said she impressed Trump and others during initial White House meetings on Monday. Trump has not finalized his decision, and with days to go until he announces his pick on Saturday, his thinking could change. The White House is currently working to schedule a meeting between Trump and Judge Barbara Lagoa while he\u2019s in the Miami area Friday, two sources tell CNN. Lagoa is one of five female candidates the President is considering as a replacement, but two sources said her chances have dimmed significantly since the weekend. But for now, Barrett \u2013 currently sitting on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago \u2013 is his clear front-runner and is viewed inside the White House as the likely nominee. The President announced Tuesday morning that he will announce the pick Saturday at the White House. Officials said Trump seemed very enthusiastic about Barrett after their meeting, which lasted for several hours. He told people afterward he believes Barrett will be very well received by \u201chis people,\u201d one official said. While no one close to the process would go so far as to say Barrett is the pick, Trump is giving people the impression he is completely sold on her. A source familiar with Trump\u2019s private conversations told CNN that one of his confidants on this issue told him that this pick is so important to not only his legacy but his re-election bid that she will effectively \u201cbe your new running mate.\u201d Lagoa remains on the list but multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN that Trump is fading on the idea of picking her. While Trump was initially enthused at the prospect of nominating a Cuban-American from Florida, a critical electoral battleground, Lagoa hasn\u2019t been previously vetted for the Supreme Court and some advisers suggested it would be a heavy lift to clear a new name quickly. Trump narrows Supreme Court list as weighty decision looms The White House may still schedule a meeting with Lagoa, but two sources said her chances have dimmed significantly since the weekend. On Monday, Trump initially said he was considering five names for the high court vacancy before adding he was really focused only on \u201cone or two\u201d names. Others on the list \u2013 including federal appeals court judges Joan Larsen and Allison Jones Rushing, and deputy White House counsel Kate Todd \u2013 are not considered serious contenders, particularly after it was learned inside the White House that Larsen volunteered for Joe Biden\u2019s 1987 presidential campaign. Trump has said the end-of-week timing for the pick was meant to show respect for Ginsburg, who will lie in repose at the Supreme Court on Wednesday and Thursday before a private interment at Arlington National Cemetery next week. But the President is also keen on extending the dramatics of his selection, likening it to his version of a running mate selection during an election year, according to one adviser. Trump plans to make his announcement during a prominent prime time address, as he did for Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh earlier in his term, according to the adviser. In the past, the President has reveled in the drama of the moment \u2013 including orchestrating an attempt to convince the media he had selected Thomas Hardiman instead of Gorsuch in 2018 by having Hardiman leave his house and drive toward Washington. This time, Trump has been clearer about who is on his list and how many names he is taking seriously. He praised Lagoa during an interview on Fox News, but even some of her supporters \u2013 of which there are many, including in Florida Republican circles and among Trump\u2019s political advisers \u2013 acknowledge that Barrett is now the leading contender. And while Cuban-Americans are an important part of Trump\u2019s re-election coalition, Lagoa presents a problem for some conservatives focused on the courts: her ties to the Bush family, which one source said is viewed skeptically by some court-focused Republicans because of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s appointment of Supreme Court Justice David Souter, who was expected to be a conservative but came to vote with the liberal wing. Another factor weighing on Trump\u2019s decision, at least in some capacity, is Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has said his support for a Supreme Court justice is contingent on whether the nominee believes Roe v Wade is \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d Hawley said on Monday that Barrett \u201cmeets that standard.\u201d But he said he is less certain with the abortion views espoused by Lagoa and it\u2019s something he is still reviewing. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Hawley said. Hawley said he spoke with the White House about his views over the weekend. Now that GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has signaled that he is on board with moving ahead with a vote ahead of the election it all but ensures any nominee put forward will be confirmed barring any potential missteps by the nominee during the confirmation process.

            "article_content": "GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah signaled on Tuesday that he is on board with the Senate\u2019s taking up a new Supreme Court nominee during the current election year, an announcement that all but ensures a nominee put forward by President Donald Trump will be confirmed barring any potential missteps by the nominee during the confirmation process. In a statement, Romney did not raise any objections to holding a vote on a Trump nominee this year and said, \u201cIf the nominee reaches the Senate floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications.\u201d With momentum from their conference behind a quick vote, GOP leaders are now making clear they are pressing ahead to get the nomination confirmed before Election Day, which would amount to one of the quickest proceedings in modern times. And it comes despite Senate Republicans\u2019 refusal to move on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to a seat in 2016 when they said his choice \u2013 eight months before November \u2013 was too close to the elections. Senate Majority Whip John Thune told CNN on Tuesday, \u201cI think it would be a good idea to move forward.\u201d He said the timing is not nailed down yet and Republican senators will discuss it at lunch Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gave a full-throated defense of his decision to move forward quickly with a Supreme Court confirmation process so close to an election. \u201cMoving ahead with a vote on the forthcoming Supreme Court nomination will be consistent with both history and precedent,\u201d McConnell said in remarks on the floor. Here's why a Supreme Court battle could benefit the GOP McConnell and other Republicans have been fending off accusations from Democrats of hypocrisy over moving forward with a new nomination now after blocking Obama\u2019s nominee to the high court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. The high-stakes election year battle over the addition of a new justice to the Supreme Court stands to have profound consequences, both for the court by pushing it in a more conservative direction for decades to come and for the ongoing fight for control of Congress and the White House. Senate Republicans are now laying the groundwork for a quick confirmation process and vote, including planning October confirmation hearings. Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that the committee plans to hold three days of hearings for the SCOTUS nominee in October. \u201cYeah, trying to keep the process like we had before,\u201d said Graham, a South Carolina Republican, when asked if the committee will hold three days of hearings. Thune said that he expects that once the Senate finishes the government funding bill \u2014 either this week or next \u2014 most senators will leave town for much of October as was planned before the passing of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Senators up for reelection are anxious to get home to campaign. Meanwhile, members of the Judiciary Committee will work to prepare for hearings, meeting with the nominee, and eventually convening hearings. A new justice on the Supreme Court before November 3 could have major implications for future high court decisions over health care or any election year disputes. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he plans to make his announcement on Saturday at the White House. Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a federal appellate judge and Notre Dame law professor, is currently viewed as the leading contender. Graham, who is up for reelection, touted Barrett, telling reporters, \u201cI think she\u2019d be a great choice.\u201d Romney said Barrett when asked his view, \u201cI haven\u2019t reviewed her judicial record to this point. And will look forward to doing so if she\u2019s the nominee.\u201d Asked by CNN if Barrett is chosen whether that would bring the issue of abortion front and center in the election, Graham downplayed the possibility, and replied: \u201cI think every issue is gonna be thrown at the nominee.\u201d Currently, there are 53 GOP senators \u2013 meaning Republicans can only lose three votes to advance the nomination if Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to cast a tie-breaking vote. Republicans are speeding toward confirmation -- even without a nominee So far, only two Republicans \u2013 Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins, who is facing a competitive reelection fight in Maine \u2013 have voiced opposition to taking up whomever Trump nominates to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s vacant seat before November 3. Collins on Tuesday specified that she would vote against anyone Trump names if a vote is held prior to the election. \u201cI made it very clear, yes, that I did not think there should be a vote prior to the election,\u201d Collins said, adding, \u201cand if there is one, I would oppose the nominee, not because I might not support that nominee under normal circumstances, but we\u2019re simply too close to the election.\u201d It is unclear if there will be any further defections within GOP ranks. Adding further momentum to an election-year Supreme Court confirmation, Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia also came out on Tuesday in favor of moving forward with the process. \u201cPresident Trump and the Republican Senate, both elected by the American people, should act to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Ginsburg\u2019s passing,\u201d the West Virginia Republican wrote in a statement on Tuesday. Romney on Tuesday declined to discuss a hypothetical of a lame duck session vote on the vacant seat if Trump loses the election. \u201cI\u2019m not going to look at all the hypotheticals that might occur,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve laid out what I intend to do and that would be\u2026 not dependent upon the timing.\u201d Pressed further, Romney replied, \u201cI\u2019ve indicated what I intend to do is to proceed with the consideration process and if a nominee actually reaches the floor, that I will vote and based upon the qualifications of that nominee.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg weeks before the presidential election has turned Democratic nightmares into a crushing reality. Impervious to cries of hypocrisy and pleas to adhere to a standard they set in 2016, Republicans are bulling forward with plans to fast-track her replacement. Liberal hopes that enough GOP senators might stand in the way have been all but dashed with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s announcement Tuesday that he supports a vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s eventual nominee. The confirmation of a new justice appointed by Trump would establish a hard conservative majority on the high court, shifting its balance of power while immediately endangering the Affordable Care Act. The court could also emerge as a reliable mechanism of the right for undermining big ticket legislation passed by Democrats in the future, even if the party wins the presidency and control of Congress. With that daunting prospect in mind, long simmering conversations on the left over the merit and possibility of abolishing the legislative filibuster, which could pave the way for expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court and pursuing statehood for Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, have been elevated into the mainstream. Many top Democrats, including moderates like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, are repeating a new mantra: \u201cEverything is on the table.\u201d The momentum behind the push, though, has already run up against the cautious nature of former Vice President Joe Biden, once a long-serving senator and ardent institutionalist who has come out in the past against changing the current rules. Asked on Monday by a reporter in Wisconsin if he would consider packing the court in a tit-for-tat with Republicans, Biden demurred. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I\u2019m not going answer,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBecause it will shift the focus. That\u2019s what (Trump) wants, he never wants to talk about the issue at hand and he always tries to change the subject.\u201d During the primary, Biden consistently opposed any suggestion that Democrats might expand the court in an effort to restore its partisan balance, suggesting it was a flawed tactic that would only exacerbate the problem it intended to solve.  And his campaign has, from the start, hinged on a promise to repair relationships on Capitol Hill \u2013 not effectively giving up on them in favor of the hardball tactics that the modern GOP has embraced. Going forward, Biden\u2019s team is determined to frame the campaign\u2019s central debate on health care and what the seating of a new conservative justice would mean for the future of Obamacare. The court is scheduled to hear a GOP-backed case to strike down the law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, a week after the election. This past weekend, Biden, in a speech on the Supreme Court fight, excoriated Republicans over what he described as \u201can exercise in raw political power\u201d before stressing his focus on efforts to defeat the coming nomination through more conventional means. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a close confidante, refused to directly address the prospect of court-packing during a Fox News interview on Sunday, suggesting the best path forward for Democrats lies in appealing to their GOP Senate colleagues\u2019 better angels. The push to abolish the legislative filibuster, which effectively requires a 60-vote supermajority to pass any bill out of the Senate, got a boost from former President Barack Obama, still the party\u2019s most popular and influential figure, when he endorsed it during his tribute to the Civil Rights icon John Lewis, at the late Georgia congressman\u2019s funeral in July. \u201cIf all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that\u2019s what we should do,\u201d Obama said, backing a range of democracy reforms, including new voting rights legislation, statehood for Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, automatic voter registration and an end to partisan gerrymandering. Obama\u2019s remarks were a sort of vindication \u2013 and stamp of approval \u2013 for other Democrats with roots in the party establishment who have been pushing for a more aggressive posture. Brian Fallon, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and the head of Demand Justice, a Democratic group aimed at fighting Trump\u2019s judicial appointments, said that the party needs to realize that victory in November will not \u201cchange everything.\u201d \u201cWe have a broken system, so we have to think bigger,\u201d Fallon told CNN. \u201cAnd all these issues Democrats care about \u2026 just winning the election is not going to be enough to make progress on those things.\u201d And pledging to go big on reforms to the democratic process could be a key to unlocking the current situation. \u201cDemocrats have to create some leverage for themselves,\u201d said Fallon, who has previously worked for Democrats like Schumer and former Attorney General Eric Holder. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch \u201cMcConnell has the numbers in the Senate. If he wants to be shameless now, he can be.\u201d Demand Justice has been advocating for expanding the court for years. But Fallon and others believe that the death of Ginsburg, an iconic figure among liberals, will boost popular support. \u201cRBG\u2019s death was not the cause of calls for things like adding seats to the Senate and adding seats to the Supreme Court and thinking about trying to change the electoral college,\u201d Fallon said, \u201cbut I do think it will cause support for them to grow exponentially.\u201d But other Democrats, including Obama\u2019s former White House chief of staff, are ardently opposed to allowing the debate to intrude on a campaign that Biden, according to nearly every public poll, leads with six weeks until Election Day. Rahm Emanuel, in an interview Monday night, warned Democrats against focusing on \u201chypothetical\u201d ideas like expanding the court or imposing term limits on its justices, especially if those conversations risk overshadowing imminent threats to abortion rights and the ACA. His advice: \u201cJust don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d Emanuel also said he questions McConnell and the GOP\u2019s political calculus. \u201cI think the Republicans, McConnell and Trump especially, are playing with fire,\u201d Emanuel said, a phrase Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used on Sunday night during a news conference with Schumer in New York. \u201cNot only are they making a lifetime decision that people don\u2019t think should be rushed, from a political standpoint, you\u2019re guaranteeing that health care will be at the center of every election going forward.\u201d Any diversion from that message, he said, specifically one focused on health care \u2013 a winner for the party in 2018 \u2013 would be a political gift to Republicans. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the way of their self-destruction,\u201d Emanuel said. Trump and McConnell\u2019s rush to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat has prompted many liberals to conclude that the time has come to meet Republican fire with their own. Indivisible, the liberal organization formed after Trump won the presidency in 2016, marshaled the anger of its local groups over the weekend, as the scope of the fights to come came into focus. \u201cThe main thing we need to do is win in November, and then as soon as Democrats take control of the Senate, they really need to start governing immediately to undo the damage that Trump has done,\u201d said Meagan Hatcher-Mays, director of democracy policy for the Indivisible Project. \u201cThat changed almost overnight, I would say, from Friday to Saturday. It just feels like just a completely different landscape.\u201d For Democrats in the Senate and other leadership positions who have so far been more circumspect in their remarks, Hatcher-Mays said, the harsh realities might not fully land until, and if, Biden wins the election and the party gains a narrow Senate majority \u2013 only to see their priorities blocked by a Republican minority. \u201cA lot of Senate Democrats, even middle-of-the-road Senate Democrats, are not going to want to sit back and watch Joe Biden\u2019s entire agenda be thwarted by one person, one Republican in the Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the reality of the situation is going to hit pretty quickly.\u201d Obama\u2019s declaration did not immediately let loose a floodgate of converts, but his standing offered a sense of political legitimacy to the movement. Asked first if he would support adding justices to the Supreme Court, then about getting rid of the filibuster, Schumer on Sunday night delivered the same message he gave to his caucus during a call the day before. \u201cWe first have to win the majority, because if we don\u2019t win the majority, these questions are all moot,\u201d Schumer said, when asked about the filibuster. \u201cBut if we win the majority, everything is on the table.\u201d Others in his caucus have been less cautious. Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who recently fended off a tough primary challenge with strong progressive backing, came out of the gates on Saturday calling for Democrats to use the threat of such radical action as a deterrent against Republicans\u2019 Supreme Court plans. \u201cMitch McConnell won\u2019t back down, and neither will we. We can defeat him if we mobilize and organize,\u201d Markey tweeted. \u201cThat is why we must make it absolutely clear that if McConnell attempts to fill this seat, we will abolish the filibuster and expand the court when we retake the Senate.\u201d Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz has suggested that Republicans might leave the Democratic caucus no other option. \u201cIt is going to be very hard after the procedural violence that Mitch McConnell has inflicted on the Senate and the country for anyone to justify us playing it soft next year just to satisfy pundits,\u201d Schatz tweeted. \u201cWe must use the power that voters give us to deliver the change we are promising.\u201d Democrats\u2019 next steps will be heavily influenced by the outcome of the unfolding clash over Ginsburg\u2019s seat. If McConnell fills it before the election or, perhaps even more divisively, after Trump and Senate Republicans potentially lose in November, intra-party dynamics could shift even further. Sean McElwee, co-founder and executive director of the progressive group Data for Progress, called the threat of eliminating the filibuster, adding justices to the court and new seats in the Senate, the Democratic Senate minority\u2019s \u201conly credible threat.\u201d \u201cYou need a number of Democratic senators to be sending that message to McConnell, because it\u2019s really the only point of leverage that Democrats have,\u201d McElwee said. \u201cMost of the procedural stuff that I\u2019m seeing come out there is a bit of a fantasy, to be entirely frank.\u201d But he also acknowledged that it would be difficult \u2013 and perhaps counterproductive \u2013 for some Democrats, especially those running difficult races in traditionally red states, to weigh in too heavily on issues that still divide opinion, or are only slight above water in popularity, with most voters. \u201cIt seems, to me, to be totally acceptable for Markey to be messaging this in a different way than Cal Cunningham is (in North Carolina), which is different than the way that Barbara Bollier is (in Kansas),\u201d McElwee said, referring to a pair of Democrats vying to unseat Senate Republicans. \u201cThey represent and seek to represent different swaths of the American population. We shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of believing that every message is for everyone.\u201d Andrew Yang, a 2020 presidential candidate who has advocated for Supreme Court term limits, chalked up Biden\u2019s hesitance to his personal history with the institution. \u201cJoe has a different vantage point because he spent so long in the Senate,\u201d said Yang, a CNN contributor who ran against Biden in the primary. \u201cHe is someone who has a healthy respect for a degree of institutional continuity.\u201d But in a year that has been marked by disruption and with the political order that Biden once knew largely toppled, the calculus guiding his campaign could, even in victory, change by the time he takes office. \u201cWe are facing simultaneous crises, one on top of another, and many Americans are justly concerned that our government and institutions are not up to the challenges that are facing us,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIn that situation, new things become necessary and popular because we can see that our current approaches are not working.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sarah Mucha contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been steadfast that the US Senate will vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court this year. In less than three days \u2013 and before a nominee has even been selected \u2013 it appears McConnell is already on track to have the votes. The speed with which Senate Republicans have largely fallen in line behind the push to quickly confirm Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s successor on the Supreme Court would be head-snapping if it didn\u2019t line up with their support for Trump\u2019s hundreds of judicial nominees over the course of the last three-plus years. There is still a long way to go \u2013 an actual nominee is a pretty key ingredient here \u2013 abut as one Republican official involved in the process told me: \u201cThings are falling into line \u2013 and fast.\u201d 42 Democrats, limited in their options to do anything on their own to stop any confirmation, have pushed hard to wrangle four Republicans to join them in opposing moving forward on a nominee until after the next president is sworn into office. They secured two senators \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 who said they opposed any vote before the election. But the final two have been elusive. And may not exist at all. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Cory Gardner, both considered possible defectors, came out in support of moving forward with the nomination on Monday. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah \u2013 one of the remaining wild cards going into the morning \u2013 signaled Tuesday that he\u2019s on board with an election year confirmation for a Supreme Court nominee, saying in a statement that if a nominee reaches the Senate floor then he will vote \u201cbased upon their qualifications.\u201d His comments all but ensure that the nomination is on track for election year confirmation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham didn\u2019t hedge on where things stood on Monday night. \u201cWe got the votes to confirm Justice Ginsburg\u2019s replacement before the election,\u201d Graham said on Fox News. \u201cWe are going to move forward in the committee. We\u2019re going to report the nomination out of the committee to the floor of the United States Senate so we can vote before the election.\u201d Notably, McConnell has not weighed in yet on the timing of the confirmation vote. But Graham, backed by Trump himself, is making clear the direction he plans on this heading in the weeks ahead. It\u2019s tough to overstate how important the rapid coalescing of Republicans is to the eventual confirmation. Outside groups are pledging millions. Democrats are organizing major public pressure campaigns to try and turn a tide that is moving sharply against them. Early public polls don\u2019t necessarily line up with the GOP\u2019s confirmation efforts in an election year. But before any of those potential pressure points could settle into play, GOP senators have taken themselves out of play as wild cards or potential no votes. That\u2019s enormous. \u201cEven the perception that this is over before it really gets started is invaluable at this point,\u201d the outside adviser told CNN. There is still a process ahead for whoever is selected. Public vetting. Committee vetting. Private meetings with senators. Public hearings. As the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh made crystal clear, things can go sideways quickly over the course of the next several weeks. That, at this point, is the primary hope for Democrats. And that is what McConnell and top advisers are working now, quietly and behind the scenes, to ensure doesn\u2019t happen this time around. Republicans have taken care to be deferential to Trump\u2019s selection process \u2013 and whoever he ends up selecting. But there is a clear preference among GOP senators at this point, according to multiple senators and senior aides: Amy Coney Barrett. McConnell, though careful not to put his thumb on the scale, has made clear in conversations with Trump and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone that the GOP conference would be comfortable with Barrett, two people with knowledge of the conversations told CNN. Sen. Todd Young, who hails from Barrett\u2019s home state of Indiana and leads the Senate Republican campaign arm, has also been an advocate, the people said. GOP begins to fall in line for quick confirmation vote on Trump's Supreme Court nominee Again, Republicans have made clear they\u2019re likely to support whoever Trump picks given his record of selections up to this point. But it\u2019s clear Barrett has fans on Capitol Hill. Sen. Josh Hawley, the first-term Missouri Republican, took to the Senate floor in late July to announce he would \u201cvote only for those Supreme Court nominees who have explicitly acknowledged that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, the day it was decided.\u201d It was a red line on the decision that provides federal protection for abortions that was laid out for just this moment \u2013 and had the potential to create problems for GOP leaders and future nominees. For all of the attention paid to moderates on the issue of abortion in past confirmations, Hawley\u2019s position made clear there was a new dynamic at play. At least one nominee meets Hawley\u2019s standard, the senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Monday: Barrett. \u201cAs to the question on the Roe, I think she meets that standard,\u201d Hawley said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put the stakes in stark terms on Monday \u2013 and echoed what many of his Democratic colleagues said to reporters throughout the day: \u201cTell me how this would not spell the end of this supposedly great deliberative body? Because I don\u2019t see how. There\u2019s only one way, one way for this chamber to retain its dignity through this difficult chapter, and that is for four brave senate Republicans to commit to rejecting any nominee until the next president is installed.\u201d Like their colleagues across the aisle, Democratic senators have very disparate views of how to handle the next few months. Practically, Democrats can\u2019t block this nomination even if they can deploy dilatory tactics along the way. But, the strategy they use over the next 40 days is going to force the party into an early test of who they will be after the election and what the Democratic message and tactics will be if they win the White House and take back the Senate. Joe Biden\u2019s message here has been moderate, measured. He wants to appeal to his former colleagues\u2019 conscience as they weigh their decision on moving ahead with a SCOTUS nominee. But Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s strategies have been more pointed. Schumer warning his caucus on a private call over the weekend that nothing will be off the table if Republicans push ahead. Pelosi warning that there are plenty of \u201carrows\u201d in her quiver. Some liberal outside groups and supporters have begun to advocate for adding more justices to the court if Democrats win in November. That would require a change of the rules, which would eradicate the filibuster. That doesn\u2019t sit well with some members. \u201cThere are some people who think we ought to stick to the issues like health care, voting rights,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana said. \u201cI think we ought to stick to the issues.\u201d For more moderate Democrats, even opening up a potential discussion about adding more seats to the Supreme Court or killing the filibuster, they argue, makes it harder to win the public campaign that is waging right now over the court. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is the right message. I don\u2019t think we should be talking about retaliation. That should not be in our lexicon,\u201d Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat up for reelection in Alabama, told me. The push and pull of what the liberal base wants right now and what members are comfortable with is going to be worth watching because the tone and tenor of this debate may look and sound different depending on what Democrat is asked. Trump narrows Supreme Court list as weighty decision looms \u201cThis is an illegitimate process and the Democrats need to use every tool at their disposal to stop it. People across this country do not want to see Donald Trump confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the last days before an election,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about retaliation. This is about what is at stake.\u201d Read Manu, Clare Foran and Ted Barrett for all of the latest on the day that was on Capitol Hill.

            "article_content": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death leaves the Supreme Court with a vacancy just weeks before the presidential election.   Republicans are gearing up to jam through a successor and Democrats are howling about hypocrisy \u2013 because after Justice Antonin Scalia died in early 2016, Republicans refused to consider then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, because it was too close to a presidential election. Here\u2019s what we know about what happens next, and why it matters. President Donald Trump has to make a pick. He said Monday that he plans to announce his selection as soon as Friday. Trump recently released a short list of candidates but has said he\u2019ll pick a woman to replace Ginsburg, the second woman to join the court. Judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa are seen as the top contenders. Whoever is chosen will have to go through a Senate process, including public hearings. Then there\u2019s a committee vote. And then there\u2019s a Senate floor vote. It varies. The last nomination to proceed to confirmation in less than two months was Ginsburg\u2019s back in 1993. These things usually take months. Republicans ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, so it takes only a simple majority. Vice President Mike Pence can break a 50-50 tie, which might happen if three Republicans decide they won\u2019t vote for Trump\u2019s nominee. A new Congress takes office January 3, so the current Senate, with the current Republican majority, has only until then to confirm a Trump nominee. Absolutely. That\u2019s true even if Democrats win the White House and the Senate \u2013  anytime before January 3, the current Senate Republicans can still go ahead and confirm a conservative nominee. That would sew up a very conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a generation or more. Technically, yes. According to the Constitution, the president appoints Supreme Court justices and the Senate approves the pick. There are several major cases on the docket already. Here are two ways in which a conservative majority could likely have an almost immediate impact: 1. The Affordable Care Act \u2013 Obamacare, which dramatically expanded Americans\u2019 access to health insurance coverage, has narrowly withstood several court challenges. It\u2019s currently facing another one. The law has survived only because a conservative justice, Chief Justice John Roberts, has sided with liberal judges. But the Trump administration has gotten behind a coalition of several states currently challenging it. Arguments are scheduled for shortly after the election. A conservative majority could overturn the law, which Trump and other Republicans currently have no plan to replace. 2. Abortion \u2013 When Republicans sat on that vacant seat in 2016, preventing Obama from naming Merrick Garland to the bench and giving Trump a seat to fill as soon as he took office, it changed the balance of the court in a way that will threaten the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the US. If a conservative replaces Ginsburg, it will take two Republican-appointed swing votes to protect the Roe decision. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good chance abortion will be outlawed in many US states. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have already said the next president \u2013 Trump or his Democratic rival, Joe Biden \u2013 should pick the nominee. That means McConnell can lose one more Republican and still have Pence break a tie. (That\u2019s also assuming all Democrats vote \u201cno\u201d on principle.) Several had said previously that they\u2019d oppose a nominee in 2020 after opposing a nominee in 2016. But minds can change! This is why people don\u2019t love politicians. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has changed his already. He had said before Ginsburg died that he\u2019d oppose an election-year nomination. Now he supports filling the seat. So go figure. He chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and would lead any hearings. But he\u2019s also running for reelection and is a top supporter of Trump\u2019s. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa had also said he would oppose an election-year nomination. Now he\u2019s signaling that he might not. Probably not. This is Republicans\u2019 opportunity to cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades to come \u2013 long after President Trump is out of office. There will be immense pressure on all Republicans to fall in line. And most will view this vote as their duty. Ginsburg was 60 when President Bill Clinton picked her in 1992. She was the oldest person to have been successfully nominated to the Supreme Court in decades. Most justices are in their late 40s or early 50s when they\u2019re nominated. Trump\u2019s other two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, are both in their early 50s. Barrett is 48. If she serves until she\u2019s 87 like Ginsburg, she\u2019d be on the court for almost 40 years. Any of these women, if they serve until they\u2019re 87 like Ginsburg, would be on the court for 30- or 40-plus years, along with Trump\u2019s other two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who are both in their early 50s. The average length of a Supreme Court tenure has grown a lot. Harvard Business Review did an actuarial analysis in 2018 and argued the average tenure over the next 100 years will grow to 35 years. It was 17 over the previous 100 years. That also means there will be fewer and fewer of these nominees, which is why Republicans will do everything they can to put a young justice in now. They do, actually. Justices have increasingly tried to time their retirements. Republican-appointed justices tend to wait for Republican presidents \u2013 like Anthony Kennedy, who retired in 2018. Ginsburg wanted the first female president to pick her replacement, so she declined to retire during the Obama administration, hoping that Hillary Clinton would get to name a successor. Instead, Ginsburg died on the bench with just enough time for Trump to appoint a successor. The same thing could have happened with Scalia, the Republican-appointed justice who died at the end of Obama\u2019s term. But because McConnell refused to even allow a hearing on Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Scalia, the court\u2019s conservative majority was protected. We live in a republic, where the Electoral College picks the president and senators confirm Supreme Court justices. And we are, increasingly, governed by people who represent a minority of Americans. That will continue on the court for a long time. CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein has a very thoughtful piece on this undemocratic element of US democracy. That\u2019s going to be a controversial question, but one that will have to be addressed \u2013 especially if Republicans lose either the White House or the Senate and still go ahead and confirm a new justice before January. During the Democratic primary in 2019, several Democrats, including now-vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, showed interest in plans to increase the number of justices on the court. There are also proposals to put term limits on individual justices or on each seat. This would insure some turnover. Not technically. It gives Congress the ability to set the makeup of the court. And its words have been interpreted to give justices life terms. But the actual words are different, saying justices shall serve during times of \u201cgood behavior.\u201d It doesn\u2019t list a term or an end date, so one has never been applied. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it couldn\u2019t. But how this would be accomplished would be up for debate. Here\u2019s the relevant language from Article III: The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. This could more easily be accomplished. The size of the court went up and down pretty regularly during the first 100 years of the US. But it\u2019s been set at nine since the 1860s. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried and failed to expand the court to 15 justices in the 1930s. Several Democrats, notably Pete Buttigieg, were pushing a similar idea during the recent presidential primary. The most important Democrat right now, Biden, has said he opposes it. Supreme Court vacancies are usually more of a motivator for Republican voters than for Democratic ones. That may not be the case this year, with Democrats still frustrated that Obama\u2019s nominee was denied a hearing or a vote. Nearly six in 10 Americans say that the president elected in November should be the one to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. This story has been updated with more details about the confirmation process.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia is looking to highlight her conservative voting record in a new ad Monday that compares her to Attila the Hun. In the ad from Loeffler\u2019s campaign, a woman asks, \u201cDid you know Kelly Loeffler was ranked the most conservative senator in America?\u201d to which a man replies, \u201cYup, she\u2019s more conservative than Attila the Hun.\u201d The scene cuts to a scene of a warrior who is purportedly Attila the Hun, who grunts at a scribe taking notes. It's true. pic.twitter.com/Yea3phqB2s \u201cFight China \u2013 got it,\u201d the scribe says while writing. \u201cAttack big government \u2013 yeah.\u201d \u201cEliminate the liberal scribes \u2026 uh oh,\u201d the scribe says in response to the last grunt to end the scene. A narrator then says, \u201cMore conservative than Attila the Hun. Kelly Loeffler: 100% Trump voting record.\u201d The ad comes as Loeffler, who was appointed to former Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s seat in December, faces a general election challenge from US Rep. Doug Collins, who is also a Republican. As opposed to a traditional primary, multiple candidates, regardless of party, can face each other in the special election for Isakson\u2019s seat as part of Georgia\u2019s election rules. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in November, the race goes to a two-person runoff. Collins, President Donald Trump\u2019s staunch ally and original pick to be appointed to the seat, has accused Loeffler of being insufficiently conservative, characterizing her donations to Democrats as backing Planned Parenthood. According to Open Secrets, of the $3.2 million Loeffler and her husband have donated to political committees, less than 3% backed Democratic candidates and efforts. Collins pushed back on the ad, asserting on Twitter that Loeffler \u201cis so uncomfortable discussing conservative values that she hired an actor to make grunting noises rather than do it herself.\u201d \u201cFYI Attila the Hun was an open-borders globalist who killed christians and practiced postnatal abortion,\u201d he added. Some critics have wondered whether the Loeffler campaign confused Attila the Hun, who famously attacked the Roman Empire, with Genghis Khan, who attacked and gained substantial control over parts of China. Attila\u2019s empire did not extend east beyond the Caspian Sea, according to maps including that by cartographer and historian William Shepherd \u2013 thousands of miles from China. The move also follows the WNBA distancing itself from Loeffler, who co-owns the Atlanta Dream, in July following her objection to the WNBA\u2019s plans to honor the Black Lives Matter movement. Last month WNBA players on teams including the Dream were seen wearing \u201cVote Warnock\u201d shirts in support of Raphael Warnock, a Democrat also running for Loeffler\u2019s seat. Loeffler in turn slammed the WNBA for participating in what she called \u201ccancel culture.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is moving closer to locking down enough support to pave the way for confirmation of a new Supreme Court nominee in the midst of a hugely consequential election year, ratcheting up calls for a quick vote that could fundamentally alter the court in a sharply more conservative direction for decades to come. Two key GOP senators \u2013 Cory Gardner, who is facing a tough reelection fight in Colorado, and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who had previously suggested he was opposed to filling a vacancy this year \u2013 signaled on Monday that they would be open to confirming a nominee, a sign that McConnell is at this stage closer to having the GOP votes he would need to secure confirmation of a new justice. While Senate Republicans are still uncertain about the timing of the vote, party leaders are growing confident that they will confirm a nominee \u2013 either right before the election or soon after, no matter the outcome and despite taking the opposite position four years ago when then-President Barack Obama sought to fill a vacancy during an election year. Asked on Monday if the Senate would confirm a Trump nominee in a lame-duck session if Biden wins, GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said: \u201cYou mean while we\u2019re still in our term office, and President Trump is? Of course.\u201d And Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News that Republicans will confirm Ginsburg\u2019s replacement before Election Day. \u201cThe nominee going to be supported by every Republican in the Judiciary Committee and we have the votes to confirm the judge, the justice, on the floor of the Senate before the election, and that\u2019s what\u2019s coming,\u201d Graham said. Graham\u2019s comments are all the more remarkable because there is no nominee and he\u2019s asserting that Republicans are already vowing to give Trump\u2019s pick final approval in what would be one of the quickest Supreme Court confirmations in modern history. Currently, there are 53 GOP senators \u2013 meaning they can only lose three Republicans if Vice President Mike Pence stepped in to cast a tie-breaking vote. So far, two Republicans \u2013 Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins, who is facing a competitive reelection fight in Maine \u2013 have voiced opposition to taking up whomever Trump nominates to fill the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s vacant seat before November 3. But it is unclear if there will be any further Republican defections. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has not yet said where he stands, saying on Monday, \u201cI\u2019m not going to speak about this until I had a chance to speak with my colleagues.\u201d But even if he were to come out against moving forward with a nominee, it is not clear whether there would be a fourth Republican senator who would follow suit, and many Republicans believe it is doubtful a fourth would break ranks. Of course, the President has yet to formally name a nominee and his decision of who to pick will have a bearing on how senators ultimately decide to vote. It is also impossible to predict how the confirmation process will unfold in the Senate and what hiccups could be yet to emerge for any nominee. But statements from Gardner and Grassley on Monday could serve to fuel momentum for the Senate GOP conference to unite behind moving quickly to advance a nominee. Trump narrows Supreme Court list as weighty decision looms On Monday evening, Gardner signaled that he is not opposed to confirming a nominee close to an election, saying in a statement, \u201cI have and will continue to support judicial nominees who will protect our Constitution, not legislate from the bench, and uphold the law. Should a qualified nominee who meets this criteria be put forward, I will vote to confirm.\u201d In 2016, after Obama announced the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Gardner said in a statement, \u201cThe next president of the United States should have the opportunity to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cOur next election is too soon and the stakes are too high; the American people deserve a role in this process as the next Supreme Court Justice will influence the direction of this country for years to come,\u201d he said at the time. Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and a former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, signaled on Monday that he is on McConnell\u2019s side, despite suggesting in July that he wouldn\u2019t favor moving ahead with a nomination this year if he were still chairman of the committee. In a statement Monday, Grassley said, \u201cOnce the hearings are underway, it\u2019s my responsibility to evaluate the nominee on the merits, just as I always have,\u201d adding, \u201cMake no mistake: if the shoe were on the other foot, Senate Democrats wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use their Constitutional authority and anything else at their disposal to fill this seat.\u201d The looming Supreme Court fight puts vulnerable Republicans in a tough spot as Democrats call for any nominee to be put on hold for consideration until after the inauguration, and the high-stakes fight could have dramatic implications in the race for control of the Senate and the White House. A statement from GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, who is facing a competitive reelection in Iowa and is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, did not address her view on timing. In the statement, Ernst said, \u201cWe have much to consider over the coming days. The Supreme Court plays a fundamental role in the defense of our Constitution and in the protection of our rights and liberties. Once the president puts forward his nominee for the Supreme Court, I will carry out my duty\u2014as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2014to evaluate the nominee for our nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d Trump vows to appoint a woman to Supreme Court as vacancy re-energizes his political prospects In a floor speech on Monday, McConnell defended his vow that a nominee will get a Senate vote, adding that \u201cthe Senate has more than sufficient time to process a nomination. History and precedent make that perfectly clear.\u201d McConnell hasn\u2019t yet specified if a vote will happen before or after the election. Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Monday that he doesn\u2019t know whether there are four Republicans who are against moving forward with a Supreme Court nomination vote before the presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from everybody. We kind of know for the most part of where most of our members are, but until we get an opportunity with everybody together, I think it\u2019s probably a little early to speculate about that.\u201d Some Republicans on Monday acknowledged that it may be challenging to confirm a new justice prior to Election Day, but suggested that confirmation could still proceed during a lame-duck session following the election even if former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, were to win the White House. Asked if it could be done in 43 days \u2013 the amount of time left before the November 3 election, Cornyn said, \u201cThe ones that have been done more quickly have typically been done with a lot more cooperation. I think I\u2019m not expecting much cooperation from the Democrats so they can probably string it out longer.\u201d The Supreme Court nomination process, explained GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, when asked if confirmation could get done before the election, said, \u201cIt would be the new recent world record \u2026. we\u2019d have to do more than we\u2019ve done in a long time to get one done that quickly, but it\u2019s possible.\u201d Asked if it would be fair to fair to vote in a lame duck if Trump loses, he said, \u201cWell, a lot of presidents have lost and had judges confirm during the lame duck.\u201d Thune declined to discuss a hypothetical on whether he would support a nomination vote during a lame-duck session if Trump lost the election. \u201cThat\u2019s a hypothetical, I\u2019m not gonna go into that,\u201d he replied. While Trump has yet to name a nominee, he said on Monday that he plans to do so by the end of the week, saying it will likely happen either on Friday or Saturday. Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a federal appellate judge and Notre Dame law professor, is currently viewed as a leading contender. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has said his support for a Supreme Court justice is contingent on whether the nominee believes Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case on abortion, is \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d said Barrett, an appeals court judge, meets that test. Asked about Barrett, he said that \u201cas to the question on Roe, Yes. I think she meets that standard.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump was only seven minutes into his campaign rally Friday when word arrived backstage that would dramatically alter the final stretch of his first term. Yet as his aides debated whether to alert him that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had died, another message arrived from Trump\u2019s chief of staff: don\u2019t interrupt the President\u2019s speech. So for more than an hour, as the late summer sun set over his northern Minnesota crowd, Trump proceeded as if the race he is currently losing hadn\u2019t been thrown into new flux. After exiting the stage, Trump was informed of Ginsburg\u2019s death by officials that included Hope Hicks, his traveling aide Johnny McEntee and social media adviser Dan Scavino. As Elton John\u2019s \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d blasted on loudspeakers in the background, he told reporters he was learning the news for the first time. The Friday night decision to proceed with his rally amounted to the first in what will be a string of rapid fire choices by Trump and his team meant to harness whatever political advantage comes from a high court vacancy in the contentious final months of a presidential campaign. Handed a potential lifeline for his flagging political career, Trump faces what some officials view as the most consequential decisions of his presidency, ones that carry with them real-world ramifications for Americans\u2019 health care, reproductive rights and the election results themselves. Trump hopes those decisions will help obscure another real-world impact of his presidency: an unsteady response to the coronavirus pandemic that has dominated the election so far and caused him serious political damage. Even before Ginsburg\u2019s death, Trump had mused in private about the potential jolt a Supreme Court vacancy might provide \u2013 and ways an election year selection process might win back voters. On Monday, Trump\u2019s campaign unveiled T-shirts blaring \u201cFILL THAT SEAT,\u201d a chant that has supplanted 2016 relics such as \u201cbuild that wall\u201d and \u201clock her up\u201d at his rallies. What effect the vacancy actually has on his political future remains unknown. But mindful of the high stakes and a condensed confirmation timeline, Trump and his aides describe a jump-started process designed to avoid missteps and error at all cost, hoping to avoid anything that would stymie what they view as a fragile advantage in naming a third Supreme Court justice. At the same time, Trump has made clear he wants to move quickly, hoping to seize momentum in the waning days of the campaign. He said Monday he\u2019d already spoken to some of the candidates earlier in the day and on Sunday. People close to the process said that included Amy Coney Barrett, the front-running candidate who met in person with the President at the White House on Monday. Trump says he will announce Supreme Court pick Friday or Saturday In the hours and days following Ginsburg\u2019s death, the President has received a flood of incoming advice on who to select and how to proceed \u2013 most of it designed to improve his political prospects, which polls show are still in serious jeopardy amid a pandemic that is nearing 200,000 Americans dead. Inside the White House, a confirmation plan that had been sitting dormant has been activated as Trump weighs two principal contenders, both of whom are receiving support from some of the President\u2019s top allies. While Ginsburg\u2019s death was a development White House officials had long viewed as a possibility given her frail condition following bouts of cancer, few anticipated the final weeks of the campaign would be dominated by a Supreme Court confirmation battle. In the months preceding her death, aides had winnowed a long list of potential replacements for Ginsburg down to a more manageable size, recognizing that speed would be essential the closer the vacancy was to Election Day. Trump himself had talked privately this summer about the prospect of nominating a female justice in order to boost his support among women voters, who polls show have soured on him amid the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the conversations said. By the time Trump spoke by phone Friday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he was returning from his rally in Minnesota, he already had two names in mind, according to people familiar with the call: the federal judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa, who are now viewed as front-runners for the slot with Barrett a clear favorite. As the weekend unfolded, some of Trump\u2019s advisers encouraged him to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg as quickly as possible, believing once a name is announced it will be harder for Republican senators to oppose Trump\u2019s nominee on procedural grounds. Already, two GOP senators \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2013 have said whomever wins November\u2019s election should select Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. But another set of advisers strongly encouraged Trump to wait until after Ginsburg\u2019s memorial services, which the Supreme Court said Monday would occur on Wednesday and Thursday this week. Those advisers warned any sign of disrespect for Ginsburg \u2013 who Trump has insulted in the past \u2013 would be used by Democrats to further galvanize their own voters in the lead-up to the election. The debate still appeared to be unfolding on Monday morning when Trump\u2019s press secretary said on Fox that he would \u201cvery likely\u201d announce a nominee before Wednesday. A few minutes later, Trump went with a more cautious view, saying on Fox he would make an announcement on Friday or Saturday. \u201cWe want to pay respect,\u201d he said. Political money flows as both parties gear up for Supreme Court fight Nevertheless, Democrats have already mobilized, using Ginsburg\u2019s legacy as a beloved figure on the left and a women\u2019s rights pioneer to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. Following Ginsburg\u2019s death Friday, donations to Democratic candidates and causes via the online fundraising platform ActBlue surged past $100 million. Trump had been careful over the weekend to honor Ginsburg\u2019s legacy, and was uncharacteristically restrained in avoiding mention of their past scuffles (she called him a \u201cfaker\u201d in 2016; he said she should resign). Yet by Monday, the President was baselessly writing off her dying wish to be replaced by the winner of the 2020 election as a Democratic ploy. And he was eagerly looking ahead to a race reshaped \u2013 at least for now \u2013 around his pending choice. \u201cI\u2019d much rather have a vote before the election, because there\u2019s a lot of work to be done,\u201d he told reporters at the White House before departing for campaign stops in Ohio. \u201cWe have plenty of time to do it. And there\u2019s really a lot of time.\u201d Inside the White House, the process is being overseen by chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 who was spotted on Capitol Hill on Monday \u2013 alongside White House counsel Pat Cipollone, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Vice President Mike Pence. But the range of voices reaching the President on the matter extends well beyond his core West Wing team. The president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List said Monday she had spoken to Trump about the decision. And Trump was essentially on the phone the entire weekend as he campaigned in North Carolina on Saturday and visited his golf course Sunday, two sources said, fielding advice and floating potential nominees to a wide orbit of people. While the conservative Federalist Society has played a prominent role in supporting Trump\u2019s past nominees, and helped craft Trump\u2019s list of potential contenders for a court vacancy, its leaders have not been as influential this go-around, according to people familiar with the matter. In multiple conversations with Trump, McConnell indicated to the President that he and other Republican senators know Barrett well, suggesting the familiarity might help her nomination move quicker, according to a source familiar with the matter. That sentiment has been echoed by some of Trump\u2019s White House advisers, who have encouraged a selection that poses as little opportunity for pitfalls as possible. Barrett has remained the favorite because she is seen as the safest choice in a situation where there is little room for error. A former clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett was Trump\u2019s pick for a seat on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. She has served as a professor of law at her alma mater, Notre Dame. Barrett was considered for the 2018 Supreme Court vacancy, and interviewed with Trump for the slot, though one official said the two lacked \u201cchemistry\u201d during their meeting. Despite that, Barrett came close to being the choice but ultimately lost out after a push by former White House counsel Don McGahn for Brett Kavanaugh. Her advocates were told by White House officials after Kavanaugh was ultimately nominated that she was still in the running for another vacancy, according to one person familiar with the conversations. There was a belief among her supporters that Trump favored nominating her to replace a female justice like Ginsburg, the person said. Amy Coney Barrett, a proven conservative on Trump's Supreme Court short list And though Barrett is the favorite, her tough confirmation fight in 2017 for the appeals court could presage another battle. Democrats questioned her on her opposition to abortion and claimed her devout Catholic faith would color her legal views \u2013 accusations which further endeared her to conservatives. Trump is also still considering other candidates. After Ginsburg died Friday, the President expressed interest in Lagoa, a Cuban-American judge he had only spoken to once before. He has told allies and friends that he likes the idea of nominating Lagoa and thinks it could be more broadly beneficial to him politically, and told reporters at the White House he may meet with her when he visits Miami later this week. Some of Trump\u2019s political allies also advocated for Lagoa, claiming her hometown could give them a campaign edge in Florida, a crucial swing state. Though a source familiar with the process said Lagoa was vetted for the appeals court and the high court, there was an effort by White House officials to find out more about her this weekend. Trump aides spoke with people in Florida about Lagoa in an attempt to glean more information. One potential issue that was discussed this weekend was how Lagoa recently joined the majority in a ruling over felons\u2019 rights when the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a requirement for fines to be paid before felons regain the right to vote. Trump\u2019s initial excitement for Lagoa seemed to fade away as the weekend wore on, people familiar with the matter said, though he praised her on Fox. \u201cShe\u2019s excellent. She\u2019s Hispanic. She\u2019s a terrific woman from everything I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. Florida. We love Florida.\u201d Meadows, meanwhile, is said to have favored federal appeals court Judge Allison Jones Rushing during discussions, though at 38 her young age has been a concern. Cipollone\u2019s deputy Kate Todd is also on the shortlist and has admirers inside the White House, but she is not viewed as a serious finalist, an official said. And in discussing his short-list of candidates on Fox, Trump made mention of \u201ca great one from Michigan\u201d \u2013 a reference, one official said, to federal appeals Judge Joan Larsen. Still, Trump made clear later Monday his actual shortlist includes only a few names. \u201cThey\u2019re all outstanding, but I have one or two that I have in mind,\u201d he said.

Among the people on his short list is Barbara Lagoa, a 52-year-old conservative judge he appointed to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals last December. After Ginsburg died Friday, the President initially expressed interest in Lagoa, a Cuban American judge he had spoken to only once before. Trump\u2019s allies advocated for the Miami-born judge, arguing her hometown could give them a campaign edge in Florida, a crucial swing state where Lagoa carved out a history-making career as a jurist. \u201cShe\u2019s excellent. She\u2019s Hispanic. She\u2019s a terrific woman from everything I know,\u201d Trump told Fox News on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. Florida. We love Florida.\u201d Prior to Trump\u2019s appointment of Lagoa last year, she served as the first Hispanic woman and the first Cuban American woman on the Supreme Court of Florida, having been appointed to it in January 2019 by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Amy Coney Barrett, a proven conservative on Trump's Supreme Court short list At the time of her appointment to the state\u2019s high court, Lagoa spoke to the personal significance of the moment as the governor, her family and her parents, who are Cuban exiles, stood nearby. \u201cOver 50 years ago, my parents, like so many others, came to this country from Cuba to start rebuilding their lives in a land that offered them opportunity, but more importantly, freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that the farthest thing from their minds when they arrived here with only the clothes on their back and their education was that their only child would be here standing today with the governor of Florida at an event like this today, especially since my father had to give up his dream of becoming a lawyer.\u201d A source close to Lagoa said she would appeal to the President because her Cuban heritage would bring a different kind of diversity to the Supreme Court, and because although she attended an Ivy League law school she has stayed true to her roots and does not represent the elitism that exists in some circles along the East Coast. Though Lagoa would not be the first Latina to have a spot on the bench \u2013 that distinction was claimed by Sonia Sotomayor when then-President Barack Obama appointed her in 2009 \u2013 it\u2019s clear that her family\u2019s heritage would play a key role in her decision making. During her Senate confirmation process last year for the 11th Circuit, Lagoa tied her commitment to originalism \u2013 the legal philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013 to Cuban politics. Trump says he will announce Supreme Court pick Friday or Saturday \u201cIf we are not bound by what the Constitution means and it is ever changing, then we are no different than the country that my parents fled from, which is Cuba. Because Cuba has a constitution and a bill of rights and it means nothing,\u201d Lagoa said during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cBecause there is no one to hold it and to say this is what the definition of this constitution means if it is always ever changing.\u201d She added: \u201cThe principles that were articulated in the (US) Constitution at the time of ratification have a meaning \u2013 that meaning is constant. What changes is the application of that meaning to new things.\u201d But Lagoa\u2019s originalism and judicial thinking could prove to be problematic for her, as White House staff working on Trump\u2019s search discussed this weekend her recent vote with the majority in a ruling over felons\u2019 rights when the 11th Circuit upheld a requirement for fines to be paid before felons regain the right to vote. \u201cIn the end, as our judicial oath acknowledges, we will answer for our work to the Judge who sits outside of human history,\u201d said part of the opinion from Circuit Chief Judge William Pryor that Lagoa joined. The case questioned whether requiring felons to pay court fees and other costs associated with their sentences in full imposed an unconstitutional tax and violated the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Lagoa sided with the majority, 6-4, in the court\u2019s major decision this month, ruling that the requirement for felons to pay all fees before voting was within the law. She explained her vote as in line with how she sees the limits of a judge\u2019s role. Florida can bar ex-felons from voting if they owe court payments, appeals court rules \u201cOur role in the constitutional system is simply to review that step for compliance with the Constitution, not to lengthen its stride. To proceed otherwise would violate the principles of federalism and separation of powers \u2013 the two structural guarantors of individual rights and liberty in our Constitution. \u2026 It falls to the citizens of the State of Florida and their elected state legislators, not to federal judges, to make any additional changes to it,\u201d Lagoa wrote. The outcome in the Florida case may be one of the most impactful in a battleground state this election, affecting thousands of people, attorneys in the case have said. Before a recent decision in the case, the Supreme Court had declined to step in before the full circuit court ruled. The Supreme Court split 6-3, with Ginsburg in the minority. The bulk of Lagoa\u2019s opinions have been in state court, so she has not weighed in on some weighty constitutional issues like Roe v. Wade while a federal judge. During her Senate confirmation process last year, however, Lagoa was asked about the landmark case that legalized abortion in the US and has since served as a key litmus test for Democrats and some Republicans. 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg In response to written questions from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, Lagoa said the 1973 decision \u201cis binding precedent of the Supreme Court and I would faithfully follow it,\u201d noting that for \u201clower court judges, all Supreme Court precedent, including Roe v. Wade \u2026 is settled law.\u201d Prior to being appointed by DeSantis to the Florida Supreme Court, Lagoa served for more than a decade on the 3rd District Court of Appeal, a position she was appointed to in 2006 by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. She made history with that appointment as well, becoming the first Hispanic woman and the first Cuban American woman to serve on the panel. Lagoa has also practiced law in both the civil and criminal arenas, according to her official biography, which noted she also served for some time as an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of Florida. As a private lawyer in 2000, Lagoa represented the American family of Eli\u00e1n Gonzalez, the Cuban boy whose family had been rescued in the open waters of the Atlantic, as they fought a bitter battle to obtain asylum for him. The high-profile case rocked Florida, triggering tensions between Cuba and the US. She also represented rock star Sammy Hagar in a breach of contract suit. Lagoa attended Florida International University before going on to get her law degree from Columbia University in 1992, where she helped edit the school\u2019s prestigious law review, according to her biography. She is married to Paul Huck, who is also an attorney, and the two have three daughters.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said on Monday he would unveil his selection to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg by the end of the week after spending the weekend fielding advice and floating potential nominees to a wide orbit of advisers. The decision on who to nominate to replace the late jurist and women\u2019s rights icon \u2013 and when to nominate her \u2013 amounts to one of the biggest decisions of Trump\u2019s presidency. Acutely aware of the stakes, Trump was essentially on the phone the entire weekend as he campaigned in North Carolina on Saturday and visited his golf course Sunday, two sources said. In those calls, he\u2019s made one thing clear: he wants to move fast. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be on Friday or Saturday and we want to pay respect,\u201d Trump said in a Monday morning interview on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cIt looks like we will have probably services on Thursday or Friday, as I understand it,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd I think the respect we should wait for the services to be over for Justice Ginsburg. So we\u2019re looking at probably Friday or maybe Saturday.\u201d Some advisers to Trump encouraged him over the weekend to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg as quickly as possible, believing once a name is announced it will be harder for Republican senators to say they would oppose a Trump nominee on procedural grounds. Already, two senators have said whomever wins November\u2019s election should select Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. Supreme Court fight adds stunning new twist to a crisis election But another set of advisers strongly encouraged Trump to wait until after Ginsburg\u2019s services. Those advisers warned that any sign of disrespect for Ginsburg \u2013 who Trump has insulted in the past \u2013 would be used by Democrats to further galvanize their voters. Trump appeared to take the more cautious view, saying on Fox he would make an announcement after Ginsburg\u2019s memorial services \u2013 even though his press secretary said on Fox News less than an hour beforehand he would likely release a name by Wednesday. Still, with a persistent polling deficit ahead of November\u2019s vote, Trump is working on an accelerated timeline. Following Ginsburg\u2019s death Friday, donations to Democratic candidates and causes via the online fundraising platform ActBlue surged past $100 million. And the Judicial Crisis Network announced Monday a $2.2 million campaign to boost Trump\u2019s Supreme Court selection. The influential conservative group will air ads in several states including Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina. The group has launched similar campaigns for Trump\u2019s last two Supreme Court picks. The President held several conversations with lawmakers and spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, multiple times as he made clear his desire to have a confirmation vote on his nominee before the November 3 election. As of Monday, Trump did not appear to have made a final selection but had instead narrowed down his short list to a handful of candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s down to five. It could be any one of them,\u201d Trump said on Fox before adding it was \u201cprobably four\u201d candidates. He named only two: Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa. Barrett has remained the favorite because she is seen as the safest choice in a situation where there is little room for error. A former clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Barrett was Trump\u2019s pick for a seat on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. She has served as a professor of law at her alma mater, Notre Dame. A source familiar with the process told CNN Trump was leaning toward Barrett and McConnell, who wants a smooth process, has made his preference for her obvious. Barrett was considered for the 2018 Supreme Court vacancy, and interviewed with Trump for the slot. Her advocates were told by White House officials after Brett Kavanaugh was ultimately nominated that she was very much still in the running for another vacancy, according to one person familiar with the conversations. There was a belief among her supporters that Trump favored nominating her to replace a female justice like Ginsburg, the person said. While Barrett is the favorite, her tough confirmation fight in 2017 for the appeals court could presage another battle. Democrats questioned her on her opposition to abortion and claimed her devout Catholic faith would color her legal views. The White House is trying to keep the circle tight when it comes to the selection process, but Trump has also received a flood of calls with outside advice on which candidate to select, making that effort difficult at best. After Ginsburg died Friday, the President initially expressed interest in Lagoa, a Cuban American judge he had only spoken to once before. Trump\u2019s allies advocated for the Miami-born judge, arguing her hometown could give them a campaign edge in Florida, a crucial swing state. Though a source familiar with the process said Lagoa was vetted for the appeals court and the high court, there was an effort to find out more about her this weekend. White House staff spoke with people in Florida about Lagoa in an attempt to glean more information. Lagoa is not well known in typical judicial circles in Washington that can be tight knit. One point of potential issue that was discussed this weekend was how Lagoa recently joined the majority in a ruling over felons\u2019 rights when the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a requirement for fines to be paid before felons regain the right to vote. Trump\u2019s initial excitement for Lagoa seemed to fade away as the weekend wore on, though he praised her on Fox. \u201cShe\u2019s excellent. She\u2019s Hispanic. She\u2019s a terrific woman from everything I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. Florida. We love Florida.\u201d Asked whether politics is a consideration in his choice, Trump said it factored \u201cless so than the person themselves.\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who is leading the process alongside White House counsel Pat Cipollone, is said to have favored Allison Jones Rushing during discussions, though at 38, her young age has been a concern. Cipollone\u2019s deputy Kate Todd is also on the shortlist and has admirers inside the White House, but she is not viewed as a finalist, an official said. Trump\u2019s aides believe the Supreme Court vacancy benefits Trump politically, but are acutely aware of how Ginsburg\u2019s death has also mobilized Democrats to massive fundraising hauls. One official said the pervading view in the White House is there is little room for error in the nomination process given the political stakes, and any perceived slight of the late Ginsburg would amount to an unforced error. The official said Trump has appeared highly aware that any missteps along the way could damage what appears to him a political lifeline. CNN\u2019s Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans, in less than 72 hours, have put themselves on the path to confirm a nominee to dramatically shift the balance of power in the US Supreme Court. And they very well may do it before the November 3 election. There is no on-ramp or slow lead-up to what\u2019s happening at this moment, in the middle of an increasingly divisive election taking place in a fractured country. A colossal battle, the contours of which have been laid over years of judicial fights, disputes and wars, was under way within hours of the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Republicans have grown more and more confident they can confirm the liberal icon\u2019s successor in the weeks ahead, according to senators and senior aides. But how \u2013 and when \u2013 is still coming together. 43 Republicans have had no issue doing a complete 180-degree shift on their 2016 position on holding open a seat in an election year. Officially, it\u2019s because the circumstances are different \u2013 unlike 2016, the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party. The reality is this is just a raw power play. Republicans have the power. They\u2019re going to exert that power, and no amount of video clips or old quotes that seemingly make them appear to be hypocrites will change that, according to more than a dozen senators and top aides to whom we spoke over the weekend. \u201cThey\u2019d do the same thing,\u201d a GOP senator told me, rationalizing the turnabout. (See more on this in Sen. Lamar Alexander\u2019s statement below.) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can lose three Republicans if this vote is held before election day, because Vice President Mike Pence can cast a potential tie-breaking vote. McConnell has already lost two \u2013 Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. But finding another two Republican lawmakers who are going to defy their leader on an issue that is as core to Republican orthodoxy as the highest court, that\u2019s tough. Supreme Court fight adds stunning new twist to a crisis election All eyes had been on Alexander. He was retiring. He\u2019s a Senate institutionalist. But, he\u2019s also a close ally of McConnell\u2019s and a reliable GOP vote. Alexander coming out in full support of McConnell\u2019s strategy made it hard to imagine who the fourth member would be. McConnell, whose career work has been defined by filling the courts with conservative judges, had a single message for his 52 GOP Senate colleagues Friday night: \u201ckeep your powder dry.\u201d That, of course, was only the message if any members were considering calling for Republicans to hold off on confirming Ginsburg\u2019s successor. For those ready to move \u2013 and move quickly \u2013 McConnell welcomed their public comments. They\u2019ve served the purpose of creating momentum, and in these cases, momentum can drive everything, including how fast the process moves along. McConnell hasn\u2019t said if a vote will happen before or after the election. And, he may not have to decide tomorrow, this week or even this month. It\u2019s possible Republicans start down this road, get a nominee, hold hearings and debate without a public pronouncement of when a vote will actually take place. That gives campaigns time to poll and McConnell more time to win over his conference. It also is a fact that predicting a timeline this early in the game isn\u2019t necessary or even practical. Need proof? See the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cThis should take as long as it needs to take, but no longer,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri, told CBS Sunday. \u201cThere is plenty of time to get this done, but to get this done before Election Day, everything has to work pretty precisely.\u201d This weekend, conservative senators publicly deployed their campaign to convince McConnell and President Donald Trump to hold a vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the election. There\u2019s a reason for that. And, there is a reason that McConnell might consider it even if we are just more than 40 days away from the election. Every moment spent on the Supreme Court is a moment when voters aren\u2019t talking about a massive pandemic that has overwhelmed the country\u2019s health care facilities, eroded the economy, and taken the lives of nearly 200,000 Americans. This election was going to be a referendum on Trump. Now, it\u2019s a reminder for conservatives and the Republican base about what is at stake: the courts. Conservatives want to move on the court now because things can always change after the election. Trump could lose, the Senate could flip or the fight for the WH could become so close, so contentious and disputed that the court will play a pivotal role. They want it filled with nine justices \u2013 three of whom were selected by Trump \u2013 if that happens. A good adage for leaders on Capitol Hill that rarely fails: If you have the votes, you vote. McConnell is on the cusp of having the green light to put a process in motion that would lead to a confirmation vote before the election. It doesn\u2019t mean he will, but the talk of this being destined for the lame duck is far from a sure thing, according to people with knowledge of the process. In fact, Republicans are growing more and more comfortable with a vote before the election, those people say. The selection belongs to Trump. The process belongs to McConnell. In other words \u2013 if McConnell says it, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. If you hear it from someone else, best to wait for McConnell to confirm it before you consider it Gospel. Sen. Cory Gardner Since coming to Washington six years ago, Gardner has rarely defied his party. He did get into a battle with the former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on marijuana a few years ago, but Gardner isn\u2019t a senator who steps outside the GOP tent very often. Now, however, he is arguably the most vulnerable Republican up for reelection in a state that looks very different from what it did six years ago. If there was ever a time for Gardner to say no to McConnell and the President, this would be it. But, as much as a vote for Trump\u2019s SCOTUS nominee could hurt Gardner with Democrats, voting against it or advertising you aren\u2019t comfortable moving before the election will hurt Gardner with his base. When you are in a razor-thin reelection fight, you can\u2019t risk cratering support from the people who were going to vote for you for people who are likely to vote for your opponent. Supreme Court prepares to start a new term with only eight Sen. Mitt Romney Romney\u2019s reputation, at least in this early stage of his Senate career, is to cross the aisle on crucial and controversial votes. He proved that last winter during impeachment when he voted with Democrats on one article. But Romney is also deeply conservative. And, when it comes to votes backing Republican values, he\u2019s not typically one to abandon the party. The key question with Romney at this point is does he see this as a vote about fairness? A vote about playing by the rules McConnell established when Barack Obama was President and Republicans refused to hold hearings or a vote on Merrick Garland. Or does he view this as a moment of consequence for conservative values and sticks with the team? Alexander, the senior senator from Tennessee who is respected on both sides of the aisle and carries the institutionalist mantle, was considered a possible wild card when this first started. He is not. And his explanation as to why is worth reading, as it is probably the best rationale anyone has given for why Republicans are so quickly coalescing behind moving forward \u2013 and fast. \u201cNo one should be surprised that a Republican Senate majority would vote on a Republican President\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, even during a presidential election year. The Constitution gives senators the power to do it. The voters who elected them expect it. Going back to George Washington, the Senate has confirmed many nominees to the Supreme Court during a presidential election year. It has refused to confirm several when the President and Senate majority were of different parties. Senator McConnell is only doing what Democrat leaders have said they would do if the shoe were on the other foot.\u201d 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg A couple points here: the first goes to the raw power view of things. Republicans control the chamber. The Senate\u2019s job is to advise and consent (or not). The majority has full authority to decide which of those paths it chooses, no matter if the rationale is seen as hypocritical or based on some made up rule (seriously, the \u201cBiden rule\u201d is not a thing). Second is the final sentence in Alexander\u2019s statement. Nothing defines the judicial wars of the last 15 years like the idea that any action was only taken because if it weren\u2019t, the other side certainly would if put in the same position. Alexander, who is traditionally one of the more bipartisan senators in the chamber, underscores just how little of that exists on judges \u2013 or really on anything at this point. There has been no shortage of psychoanalysis of the Kentucky Republican over the years, and there will certainly be reams of it to come in the days ahead. This won\u2019t be that, but just a couple of quick points to keep in mind in the weeks ahead: The actual selection does matter here. It may not seem like it, but Alexander made clear in his statement he wasn\u2019t an automatic yes. (That\u2019s not the case for everyone.) But to some degree the pressure on who, exactly, is selected may be minimized somewhat by the current realities. The concern over Amy Coney Barrett had been that she\u2019d be unpalatable to the GOP moderates \u2013 specifically Collins and Murkowski \u2013 due to her views on abortion. Well, Collins and Murkowski have already put their pre-election cards on the table. That doesn\u2019t mean Barrett is or will be the pick. That\u2019s the President\u2019s prerogative, though Republicans involved in the process told CNN she\u2019s viewed as the clear leader at the moment (and McConnell, while not putting his thumb on the scale, made clear to Trump in a phone call that the Republican conference is comfortable with Barrett, according to two people familiar with the matter). But it\u2019s an interesting element of all of this. Let\u2019s start with the baseline that things are scrambled, and despite some early polling, nobody is exactly sure what this is going to mean for November. But there are theories \u2013 and watching how each side is lining up provides some insight, as does conversations with campaign operations on both sides. Republicans Aides, campaign strategists and members we\u2019ve talked to over the weekend have warned that this vacancy, a vote before the election and the consequences or opportunities for a faster timeline are different for every single member running for reelection. For Gardner, a Republican in Colorado, who is facing a state that has changed dramatically in six years and is looking bluer, it\u2019s a tough vote. For Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, a southern state where a conservative base is far more motivated by the issue of abortion, less so. For Collins, who has already come out against moving forward before the election, this is an opportunity to assert an independent streak. The politics are all over the map here and McConnell is going to have to work through that with his members Tuesday when they meet for lunch. Democrats Here's why a Supreme Court battle could benefit the GOP Democrats are furious and that furor is translating, at least in these early days, to the campaign trail. ActBlue, the Democratic small-dollar fundraising platform, reported more than $100 million in small dollar donations in a little more than 36 hours this weekend. One thing is clear \u2013 Democrats, from Joe Biden down, are moving quickly to put the focus on health care. It was a winning issue in 2018, before the pandemic it was going to be the central component of their campaigns, and with the Supreme Court set to take up a case that would strike down the Affordable Care Act, it will once again take center stage. It\u2019s important to remember. There are no options for Democrats to block this nomination if McConnell moves forward and has the votes. They can delay and make life more difficult and annoying for moving this nomination, but they can\u2019t block it. The only things they can do are 1) convince four Republicans that supporting a Trump nominee before the election is wrong or 2) retaliate in January if they win back the US Senate. A little about the first If you were watching Biden\u2019s message Sunday, it wasn\u2019t about what Democrats should do right now, but what he hopes Republican rank-and-file members will do. Biden\u2019s appeal is to convince Republicans on the fence that moving ahead with a nomination before the election or even if Trump losses is the wrong move. And, the second Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his caucus over the weekend that \u201cif Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table.\u201d Behind the scenes, Democrats are talking about a lot of steps they could take, including nuking the filibuster, if they win in November, even adding additional seats to the Supreme Court. But, right now, all of those things would depend on Schumer winning the Senate and having 51 votes. They are all hypothetical and future threats. And even if Democrats flip the Senate, you have to convince enough members of the caucus to vote to change the rules. On the historic Senate fight to come, via Clare Foran, Manu Raju and Ted Barrett.

            "article_content": "The United States is barreling into the ultimate political stress test, with the most divisive partisan collisions \u2013 a Supreme Court battle and a presidential election \u2013 occurring in the middle of an again-worsening pandemic that is about to claim its 200,000th American life. President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans spent the weekend rolling out an aggressive power play to try to solidify an unassailable and generational majority on the nation\u2019s top bench possibly even before an election that is only 43 days away. Democrats are meanwhile mobilizing to maximize what they see as possible benefits of the nomination struggle for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign and to prevent the President from using the sudden confirmation fight to turn the focus away from his disastrous mismanagement of the coronavirus emergency. The confrontation is heating up with some Americans already taking part in early and absentee voting, and only a week before the first critical presidential debate between the President and the former vice president in Ohio.   The death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday injected an extraordinary new dimension into what was already shaping up as the most contentious election in decades. Her passing also unleashed an even more divisive than normal battle for a replacement since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pressing ahead to confirm a late-term Trump pick despite refusing to move on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, many months before the 2016 election. Trump said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Monday morning that he will likely announce his nominee on Friday or Saturday. Back in 2016, McConnell said voters should decide the destiny of the court in choosing a new President. But McConnell turned his back on his own made-up rule with a Republican in the White House. This Republican hypocrisy led to an absurd spectacle on Sunday talk shows of lawmakers and officials trying to explain away their own disingenuousness. The GOP will not care, however, since this pick will likely enshrine a decades-long conservative majority with the capacity to shape vast areas of American life \u2013 from voting and gender rights to environmental regulation and big business matters. The court could also become a thorn in the side of future Democratic presidents. Trump reveled in his opportunity to nominate his third Supreme Court Justice at a rally in North Carolina on Saturday night. \u201cIt will be a woman, a very talented, very brilliant woman,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t chosen yet, but we have numerous women on the list.\u201d Trump vows to appoint a woman to Supreme Court as vacancy re-energizes his political prospects Among the President\u2019s top choices, according to CNN reporting, are Amy Coney Barrett, whom Trump previously nominated to sit on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, and Barbara Lagoa, whom he appointed to the 11th US Circuit of Appeals in 2019. Lagoa is Hispanic and from Florida and could fit well with Trump\u2019s reelection strategy, which depends on him winning the vital swing state. Biden seized on McConnell\u2019s gall in an effort to make the case that Republicans who won the presidency despite losing the popular vote are embarked on an extreme power grab and must be reined in. \u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d Biden said Sunday, directly appealing to GOP senators. \u201cUphold your constitutional duty, your conscience, let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can\u2019t keep rewriting history.\u201d Two Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins, who is locked in a tight reelection fight in Maine, have already said that they oppose taking up Trump\u2019s nomination before the election, leaving McConnell almost no margin for error if he is to fulfill Trump\u2019s wish for a vote before the election. He can only afford to lose one more Republican senator and still confirm the pick before November 3 with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. The exact dynamics inside the Senate GOP will become more clear later this week as the chamber returns to work and members gather for their policy lunch. Biden plans to make the Supreme Court duel into a new platform for his assault on the President on health care, sources told CNN. The approach will allow him to also leverage criticism of Trump\u2019s performance on the pandemic. The court is already scheduled to hear oral arguments in the administration\u2019s latest attempt to kill off Obamacare the week after the election, and Democrats will argue that the new nominee could help finally seal the law\u2019s fate and crush popular provisions like a ban on denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The President pivoted forcefully to the new Supreme Court battle after a week when he became increasingly desperate to deflect from the pandemic, which included misleading and often false accounts, for example, of the speed with which Americans can expect to see a vaccine needed to end the disaster. Biden to make health care push as Supreme Court vacancy fight looms View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Trump\u2019s claims that the country has been turning the corner on the virus are being comprehensively refuted by data, which shows a rising number of cases and daily coronavirus deaths averaging around 800. The number of Covid-19 deaths in the United States is about to top the staggering barrier of 200,000 after it emerged in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book that the President understood the seriousness of the disease back in February but refused to level with the country. Some experts say this may have potentially caused tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. On Monday, Trump once again gave himself an A+ in his handling of the pandemic despite the rising number of infections throughout the country. Trump\u2019s hopes of talking about anything but the pandemic look slim given the worsening situation. The number of new Covid-19 cases has increased by at least 10% in 28 states over the last week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The test positivity rate \u2013 the percentage of new test results that are positive \u2013 is rising in 25 states, according to the Covid Tracking Project, fulfilling the fears of experts who warned of a post-Labor Day spike. While large crowds of mourners gathered at the Supreme Court to pay tribute to Ginsburg, the White House was embarking on an aggressive plan to put her replacement \u2013 and a 6-3 conservative majority \u2013 in place. \u201cJustice Ginsburg was confirmed within 43 days of her nomination,\u201d Pence\u2019s Chief of Staff Marc Short told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, though it actually took 50 days from the presidential announcement. \u201cToday, we sit here 44 days out from election, so it\u2019s certainly possible,\u201d he said, referring to the chances of getting a new justice on the bench by November 3.\u201dBut I think that the President\u2019s obligation is to make the nomination. We will leave the timetable to Leader McConnell.\u201d Republican senators blew past accusations of hypocrisy when asked about the tactics of McConnell, who has made reshaping the federal judiciary the priority of his leadership of the Senate. Here's why a Supreme Court battle could benefit the GOP Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso laid out his expectations for a swift confirmation on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday. \u201cThe President is going to make a nomination. I believe it\u2019s going to be this week. And Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we will hold hearings. And there will be a vote on the floor of the United States Senate this year.\u201d If the Republicans cannot ram through a vote before the election, it could lead to a massive political conflagration should Democrats win the presidency and take back the Senate, then have to watch as a new justice is confirmed in a lame duck session by McConnell. Such possibilities are making for some treacherous politics for both sides ahead of the election. Trump, for example, is clearly hoping that a Supreme Court fight will supercharge his political base and send an overwhelming wave of conservatives into polling places. But there is also the chance that the Supreme Court battle could backfire on the President. It could boost liberal turnout among voters who fear, for example, that the new conservative majority will seek to limit or even outlaw the right to an abortion. A prolonged fight over this issue ahead of the election may further weaken Trump\u2019s already compromised position among suburban women voters. A new Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday found 62% of Americans agreed that the winner of the election should appoint Ginsburg\u2019s replacement. But the poll also pointed to partisan divides and public uncertainty since 46% of those asked agreed that Trump should nominate a replacement before his term ends. The audacity of the President and McConnell is also fueling Democratic intensity over what many in the party will view as two stolen Supreme Court seats. Former President Bill Clinton said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that for \u201cSenator McConnell and President Trump, their first value is power. And they\u2019re trying to jam the court with as many ideological judges as they can.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a democracy if there\u2019s one set of rules for one group and another set for everybody else,\u201d Clinton said.",

            "article_content": "A very different Supreme Court will meet in two weeks to grapple with the potential of 4-4 splits and a caseload that includes no less than the future of the Affordable Care Act and possibly the presidential election. As the next term begins, the justices will also find themselves in a spot they often seek to avoid: the center of a politically ferocious fight playing out across the street on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s been a mission of Chief Justice John Roberts to keep the court above the political fray, but that will be impossible as election related petitions flow into the court and the confirmation battle plays out across the country. Roberts will navigate a fraught moment in history, at a time when his own place on the court might be about to shift. On top of that, he must help plan a memorial for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and balance the wishes of mourners with the reality that the court has been closed to the public since March because of the coronavirus pandemic. At the time of her death, the court was considering an issue critical to Ginsburg\u2019s legacy: abortion, as the Trump administration filed an emergency request to reinstate FDA restrictions on a pill used to induce early abortions. The court\u2019s order \u2013 most certainly delayed due to Ginsburg\u2019s tragic death \u2013 could reveal where Roberts might be headed in the future. Last term, he voted with the court\u2019s liberals to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law. But writing alone, he also peeled away at recent precedent \u2013 a move that worries supporters of abortion rights. The chief\u2019s vote on the pending order could illuminate his path forward on the issue. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's most notable Supreme Court decisions and dissents Other petitions \u2013 related to the election \u2013 are also bound to reach the high court. In April, for example, the justices split badly on an emergency order related to absentee ballot deadlines in Wisconsin during the early months of the pandemic. Ginsburg dissented in that case, writing that the court\u2019s reasoning \u201cboggles the mind.\u201d Asked last week whether the court is doing anything to prepare for the onslaught of election-related petitions, Justice Stephen Breyer said the justices make no special accommodations. The court has learned, he said Thursday in an event hosted by George Washington University, \u201cto deal with a case when it comes up.\u201d As if their job isn\u2019t complicated enough, the justices have been unable to meet in person for months. On September 29, they are scheduled to gather by phone to consider the piles of petitions that have built up over the summer. They include cases on qualified immunity, an Arizona ballot harvesting law and a Mississippi abortion restriction. In last week\u2019s appearance, Breyer noted that the justices can\u2019t even do video conferences with each other to benefit from some face to face contact out of security concerns the feed would be hacked. When the virtual gavel comes down on the first Monday in October the justices will begin the term, by telephone, releasing a live audio feed. On November 10 \u2013 a week after the election when the final tally might still be in limbo \u2013 the justices will take up the Affordable Care Act. The stakes are stratospheric. Challengers to Obamacare, including the Trump administration, say that the law\u2019s individual mandate is unconstitutional, and the entire law must fall. Biden to make health care push as Supreme Court vacancy fight looms In 2012, Roberts cast a critical vote to uphold the law under Congress\u2019 taxing power. But in 2017, the Republican-led Congress cut the tax penalty for those who lacked insurance to zero as part of a tax overhaul. Texas and other Republican-led states sued, arguing that since the mandate was no longer tied to a specific tax penalty, it had lost its legal underpinning. The justices will review a lower court opinion that struck the mandate but punted on whether the rest of the massive law \u2013 even provisions unrelated to the mandate \u2013 could remain on the books. If the case is reviewed by only eight justices, there is always a risk that they could split 4-4. When the court is evenly divided it is basically left with few options. It allows the lower court opinion to remain in place but creates no new precedent to guide the lower courts. It is a highly unsatisfactory outcome for the court and something it tries to avoid whenever possible. Without an alternative in place, that could mean the end of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions, including barring insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on a person\u2019s medical history. It also threatens the coverage of millions of Americans who are insured through the Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid expansion \u2013 both of which are expected to increase this year amid coronavirus-fueled layoffs. A new nominee will impact the court \u2013 and the docket it decides \u2013 for years to come. If Trump succeeds in his quest to add a new member, conservatives will be energized to move the court even further to the right on hot button issues. Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for her legacy in her final Supreme Court term Already, conservatives on the court have expressed an interest in taking up the Second Amendment again, and Justice Clarence Thomas, for instance, believes the court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence is in disarray. Percolating in the lower courts is also a massive case concerning affirmative action concerning the admissions plan at Harvard. Last term, the justices also dodged a series of cases on qualified immunity, a legal doctrine some say shields law enforcement and government officials from accountability, and a new justice might encourage movement on that front. Meanwhile, since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, Roberts has played a role as the swing vote at times. That might change with a new conservative justice. Roberts will still be chief, and have a powerful assignment power, but his own role could shift. The justices often say in speaking appearances that a new justice changes the entire court. That change will come as progressives mourn the death of a liberal icon, the country works through a divisive election and Capitol Hill once again plays host to a fiery confirmation process. All in the middle of a pandemic. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Top Senate Republicans are privately arguing that it would boost their chances of holding the majority in November if their party makes a full-throated effort at confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, according to multiple GOP sources, despite their past posture that such nominees should not be confirmed in a presidential election year. Behind the scenes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is calculating whether he has the votes to quickly confirm Trump\u2019s eventual nominee to the Supreme Court, focusing in large part on the party\u2019s most vulnerable Republicans facing voters in less than two months. The Kentucky Republican could only lose three senators of his 53-47 majority and still confirm the pick with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. The argument, according to Senate GOP sources, is that getting behind Trump\u2019s pick will energize the Republican base and woo conservative-leaning voters who are uncertain about backing Trump and the GOP this fall. Opposing the nominee, they argue, will only cause a backlash from their party\u2019s supporters and might not be enough to win over Democratic voters who are already inclined to back their opponents. But moving ahead on a nomination now could anger some voters who may recoil at the GOP\u2019s heavy-handed tactics, including in Democratic-leaning states where Republicans face voters in the fall. On balance, though, Republicans say that moving ahead now would be far more beneficial to keeping control of the narrowly divided chamber. In the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death on Friday, several of the most vulnerable Republican senators \u2013 Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Martha McSally of Arizona and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia \u2013 have signaled their support for moving ahead with confirmation proceedings this year. Those three senators are running behind Trump in the polls, suggesting that they need to coalesce their party\u2019s support. Supreme Court fight highlights US Senate race in Arizona \u201cThis U.S. Senate should vote on President Trump\u2019s next nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d tweeted McSally on Friday night. Republican senators opposed even holding a confirmation hearing in 2016 for Judge Merrick Garland, who then-President Barack Obama nominated to the bench in March of that year after Justice Antonin Scalia died. But with Trump in office, many have since changed their minds. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is running for reelection and vowed in 2016 to oppose moving forward with a Supreme Court pick in a presidential election year, has already signaled that the Judiciary Committee he chairs will consider Trump\u2019s nominee. And before Ginsburg died, vulnerable Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa also supported taking up a Trump nominee after November in a lame-duck session of Congress. With vulnerable Republicans beginning to fall in line, GOP leaders say they are confident that they will ultimately get the votes to confirm Trump\u2019s nominee this year \u2013 whether it\u2019s before the elections or between November and January during a lame-duck session of Congress. \u201cThere\u2019s no reward on the other side,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff who advises the leader. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Democrat motivated by this issue, you\u2019ll never vote Republican.\u201d The fight for the Senate majority leads through a number of Republican-leaning states and swing states, including Arizona, North Carolina, Montana, Iowa and Georgia. Yet it also goes through left-leaning states like Maine and Colorado. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican in a tough reelection race, said Saturday that the Senate should not vote on a Supreme Court nominee prior to the presidential election given its \u201cproximity.\u201d \u201cIn fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd,\u201d Collins said in a statement. But Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who said in 2016 that the \u201cnext President ought to choose\u201d the Supreme Court nominee, has not said what the Senate should do. At a local townhall Saturday, Gardner avoided answering whether he would stay by his view in 2016 when he opposed filling the vacancy in a presidential election year. \u201cWe need to make sure that we are giving time for personal reflection on this loss of an American icon,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThere is time for debate, there is time for politics, but the time for now is to pray for the family.\u201d To flip the chamber, Democrats need a net gain of four seats, or three seats if they also win the White House. They argue that appointing a Supreme Court justice who will change the ideological balance of the court from a 5-4 to a 6-3 conservative majority will also motivate their party and independents this fall. They\u2019ve already warned that another Trump justice would undermine Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that provided a constitutional right to abortion, and dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The court will hear arguments regarding the constitutionality of the ACA on November 10, one week after Election Day. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death throws dramatic election into even more chaos Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, said that his outside liberal group will spend $10 million in the Supreme Court fight. \u201cWe will make sure Senate Republicans in key states understand the political peril they will face for trying to install a Trump supermajority on the Court in the twilight of his presidency,\u201d Fallon said. But outside conservative groups are galvanized by the opportunity to tilt the court\u2019s ideological balance further to the right. When asked about Demand Justice\u2019s pledge to spend heavily against Trump\u2019s pick, Carrie Severino, the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, told CNN, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to see their 10 million, and match it, and raise it.\u201d Other than Collins, just Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Chuck Grassley of Iowa have indicated that it\u2019s too close to an election to move ahead now. Neither are up for reelection, but Murkowski was the lone Republican to vote against Trump\u2019s pick of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and Grassley was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the Republicans refused to consider Garland. In July, Grassley told CNN, \u201cMy position is if I were chairman of the committee, I couldn\u2019t move forward with it.\u201d Asked on Saturday if he still stands by that sentiment, Grassley\u2019s office instead pointed to his statement from Friday night where he honored Ginsburg but steered clear of how to replace her. Privately, McConnell is urging his colleagues to \u201ckeep your powder dry,\u201d urging them to not get locked into positions they might regret later, according to a person who saw a private letter the GOP leader sent to colleagues on Friday. Many are heeding that advice. Key GOP senators up for reelection like Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Steve Daines of Montana were quick to tweet their condolences for the loss of Ginsburg but stopped short of weighing in on the question of how and when she should be replaced. Two GOP senators whose votes could be at play \u2013 Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee \u2013 have not indicated their preference, and their aides are declining to comment on whether they think the nominations should wait until next year. \u201cHer service to our country deserves great respect,\u201d Alexander said in a Saturday statement about Ginsburg. Moving ahead will also put a number of Republicans in an awkward position to explain why they refused to consider the Garland nomination but are now willing to consider Trump\u2019s pick, with far fewer days before the election. Now, McConnell argues, the situation is different because Republicans are in control of both the White House and the Senate, unlike in 2016 when a Democrat occupied the White House. But that was not the message that Republicans vocally made at the time, namely Graham. In 2016, Graham told his colleagues: \u201cI want you to use my words against me. If there\u2019s a Republican President in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say: Lindsey Graham said let\u2019s let the next President, whoever it might be, make that nomination.\u201d White House wants to announce Trump's Supreme Court pick before first debate, source says On Saturday, Graham pointed to recent comments he made saying times have changed and that he views judicial nominees differently after Kavanaugh, who was confirmed in 2018 after an emotional and vicious fight once he was accused of sexual assault as a young man, allegations that he furiously denied. In late July, Graham told CNN that \u201che\u2019d like to fill a vacancy\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know how practical that would be. \u2026 But after Kavanaugh, I have a different view of judges.\u201d Tillis, too, will have to reconcile his past views \u2013 but clearly is calculating that sticking with Trump is crucial in his neck-and-neck race against Democrat Cal Cunningham in North Carolina. Speaking to conservative activists in 2016, Tillis said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to nominate a Supreme Court Justice until the people have spoken.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to let the American people speak.\u201d On Saturday, Tillis sang a different tune. \u201cThere is a clear choice on the future of the Supreme Court between the well-qualified and conservative jurist President Trump will nominate and I will support, and the liberal activist Joe Biden will nominate and Cal Cunningham will support, who will legislate radical, left-wing policies from the bench,\u201d he said in a written statement. This story has been updated with a statement from Sen. Susan Collins and comments from Sen. Cory Gardner. Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg less than two months from the presidential election has forced a reexamination of Republicans\u2019 11-month blockade of Merrick Garland in 2016. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a Friday night statement that President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Ginsburg will get a vote in the Senate. Doing so would be a complete reversal of his position in 2016, when the GOP-led Senate refused to hold a hearing or vote on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, saying it was too close to the election. Justice Antonin Scalia, who had been a conservative stalwart on the Supreme Court since being nominated by then-President Ronald Reagan in 1986, died on February 13, 2016. Within hours \u2013 as other senators were offering condolences to Scalia\u2019s family \u2013 McConnell issued a stunning, categorical rejection of Obama\u2019s authority more than 11 months before the Democrat\u2019s replacement would be sworn into office. \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\u201d McConnell said. Other leading Republicans followed McConnell\u2019s lead. A reason they frequently cited: What they called the \u201cBiden rule.\u201d Joe Biden had said in a 1992 Senate floor speech \u2013 when there were no high court vacancies to fill \u2013 that \u201conce the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.\u201d McConnell never backtracked, despite Democrats\u2019 hopes that he would face political pressure to do so. On February 23, a week after Scalia\u2019s death and before Obama had nominated his replacement, McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor that no Obama nominee would receive a vote. \u201cPresidents have a right to nominate, just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cIn this case, the Senate will withhold it.\u201d GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that day signed a letter to McConnell saying they would refuse to hold hearings on any Scalia replacement until after a new president took office on January 20, 2017. Many Republicans cited the \u201cBiden rule.\u201d In the ensuing weeks, Obama forged ahead, ignoring Republicans\u2019 insistence that no nominee would receive a hearing or a vote and chose Garland on March 16. His calculation was that a long-time jurist \u2013 Garland, then 63, was the chief judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u2013 who was respected by both parties and had been previously confirmed by the Senate would be difficult to turn away. \u201cI hope they\u2019re fair,\u201d Obama said of Senate Republicans in the Rose Garden as he announced Garland was his choice. \u201cThat\u2019s all. I hope they\u2019re fair.\u201d But Republicans did not budge, making clear on the day Garland was nominated that their position had not changed and he would not receive a vote. \u201cI think well of Merrick Garland. I think he is a fine person. But his nomination does not in any way change current circumstances,\u201d then-Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said at the time. Through the summer and fall, Senate Republicans continued to act as if no Supreme Court vacancy existed and no nomination had been made. On July 20, Garland broke the 100-year-old record of 125 days for the longest gap between a Supreme Court nomination and confirmation. Supreme Court activity slowed drastically. The court \u2013 mindful of potential 4-4 splits \u2013 was reluctant to take on new cases. The GOP\u2019s refusal to act on Obama\u2019s nominee turned the Supreme Court into a key political issue in November\u2019s general election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Trump on May 19, 2016, released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees \u2013 a list shaped by conservative allies and aimed at soothe Republican voters\u2019 concerns over whether he would nominate right-leaning judges. The promise of anti-abortion, pro-gun rights and anti-LGBTQ rights judges motivated religious conservatives who might have had misgivings about Trump\u2019s character. Less than two weeks after taking office, on January 31, 2017, Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia\u2019s former seat on the Supreme Court. The Senate, where Republicans maintained a majority after the 2016 election, confirmed Gorsuch less than three months later, on April 7, 2017.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. No other government official will have their reputation changed more than William Barr, the attorney general. At his confirmation hearing in 2019, he promised independence and a patriotic duty to fix the Department of Justice. That was then. What\u2019s happened. Now it is extremely hard not to shake the impression that his vision of justice consistently appears in complete line with what benefits President Donald Trump staying in office. A really bad analogy. For starters, Barr this week compared coronavirus stay-at-home orders, which Trump has opposed, to slavery. \u201cYou know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,\u201d Barr said at a Constitution Day celebration put on by Hillsdale College. South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn said that Barr\u2019s comment was \u201cthe most ridiculous, tone-deaf, God-awful thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Brandon Tensley went deep on the painful absurdity of drawing any kind of analogy between forced bondage and government recommendations designed to keep Americans safe from a deadly virus, especially during this time of a general re-examination of the country\u2019s racist history. Trump\u2019s man. But it\u2019s just the latest example of the impression Barr has given that he either agrees with most, if not all, of the things that come out of the President\u2019s mouth or is at least more than willing to humor and enable it. Brooking no dissent. At the same event, Barr said US attorneys lack the political judgment or clout to bring some charges. He referred to them as headhunters seeking glory and as junior level employees. \u201cName one successful organization or institution where the lowest level employees\u2019 decisions are deemed sacrosanct, there aren\u2019t. There aren\u2019t any letting the most junior members set the agenda,\u201d Barr said during his speech. \u201cIt might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency,\u201d the attorney general added. (Montessori kids are clearly the most unruly of the pre-school lot in his mind). Barr\u2019s targets. One problem here is that Barr\u2019s top-down approach always seems to benefit Trump\u2019s buddies and hurt his enemies. He\u2019s considered looked into charges against Portland city officials for the protests that took place in their city around a federal courthouse. His DOJ made an about-face on admitted law-breaking by Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. He exerted influence before the sentencing of convicted felon and Trump buddy Roger Stone. Prosecutors quit in protest. Conversely, the Justice Department gotten involved in the stream of tell-all books condemning Trump in recent months. They tried to revoke release granted to former Trump lawyer and confidant Michael Cohen because of Covid. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Barr. They\u2019ve opened a criminal inquiry into former national security adviser John Bolton. Barr vs. protesters, Trump vs. protesters. While Trump was building his reelection campaign around opposing peaceful protesters in US cities, Barr was helping engineer the military-style crackdown on protesters in Lafayette Park. More recently he\u2019s suggested charging violent protesters with sedition. That\u2019s a conspiracy to overthrow the government. It\u2019s listed alongside treason in US code. He\u2019s pushed the Trump and the Right\u2019s conspiracy theory that Antifa is a threatening cabal. The US national security apparatus is more concerned about right wing extremist groups. Barr adopts the \u201cdeep state\u201d line. During that interview with journalists in Chicago, Barr also pushed Trump\u2019s idea of a \u201cdeep state\u201d of government workers out to undermine him and blamed this supposed deep state for tying Trump to Russia despite all the evidence. Trump thinks Barr is his guy. Why else would he have asked the leader of Ukraine to meet with Barr as part of the effort to discredit the Russia investigation? He\u2019s distinctly refused to say he won\u2019t release the results of that investigation in the lead-up to November. Barr knows he\u2019s not supposed to be directly involved in politics. He\u2019s supposed to be upholding justice for all Americans. He said as much during an interview with Chicago journalists. Then he pushed the President\u2019s alarmist line that if Biden wins the White House, the US would be \u201cirrevocably committed to the socialist path.\u201d What this means for November and beyond. While Barr has described as \u201cbulsh**\u201d the idea that Trump would try to seize power if he lost the election, Barr has also subtly fueled Trump\u2019s argument that mail-in voting is rigged and questioned the flow of Democratic-leaning mail-in votes expected to pour in through the mail system. \u201cSomeone will say the President just won Nevada. \u2018Oh, wait a minute! We just discovered 100,000 ballots! Every vote will be counted!\u2019 Yeah, but we don\u2019t know where these freaking votes came from,\u201d Barr said. Election law professor Richard Hasen writes for CNN that this undermining of election integrity is the most dangerous thing Barr could do. And about the \u201cbullsh**\u201d \u2013 Barr said it\u2019s fear-mongering by Democrats that Trump could reject the election results. But he also, during testimony before the House Judiciary Committee this past summer, did not unequivocally say he\u2019d leave office on January. What he said was: \u201cWell, if the results are clear, I would leave office.\u201d He and Trump sure seem ready to say the results aren\u2019t going to be clear. Trump said Thursday on Twitter the results may never be known. Where will that leave us? When then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in a plane on a tarmac with Bill Clinton in 2016, it fed a persistent conspiracy theory inflaming the Right that the two were in cahoots to bury information about Hillary Clinton. After an inspector general report, it appears it wasn\u2019t much more than a long and ethically inappropriate conversation that Lynch regretted having because it gave a false impression and allowed people to question her independence from her boss, Barack Obama. Barr has done absolutely nothing to express his independence from his boss, even though that\u2019s what his job is supposed to demand. And that\u2019s what he promised when he got it. And that matters not just from a theoretical standpoint. It matters because Barr will still be attorney general after Election Day and at least until January 20, when the next president is due to be inaugurated. It will be up to him to enforce the rule of law during that period, when the long history of peaceful transfers of power in the US may be tested like never before. I get somewhat distracted every time I see a photo of CDC Director Robert Redfield because his Abe Lincoln-style beard makes him look so much like C. Everett Koop, the Reagan-era Surgeon General now lionized for raising awareness about the dangers of smoking, withstanding Reagan administration efforts to crack down on abortion despite his personal opposition to the practice and writing a key government report about AIDS. Koop had celebrity status in the United States in the \u201980s and that gave him the power to tangle with tobacco state senators and withstand White House pressure. His New York Times obituary describes him as insisting that condoms be mentioned in that AIDS report and withstanding smear campaigns from social conservatives. Redfield, who lacks Koops stature and has faced his share of criticism, is also known for his work on AIDS. Back during that condoms debate, he was on the other side, pushing abstinence. His views have changed. But now he\u2019s in the position of withstanding pressure from the White House, as he did this week when he said, contra President Trump, that masks are the top priority to stop the spread of Covid 19. On Instagram today, I posted Getty images of Redfield testifying Wednesday and Koop testifying back in 1998.",

            "article_content": "Following a summer of political activism and frustration around Covid-19, young people say they\u2019re channeling their energy and dissatisfaction with the current political system into voter engagement. But with in-person campus life largely at a halt, they\u2019re facing a new challenge of connecting with their peers from afar. Students at colleges and universities across the country have drawn up new plans for voter engagement and built innovative ways to reach their classmates. Much like other parts of life amid the pandemic, social media and video calls may take the place of tabling in the quad or knocking on doors to get out the vote. This past weekend, a group of college-aged grassroots organizers convened Generation Democracy, an online conference to mobilize young people as voters, volunteers and organizers. Organizers with NextGen America have led virtual drag shows and online rallies via Twitch and even Animal Crossing to engage voters. And a youth-led organization called The GAP Project is working to pair high schoolers and other college-aged students with campaigns across the country by using a quiz and algorithm based off their stances on issues such as climate change, abortion and gun control. And, devoid of in-person interaction, young organizers are focused on alternative modes for peer-to-peer conversations. Bruce Wilson, a senior at Hampton University in Virginia, emphasized the need to engage directly with unenthusiastic voters. This fall, he plans to ignite conversations about the importance of voting and the issues he cares about through phone calls and Instagram DMs. To decide who to call and DM, Wilson says, he conducts short polls and surveys on his social media platforms to gauge his community\u2019s excitement about the election and the political process. He asks questions including, \u201cDid you vote in 2016,\u201d \u201cDo you plan on voting in November\u201d and \u201cIs your favorite candidate still in the race?\u201d Wilson says \u201cconversation and open dialogue\u201d is a \u201cstrong tool that people don\u2019t utilize enough.\u201d He has found that having a conversation with a peer can help them \u201cunderstand the significance of their vote,\u201d he said. This weekend, sessions at the Generation Democracy conference focused on similar tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s social media, so be social,\u201d Rina Welch told participants in a session on using social media to get out the vote, which focused on best practices for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. Welch, 25, is a social media strategist with Blue Future, a political action committee that connects young people to progressive campaigns. She encouraged participants to post using \u201ctangible language\u201d about how and why they\u2019re voting. \u201cEverybody has their platform; that doesn\u2019t matter if you have literally 25 followers or a thousand or more,\u201d Mitchell Rosenberg, the 23-year-old founder of Now Simplified, a short-form media company, said during the same session. Trevor Wild, 22, talked about using TikTok to share his story and how he feels about politics. Wild is a gun violence-prevention activist. Historically, getting students to vote has been difficult and youth voter turnout has been low. They have faced challenges, including barriers to voting access, suppression of young voters and a lack of civic education, which may account for the low turnout, according to an op-ed written by Alan Solomont, dean of Tufts University\u2019s Tisch College of Civic Life, and Dan Glickman, a former US secretary of agriculture who now works at the Aspen Institute. In the past five years, many schools have revamped their on-campus voter-registration and get-out-the-vote initiatives \u2013 a trend that has coincided with a national rise in youth activism and high youth voter turnout. In the 2018 midterm elections, young voters hit the polls at a rate of 36%, according to the Census Bureau. That was a jump up from 20% in the 2014 midterms \u2013 the highest percentage-point increase for any age group, the Census Bureau reported. Many college campuses, including Harvard, Brown and the University of Texas at Austin, reported student voting rates much higher than those of the previous midterm elections, in 2014. Younger Americans do appear to be more likely vote this November than they did four years ago. From late May through August 2020, an average of 56% of 18- to 29-year-olds said they were certain to vote in ABC News/Washington Post polling. During that same period in 2016, it was 50%. For 30- to 39-year-olds, an average of 64% said they were certain to vote in the last three polls. During that same period in 2016, it was 57%. Some voting turnout efforts also are supported by campus administrations or local officials. Ahead of the California primary, 11 Cal State campuses, including Sacramento State and Fresno State, announced they would host voting centers. According to Nathan Dietrich, associate vice president, public affairs and advocacy, at Sacramento State, the on-campus voting center helped turnout in the primary. Dietrich says that more than 1,000 students voted at the site and hundreds of others dropped their ballots off at the vote center on or prior to Election Day. Barring a statewide ban on in-person voting, Sacramento State and Fresno State intend to keep their voting centers open with Covid-19 precautions in November, despite the fact that classes at both schools are operating mostly remotely. According to Lisa Boyles Bell, public information officer at Fresno State, the school has been working closely with the Fresno County elections office and the secretary of state\u2019s office to create a plan that\u2019s safe and responsible for those voting at Fresno State. \u201cWe expect high student voter turnout in November, with students using their vote-by-mail option or the on-campus vote center, whichever is more convenient to them,\u201d said Dietrich of Cal State Sacramento. Brandi Orth, Fresno County clerk and registrar of voters, said she hopes student turnout at the voting center at Fresno State is high again this fall as well. The vast majority of students at Fresno State are from California. Even though students will be social-distancing in November, \u201cI still think they will vote there because it\u2019s familiar,\u201d Orth said. Research from the Center for Information Research on Civic Learning Engagement at Tufts demonstrates that young people believe they can enact change this election cycle. According to a June poll from the center, 79% of young people say Covid-19 helped them realize that politics matter in their everyday lives and 83% currently believe they have the power to change the country. At the same time, as Wilson noted, some young people are skeptical of electoral processes and representation. Some young voters cite that while Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016, Trump still won the presidency. Others say that because of state-level laws that may limit absentee voting, it is harder than it should be for young people to vote. According to Iman Jaroudi, a junior at Yale, \u201cA video teaching you how to vote absentee will not necessarily get you excited to do it.\u201d This past summer, Jaroudi was part of a reading group led by the Yale chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America. Their reading list included \u201cABC\u2019s of Capitalism,\u201d \u201cRacecraft\u201d and \u201cNo Shortcuts,\u201d a book about grassroots organizing. Chatting with peers each week about the themes and topics of their readings has inspired her and other young Democrats and democratic socialists \u201cto get excited and engaged\u201d about voting this November. \u201cHaving frank and honest conversations, getting feedback, finding what resonates, that\u2019s gonna be really important in the fall,\u201d she said. Jaroudi said the readings will influence the way she engages her community in conversations about voting and the need for community and community organizing outside of electoral politics this November. Enthusiastic student voters are looking to cultivate a sense of civic duty and to raise voter participation from their peers by emphasizing the need for change and the ability for votes to matter not just at the federal, but also at the local, level, especially ahead of elections that they say are both important and urgent. Christopher Schiller, a junior and vice president of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s College Republicans chapter, said he thinks that college students want to vote now more than ever. He believes the activism in the streets will translate to the polls in November. \u201cMany of my friends went out and protested, despite [there] being a pandemic going on \u2026 people went out of their way to be involved in the political process,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cEveryone that I know personally will go out and vote,\u201d he believes. Schiller will be working with Penn Republicans this fall to hold virtual voter-registration events and phone banks. Likewise, Harrison Feinman, a junior at Penn from Los Angeles who\u2019s the director of Penn Leads the Vote, is similarly optimistic about voting this fall. He explained that the school\u2019s theme of the year is civic engagement, which he says means the school will be fostering \u201cevery realm of civic engagement, which, of course, includes voting.\u201d This year\u2019s theme demonstrates a commitment from the school to educate its student body on what it means to be an active citizen, Feinman said. Anjitha Nair, a junior at the University of Texas at Austin and a member of TX Votes, said she didn\u2019t return to campus for classes this fall and that she plans to vote in her home county, Collin County, in November. According to Nair, the issue that\u2019s motivating her to vote is a candidate\u2019s vision for economic recovery, including policies to bring manufacturing back and resolve current levels of unemployment, eviction and small business closure in America. From her home in Plano, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, Nair says she\u2019ll be working with TX Votes to create digital content and mobilize its members\u2019 networks of friends. She says she will also use social media to help her own friends and social network register to vote. At Brown, with no first-year students on campus this fall, one organization prepared videos and information with voter-registration and in-person or vote-by-mail materials that were sent to first-year students. Madison Mandell and Kimberly Collins, civic engagement fellows with Brown Votes, are holding virtual office hours for voter registration and questions about in-person voting or voting by mail. They will provide an open forum for voting-related questions on the website. \u201cAnd then, also, our DMs on social media will always be open for, you know, anyone to ask a question,\u201d Mandell said. Harvard Votes Challenge, a program that launched ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, started an initiative called the \u201cPledge to 100%,\u201d asking every on-campus club, team, student group and organization to sign the pledge. According to Kevin Ballen, a junior who\u2019s a co-chair of Harvard Votes Challenge, the pledge commits each organization to talking about voting and ensuring its eligible members register to vote and turn out. Groups participating include sports teams, finals clubs and affinity groups, Ballen said. He said he hopes this energy is sustained in future election cycles. \u201cThere\u2019s so much energy right now, because for the first time in my lifetime, in the lifetime of people in my generation, we\u2019ve had a crisis that demanded our government act and we needed our government,\u201d said Jonathan Schwartz, a student leader with Yale Votes. Like Schiller, Schwartz believes that among protests and the Black Lives Matter movement, people are \u201creally starting to hone their role as actors in a democratic society.\u201d \u201cCombine that on top of the urgency that already surrounded the 2020 election. We have a huge wave of youth engagement, of student engagement, building up over the summer. That\u2019s going to come back to college campuses one way or another in the fall.\u201d CNN\u2019s Harry Enten contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration is pushing to expand its ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, a move that critics say could further restrict health care access around the world. In a move that will please President Donald Trump\u2019s base, the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration published the proposed rule on Monday to extend the \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance\u201d policy, which already encompasses global health grants and cooperative agreements, to apply to contracts. The rule already applies to the State Department, Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense and the US Agency for International Development. The proposed rule \u2013 which now faces a 60-day comment period that ends after Election Day \u2013 marks another appeal by the administration to abortion rights opponents in the run-up to the presidential election. In recent weeks, Trump has highlighted his anti-abortion stance in his judicial nominees, and Vice President Mike Pence has appeared with anti-abortion groups in several swing states. The rule also comes about a month after a State Department review found that the policy as it currently stands has hurt efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs, and has had a significant impact in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on data from 2013 through 2015, global health funding provided through contracts could account for almost 40% of all funding affected by the rule should Monday\u2019s provision expanding the policy take effect, said Jen Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThis is that step that (the administration) had not yet taken,\u201d Kates told CNN. \u201cI think the intent is for the policy to apply to as much global health funding as possible.\u201d Plans for the additional requirement had been underway for some time. In 2017, the Trump administration reinstated the \u201cMexico City Policy\u201d \u2013 which had previously impacted only family planning assistance \u2013 by presidential memorandum and extended it to all applicable US global health funding under the \u201cProtecting Life in Global Health Assistance.\u201d Organizations that continued to promote or perform abortions stood to lose all US health aid under the policy \u2013 affecting more than 1,300 global health projects and an estimated $12 billion in US assistance in 2017-2018, according to the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. The policy was intended to apply to grants, cooperative agreements and contracts from the start. But applying the policy to contracts required the creation of new rules, which the State Department and USAID pursued by 2018. Monica Kerrigan, executive director of Planned Parenthood Global, slammed the proposed rule in a statement Monday. \u201cAs Covid-19 continues to claim lives and devastate communities, the administration is knowingly moving to expand this policy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no excuse for this brazen disregard for people\u2019s health and rights.\u201d There have been restrictions on federal assistance money for abortion since 1973. In 1985, the ban was extended to foreign groups receiving federal aid. That policy has been enforced off and on since, with Democratic administrations traditionally rescinding the policy and Republican administrations reinstating it.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees, a bluntly political move designed to keep conservatives from abandoning him, just as he used his first list in 2016 to entice conservatives to join him. Speaking at the White House, Trump warned in hyperbolic terms of \u201cradical justices\u201d who would silence political speech rights; favor anarchists and rioters; and abolish religious liberties, including by obliterating \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. \u201cOur cherished rights are at risk including the right to life and our great Second Amendment,\u201d said Trump, who opposes abortion rights and gun regulations. Trump has predicted that the next president could fill several seats on the nine-member Supreme Court: \u201cMaybe even five,\u201d he said at a recent New Hampshire appearance, adding, \u201cYou better vote for me.\u201d Trump lists 20 more potential SCOTUS nominees to boost conservative support But his exaggerated claims and the revised list reflect more than the usual campaign crowing. They are a reminder of Trump\u2019s broader attempt to use and control the federal judiciary. His actions undermine the traditional neutrality of the bench. Trump has adopted an us-versus-them approach to judges, a theme familiar to much of his presidency. He expects fidelity from his appointees, and he assumes Democratically appointed judges will automatically rule against him. He reinforces that view with regular tweets, and as he accelerates his criticism of judges, he has generated more conflict and suspicions among judges themselves. \u201cThese horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives,\u201d Trump said on Twitter in June as the Supreme Court was completing its recent session. \u201cWe need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment & everything else. Vote Trump 2020!\u201d The Supreme Court! So hot right now! One of Trump\u2019s new candidates for the court responded on Wednesday with the same crusader spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Roe v. Wade to go,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote on Twitter, referring to the 1973 milestone that made abortion legal nationwide. Trump\u2019s new list includes myriad conservatives, from low-profile US appeals court judges to prominent establishment lawyers to political flamethrowers such as Cotton and fellow GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. Hawley posted a tweet saying he was not interested in becoming a justice and wanted to remain a senator. \u201cI look forward to confirming constitutional conservatives,\u201d added Hawley, who was once a law clerk to Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts and some lower court judges have lamented the lens of politics through which many people, the President included, view today\u2019s judiciary. In November 2018, Roberts rebuked Trump for referring to a judge who ruled against the administration as an \u201cObama judge.\u201d EXCLUSIVE: How Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases But to Trump, he is merely articulating the reality. (He retorted as much to Roberts in the 2018 incident.) Yet, the President may be doing more: he may be generating a self-fulfilling prophecy. He seems determined to produce a Republican-versus-Democrat mindset throughout the third branch, or maybe Trump versus everyone else. \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d he said in a June tweet. And in July, when he saw mixed decisions on his effort to block subpoenas on his tax and other financial records sought: \u201cCourts in the past have given \u2018broad deference\u2019. BUT NOT ME!\u201d His assertions have heightened tensions among judges, as liberal judges see a President constantly challenging the rule of law and conservatives see a presidency continually under attack, including from the judiciary. Trump on Wednesday criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for not issuing a similar list of possible Supreme Court nominees. Biden earlier this year pledged to appoint the first African American woman to the court. EXCLUSIVE: Anger, leaks and tensions at the Supreme Court during the LGBTQ rights case Trump asserted on Wednesday that any Biden nominees would be \u201cso extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance.\u201d In past elections, Republican voters have appeared more concerned than Democrats about the direction the Supreme Court, perhaps because the high court was long regarded as a bastion of liberalism on abortion rights and other social policy dilemmas. But Democratic voters may have greater fears for the future of the bench, especially in light of the fact that the two eldest justices \u2013 87-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 82-year-old Stephen Breyer \u2013 are liberals. A recent CNN poll found that more Biden supporters (47%) called Supreme Court nominations \u201cextremely important\u201d than did Trump supporters (32%). More broadly, the CNN poll found that the Supreme Court was among top issues for all those surveyed, falling just after the economy, health care and foreign policy. Of the people surveyed, 69% rated the Supreme Court as an issue \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important.\u201d EXCLUSIVE: Inside the Supreme Court's internal deliberations over Trump's taxes The Supreme Court was arguably more significant to voters in 2016 because there was a vacancy, caused by the February 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked all Senate action on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, US appeals court judge Merrick Garland.) Scalia was a crucial member of the five-justice right-wing, and if Obama or a Democratic successor had been able to appoint Scalia\u2019s replacement, it would have tipped the Supreme Court over to a liberal majority for the first time in decades. Trump campaigned on appointing justices in the mold of Scalia and in May 2016 took the unprecedented step for any contemporary presidential candidate of revealing a list of 11 possible nominees for the court. Trump added to the list the following September and then again in 2017. Ruth Bader Ginsburg worked through her fifth bout of cancer to help shape a blockbuster Supreme Court term The May 2016 move reassured many establishment Republicans who had been warily watching the unconventional candidate Trump, a former New York real estate developer and reality TV celebrity. Trump\u2019s lists, shaped by the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, were composed mainly of experienced conservatives sitting on US appeals courts and state supreme courts \u2013 jurists who might have made any traditional Republican presidential candidate\u2019s list. And Trump would boast that the Supreme Court was one of the leading reasons for his 2016 victory. Trump has since appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both former US appeals court judges. They have generally sided with the Trump administration, as have the three other Republican appointees on the court currently split between five conservatives and four liberals. Trump referred to that close margin on the Roberts court to point up the need for more conservatives: \u201cIn the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms including religious liberty, free speech and right to keep and bear arms have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court.\u201d While his attention on the court and expanded list will likely appeal to his base, Trump\u2019s rhetoric also reinforces his politicization of the court and recalls his many attacks on individual jurists. Coincidentally, it was in May 2016, just after he revealed his first list, that Trump derided a federal judge in San Diego who was hearing fraud claims against Trump University as a \u201cMexican judge.\u201d Trump\u2019s more routine criticisms, such as against an \u201cObama judge,\u201d are political. Two weeks ago, US Appeals Court Judge Thomas Griffith, a Republican appointee who was about to step down from the DC Circuit, complained about the politicization of the judiciary. An inside look at Brett Kavanaugh's role on the Supreme Court \u201cIn cases that attract public attention, it is common for pundits and politicians to frame their commentary in a way that reduces the judicial process to little more than a skirmish in a partisan battle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe party affiliation of the President who appoints a judge becomes an explanation for the judge\u2019s real reason for the disposition, and the legal reasoning employed is seen as a cover for the exercise of raw political power.\u201d Trump, of course, engages in this pattern from his highly visible perch. As the President finished reading aloud his 20 new names on Wednesday, he struck a campaign chord, declaring: \u201cTogether we will defend our righteous heritage and preserve our magnificent American way of life.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jake Auchincloss, a 32-year-old formerly registered Republican, won a tough nine-way Democratic primary to likely succeed the outgoing Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy. The Marine veteran and Newton city councilor ran as an \u201cObama-Baker\u201d Democrat, referring to the former president and current popular Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, describing himself as someone who could lead during a time of crisis. He beat, among others, Jesse Mermell, a progressive Democrat endorsed by Rep. Ayanna Pressley and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and overcame the opposition of a group affiliated with EMILY\u2019s List, which aims to elect women supportive of abortion rights. Mermell and other top contenders conceded the race after Tuesday\u2019s vote. The seat for the district, which includes parts of the Boston suburbs and southern Massachusetts, became open after Kennedy launched a primary campaign against Democratic Sen. Ed Markey. The senator won on Tuesday by positioning himself as the progressive champion. But the state\u2019s 4th Congressional District went with Auchincloss over more liberal challengers like Mermell, who supports single-payer health care and the Green New Deal. Auchincloss supports a public health care option and other measures to address climate change. He received The Boston Globe\u2019s endorsement after saying he would prioritize \u201cfederal relief for local budgets\u201d to help the state provide education services and improve its infrastructure. The race was marked not only by the top two candidates\u2019 ideological clash but also by the difficulties of voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Debra O\u2019Malley, spokesperson for Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin, told CNN more than 3,000 ballots were not initially counted, which potentially could have changed the outcome of the race. O\u2019Malley said that the majority ballots that were found, from Franklin, went uncounted due to an \u201coversight of the Franklin town clerk.\u201d She said the secretary of state\u2019s office \u201cwill be heavily involved in many towns to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d The other ballots that the secretary\u2019s office found, from Newton and Wellesley, hadn\u2019t been counted because they came from dropboxes where voters were submitted ballots \u201cat the last minute,\u201d according to O\u2019Malley, and which weren\u2019t sent to be counted in time. Massachusetts law was changed to allow votes to be counted up to three days after Election Day in November, but that change didn\u2019t take effect in time for the primary. As a result, the secretary of state\u2019s office secured a court order that allowed those ballots found to be counted after Election Day. O\u2019Malley said that the ballots \u201cdid not change the order of the candidates,\u201d and Auchincloss\u2019 opponents have conceded, but said her office \u201cwill be heavily involved in many towns to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d this fall. In Mermell\u2019s concession on Friday, she congratulated Auchincloss on his victory. Auchincloss thanked her and tweeted that Democrats must unite to defeat Republican Julie Hall in the fall. \u201cWe must rally behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to defeat the Trump agenda and get to work rebuilding this country: its institutions, its confidence, and its commitment to justice,\u201d tweeted Auchincloss on Friday. \u201cThat work starts here at home. There\u2019s much to be done across our district, and it should begin by focusing on an inclusive and equitable economic recovery for all of the Massachusetts Fourth. We must leave no one behind.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adam Levy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Kanye West\u2019s secretive political operation has no shot of landing him a spot in the Oval Office, but he and the Republican operatives propping him up could still wreak havoc in a handful of battleground states come November. \u201cKanye West will not garner enough voters to become president. But he can garner enough voters to determine the outcome of this election,\u201d said Terrance Woodbury, a Democratic pollster and partner at HIT Strategies. Any third-party candidate can pose a risk in a tight election, and strategists say that\u2019s even more true when the candidate comes with name recognition and nationwide fan base. West isn\u2019t holding campaign events or even filing required financial disclosures. He\u2019s keeping his campaign organization under wraps. And aides are focused almost entirely on getting his name onto the ballot. So far, the music mogul has only made the ballot in 10 states, making it mathematically impossible for him to become the next president. But those states include potential battlegrounds like Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race West\u2019s campaign took two blows on Thursday. A judge booted him from the ballot in Virginia, saying the campaign fraudulently or improperly collected signatures. And in Arizona, a judge blocked West from appearing on the ballot. Political operatives on both sides of the aisle said West\u2019s campaign appears to be little more than an effort to skim support from Democratic nominee Joe Biden and boost President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection odds. One source told CNN that GOP operatives believed they had the Trump campaign\u2019s blessing to aid West\u2019s efforts. \u201cI think, unfortunately, he\u2019s being used by these Republicans,\u201d said Quentin James, founder and president of The Collective PAC, which aims to elect more Black candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad and, you know, we wish Kanye the best in getting his mental health under control. But again, this is not what we want to see in politics. We want to see Black voters and their voices heard at the ballot box. Not by voting for Kanye West, who has no shot right to bring forth new ideas to win the White House.\u201d When a reporter from Forbes recently pointed out to West that he has no shot at the Oval Office and appears to be a spoiler candidate, West replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.\u201d Critics said the effort to prop up West\u2019s campaign looks particularly unseemly given West\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The disorder is marked by swings between mania and depression and the rap superstar has said publicly he does not take medication for his illness. \u201cTaking this man who needs help and propping him up for their own good and for their own gain, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said mental health advocate Bassey Ikpi, who is the author of \u201cI\u2019m Telling the Truth But I\u2019m Lying,\u201d and lives with bipolar disorder. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing with Kanye. They\u2019re not considering him a human being. They\u2019re considering him a pawn.\u201d A representative for West did not respond to a list of questions from CNN regarding West\u2019s campaign. West announced he was running for president on July 4 and declared to Forbes he was running as a member of the Birthday Party, \u201cBecause when we win, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s birthday.\u201d His South Carolina campaign kickoff immediately raised concerns about the rapper\u2019s wellbeing. West, who appeared wearing a bullet-proof vest, jumped from topic to topic before he broke down crying while discussing abortion and his family. \u201cRunning for president will not contribute to his wellbeing,\u201d said Katherine Burdick, an associate professor of psychology at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital who has studied bipolar disorder for decades. \u201cIt will put him under an enormous amount of stress regardless of the outcome.\u201d The people who are most successful at treating the illness tend to take medication and pay close attention to changes in their mood, sleep, diet or stress, she said. As mental health advocates have looked on with concern, the West campaign has cobbled together Republican operatives and attorneys \u2013 most of whom refuse to discuss their work with the campaign \u2013 who could help the campaign play catch up. West\u2019s late entry into the presidential fray put the fashion and music mogul well behind in the scramble to get on the ballot, a complicated effort that varies state by state. Half a dozen GOP political operatives said Gregg Keller \u2013 a Republican and a former executive director of the American Conservative Union \u2013 is at the heart of West\u2019s campaign effort and has helped recruit other Republicans across the country to help. Keller, a prolific Tweeter on the twists-and-turns of the campaign\u2019s ballot access efforts, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In a recent Instagram post \u2013 a screenshot with a section of the Vice story reporting Keller\u2019s involvement with the West campaign \u2013 Keller added the caption, \u201cLife is weird.\u201d Mark Jacoby, an executive at a company called Let The Voters Decide, is also helping the West campaign collect signatures in multiple states. Jacoby has previously pleaded guilty to voter registration fraud related to his work for the California Republican Party. A representative for the company said, \u201cThis years-old misdemeanor charge had nothing to do with any political campaign or voter, Let The Voters Decide, voter registrations, elections or any other matter and any ongoing focus on it is misplaced and irresponsible.\u201d Still, the West campaign has been dogged by allegations of improperly or fraudulently obtaining signatures, which led to West being kicked off the Virginia ballot this week. Local GOP operatives are also popping up to aid West in potential battleground states where the singer is aiming to appear on the ballot. In Wisconsin, longtime Republican lawyer Lane Ruhland dropped off West\u2019s paperwork to appear on the ballot, just missing the deadline, according to state election officials. Ruhland is also doing legal work on behalf of the Trump campaign, which prompted a watchdog group to file a complaint about her with the state bar. Ruhland did not respond to a request for comment. The West campaign is still suing to try to get on the ballot in Wisconsin An attorney representing West in the Wisconsin lawsuit, former Minnesota GOP official Erick Kaardal, said, \u201cI\u2019ve been instructed not to comment\u201d when asked how he came to represent West. When asked who instructed him not to comment, he said, \u201cI really can\u2019t comment.\u201d In Colorado, Republican operative Rachel George emailed another GOP strategist asking to help get West on the ballot. \u201cNo, I am not joking, and I realize this is hilarious,\u201d she wrote, according to a copy of the email obtained by Vice News. George did not respond to requests for comment. West\u2019s campaign has also raised suspicion that it\u2019s little more than a spoiler effort in light of the hip hop star\u2019s public support for the President and longtime friendship with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. Back in 2016, West told a crowd that he didn\u2019t vote in the election, but if he had, he \u201cwould have voted for Trump.\u201d He later visited Trump in the White House in 2018, partly to talk about criminal justice reform, which is an issue his wife, Kim Kardashian West, has also worked on closely with the White House. During his Oval Office visit, West told Trump that wearing a MAGA hat made him feel like \u201cSuperman.\u201d This year, as West decided to run for President, he told Forbes, \u201cI am taking the red hat off.\u201d In an interview on the Cannon\u2019s Class podcast, Nick Cannon asked West about rumors that he is in \u201ccahoots\u201d with Republicans and being paid to run in 2020. \u201cBro, can\u2019t nobody pay me,\u201d West responded. \u201cI got more money than Trump.\u201d West\u2019s campaign has so far failed to file its required financial disclosure forms, so it\u2019s not publicly known who is bankrolling his campaign or who his campaign is paying. View 2020 presidential election polling Both the Trump campaign the President have denied playing any role in West\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cKim Kardashian, she\u2019s got a good heart, a very good heart and I like Kanye very much,\u201d Trump said, when asked about West in a press briefing last month. \u201cI have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We\u2019ll see what happens, but I\u2019m not involved.\u201d Last month, Kushner confirmed that he met up with West on a trip to Colorado, and said they\u2019ve been friends for a decade. \u201cWe both happened to be in Colorado and so we got together and had a great discussion about a lot of things,\u201d Kushner said during a White House press briefing last month. \u201cHe has some great ideas for what he\u2019d like to see happen for the country.\u201d In recent years, West has simultaneously courted controversy \u2013 including in his support for Trump \u2013 and openly addressed his diagnosis with bipolar disorder. \u201cS\u2014 could get menacin\u2019, frightenin\u2019, find help / Sometimes I scare myself, myself,\u201d West sings on Yikes from his 2018 album \u201cye.\u201d On the same track, he calls bipolar disorder his \u201csuperpower.\u201d Ikpi, the author who lives with bipolar disorder, said, \u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to say don\u2019t give him attention,\u201d but people need to better understand the illness he\u2019s living with. She added: \u201cThere has to be a conversation about grace. There has to be a conversation about empathy, not just about Kanye West.\u201d After West\u2019s South Carolina campaign stop, West\u2019s wife asked the public for just that. \u201cWe as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental health as a whole,\u201d Kardashian West wrote, \u201chowever we should also give it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it the most.\u201d CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten, Kristen Holmes and Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In 2016, Jerry Falwell Jr. was among those who took the stage at the Republican National Convention to praise Donald Trump. As president of Liberty University, the massive Christian college in Virginia founded by his televangelist father, Falwell had made waves earlier that year when, on the eve of the Iowa caucus he\u2019d endorsed Trump rather than Ted Cruz. Falwell\u2019s early support helped Trump solidify his hold on evangelical Republicans and propel him to the nomination. Four years later, things have changed. Rather than speaking at the RNC, Falwell was instead in the midst of an epic fall from grace \u2013 leaving many Christian conservatives to wonder how the namesake of the Moral Majority founder ended up battling allegations of a sexual affair, needing help from Trump\u2019s disgraced fixer, and forced to resign from the university he built into one of the most financially successful Christian schools in the country. On Monday, the first day of the GOP convention, Falwell announced his intention to resign from Liberty following allegations from a former hotel pool attendant who claims to have had a sexual relationship with Falwell and his wife, on the heels of a controversy about a photo he appeared in that violated Liberty\u2019s own moral code. His fall potentially marks the end of the Falwell family\u2019s prominent role as evangelical political powerbrokers. It also bookends a story that began more than 40 years ago when Falwell\u2019s father, televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr., founded the Moral Majority and began to aggressively organize conservative Christians as a political constituency. The elder Falwell permanently lodged social conservatives and White evangelicals into the GOP coalition to ensure that no Republican could win without their support. After Falwell Sr. died in 2007, Falwell took on his father\u2019s mantle, growing the financially troubled Liberty into a Christian behemoth with an endowment worth more than $1 billion. He also became a gatekeeper for Republican politicians seeking entry into the conservative evangelical world. But the shine wore off as scrutiny of both Falwell\u2019s business practices and his personal life left him ever more isolated in the evangelical world \u2013 and now, politically diminished for Trump, who no longer needs validation within the evangelical community. In the transactional world of politics, Falwell served his purpose for Trump by giving him credibility among the faithful \u2013 a particularly valuable commodity amid the subsequent flurry of headlines about paying for a porn star\u2019s silence and the Access Hollywood tape. Though Falwell\u2019s sins are entirely his own, he is hardly the first, and likely not the last, to exit his relationship with Trump deeply diminished. For some conservative evangelicals, Falwell\u2019s demise offers an opportunity to dispense with the idea that he was ever truly representative of Christian political interests \u2013 and to take measure of an era where the religious right found itself aligned with an administration that, in the minds of many, had lost its claim to any moral high ground with policies that placed immigrant children behind bars and rhetoric that targeted religious minorities. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t understand us,\u201d said Hunter Baker, a professor and dean at the evangelical Union University in Jackson, Tennessee. \u201cFalwell is the perfect kind of person to fill that role because it\u2019s a power equation. I think that Trump understands power.\u201d Falwell\u2019s story parallels the evolution of conservative Christian political players over the past two generations \u2013 from recognizing the untapped opportunity of Christian voters to playing a powerful part of the GOP coalition. More than anyone, Jerry Falwell Sr. can claim responsibility for bringing conservative Christians into the Republican fold. Politically homeless in the 1970s, evangelicals and social conservatives organized under Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority. The broad religious right was a critical part of Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d that also included anti-Communist hawks and fiscal conservatives. That place in the GOP coalition strengthened over the next few decades, with Republicans delivering on agenda items like conservative judges, restrictions on abortion and defense of religious institutions. But social conservatives and evangelical leaders maintained a conditional relationship with the Republican Party. At a closed-door meeting in 1998, the New York Times reported at the time, Focus On the Family founder James Dobson told his fellow social conservatives that if the GOP continued to \u201cbetray\u201d evangelical voters on social issues like homosexuality and sex education funding that he would leave the party and \u201cdo everything I can to take as many people with me as possible.\u201d This sort of credible threat demonstrated the position evangelicals found themselves in the world that Falwell Sr. built: dictating the terms to a party that needed their votes. By the time Falwell Sr. died in 2007, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian named George W. Bush was the Republican president and evangelicals were increasingly ensconced in the party\u2019s power structure. So when Falwell Jr. took over Liberty University, he was inheriting a keen sense of the political power that came with it. A lawyer and college administrator but not a minister like his father, Falwell Jr., is not a liturgical leader among evangelicals. But his growth of Liberty from a small, perpetually cash-strapped Christian school to an evangelical powerhouse with a $1.6 billion endowment and more than 100,000 students (the majority of them online) elevated him as both a gatekeeper and a success story that was attractive to Republican politicians. It was no coincidence that evangelical favorite Ted Cruz launched his candidacy for president in 2015 onstage at Liberty\u2019s convocation, a regular gathering of all students for prayer and fellowship. And it shocked and resonated when, just before the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Falwell gave his endorsement not to Cruz \u2013 the social conservative champion \u2013 but to Trump. It also raised questions about the political goals of evangelical Christians. While some of the agenda items have shifted since the Reagan administration, the religious right has also advocated for higher moral character among elected officials. Falwell made little effort to claim that about Trump, a thrice-married former casino owner who had demonstrated little public interest in the spiritual life. Falwell embraced Trump for reasons that went beyond his Christian identity, praising Trump\u2019s business know-how and called him a \u201ca wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\u201d But there were also some unusual circumstances adjacent to Falwell\u2019s endorsement. In 2015, months before he backed Trump, Falwell spoke with Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen about helping keep some racy \u201cpersonal\u201d photographs from becoming public, Cohen confirmed to CNN this week. And before Trump began his run for the presidency in 2015, Cohen hired a Liberty University employee, John Gauger, to rig online polls in Trump\u2019s favor, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2019. Whatever the reason, the endorsement was mutually beneficial, giving Trump cachet with evangelical Christian voters and Falwell access to power. His association with Trump for the past four years has boosted his own profile and that of Liberty University, where Trump delivered the commencement address in 2017. Meanwhile, Falwell has joined the rotating cast of unofficial outside advisers to the President and has been a regular visitor to the White House, including on Election Night in 2018. His wife Beckie Falwell is on the advisory board for Women for Trump. Together, the Falwells have been the face of politically engaged evangelicalism in the Trump era, making Falwell Jr.\u2019s downfall all the more damaging to conservative Christians. Costi Hinn, a prominent evangelical pastor in Arizona, said it has been \u201cproblematic\u201d to have Falwell represent evangelicals on the political stage, calling him a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d \u201cFor evangelicals, the question is, are the people representing us in the White House of character?\u201d Hinn said. \u201cThese are the days where we all miss Billy Graham, because he had integrity. He had character.\u201d (Graham\u2019s granddaughter, Cissie Graham Lynch, spoke Tuesday at the RNC.) The question for evangelicals concerned both about their position in politics and the future of Christian higher education is: What happens next? The close association of Liberty with Trump, and Falwell\u2019s deeper dive into partisan politics, has rankled several alumni and faculty, some of whom have left the university over it. The growth of the school has also come with criticisms of Liberty\u2019s aggressive approach and how the school is spending its resources. Taking advantage of the explosion in online, for-profit higher education, Liberty boasts an online student body of more than 100,000. That influx of cash has helped the university expand its physical campus in Lynchburg \u2013 benefiting the much smaller 19,000 residential students the school claims. That strategy raises questions, too, about the ethics of Liberty using its non-profit-status to accept federal loans from its online students, only to leave those students with the obligation to pay off the loans. Under Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, federal rules policing for-profit universities have been relaxed. All of it worries others in the field of Christian higher education, who say Falwell\u2019s partisan activities and Liberty\u2019s assertive business model could paint Christian colleges in a bad light. \u201cWe would not want to paint a target on our back by getting more involved in retail politics,\u201d said Baker. \u201cI think [Falwell] caused Liberty to fly too close to the sun.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After a contentious extended Supreme Court term, a majority of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, earning the court its highest rating in over a decade, according to a Gallup Poll released Wednesday. Fifty-eight percent of Americans approve of the job the court is doing, up from 54% last year, according to the poll. But the poll shows dramatic swings in how Democrats and Republicans view the court. Sixty percent of Republicans approved of the court this year, down 13% from 2019. For Democrats, 56% approved, up from just 38% one year ago. Independents, at 57%, also had a positive view of the court. The partisan ratings for the court are the closest across ideological lines that Gallup has recorded since 2000. EXCLUSIVE: How Brett Kavanaugh tried to sidestep abortion and Trump financial docs cases The results come after the court contemplated several hot button issues this term, handing some surprising wins to liberals and infuriating conservatives who wanted and expected much more than they got from the majority conservative bench. President Donald Trump slammed the court several times throughout the term, but got a mixed bag in two cases concerning his bid to shield his financial documents that will likely allow him to not release anything before the election. The court also decided major issues concerning abortion, the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, religious liberty and executive power. Conservatives made strides, particularly in the area of religious liberty and the administrative state. But liberals got a clean win in a landmark case expanding the Civil Rights Act to LGBTQ employees  and at least temporary wins on DACA and abortion. EXCLUSIVE: Anger, leaks and tensions at the Supreme Court during the LGBTQ rights case The high approval rating also comes as the public has had unprecedented access to the inner machinations of the court. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the court streamed oral arguments over the airwaves, allowing Americans to listen to the proceedings live. CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 rejection of President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his finances must be kept secret provided a fitting capstone to a Supreme Court session dominated by Roberts, who balanced his conservative impulses with a quest for institutional respect. The Roberts Court showed it would neither bow to Trump nor fully turn its back on him. Rather, Thursday\u2019s decisions \u2013 both by 7-2 votes \u2013 reflected Roberts\u2019 effort to find unity between the court\u2019s dueling ideological camps. Tellingly, the two decisions were joined by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has complained publicly about Trump withholding his tax returns, as well as by Trump\u2019s two conservative appointees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The holdouts? Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H.W. Bush, and Samuel Alito, appointed by George W. Bush. Roberts was able to avoid the familiar 5-4 conservative-liberal spilt by crafting opinions that laid down fundamental checks on a President yet offered Trump multiple ways to keep fighting subpoenas issued by a Manhattan grand jury and the Democratic-led US House of Representatives. The 1 big thing Donald Trump *still* doesn't get about the Supreme Court The result was a loss for an assertion of presidential power, but a practical win for Trump as he approaches his re-election in November. It is unlikely he would be forced to produce any documents before the election, especially in the cases brought by House committees seeking records from his accountants and banks. And Roberts was a winner of sorts, too, as he found common ground. All eight of his colleagues agreed that a President cannot claim absolute immunity from criminal prosecution, as Trump\u2019s lawyers had asserted in the case against Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance During a lower court hearing, Trump\u2019s lawyer responded to a question about Trump\u2019s infamous Fifth Avenue claim by saying that even if the President shot someone on the avenue in New York, he would not be subject to any state criminal proceeding while in office. In the House disputes, Roberts brought together the four liberal justices and two fellow conservatives to endorse congressional subpoena power \u2013 but with conditions. The House will have to more specifically justify its need for the Trump materials and overcome any burden the request may put on him. Wrote Roberts: \u201c(B)urdens imposed by a congressional subpoena should be carefully scrutinized, for they stem from a rival political branch that has an ongoing relationship with the President and incentives to use subpoenas for institutional advantage.\u201d All told, the decisions culminated an unprecedented term marked by the coronavirus pandemic, national strife and myriad cases involving the Trump agenda. Trump, who had continually railed against the court and individual justices, tweeted Thursday: \u201cThe Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution. I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!\u201d He added, \u201cCourts in the past have given \u2018broad deference\u2019. BUT NOT ME!\u201d Yet the Roberts majority did not leave Trump empty-handed in the documents cases or major disputes this term. The high court gave the Trump administration plenty of what it wanted in other cases \u2013 notably in its decision this week favoring religious employers chafing at federal anti-discrimination law and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that workers\u2019 insurance include contraceptive care. Chief Justice John Roberts was briefly hospitalized in June after a fall And Roberts wrote the court\u2019s 5-4 decision invalidating the leadership structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in an opinion that would bolster presidential authority at the expense of independent agencies. But there were high-profile exceptions, as when Roberts rejected the Trump effort to end an Obama-era program that protects young immigrants who came to the US without documentation. In that dispute over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Roberts joined with the court\u2019s four liberal justices. He also cast the fifth vote with liberals to ensure that a Louisiana abortion regulation on physicians was not revived. At the same time, Roberts continued his pattern of offering neither side an outright victory. He raised the bar for women, physicians and abortion rights advocates who want to challenge abortion regulations in the future. The paired Trump document disputes recalled the high court\u2019s landmark battles over presidential immunity and privilege in the 1974 Richard Nixon Watergate tapes dispute and 1997 Bill Clinton Paula Jones case. In both instances, the court ruled unanimously against the president\u2019s effort to withhold materials and testimony. Justices of the earlier eras closed ranks to deliver a message against the president, without any alternative options as Trump was afforded on Thursday. In United States v. Nixon, the court concluded that fundamental due process and need for evidence in a criminal trial overrode Nixon\u2019s interest in withholding Oval Office tapes connected to the Watergate cover-up. In Clinton v. Jones, the court said Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Jones, who claimed he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. Thursday\u2019s decisions arose from US House committee attempts to obtain financial documents that members say would help them write new ethics legislation. Those subpoenas were directed at Trump\u2019s accountants Mazars USA and two of his financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trumps\u2019 lawyers intervened, arguing that the subpoenas lacked any valid legislative purpose. A separate case emerged from the New York grand jury\u2019s investigation, directed by Manhattan DA Vance pursuing whether Trump, before becoming president directed \u201chush money\u201d to women who claimed to have affairs with him. (Trump has denied the affairs.) In that case, Trump argued that a sitting president is immune from any criminal proceeding while in office. Lower court judges rejected the Trump arguments and upheld all the disputed subpoenas. In considering those cases, successors to the Nixon and Clinton milestones, Chief Justice Roberts probably came as close as possible to unanimity on this court. Only conservative Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. In many other ideological disputes, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have aligned with Thomas and Alito. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh likely were reassured by Roberts\u2019 opinion keeping the door open to the President\u2019s fight against the subpoenas. They also might have had their own interest in demonstrating independence from Trump. This President has often suggested that any Democratic-appointed jurist would rule against him, and, alternatively, that his appointees would always be with him. In 2018, after Trump disparaged a judge who ruled against the administration as an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Roberts, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush, rejoined: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d Trump responded at the time with a string of tweets that began: \u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.\u201d On Thursday, it was a combination of Obama, Clinton, Bush and Trump judges who delivered the verdict.",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood Acting President Alexis McGill Johnson has been named the permanent president of the organization, extending a tenure featuring multiple successful court challenges against abortion restrictions into a pivotal Supreme Court term and election season in the group\u2019s ongoing fight for abortion access. The non-profit organization\u2019s board of directors announced Friday that they had voted to name McGill Johnson the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood and the organization\u2019s political arm, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u201cI am so proud and humbled to have been named the permanent president and CEO,\u201d McGill Johnson said in a statement Friday. \u201cI have learned so much from Planned Parenthood patients, our staff, and our broader movement, and am honored to continue this fight with them, and for them,\u201d she added. \u201cI look forward to the work ahead.\u201d Planned Parenthood Board Chair Aimee Cunningham and Action Fund Board Chair Jennie Rosenthal praised McGill Johnson as having \u201csteered us through one of the most difficult times in our history with unfailing courage, tenacity, and resolve.\u201d McGill Johnson has served in the role in an acting capacity since July, when she replaced former Planned Parenthood President Dr. Leana Wen. The contentious leadership shakeup came following a spring that saw a flurry of Republican-controlled states pass abortion restrictions. Since then, Planned Parenthood has filed or continued multiple lawsuits against state abortion restrictions, including those handed down by Republican governors in Covid-stricken states. Those GOP leaders said the orders were meant to conserve personal protective equipment. The group has seen significant, but not complete, success in the courts. None of the nine so-called gestational bans \u2013 which bar abortions past a certain point in pregnancy \u2013 passed last year have gone into effect after most of them have been blocked by judges, many in challenges backed by Planned Parenthood. But the group opted to drop federal funding in the Title X federal family planning program after an appeals court allowed the Trump administration\u2019s rule blocking program participants from referring patients about abortion services to go into effect. And the coming months will offer no shortage of fronts in the battle over abortion access. In the coming weeks, the Supreme Court is slated to issue a decision concerning a controversial Louisiana abortion access law. Abortion rights supporters are fearful that it could mark the first of a potentially growing number of opportunities for the court\u2019s new conservative majority to offer a blueprint for states to continue to chip away at abortion rights. McGill Johnson told CNN earlier this year that the justices \u201cdon\u2019t have the ability to completely overturn\u201d Roe vs. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, in the Louisiana case but threats to the ruling still loom. \u201cWhat they would be doing is gutting it so much and creating the right template for state legislatures to then follow suit, and then opening up those floodgates,\u201d McGill Johnson said at the time. The election could mark a similar watershed moment for the organization. President Donald Trump has professed his support for tighter abortion restrictions, saying at this year\u2019s annual March for Life rally in Washington that \u201cunborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\u201d Planned Parenthood endorsed presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden earlier this month, with McGill Johnson saying that Biden \u201chas been clear he is \u2019100% for sexual and reproductive health.\u2019 And we are going to hold him to that.\u201d \u201cThis election we have a choice \u2014 between Donald Trump, whose incompetence and disregard for the law are a danger to us all, and Joe Biden, who is committed to fighting for reproductive health and rights for all,\u201d she said at the time.",

And, you know, elections are binary choices. I will say this: I think, I hope, that Biden understands that this moment in history calls for him to be a leader, not a politician,\u201d Fiorina told The Atlantic\u2019s podcast The Ticket in an interview released Thursday. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Pressed whether that meant she would vote for Biden in the general election, Fiorina replied, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not \u2018til November is it? I\u2019m not voting for Trump \u2026 it\u2019s a binary choice. So if faced with a binary choice on a ballot, yes.\u201d Fiorina is one of several Republicans who have recently said they won\u2019t vote for Trump in November. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton said he\u2019ll instead write in a conservative candidate, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that he\u2019ll vote for Biden. Fiorina, an anti-abortion and former US Senate candidate, acknowledged that there are \u201cplenty of policy differences\u201d she has with Biden, but added that she believes the former vice president could \u201cproblem solve\u201d and \u201cfind common ground on a bipartisan basis.\u201d \u201cI am encouraged that Joe Biden is a person of humility and empathy and character. I think he\u2019s demonstrated that through his life,\u201d she said. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO was one of 17 Republican presidential candidates in 2016, becoming the only declared female candidate to seek the GOP nomination. After dropping out, she endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for president, and Cruz, in a late ditch attempt to regain momentum in the race, named Fiorina his running mate. Cruz and Trump had engaged in a contentious and ugly primary fight for the nomination, which culminated with Cruz calling Trump \u201cutterly amoral\u201d and Trump verbally attacking Cruz\u2019s wife. Asked about Cruz\u2019s embrace of Trump now, Fiorina told The Atlantic she thinks it\u2019s \u201call about politics\u201d and that she hasn\u2019t spoken to the US senator in a couple of years. \u201cI don\u2019t excuse it. I don\u2019t. It disappoints me,\u201d she said. View 2020 presidential election polling Fiorina said she voted for Trump in 2016, citing her disapproval of then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2013 even after she had her own appearance attacked by Trump during the primary. Trump dismissed Fiorina\u2019s criticism later Thursday, calling her a \u201cfailed presidential candidate.\u201d \u201cShe lost so badly to me, twice in one campaign, that she should be voting for Joe. No complaints!!!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Fiorina has previously criticized Trump, including during the impeachment inquiry in December, when she told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow, \u201cit is vital that he be impeached\u201d but stopped short of calling for his removal from office. At the time, she did not rule out voting for Trump again in 2020, saying, \u201cit depends who the Democrats put up.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Fiorina was the only woman to seek the GOP nomination in 2016. It has also been updated to include Trump\u2019s response.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 200th judicial nominee was confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday, marking a significant milestone in a presidency that has tilted the federal judiciary in a conservative direction for decades to come. With the confirmation of Judge Cory Wilson to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump has successfully appointed 53 appeals court judges, 143 district court judges, two US Court of International Trade judges and two Supreme Court justices \u2013 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office. By comparison, former President Barack Obama successfully appointed 334 federal judges during his two terms, according to the US Courts. Former President George W. Bush successfully appointed 340 judges during his eight years in office, while former President Bill Clinton put 387 judges on the bench during his two terms. Trump, with the help of a determined McConnell and Senate GOP majority, has significantly reshaped the judiciary during his first term, and the 200th appointment milestone illustrates how lasting his legacy will be, as federal judges serve lifetime appointments and many of Trump\u2019s picks have been young judges who can serve for many years. \u201cJudicial confirmations may be President Trump\u2019s most important legacy,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \u201cThey will shape the nation\u2019s laws on abortion, LGBT rights, voting rights and many other issues long after Trump leaves office.\u201d The 200 confirmations will also be a permanent part of McConnell\u2019s legacy. The Kentucky Republican, who is up for re-election this year, played a key role in changing Senate rules to both speed up the process of confirming judicial nominees eliminating the 60-vote threshold for minority filibusters. In a 52-48 vote on Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Wilson and filled the last currently available appeals court post. Democrats complained about Wilson\u2019s views on voting rights and other issues, but could not stop his confirmation since a simple majority vote is all that\u2019s required for approval. McConnell gloated about the accomplishment before the vote, saying: \u201cOnce we confirm Judge Wilson today, this Senate will have confirmed 200 of President Trump\u2019s nominees to lifetime appointments on the federal bench.\u201d \u201cAnd following number 200, when we depart this chamber today, there will not be a single circuit-court vacancy anywhere in the nation for the first time in at least 40 years,\u201d McConnell said. Earlier this month, the Senate also voted to confirm Justin Walker, a young judge close to McConnell, to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, enraging Democrats who said he\u2019s not qualified. The DC appeals court is considered a breeding ground for future Supreme Court justices, and was the court Kavanaugh served on before Trump appointed him to the Supreme Court.

            "article_content": "The votes are in, but the jury is still out on a handful of New York\u2019s most closely contested races and an unexpectedly competitive Senate primary in Kentucky. If the current leaders in New York hold on after the absentee ballots are counted next week, progressive newcomers will have successfully knocked off longtime Rep. Eliot Engel and replaced retiring Rep. Nita Lowey. Incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney is also locked in a tight race to retain her seat. City Councilman Ruben Diaz Sr. \u2013 a social conservative who opposes abortion and same-sex marriage and has said he would consider voting for President Donald Trump in November \u2013 is trailing in his race, likely sparing Democrats an embarrassing result in the country\u2019s bluest district. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won handily in her first primary as an incumbent, despite a well-funded challenge from her right. But the uncertainty surrounding so many of the night\u2019s races, as voters wait for their mailed-in ballots to be counted, could be a sign of things to come. The coronavirus pandemic is worsening in many regions, and if it doesn\u2019t improve rapidly ahead of the fall, more states could shift toward absentee voting, meaning hundreds of millions of Americans could be facing a similar wait on election night in November. Ocasio-Cortez easily dispatched of her own challenger, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a moderate former cable news host who accused the 30-year-old of forsaking her district for the national stage. The charge didn\u2019t stick and Ocasio-Cortez, who turned her campaign team into a constituent service army during the worst of the coronavirus crisis in New York City, appears poised to cruise to a second term in Congress. Is this the next AOC? With her overwhelming win in Tuesday\u2019s primary, chatter over a potential challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in 2022 is likely to heat up. But in the meantime, Ocasio-Cortez could see her influence in the House Democratic caucus grow if fellow New York progressives Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones, who could be one of the first openly LGBTQ Black members of Congress hold on to their leads in closer, still-undecided races. \u201cWhat you all have shown is that a people\u2019s movement here is not an accident, it is a mandate,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on a livestream Tuesday night. \u201cThis absolutely strengthens us. It\u2019s not just about winning or losing, but so much of this is about how we win. To win with that kind of mandate is transformative, and it tells us that our policy positions are not an accident.\u201d Caruso-Cabrera, who raised about $2 million, didn\u2019t concede or acknowledge Ocasio-Cortez in a late statement, but urged Democrats to come together ahead of the presidential election this fall. \u201cTogether, we must continue the charge forward toward November,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must rally and support the standard bearer of our Democratic party, Joe Biden. Only through unity will we lead the way forward as Democrats and restore integrity to the democratic process.\u201d The disastrous primary days that occurred in Wisconsin and Georgia, where citizens waited in line for hours to try to vote in person during the coronavirus pandemic, did not seem to materialize in Kentucky. The state dramatically reduced the number of polling places from 3,700 to fewer than 200, including just one each in the state\u2019s two largest cities, due to a massive shortages of poll workers. That led to concerns of a suppressed Black vote, including from national figures such as Hillary Clinton, NBA star LeBron James and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate. There were some issues. By midday, lines in Lexington stretched for about an hour, according to local media reports and voters who posted about their wait times on social media. But voting was steady throughout the day in Louisville at the Exposition Center, a sprawling building designed to allow hundreds of people to cast ballots at once and be socially distant from one another. Several voters told CNN they finished the entire voting process in 10 to 15 minutes. A judge extended voting by 30 minutes, allowing more than 100 people who were waiting outside the Expo Center to vote. The doors briefly re-opened after Charles Booker, the Democrat facing Amy McGrath in a closely watched Senate primary there, asked a court to extend voting hours until 9 p.m. ET, citing traffic going to the building. McGrath later tweeted that she too was filing an injunction seeking to keep the polls open in Louisville, but the judge did not issue another order beyond the half hour extension. \u201cWhile all eyes were on Kentucky, we offered the nation a model for success in conducting an election during a pandemic,\u201d said Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Kentuckians for exercising their rights, and proud of the bipartisan coalition who worked with me \u2014 the Governor, State Board of Elections, county clerks, and poll workers \u2014 to make this election both successful and safe.\u201d Madison Cawthorn, a 24-year-old political newcomer, defeated Lynda Bennett, a realtor and President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate, in the North Carolina GOP congressional primary for the seat vacated by the President\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Cawthorn is a real estate investor who was partially paralyzed in a 2014 car crash. He will turn 25 in August, the constitutionally required age to serve in the House. If elected in November, he would become the youngest member in Congress, a title currently held by Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cTonight, the voters of the 11th district of North Carolina said they\u2019re ready for a new generation of leadership in Washington,\u201d Cawthorn said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cYou turned our message of hope, opportunity and freedom into a movement.\u201d Cawthorn\u2019s victory marks the latest surprising victory of a Republican winning his primary despite the preference of the President. Meadows had also endorsed his opponent. In early June, all 73 of Trump\u2019s endorsed candidates in congressional primary and special elections this cycle had won, according to Steve Guest, a Republican Party rapid response director. But then Rep. Denver Riggleman lost a district convention after officiating a gay wedding last year. And on Tuesday, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie overwhelmingly won his primary despite Trump calling to \u201cthrow\u201d the congressman out of the party after he held up a coronavirus aid package in March. Still, Republicans strongly support Trump. When Republican registered voters were asked in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll if they considered themselves to be more of a supporter of Trump or the party, 52% said Trump, while 38% said the party.

            "article_content": "The lines on Election Day in Georgia were so long that state officials announced investigations before the polls even closed, raising fears of what\u2019s to come when the nation votes in November. The primaries of the Peach State, including for competitive House and Senate races, garnered outsized attention among the five states that voted on Tuesday, as poll workers attempted to handle the state\u2019s new voting system that cost more than $100 million. The end result left election observers worried about more than who won. But there were other intriguing developments, particularly next door in South Carolina, where state Rep. Nancy Mace expanded on the gains of other Republican women to win her primary for a House seat. Here are the highlights from Tuesday\u2019s election night: By the end of Election Day, Georgia hadn\u2019t declared the winners of its competitive races. Instead, it declared investigations. The new, $100 million-plus voting system had not worked well, resulting in long lines that brought fears of what would come in November. County officials blamed state officials, who blamed poll workers, who blamed the machines. In two of the most populated counties, Fulton and DeKalb, which encompass Atlanta and some of its suburbs, the finger pointing began well before the polls closed. In the early afternoon, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said the situation in those two counties was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and opened an investigation. He said there would \u201cobviously\u201d be a \u201clearning curve\u201d with the new system but that other counties \u201cwere significantly better prepared to respond so that voters had every opportunity to vote.\u201d Michael Thurmond, the CEO of DeKalb county, shot back that Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, should launch a probe into what happened, saying it was Raffensperger\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to train, prepare, and equip election staff throughout the state to ensure fair and equal access to the ballot box.\u201d \u201cThe Election Day issues relating to the use of state-purchased voting machines represent an attack on the democratic process,\u201d said Thurmond. \u201cThe Secretary of State\u2019s office has alleged these issues resulted from a failure of county leadership. If there was a failure of leadership, it starts where the buck should stop, at the top. The eradication of any \u2018learning curve\u2019 rests squarely at the feet of the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his office.\u201d Ultimately, a dozen hours were not enough for either county and they extended voting at polling places for at least two extra hours. Still, top-tier races in Georgia, including the Democratic primary for Senate, were not called by the time of publication late on Tuesday night. Jon Ossoff was in the lead, though it was unclear as of Tuesday night whether he\u2019d win outright and avoid a runoff. Ahead of the primary elections, Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office were touting their response to handling of the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Raffensperger said that the office had purchased tens of thousands of masks for election workers, mailed nearly 7 million absentee ballot request forms to active Georgia voters. Fewer than 40,000 people typically vote by absentee ballot in Georgia, but already, the state has received more than 1.2 million absentee ballots, a primary participation record. Of those ballots cast, 951,970 were mail-in ballots, according to numbers provided by his office. But on Tuesday, voting rights activists lambasted the state\u2019s efforts to fulfill its citizens\u2019 right to vote. \u201cThe Georgia elections held today were a massive failure,\u201d said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia. \u201cWhether it is incompetence or intentional voter suppression \u2013 the result is the same \u2013 Georgians denied their rights as citizens in this democracy.\u201d Despite the mess, one thing was clear. \u201cLet\u2019s all work, hope and pray that this not be a preview of November,\u201d tweeted Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. State Rep. Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, won her Republican primary in South Carolina, CNN projected Tuesday evening, setting her up against Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham in one of the most competitive House races in the country. Mace is running with the backing of the Club for Growth PAC and is touting her support for President Donald Trump in the Lowcountry district he won in 2016 by over a dozen points. Mace, who lost a Senate primary to Lindsey Graham in 2014, made headlines last year for telling her own story of rape on the state House floor when advocating for a rape and incest exemption in an anti-abortion bill. Mace\u2019s victory continues the success of Republican women in 2020, a group of candidates who have traditionally struggled to win primaries. In the House, 101 representatives are women; only 13 are Republican. But last week, five GOP women won nominations for potentially competitive House races. Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Cunningham\u2019s vote to impeach Trump \u201cproves he will always put his political party before the people of South Carolina.\u201d \u201cNancy Mace is a proven conservative leader for South Carolina and will never put politics over people,\u201d added Emmer. But Democrats are confident that Cunningham will win reelection despite the conservative nature of the district. Rep. Cheri Bustos, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Cunningham \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about the partisan labels that politicians try to use to divide us.\u201d \u201cBy working across the aisle with Republicans, Joe is putting the Lowcountry first in Congress: passing bipartisan legislation to ban offshore drilling, improve veterans\u2019 health benefits and lower the cost of prescription drugs,\u201d said Bustos. \u201cI look forward to sharing a six pack of Lowcountry brews with Joe after South Carolinians re-elect him this November.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kelly Mena, Simone Pathe, Gregory Krieg, Adam Levy, Dianne Gallagher and Paul P. Murphy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden has officially secured the Democratic nomination for president, CNN projected on Saturday, but there\u2019s still plenty of down-ballot primary action this year as some of the most competitive House and Senate races take shape. Five states vote on Tuesday \u2013 Georgia, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina and West Virginia. Georgia and West Virginia moved their primaries from earlier this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Much of the most consequential primary action is in Georgia, where Democrats are hoping to make inroads in 2020 up and down the ballot. But there are trends and candidates to keep an eye on in the other states, too. Here are four things to watch Tuesday night: Georgia has not elected a Democratic senator in 20 years. But Democrats are hopeful that they will defeat two Republican senators in 2020, driven by the divisiveness of President Donald Trump, growth of the Atlanta suburbs and voter expansion efforts led by former state House minority leader and 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams. Georgia Democrats may come one step closer to their goal on Tuesday, when they pick their nominee against Republican Sen. David Perdue, who has acknowledged that the Peach State is in play. The seven Democrats running against him include Jon Ossoff, the CEO of a documentary production company whose failed congressional bid in 2017 was the most expensive House race in history. Ossoff has raised by far the most money among the Democratic candidates and boasts the high-profile endorsement of Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon. He is attempting to avoid a runoff, recently putting $450,000 of his own money into the campaign, while emphasizing his more progressive positions on criminal justice and attacking Perdue for trading stocks during the pandemic. Perdue has responded by pointing out that his advisers made the transactions and that they will no longer trade in individual companies. The other top-tier Democratic candidates include Sarah Riggs Amico, the 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor and executive chair of a trucking company, and Teresa Tomlinson, a former Columbus mayor and attorney who has distinguished herself by supporting the Green New Deal and other progressive priorities. Tomlinson also has some high-profile endorsements from former Sen. Max Cleland and former Ambassador Andrew Young. If none of the candidates receives a majority on Tuesday, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held on August 11. Democrats are also trying to defeat Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat in December after Sen. Johnny Isakson announced his resignation. That election will be decided by an unusual format, in which all of the candidates will be on the same ballot in November. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two finishers will advance to a January runoff. Georgia Democrats also have their sights on a few House seats in the metro Atlanta area, the types of upwardly mobile suburbs and diversifying communities Democrats won across the country to take back the House in 2018. They came up short in Georgia\u2019s 7th District, northeast of Atlanta, which was the closest race in the country in 2018. Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux came about 400 votes shy of unseating GOP Rep. Rob Woodall in a recount. Bordeaux is running again, but Woodall, a five-term congressman, has decided to call it quits. Now that it\u2019s an open-seat race, plenty of other Democrats are running too, as are seven Republicans who think they can keep this territory in GOP hands. Bourdeaux, a Georgia State University professor who also has the backing of Lewis, is the fundraising leader in the entire field. She is facing a handful of Democrats, including state Sen. Zahra Karinshak, state Rep. Brenda Lopez Romero and Nabilah Islam, who was endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezof New York, the progressive firebrand. Among the Republicans running to replace Woodall are emergency room physician Rich McCormick, state Sen. Renee Unterman and former Home Depot executive Lynne Homrich. The conservative Club for Growth PAC has endorsed McCormick, while former Gov. Nathan Deal has endorsed Unterman, the sponsor of the state\u2019s controversial \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill, which aimed to ban abortions as soon as six weeks after pregnancy. Republican women, who have traditionally struggled to win primaries, are having a good year. Five women won GOP nominations for potentially competitive House races in primaries last week, and several more have the chance to win their party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday for what will likely be competitive seats in November. That\u2019s a big deal for a party that currently has only 13 women in the House compared with Democrats\u2019 88. (Republicans are down 10 women from the previous sessions of Congress, when there were 23 in the House.) And at least two of those 13 women aren\u2019t coming back next year because they\u2019ve decided not to seek reelection. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primaries, former GOP Rep. Karen Handel has consolidated support in Georgia\u2019s 6th District for the right to take on freshman Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, who narrowly defeated her in 2018. Handel, who first won the seat in a high-profile 2017 special election, faces a handful of other Republicans on Tuesday, but she\u2019s running with the support of President Donald Trump, Gov. Brian Kemp and most of the state\u2019s GOP congressional delegation. Besides Georgia\u2019s 7th District (see above), another competitive district where a woman could emerge as the GOP nominee on Tuesday is South Carolina\u2019s 1st District, which flipped from red to blue in 2018. Republicans have made freshman Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham a top target in 2020, and two of the four Republicans on Tuesday\u2019s ballot are women. State Rep. Nancy Mace, the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, is running with the backing of the Club for Growth PAC and is touting her support for the President. Mace, who lost a Senate primary to Lindsey Graham in 2014, made headlines last year for telling her own story of rape on the state House floor when advocating for a rape and incest exemption in an anti-abortion bill. Mount Pleasant town councilwoman Kathy Landing is also running \u2013 and, unsurprisingly in a GOP primary in a Trump district \u2013 also trying to closely ally herself with the President. If no one receives a majority, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff later this month. Richard Ojeda burst onto the national scene as a 2018 Democratic House candidate in West Virginia who had voted for Trump. The tough-talking retired Army paratrooper had soured on the President since 2016, though, and he argued that Trump was exploiting coal country. It was a potentially compelling message for a Democrat in Trump country, but it didn\u2019t work in the face of outside money nationalizing the race. A week after his double-digit loss in November 2018, Ojeda announced he was running for the Democratic nomination for president and later resigned his state Senate seat. That didn\u2019t last long \u2013 he ended his presidential campaign in late January 2019. A year later, he announced a bid for the US Senate. Ojeda is facing off against two other Democrats who have run for office before. Paula Jean Swearengin, who challenged Sen. Joe Manchin in the 2018 Democratic primary, has reported raising the most money \u2013 about $359,000. Former South Charleston Mayor Richie Robb, who\u2019s run for governor and the House, has not reported raising any money to the Federal Election Commission. Despite the national support he eventually received for his 2018 House race, Ojeda\u2019s candidacy hasn\u2019t attracted much attention this year. He reported raising only about $31,000 for the race by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on May 20. That\u2019s because whoever wins the Democratic nod will take on GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. The Republican senator isn\u2019t in much danger come November. She won her 2014 election by nearly 30 points, and the state has shifted more Republican since then. Even Manchin \u2013 a well-known former two-term governor \u2013 only narrowly held on to his Senate seat in 2018.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump made his second visit to a religious site in as many days on Tuesday with a visit to the John Paul II National Shrine in Washington alongside first lady Melania Trump. Later Tuesday, Trump will sign an executive order on international religious freedom. His photo-op outside St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church across Lafayette Square from the White House on Monday came only after protesters \u2013 and some members of the church\u2019s clergy \u2013 were pushed back using tear gas and flash bangs. The episode drew sharp criticism from the bishop who oversees the church, who called it a \u201ccharade.\u201d Ahead of the President\u2019s Tuesday visit, Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory released a sharply worded statement criticizing Trump and the shrine for hosting him. \u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,\u201d Gregory said. The first African American archbishop of Washington also added that Saint Pope John Paul II \u201ccertainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrence to silence, scatter, or intimidate \u2026 for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.\u201d The President and first lady\u2019s visit inside the shrine was closed to press, but the two emerged outside for three minutes, where they stood beside a sculpture of Saint Pope John Paul II and a wreath. They stood solemnly, the first lady in sunglasses, and held hands. The President smiled briefly before they moved to stand in front of the sculpture for a moment before returning inside. The President and his political advisers have grown concerned about his standing slipping with religious conservatives, people familiar with the matter say. Trump himself has fixated in his standing with evangelicals throughout his presidency, and has been worried by recent polls showing a slide in confidence related to his handling of coronavirus. The concern among Trump\u2019s political advisers about his standing with voters of faith comes five months before the general election. The presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, is a practicing Catholic who regularly attends Mass and weaves religion into his public life. Biden spoke with black leaders at a church in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday. Trump has not been a frequent church-goer over the course of his presidency. He is visiting the shrine in Washington on Tuesday in part to commemorate the 100th birthday of the late Pope John Paul II, who was born on May 18, 1920. It\u2019s also the 41st anniversary of John Paul II\u2019s historic mass at Victory Square in Warsaw. Melania Trump is the nation\u2019s second Catholic first lady after Jacqueline Kennedy. Trump has made 20 visits to churches since taking office, as well as the Inauguration Day service at St. John\u2019s hours before he was sworn in as President. That includes 11 attendances at church services, four visits to churches after natural disasters, and one political speech at an Evangelicals for Trump coalition event earlier this year. Trump responds to protests with a strongman act While he said he watched live-streams from a selection of megachurches during the coronavirus lockdown, he hasn\u2019t attended an in-person service since he declared houses of worship essential. He attended a Christmas Eve service at a mega church in West Palm Beach, eschewing the traditional stone Episcopal church he typically attends and where he held his third wedding, due to Melania Trump receiving a Woman of Distinction award in February from a college affiliated with the church. Before that, Trump has visited a large evangelical church in McLean, Virginia, coming directly from his golf course and wearing golf shoes. He previously went to St. John\u2019s for a St. Patrick\u2019s Day service and for the traditional inauguration prayer session. He\u2019s attended Easter and Christmas services in Palm Beach. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington called into CNN Monday night to tell Anderson Cooper she was \u201coutraged\u201d by the St. John\u2019s photo op. Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde called the event \u201cantithetical to the teachings of Jesus.\u201d On CNN the next morning, Budde described the event as a \u201ccharade.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear: he did not come to pray. He did not come to express remorse or consolation, he did not come to share the grief or to provide hope to the thousands of young people who are gathered in the park that day,\u201d she said. As Trump was standing in front of the building holding a Bible aloft, he was asked whether it was his family\u2019s Bible. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bible,\u201d he said. Vice President Mike Pence, a devout Christian, wasn\u2019t there. With an eye toward evangelical and white Catholic voters, Trump announced two weeks ago that churches and other places of worship would be deemed \u201cessential\u201d and that he would override governors who sought to prevent their reopening. \u201cThe churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,\u201d Trump said in late May as he was leaving the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. \u201cI want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.\u201d A day later, he did just that by stepping into the White House briefing room and declaring houses of worship essential, using language that appealed directly to evangelicals. \u201cSome governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It\u2019s not right. So, I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,\u201d he said. The move did not have unanimous agreement among his coronavirus task force, one source told CNN. A battle had been raging internally over how detailed the guidance for reopening places of worship should be, with the President\u2019s political advisers arguing the proposals offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were too complex and would slow the opening of churches, possibly hurting Trump\u2019s standing with evangelicals who felt stay-at-home restrictions had limited their religious freedoms. Some advocated for issuing no guidance at all and allowing churches, mosques and other places of worship make their own decisions. After watching coverage on Fox News that criticized how liquor stores and abortion clinics were considered essential services, Trump decided churches should be too \u2013 a move that later drew praise from several evangelical leaders. But some of his health experts expressed concern about how quickly they were moving. \u201cMaybe they can\u2019t go this week if there\u2019s high number of Covid cases,\u201d Dr. Deborah Birx told reporters after the President had left the briefing room that day. \u201cMaybe they wait another week. But there is a way to social distance, like you are here, in places of worship.\u201d Any decision on reopening churches was considered highly sensitive among Trump\u2019s advisers because of its political ramifications. Trump has enjoyed strong support among white Christian groups, even when his behavior seemed opposed to their ideals. But polls over the last few months, including a Pew Research Center survey, have shown a downturn among those groups on how he\u2019s handled the coronavirus outbreak. The Pew poll showed a slide in confidence among white Evangelicals, white Catholics and white non-evangelical Protestants \u2013 though a majority in the three categories still gave Trump high marks for his coronavirus performance. Though he once pushed to reopen the nation in time for Easter Sunday services \u2013 another move viewed as an appeal to religious voters \u2013 Trump himself did not attend church the Sunday after he declared he would override governors who refused to open theirs. Instead, he was seen golfing at his club outside Washington.",

            "article_content": "Concerned about his political prospects and no longer able to rely upon a surging economy, President Donald Trump is using his office to appeal to the voting constituencies that helped propel him there \u2013 and whose support some advisers fear is now slipping. Even as he stokes a reliable base of white male voters using a new ideological divide on face masks and reviving claims of anti-conservative bias on social media, Trump is simultaneously seeking out policies that could help shore up places where support appears to be slipping. If there was any question why Trump was standing in the Rose Garden on Tuesday announcing a new insulin affordability effort directed toward older Americans, he provided an answer four and a half minutes into his speech. \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it,\u201d Trump said after unveiling the plan and musing, off-script, whether he should take insulin himself. (While his annual physical results haven\u2019t been released, he is not known to be diabetic.) \u201cI hope you\u2019re going to remember me just in case the unthinkable happens,\u201d he said later, a rare nod to the possibility he doesn\u2019t win a second term in November. It was a moment of honesty from Trump as he works to bolster his standing after a coronavirus response seen by most Americans as lacking. Trump\u2019s remarks included a claim that his election-year rival Joe Biden couldn\u2019t have achieved the same insulin pricing scheme. A Quinnipiac poll released a week ago showed the former vice president leading Trump by 10 points with registered voters over 65 \u2013 a bloc he won handily in 2016. Those numbers matched a CNN survey from earlier this month. The President\u2019s political advisers have also grown concerned about his standing slipping with religious conservatives. With an eye toward evangelical and white Catholic voters, Trump announced last week that churches and other places of worship would be deemed \u201cessential\u201d and that he would override governors who sought to prevent their reopening. Whether Trump is successful in maintaining \u2013 or in some cases, luring back \u2013 the voters whose support he\u2019ll need to November remains to be seen. Much could depend on whether a resurgence of the virus follows the reopening efforts he\u2019s heralded. For now, though, his strategy seems clear cut \u2013 and he has done little to disguise his political overtures. Even Trump\u2019s decision to forgo a face mask in public seems designed, in part, to appeal to the one demographic who say in polls that masks should not be required for everyone: white men. It\u2019s among that bloc Trump performed best in 2016. As he begins official travel again after months remaining at the White House because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has focused on battlegrounds that he won in 2016 but where some polls now show his support slipping: Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those states\u2019 older populations helped Trump win them four years ago. On Wednesday, he\u2019s due to head to Florida, where in 2016 more than 20% of voters were aged over 65, according to exit polls. Trump won the bloc by 17 points that year \u2013 but recent polls have shown Biden with an edge among Florida seniors. As he stood in the Rose Garden on Tuesday to announce a plan he said would drastically reduce the price of insulin for seniors, Trump had Biden in mind. \u201cNobody has seen anything like this for a long time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t do this \u2013 that, I can tell you.\u201d Speaking on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway denied the event was a tacit attempt to shore up support among older Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s a scream-out-loud expression that the senior citizens in the Democratic Party like Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden have done absolutely nothing for seniors when it comes to insulin and the cost of prescription drugs,\u201d Conway told reporters, adding: \u201cThis president has been working for seniors every day for three years. There\u2019s nothing tacit about a stated-out-loud, loudly and proudly in the Rose Garden.\u201d Still, the message came amid a coronavirus pandemic that has most directly affected older Americans. Trump\u2019s support among the oldest voting bloc has softened during the outbreak, worrying some of his advisers and leading to renewed efforts at the White House to highlight support for seniors. Over the past month, Trump has declared \u201cOlder Americans Month\u201d and sought to improve testing and treatment for residents of nursing homes, where coronavirus has ravaged populations. His vice president has been photographed delivering supplies to nursing homes and mentions senior citizens often in public remarks. The announcement on Tuesday fit within that effort. Trump said most senior Medicare recipients will be able to get prescription plans that cap copay costs for insulin, allowing them access to various types of insulins at no more than a $35 copay for a month\u2019s supply. Senior citizens are among the country\u2019s most reliable voters and voted for Trump by a 7-point margin in 2016. But the President\u2019s response to the coronavirus has some Republicans worried that support among that group could be softening. The CNN poll conducted by SSRS taken earlier this month found 56% of respondents over the age of 65 disapproved of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, compared to 42% who approved. That was the lowest approval of any age group except those between 18 and 34. The same poll showed 57% of registered voters over 65 would vote for Biden if the presidential election were held today, versus 42% who said they would vote for Trump. The falloff has concerned some of Trump\u2019s political advisers, some of whom expressed concern that the President\u2019s performance and sometimes-erratic behavior amid the pandemic has alienated seniors. Those concerns, in part, led to the scuttling of the daily coronavirus briefings that often saw the President going off-piste and lashing out against his perceived enemies. Some of Trump\u2019s advisers have also conceded that Biden \u2013 who served in the Senate for decades before his eight years as vice president \u2013 is a known and more well-liked entity for older voters than Hillary Clinton was when she was Trump\u2019s rival in 2016. Privately, some Republicans have expressed concern that efforts by Trump and his campaign to paint Biden as doddering and senile could backfire among the oldest voting group, according to people familiar with the thinking. In his remarks in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Trump took direct aim at Biden \u2013 but also at the Affordable Care Act, despite surveys showing Obamacare reaching new levels of popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it,\u201d Trump said of the new policy, \u201cbecause Biden is the one that put us into the jam because they didn\u2019t know what they were doing, they were incompetent.\u201d Last week, Trump was delivering another politically tinged message about Democrats and their willingness to reopen churches \u2013 a recent flashpoint amid the nation\u2019s lockdown. \u201cThe churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,\u201d Trump said Thursday as he was leaving the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. \u201cI want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.\u201d A day later, he did just that by stepping into the White House briefing room and declaring houses of worship essential, using language that appealed directly to evangelicals. \u201cSome governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It\u2019s not right. So, I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,\u201d he said. The announcement, much like Trump\u2019s decision to eschew a face mask in public, appeared to be another attempt at seizing the ideological divisions that are emerging amid the pandemic and using them for political advantage. The move did not have unanimous agreement among his coronavirus task force, one source told CNN. A battle had been raging internally over how detailed the guidance for reopening places of worship should be, with the President\u2019s political advisers arguing the proposals offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were too complex and would slow the opening of churches, possibly hurting Trump\u2019s standing with evangelicals who felt stay-at-home restrictions had limited their religious freedoms. Some advocated for issuing no guidance at all and allowing churches, mosques and other places of worship make their own decisions. After watching coverage on Fox News that criticized how liquor stores and abortion clinics were considered essential services, Trump decided churches should be too \u2013 a move that later drew praise from several evangelical leaders. But some of his health experts expressed concern about how quickly they were moving. \u201cMaybe they can\u2019t go this week if there\u2019s high number of Covid cases,\u201d Dr. Deborah Birx told reporters after the President had left the briefing room that day. \u201cMaybe they wait another week. But there is a way to social distance, like you are here, in places of worship.\u201d Any decision on reopening churches was considered highly sensitive among Trump\u2019s advisers because of its political ramifications. Trump has enjoyed strong support among white Christian groups, even when his behavior seemed opposed to their ideals. But polls over the last few months, including a Pew Research Center survey, have shown a downturn among those groups in how he\u2019s handled the coronavirus outbreak. The Pew poll showed a slide in confidence among white Evangelicals, white Catholics and white non-evangelical Protestants \u2013 though a majority in the three categories still gave Trump high marks for his coronavirus performance. Though he once pushed to reopen the nation in time for Easter Sunday services \u2013 another move viewed as an appeal to religious voters \u2013 Trump himself did not attend church the Sunday after he declared he would override governors who refused to open theirs. Instead, he was seen golfing at his club outside Washington.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump made another play to his base Friday, declaring churches and houses of worship \u201cessential\u201d and sharply warning the nation\u2019s governors that he would \u201coverride\u201d any actions they take that interfere with the resumption of religious services. It was a move meant to shore up the support of his core supporters at a time when Trump\u2019s reelection prospects look uncertain in the midst of declining approval of his handling of the virus and the economic meltdown. Adding fuel to the latest controversy on the right \u2013 just as he did when he supported protesters at state capitols who rebelled against their states\u2019 lockdowns \u2013 Trump tried to assert authority he does not have as part of his relentless push for normalcy. His comments came as the nation headed into Memorial Day weekend, a time when health experts worry that Americans\u2019 vigilance will give way to complacency with the potential for crowded beaches, pools, parks, holiday barbecues \u2013 and now churches \u2013 across the country. An updated predictions model from the PolicyLab at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia this week forecasts that Miami and parts of Alabama, Tennessee and Texas will see rapid surges in new cases. Neither the President nor his press secretary explained Friday how he plans to follow through on his threat to governors, which he issued shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released voluntary recommendations for religious institutions. But, like his decision not to wear a mask during his tour of a Michigan Ford plant on Thursday, Trump was offering fighting words to his faithful at a time when the public is increasingly skeptical of his handling of the pandemic. A Fox News poll this week showed Trump\u2019s overall approval rating has fallen to 44%, down from 49% in April. And in a new ABC/Ipsos poll, only 39% of Americans approved of the President\u2019s handling of the crisis. Still, Trump\u2019s remarks Friday were threaded with his impatience for the cautionary warnings of the scientists and medical experts within his own administration, who are worried about a resurgence of coronavirus cases and have highlighted the risks of large gatherings (which many religious services could entail). Throughout the week, he has courted his evangelical supporters with his charge that governors are treating churches unfairly and his insistence that he wants to \u201cget the churches open.\u201d Trump said Friday that some governors have \u201cdeemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential,\u201d but have left out churches and other houses of worship. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. So I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,\u201d he said during a brief statement at the White House. \u201cI call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there\u2019s any question, they\u2019re going to have to call me, but they\u2019re not going to be successful in that call,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors. In America we need more prayer, not less,\u201d he said, taking no questions from reporters. As his general election campaign with former Vice President Joe Biden heats up, Trump has increasingly invoked America\u2019s culture wars. During a \u201cRolling to Remember\u201d ceremony earlier on Friday to honor the nation\u2019s veterans, prisoners of war and those missing in action \u2013 where he spoke to bikers who then rode two laps around the White House driveway \u2013 Trump noted his political support from bikers. \u201cAlways there, the bikers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do I have? 98%? 95? We\u2019re trying to find who are the 3% or the 2%. We\u2019re looking for them, right?\u201d \u201cNovember 3rd is a big day,\u201d Trump said, referring to the November election after they lapped the South Lawn Drive. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to destroy this country. We\u2019re going to make it bigger, better, greater than ever before.\u201d Though the Memorial Day weekend traditionally kicks off summer, this year\u2019s holiday will be anything but normal with many governors, mayors and local officials calling on their states\u2019 residents to continue social distancing, wear masks and stay as close to home as possible. Speaking from the briefing room podium later on Friday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the administration\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, tempered some of Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for reopening \u2013 emphasizing both the social distancing guidelines that churches should adhere to in order to reopen as well as the safety precautions Americans must take to enjoy their favorite pastimes this weekend. In encouraging news, Birx noted that 42 states now have less a less than 10% positivity rate of cases as a rolling seven-day average. But she noted that Maryland, the District of Columbia and Virginia are still the top states with high numbers of cases, followed by Nebraska, Illinois and Minnesota. \u201cThere is still significant virus circulating here,\u201d she said of the Washington area.   Birx also highlighted the top metropolitan areas where the rate of positive cases has stalled or increased as places where Americans should be especially cautious this weekend. The DC metro area topped that list, followed by Baltimore, Chicago and Minneapolis. (All of the others were below the 10% threshold, which Birx said, showed \u201cgreat progress.\u201d) Despite the encouraging news from Birx about the decline in the rate of positive cases, the holiday weekend could also mark another grim moment in the pandemic as the number of deaths in the US approached 100,000. \u201cWe think we\u2019re going to hit the milestone of 100,000 deaths over the four-day weekend,\u201d said Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which has produced one of the most influential coronavirus models. Looking ahead to the holiday weekend, Birx said Americans could get outside with a long list of caveats. Some Americans could play golf, she said, for example, if they are \u201cvery careful\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t touch the flags.\u201d She suggested playing tennis with \u201cmarked balls\u201d and just one other person so \u201cyou\u2019re only touching your ball.\u201d This weekend, if Americans want to do some kind of social gathering, \u201cit\u2019s very important to maintain that six feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance cannot be maintained,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe are asking continuously for you all to be outside, to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend; to play golf; to hike as Dr. (Anthony) Fauci said; to play tennis with marked balls \u2013 and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with; and even consider sharing socially distanced space as long as you have utensils that belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately,\u201d Birx said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to think through. I know you can do this. I know the American people can do it.\u201d When asked about Trump\u2019s declaration that churches and houses of worship should reopen, Birx said faith community leaders should be in touch with their local health departments to check the number of new cases in their zip codes, so they can communicate the risks to congregants. \u201cCertainly people that have significant co-morbidities, we want them protected. I know those houses of worship want to protect them,\u201d Birx said. \u201cSo really ensuring that \u2013 maybe they can\u2019t go this week if there\u2019s high number of Covid cases. Maybe they wait another week, but there is a way to social distance like you are here,\u201d she said, gesturing to the reporters who were spaced several seats apart in the White House briefing room, \u201cin places of worship.\u201d Though Baltimore is one of the areas of concern for public health officials like Birx, Trump and first lady Melania Trump plan to travel to Fort McHenry in Baltimore on Monday to commemorate Memorial Day. They will do so in spite of a plea from Baltimore\u2019s Mayor Bernard \u201cJack\u201d Young who said the trip will send the wrong message at a time when he is asking the city\u2019s residents not to travel. \u201cI\u2019m asking the President to rethink his trip. It sends a bad, bad message to the citizens of Baltimore because I\u2019m asking them to stay home and only come out for essential reasons,\u201d Young told CNN\u2019s John King. \u201cI just want him to set the example for the rest of the country and not do this trip, because it\u2019s not essential.\u201d White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere responded to earlier criticism from Young by stating that \u201cthe brave men and women who have preserved our freedoms for generations did not stay home and the President will not either as he honors their sacrifice by visiting such a historic landmark in our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts rebuffed legal arguments on Tuesday that would totally shield President Donald Trump from subpoenas yet voiced enough skepticism of Trump\u2019s challengers to suggest orders for his financial records would not actually be delivered anytime soon. That could mean that Trump loses to some degree at the Supreme Court but actually wins. For instance, while the ability of the Congress and a state grand jury to subpoena a President could be upheld, future proceedings could further delay release of Trump\u2019s tax returns and other financial documents, perhaps past this November\u2019s election. Such a prospect emerged through the questioning of Roberts, the conservative who sits in the middle of this ideologically divided bench. He is likely to control decisions in the separation-of-powers disputes that recall landmark cases dating to the Watergate era and that raise new political challenges in today\u2019s polarized Washington. If the 65-year-old chief hews to his recent pattern, he will rule as narrowly as possible and try to avoid a decision from the five Republican-appointed conservatives and four Democratic-appointed liberals that appears blatantly political in the American mind. Takeaways from the historic Supreme Court arguments over Trump's finance and tax records Earlier this year, Roberts navigated another Trump minefield as he presided over the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial. The chief justice declined to intervene in any substantive way, spurning requests by Democratic senators to ensure witness testimony. Trump was acquitted in February of charges tied to his alleged conditioning of security aid to Ukraine on that country\u2019s investigation of US Democrats. On the bench, Roberts has built a sturdy conservative record, particularly on dilemmas of race, religion, guns and campaign finance. He authored a 2013 decision that curtailed the scope of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, lifting a requirement that had forced certain localities with a history of discrimination, mostly in the South, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral rules. He has yet to vote to strike down an abortion regulation. Still, in two highly charged cases he moved left, most notably in 2012 when he cast the decisive vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act and last year when he provided the fifth vote to keep a question regarding citizenship status off the 2020 census. Even as he may be less predictable in these rocky times, Roberts is bound to want to protect the office of the presidency, confronted by investigations in the House of Representatives and scrutiny from a New York grand jury. Roberts cut his teeth in Washington as a lawyer in the Ronald Reagan White House and has long favored strong executive power and prerogatives. Regarding the grand jury subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax documents, Roberts worried about presidential distractions. READ: Supreme Court arguments in Trump's attempt to block House and New York subpoenas \u201cIs there supposed to be a hearing where he says: \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ve got this pandemic thing, you know, China is causing all sorts of trouble?\u2019\u201d Roberts asked. \u201cYou know,\u201d he added, \u201cmost Presidents throughout their term have a pretty long to-do list.\u201d Roberts separated himself from the four liberals who leaned heavily on rulings against President Richard Nixon in 1974 and President Bill Clinton in 1997. Instead of focusing on potential distractions for a president, liberal justices voiced concerns about holding a president accountable. \u201cIn the grand jury context,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed, \u201cthe public has a right to every man\u2019s evidence.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan added, \u201ca president isn\u2019t above the law.\u201d Leading off the questioning in Tuesday\u2019s telephonic hearings, Roberts suggested a president could not be absolutely protected from any House subpoena for his personal records, and he separately derided the Trump claim of immunity from any criminal investigation as \u201cno circumstances, no how.\u201d Supreme Court debates Trump's ability to keep financial information and taxes secret Yet Roberts raised concerns about a president having to answer to potentially hundreds of state prosecutors nationwide and suggested he was inclined toward a tough test for any enforcement of a subpoena in a state criminal proceeding. He also drew a line between the Trump case and the Supreme Court\u2019s 1997 Clinton v. Jones decision that subjected Clinton to a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who claimed he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. Roberts said a criminal case could constitute a greater distraction on a president, keeping him from his constitutional duties. Two of Tuesday\u2019s cases flow from US House committee efforts to obtain financial documents that members say would help them write new ethics legislation. The subpoenas were directed at Trump\u2019s accountants Mazars USA and two of his financial institutions, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Trump\u2019s lawyers intervened to block the subpoenas, rejecting the contention of a valid legislative purpose. The third case emerges from a New York grand jury\u2019s investigation and concerns whether \u2013 as Trump argues \u2013 a sitting president can be immune from any criminal proceeding while in office. In that case, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is pursuing whether Trump, before he became president, directed \u201chush money\u201d to women who claimed to have affairs with him. (Trump has denied the affairs.) Lower court judges upheld all the disputed subpoenas. In separate questioning, Roberts voiced sharp doubt for the position advanced by House counsel Douglas Letter, who said the court should defer to Congress\u2019 determinations of the subpoenas necessary for its legislative mission. The chief justice worried that a standard linked broadly to legislative efforts would be \u201climitless\u201d and expose a president to all manner of requests. \u201cCould you give me a plausible example of a subject that you think is beyond any legislation that Congress could write?\u201d Roberts asked. When Letter conceded the breadth of Congress\u2019 legislative authority, Roberts rejoined, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting, that your test is really not much of a test. It\u2019s not a limitation. And it doesn\u2019t seem in any way to take account of the fact they were talking about a coordinate branch of government, the executive branch.\u201d Supreme Court justices are behaving nicely on the phone. It may impact who wins Justice Samuel Alito, a fellow conservative, followed up with Letter, emphasizing that a president could be vulnerable to a barrage of subpoena requests designed mainly to harass a political opponent. \u201cYou were not able to give the chief justice even one example of a subpoena that would not be pertinent to some conceivable legislative purpose, were you?\u201d Alito said. When Letter rejoined that Congress indeed has \u201cextremely broad\u201d authority to legislate, Alito insisted, \u201cWell, so the end result is that there is no protection whatsoever in your view.\u201d Roberts appeared opened to a standard advanced by the Justice Department, which is siding with Trump but shunning the far-reaching arguments of his personal lawyers that would practically close the door on any subpoenas for personal documents. The Justice Department test would allow congressional subpoenas of personal documents but require that the legislative purpose asserted be particularly detailed and pertinent to documents sought. Liberals pull no punches against Trump's lawyers, but it may not be enough In the grand jury case, Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued that he deserves \u201ctemporary presidential immunity\u201d from any criminal process while in office. Perhaps the most revealing Roberts\u2019 comments surfaced at the beginning of the three-and-one-half hour session. Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge stressed the constraints on Congress to order the release of a president\u2019s personal papers. \u201cI think it is very hard to imagine that the House is ever going to have the power, pursuant to its legislative powers, to subpoena the records of the President,\u201d Strawbridge insisted. But Roberts pressed about the remote possibility of a case that could be tested in federal courts to see if within bounds. Strawbridge acknowledged the possibility and Roberts seized on it. He said it appeared that the House would have \u201csome power,\u201d and then Roberts said he understood that the House would \u201cconcede there is some limit to its authority.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas has found his moment \u201cSo,\u201d Roberts declared, \u201cit sounds like at the end of the day this is just another case where the courts are balancing the competing interests on either side.\u201d That notion, or aspiration, may reflect Roberts\u2019 mindset as he looks ahead to forging a consensus among the Supreme Court nine. The cautious, calculating chief would be aware that the Nixon and Clinton landmark cases were decided unanimously as justices set aside their political and ideological differences. If there is a way turn the matter into \u201cjust another case\u201d and avoid a 5-4 resolution, Roberts would no doubt grasp it.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will hear two blockbuster cases concerning President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to shield his financial records on May 12. The cases were originally set to be heard in late March and early April but were postponed due to health concerns related to the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, the justices announced that instead of holding oral arguments for cases in their august courtroom they would participate remotely by phone and allow the public to listen in real time. The justices have never allowed the release of live audio of their proceedings. The court has yet to release any details on how exactly the oral arguments will play out, and whether they will depart from their normal protocols given that they won\u2019t actually be able to see the lawyers or even their own colleagues. No justices will be in the courtroom and there will be no on-camera component, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said earlier in the week. The 10 cases will be heard May 4-6 and May 11-13. It is also unclear if the court will keep to its usual end of June deadline to release all opinions. The cases involving Trump\u2019s financial documents concern whether the US House of Representatives and a New York prosecutor can subpoena the President\u2019s longtime accounting firm and banks for his records, two monumental disputes concerning separation of powers and Trump\u2019s broad claims of immunity. Two other major issues are on the docket for next month. The Electoral College will be debated in a case involving so-called faithless electors who voted or attempted to vote for candidates other than the ones who won their states \u2013 Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2013 in the 2016 election. Most states currently require some kind of a pledge from an elector to vote for the party\u2019s candidate who won the popular vote in the state. Overall, 10 of the 538 presidential electors in 2016 voted or attempted to vote for someone other than their pledged candidate. That will be heard on May 13. On May 6, the justices will hear a case called Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania concerning the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to weaken the \u201ccontraceptive mandate,\u201d the Affordable Care Act\u2019s long-controversial requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover birth control as a preventive service. In 2018, the Trump administration expanded those exemptions to cover other entities with sincere religious or moral objections. The new rules were immediately challenged by Pennsylvania and other states, as well as by the Little Sisters of the Poor religious order. Roughly half of oral arguments the court was scheduled to hear in March and April will now be postponed until the fall term, lawyers for those cases were told last Monday. Those issues involve a copyright case between Google and Oracle and a case concerning the statute of limitations for rape in the military. In addition to the oral arguments, the justices are still scheduled to release opinions for all the cases that have been argued so far this term. They include blockbuster issues concerning LGBT rights, abortion, the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program and the 2nd Amendment.",

            "article_content": "Until Monday night, the Supreme Court had been moving gingerly, sitting on a tinderbox of blockbuster cases and carefully navigating the new Covid-19 world. All that changed when the court issued its first order related to the pandemic after a long day of ricocheting legal briefs concerning Wisconsin\u2019s pending primary. Instead of a quiet compromise in the age of coronavirus, the court split 5-4 along ideological lines, in a stinging loss for Democrats and a signal that between now and November the Supreme Court\u2019s path may not be smooth as the pandemic continues to cripple sectors of the country and voting disputes multiply. The majority opinion was unsigned, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg penned a fiery dissent for the liberals, saying at one point the reasoning of her conservative colleagues \u201cboggles\u201d the mind. At issue Monday was a request to the justices to review a lower court ruling that extended Wisconsin\u2019s absentee voting deadlines in part because requests for absentee ballots were exploding and voters expressed fears of contamination and spreading the virus if they had to vote in person. Republicans asked the justices to put that ruling on hold, while Democrats said they feared a ruling against them would disenfranchise voters and risk public health. Wisconsin primary set to go ahead Tuesday after courts block attempts to delay voting due to coronavirus In an unsigned opinion, the Court\u2019s five conservatives saw the case as a \u201cnarrow\u201d dispute on a \u201ctechnical question.\u201d They stressed court precedent that discourages the changing of election rules so close to an election. \u201cThis court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election,\u201d they wrote. They noted the lower court had given the Democratic plaintiffs more than they had even asked for. \u201cEven in an ordinary election,\u201d the majority reasoned, voters requesting absentee ballots at the deadline will usually receive their ballots on the day before or day of the election. For the majority, the Democrats \u201cput forward no probative evidence in the District Court that these voters here would be in a substantially different position from late-requesting voters in other Wisconsin elections.\u201d It was that line of thinking that fired up the 87-year-old Ginsburg, who has been practicing social distancing but continuing her workout routine at the high court even if the building is closed to the public. Joined by her liberal colleagues, she blasted not only the majority\u2019s reasoning, but the way her colleagues framed the dispute. \u201cThe court\u2019s suggestion that the current situation is not \u2018substantially different\u2019 from an \u2018ordinary election\u2019 boggles the mind,\u201d she wrote. Unlike the majority, Ginsburg focused on the virus and the fact that the state had 1,500 confirmed cases and 24 deaths \u201cwith evidence of increasing community spread.\u201d Because gathering at polling places now poses \u201cdire health risks,\u201d an unprecedented number of Wisconsin voters were turning to absentee voting. \u201cWhile I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the Court\u2019s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement,\u201d she wrote. How coronavirus is deepening American inequality While the majority cited Supreme Court precedent meant to stop voter confusion, Ginsburg wrote about an unprecedented global health crisis. She said that the concerns raised by the court and advanced by the Republican National Committee \u201cpale in comparison to the risk that tens of thousands of voters will be disenfranchised.\u201d And although she didn\u2019t talk about other potential cases \u2013 for instance the move by several conservative states to restrict abortion during the pandemic in order to preserve medical supplies \u2013 she ended her opinion with a possible look forward. The case was about constitutional rights \u201cand in this most extraordinary time, the health of the Nation.\u201d Her closing differed in every way from the majority, hinting of more similar disputes to come. \u201cThe court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of COVID-19 are appropriate\u201d the majority opinion said. \u201cThat point cannot be stressed enough.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court said on Friday that it will postpone the remaining two weeks of oral arguments that were set to begin on April 20 and it is considering rescheduling some of the 20 or so cases that it has had to put off so far in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The delayed cases include arguments scheduled for this week on attempts by Democrats to obtain President Donald Trump\u2019s financial records. \u201cThe Court will consider rescheduling some cases from the March and April sessions before the end of the Term, if circumstances permit in light of public health and safety guidance at that time,\u201d Kathy Arberg, a court spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cThe Court will consider a range of scheduling options and other alternatives if arguments cannot be held in the Courtroom before the end of the Term.\u201d Delay in Trump's financial documents cases clouds House power on investigations Regarding oral arguments, Arberg did not specify which of the postponed cases might still be argued this term. Some of the cases are more time sensitive than others, including two concerning Trump\u2019s bid to shield his financial documents from release. Another case that might be under consideration concerns so called faithless electors \u2013 something the justices may wish to decide before the next election. The court was also set to hear a copyright dispute between Google and Oracle and a religious liberty case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor. According to the statement the justices will release opinions for all the cases that have been argued so far this term. They include blockbuster issues concerning LGBT rights, abortion, the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program and the 2nd Amendment. So far the court is already behind on its schedule. According to Adam Feldman, writing for Scotusblog, \u201cthrough March of this term, the court has decided fewer cases by signed opinion than it has since at least before the Spanish flu closed the court\u2019s doors in 1918.\u201d Arberg said that while the court remains open for official business \u201cmost Court personnel are teleworking.\u201d Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, blasted the delay. \u201cThis is getting ridiculous. If the Supreme Court can conduct its weekly conferences remotely, which it has been doing for weeks, it can conduct its remaining arguments remotely and allow the public to listen in,\u201d Roth said in a statement. The Supreme Court has resisted changes to its traditions, including in-person oral arguments, and any efforts to allow oral arguments to be televised. But earlier Friday, the judicial conference announced that the public and the media will be able to access certain criminal proceedings conducted in federal court via teleconference or video conference during the coronavirus crisis. The order only pertains to district and appellate courts and not the Supreme Court. Arberg has not specified if the court would allow any kind of live audio or teleconferencing of its arguments. This story has been updated with additional details of the Court\u2019s action. CORRECTION: This article has been corrected to accurately describe the Google and Oracle dispute.",

            "article_content": "Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski\u2019s primary loss earlier this week may soon mean there\u2019s less than a handful of Democrats left in the House who sometimes vote against abortion rights. And it\u2019s not a sure bet all of them will survive the November elections, raising the possibility that the Democratic caucus could soon be almost exclusively pro abortion rights. And while that would put the caucus in sync with the Democratic Party\u2019s official platform on abortion, some Democrats fear that the loss of those anti abortion rights members might not bode well for Democrats\u2019 ability to hold onto seats \u2014 and make inroads \u2014 in redder parts of the country. \u201cWhy is it important? We have to keep our majority,\u201d said Democratic strategist Dave Heller, who worked for Lipinski and has consulted for many other Democrats who oppose abortion rights. Illinois\u2019 3rd District, which Hillary Clinton won by 15 points in 2016, isn\u2019t at risk of falling into GOP hands. But that\u2019s not the case for Minnesota\u2019s 7th District, where House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson \u2014 perhaps the staunchest anti abortion Democrat in the House \u2014 is running for a 16th term. His district voted for President Donald Trump by a bigger margin than any other represented by a Democrat. That makes Peterson among the most endangered Democrats in 2020. Classifying lawmakers as either supportive or opposed to abortion rights isn\u2019t black and white \u2014 it depends which legislation or action is being used as a litmus test. But there\u2019s no question that the number of Democrats who vote against abortion rights has declined significantly over the last decade. During negotiations over the Affordable Care Act, 64 House Democrats voted for an amendment that would have prohibited women who receive federal insurance subsidies from buying abortion coverage. Most of those Democrats are either no longer in Congress or now vote in support of abortion rights. There are no Democratic women in the House who oppose abortion rights. In the 116th Congress, just two House Democrats co-sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks: Lipinski and Peterson. The same two lawmakers were the only Democrats to sign onto a brief submitted by 200 Republicans earlier this year urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Peterson has the highest score from the National Right to Life \u2013 56% \u2013 although not all of the votes the anti abortion rights group scores are explicitly about abortion. Lipinski has a 42% score. Several other Democrats have sided with National Right to Life in 2019 and 2020 enough to earn them double-digit scores, but only one of them could be in trouble come November. Utah Rep. Ben McAdams has a 42% score. Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, who has a 27% score, just survived his biggest electoral hurdle \u2014 a well-financed primary challenge from his left. He isn\u2019t in electoral danger come November. Clinton carried his district by 20 points in 2016. The two Democrats who vote against abortion rights, to varying degrees, and could be in trouble in the fall are Peterson and McAdams. McAdams, the former mayor of Salt Lake County, is a freshman who unseated GOP Rep. Mia Love in 2018. \u201cI support the teachings of my LDS faith that oppose abortion except in cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother\u2019s life and in certain other rare circumstances. I support the Hyde Amendment prohibiting the use of tax dollars to fund abortion, with certain exceptions,\u201d McAdams said in a statement Friday. \u201cPoliticians are the last people who should be making decisions about abortions. Ultimately, decisions about terminating a pregnancy should made by a woman in consultation with her physician and others whose counsel she trusts like family and faith counselors,\u201d he added. McAdams represents a district Trump won by nearly 7 points in 2016, which makes him a top Republican target. His strongest challenger, however, recently dropped out of the race. State Sen. Dan Hemmert, a former aide to Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, said he\u2019d reevaluated his ability to campaign and run his business late last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right time,\u201d he told the Salt Lake City Tribune in December. McAdams ended the year with $1.8 million in the bank, giving him a financial advantage over the remaining Republicans in the race. Peterson represents a sprawling, rural district in northwestern Minnesota that Trump carried by 31 points. After narrowly defeating an underfunded challenger who ran without national party support the past two cycles, Peterson is front and center on the radar of national Republicans, who\u2019ve signaled support for a former lieutenant governor to take him on. As one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, Peterson is known for bucking his party. He voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010. More recently, he was one of just two House Democrats who voted against Democrats\u2019 gun background check legislation and against both articles of impeachment against Trump. Although he\u2019s close to speaker Nancy Pelosi, he was no fan of his party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2016. He told Roll Call that for the first time in his life, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to vote in the general election for president. But when Peterson announced earlier this year that he\u2019d seek a 16th term, Democrats breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cEvery ounce of power that the Democrats have derives from Nancy Pelosi being the speaker of the House, and if we lose Collin Peterson, you lose Minnesota 7 forever,\u201d said Heller, the Democratic strategist, who\u2019s also working for the congressman. The past several cycles, Peterson has asked the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee not to spend on his behalf \u2014 for fear of unnecessarily nationalizing his race and taking resources away from contests where party money might have been more useful. But that might be different this year if he\u2019s up against former Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach and the outside GOP money her candidacy is likely to attract. Peterson ended the year with $1 million in the bank to Fischbach\u2019s $204,000. Fischbach, who already has Trump\u2019s endorsement, is trying to attack Peterson for being insufficiently opposed to abortion rights. Fischbach\u2019s husband was the head of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and her mother is the co-director of the National Right to Life, which has endorsed her. Peterson has the backing of Democrats for Life, but the group doesn\u2019t have resources to spend in elections. \u201cHe\u2019s a Democrat in a district where Hillary got 30.8% \u2013 you\u2019ve got to round up to get to 31 \u2013 so there\u2019s nothing wrong with reminding people that you are a different kind of Democrat,\u201d Heller said. \u201cBut is that the primary basis of our campaign? No,\u201d Heller said. \u201cHe\u2019s the chairman of the Ag Committee in rural Minnesota. If we are running on pro-life, then shame on us.\u201d",

Illinois increasingly has become a solid Democratic state in presidential politics. Democrats have fared better here than nationwide in every presidential election since 1980. Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton all carried the state by double-digit margins. The state legislature is controlled by Democrats, as is the governor\u2019s office. Both of its US senators are Democrats, and Democrats outnumber Republicans in its US House delegation. Historically, the so-called \u201ccollar counties\u201d of the Chicago suburbs (DuPage County, Kane County, Lake County, McHenry County and Will County) compose one of the most fiercely contested battlegrounds in Illinois. Republicans traditionally did well here, especially in the more affluent neighborhoods, but as the GOP shifted rightward in the 1980s on social issues such as gun control and abortion, Democratic support began to rise. Outside of Chicago and the collar counties, voters don\u2019t lean left as much. Central and south Illinois has become a Republican stronghold. The northern region of the state, which contains corn farmers and industrial cities, has moved to the right in recent years.",

Bernie Sanders on Sunday contrasted his voting record in Congress against former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s, highlighting several measures Sanders voted against that Biden voted for. \u201cI voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the bankruptcy\u00a0bill, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against the war in Iraq,\u00a0which was also a tough vote, you voted for it.\u00a0I voted against disastrous\u00a0trade agreements like (North American Free Trade Agreement) and (permanent normal trade relations) with China,\u00a0which cost this country over 4\u00a0million good-paying jobs. You voted for it,\u201d Sanders said at Sunday\u2019s debate. \u201cI voted against the Hyde\u00a0Amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an\u00a0abortion.\u00a0You have consistently voted for\u00a0it. I don\u2019t know what your position is on it today,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe can argue about the merits of the bills. It takes courage sometimes to vote, do the right thing,\u201d Sanders said. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race 5 takeaways from the Biden vs. Sanders debate Biden responded by attacking Sanders\u2019 past opposition to the Brady Bill that was aimed at curbing gun violence. \u201c(Sanders) voted against the Brady Bill five times. Background checks \u2026 Five times,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis man is the only, one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cTalk about a special, special interest. We should be able to sue drug companies. We should be able to sue tobacco companies. We cannot sue gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago. He says it was a mistake now. I\u2019m prepared to accept be says it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d \u201cThe question is what do we do from this point on,\u201d Biden said. Here\u2019s how Sanders and Biden voted on each bill when they were both in Congress: The Defend of Marriage Act is a 1996 law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. It was signed into law by President\u00a0Bill Clinton. Biden voted for the bill in the Senate. 32 Democrats and 53 Republicans voted for the bill in the Senate. 14 Democrats opposed the bill. Sanders voted against the bill in the House. 224 Republicans and 118 Democrats voted for the bill in the House of Representatives. Sanders, an independent, joined one Republican and 65 Democrats in voting against the bill. The Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key part of the law that denied to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses. Biden announced that he supported same-sex marriage in 2012 when he served as vice president, famously getting ahead President Barack Obama on the issue. Biden said at Sunday\u2019s debate, \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0the first person to go on\u00a0national television in any administration and say \u2018I\u00a0supported gay marriage.\u2019\u201d The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 was effort to prevent consumers from abusing the bankruptcy system by clearing all their debts when they might have the ability to repay at least some of them. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Biden voted for the bill in the Senate. 18 Democrats, 55 Republicans and one independent voted for the bill in the Senate, and 25 Democrats voted against it. Sanders voted against the bill in the House.125 Democrats and Sanders voted against it, and 229 Republicans and 73 Democrats voted for it. Biden recently backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy plan, endorsing his former Democratic rival\u2019s proposal to repeal portions of this 2005 bankruptcy law. Biden, whose state of Delaware is the home of several major credit card companies, was a leading proponent of the bill in the Senate and voted for it. He and Warren clashed over the bill when she was a Harvard professor and vocal opponent. This resolution authorized the use of United States Armed Forces against Iraq. It was signed by President George W. Bush. Biden voted for the resolution in the Senate. 29 Democrats and 48 Republicans voted for it, and 21 Democrats, one Republican and one Independent voted against it. Sanders voted against the resolution in the House.126 Democrats, 6 Republicans and Sanders voted against it. 81 Democrats and 215 Republicans voted for it. Biden has since called his decision to vote for the resolution a mistake. A treaty entered into by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 1994. It was signed by President Bill Clinton. Biden voted for it in the Senate. 27 Democrats and 34 Republicans voted for it, and 28 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted against it. Sanders voted against it in the House. 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans and Sanders voted against it. 102 Democrats and 132 Republicans voted for it. Biden has responded to Sanders\u2019 criticism on the trail by calling himself a \u201cfair trader\u201d and making the argument that the US should treat countries like China the way they treat the US. This bill\u00a0extended permanent, normal trade status to China. It was signed by President Bill Clinton. Biden voted for it in the Senate. 37 Democrats and 46 Republicans voted for it, and 7 Democrats and 8 Republicans voted against it. Sanders voted against it in the House. 138 Democrats, two independents and 57 Democrats voted against it. 73 Democrats and 164 Republicans voted for the bill. This law mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers in the United States, and imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases. It was signed by President Bill Clinton. Biden voted for the bill in the Senate. 47 Democrats and 16 Republicans voted for the bill, and 8 Democrats and 28 Republicans voted against the bill. Sanders voted against the bill in the House. 69 Democrats,119 Republicans and Sanders voted against the bill, and 184 Democrats and 54 Republicans voted for the bill. At the South Carolina Democratic debate in February, Sanders called his opposition to the bill \u201ca bad vote.\u201d \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote,\u201d he said. The Hyde Amendment is a measure that blocks federal funds from\u00a0being used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is in danger. Once a longtime supporter of the Hyde Amendment, Biden reversed his position in June of last year amid criticism from\u00a0his 2020 Democratic rivals. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone\u2019s ZIP code,\u201d Biden said. While Sanders has been critical of Biden\u2019s past support of the measure, he has voted for large spending bills that included the Hyde Amendment. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked Sanders in June, \u201cIs it misleading, Senator, to say that you have never voted for it?\u201d Sanders said that sometimes \u201cin a large bill, you have to vote for things you don\u2019t like. But I think my record as being literally 100% pro-choice is absolutely correct.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gave no indication that he is giving up his fight for the Democratic nomination for president during Sunday\u2019s night\u2019s debate, aggressively challenging former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s record and questioning whether he can generate the enthusiasm needed to defeat President Donald Trump. After a series of crushing defeats in the two Super Tuesday contests, Sanders has fallen far behind Biden in the critical race for delegates. But the champion of the party\u2019s progressive wing sought to draw out the ideological contrasts with Biden as the former vice president argued that Americans are \u201clooking for results, not a revolution.\u201d As the two candidates tangled over policy throughout the night, Biden repeatedly called for unity among Democrats and made major news by stating he would pick a woman as his running mate. \u201cIf I\u2019m elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint \u2013 pick a woman to be vice president,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for all 2020 news Both Biden and Sanders said half their Cabinet advisers would be women to match the makeup of the nation, and when pressed Sanders said he would probably also pick a female vice presidential running mate. \u201cIn all likelihood, I will,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\u201d The two men met for their first one-on-one debate Sunday night at a time when many Americans are staying at home in an unprecedented national effort to slow the spread of novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 3,400 people in 49 states and led to at least 65 deaths. Underscoring the extraordinary moment in this nation\u2019s history, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance moments before the two men took the stage in CNN\u2019s Washington bureau \u2013 urging Americans to cancel or postpone in-person gatherings that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks. Biden, with a grin, offered his elbow as a greeting to Sanders before the two men took their place behind the podiums, which were spaced more than six feet apart in keeping with government\u2019s guidelines for social distancing. As they both outlined their respective plans to take on the coronavirus, they agreed that government should cover not only the health care costs of those who get sick, but also any lost wages, missed rent or mortgage payments and childcare costs incurred as a result of the illness. Beyond that, however, the debate illustrated the stark disagreements between the Vermont senator and the former vice president on how far they would go in attempting to restructure government to address income inequality in America. Casting himself as a champion of working people, Sanders argued that the pandemic has exposed \u201cthe fragility\u201d of the US economy by illuminating the fact that \u201chalf of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are struggling, working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What\u2019s going to happen to them?\u201d Sanders said. Biden, Sanders debate whether 'Medicare for All' would save lives But Biden argued that most Americans are in no mood for revolution, as they look to their commander-in-chief to marshal all of the resources of government stop the pandemic and keep their families safe. Alluding to plans Sanders supports \u2013 like a wealth tax and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2013 Biden said the current crisis is \u201cnot going to be solved by a change in tax policy now. It\u2019s not going to be solved by how we deal with health care,\u201d and then pivoted to his plans for emergency hospitals, enhanced coordination with other nations and his agenda for expanding the nation\u2019s testing capacity. The former vice president said he would make sure every state in the union had 10 places where Americans could access drive-through testing, while also engaging the Defense Department and Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up emergency 500-bed hospital sites to triage patients. Sanders: Trump is undermining the good work of scientists He added that he would try to swiftly deal with the economic fallout from the crisis by helping Americans cover their mortgages and allowing small businesses to borrow interest-free loans. If he had the power to act immediately, Sanders said he would move aggressively to make sure that every person in the country who becomes infected would know that they would not lose income, and assure them that \u201call payments will be made.\u201d He also touted his plan for Medicare for All as a critical part of the safety net in the midst of this crisis. \u201cI want every person in this country to understand what when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for,\u201d Sanders said, explaining what he would want to occur under his administration. Coming at a moment of national uncertainty, the debate underscored the very different positions the two candidates find themselves in right now as Biden has surged ahead of Sanders in delegates. Sanders was the aggressor throughout the night, repeatedly challenging Biden\u2019s lengthy Senate record and suggesting the former Delaware senator had acted for political expediency instead of taking more controversial positions that Sanders did. An hour into the debate, Sanders reeled off a list of difficult votes that both candidates took in Congress, noting that he and Biden voted differently on the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill and the war in Iraq, which he has said raised questions about Biden\u2019s judgment. \u201cI voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI voted against the disastrous trade agreements like (North American Free Trade Agreement), which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde Amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don\u2019t know what your position is today. \u2026 We can argue about the merits of the bill. It takes courage sometimes to vote and do the right thing.\u201d Biden, with a lighter touch, faulted Sanders for voting against the Brady Bill, which contained measures to try to prevent gun violence like enhanced background checks and noted that Sanders voted against legislation that prevented gun manufacturers from being sued. Still, Sanders pointed to his consistency, which is what has endeared him most to his supporters. \u201cWe can argue this or that bill, but what I\u2019m suggesting is that in this time of crisis when we are living in a really, really unsettling world \u2013 economically, from a health care perspective with the coronavirus \u2013 the people of America know my record,\u201d the Vermont senator said. Biden\u2019s priority at this time, however, is to try and persuade Sanders supporters to back him if he becomes the Democratic nominee, and he often noted areas where they agreed on Sunday \u2013 including his new support for the bankruptcy plan of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a new announcement that he\u2019ll support free college tuition for students in households making less than $125,000. \u201cCharacter of the nation is on the ballot,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSen. Sanders and I both agree we need \u2013 health care should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we have a New Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don\u2019t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything.\u201d Some of their sharpest exchanges were over electability. Noting the youth and energy of his supporters, the Vermont senator argued that Biden would not be able to muster the kind of excitement that would be need among his backers to take on Trump. Sanders framed his coalition as a multiracial, multi-generational grassroots movement, acknowledging Biden\u2019s advantage in the delegate count but pointing to the energy of his supporters. \u201cJoe has won more states than I have. But here\u2019s what we are winning,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe are winning the ideological struggle. Even in Mississippi where Joe won a major victory, it turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for All. That\u2019s true in almost every state in this country.\u201d \u201cWe are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we\u2019re winning people 50 years of age or younger. Big time \u2013 people 30 years of age and younger,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLook if I lose this thing \u2013 Joe wins \u2013 Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump \u2013 who will be a very, very tough opponent \u2013 unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history.\u201d In one of his more cutting retorts, Biden pointed to his victories and the rise in turnout in many of the states where he has done well, arguing that his message \u201cis resonating across the board.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get this straight. The energy and excitement that\u2019s taken place so far has been for me,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSeventy percent turnout increase in Virginia. I can go down the list. \u2026 And I didn\u2019t even have the money to compete with this man in those states.\u201d In one of the more human moments, both candidates were asked how they were confronting the unique risks facing Americans of advanced age with the coronavirus. Biden and Sanders have both suspended their rallies, directed their aides to work from home and have avoided shaking hands. Sanders, who is 78 and had a heart attack last year, said he\u2019s \u201cvery careful about the people I am interacting with.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cAnd I have to say, thank God right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that.\u201d Biden, who is 77, pointedly noted that he does not have underlying conditions and said he was in good health. \u201cI wash my hands God knows how many times a day,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI carry with me, in my bag outside here, hand sanitizer. I don\u2019t know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don\u2019t touch my face and so on. I\u2019m taking all the precautions we\u2019re telling everybody else to take.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments throughout the debate.

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Wisconsin has penned a caustic essay accusing Chief Justice John Roberts of \u201cundermining democracy\u201d and placing him at the center of problems in a polarized America, just as Roberts has been increasingly trying to defend the Court from US politics. In a piece ricocheting across social media and provoking conservatives, US District Court Judge Lynn Adelman, a 1997 appointee of former President Bill Clinton, writes that Roberts\u2019 confirmation pledge to be an umpire merely calling balls and strikes \u201cwas a masterpiece of disingenuousness.\u201d \u201cThe Roberts Court has been anything but passive,\u201d Adelman says in his 35-page essay. \u201cRather, the Court\u2019s hard right majority is actively participating in undermining American democracy.\u201d Adelman highlights decisions such as the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision that curtailed the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling that lifted campaign finance regulations. Both cases were decided by 5-4 votes, with Republican-appointed conservatives holding the majority. An overriding point of Adelman, a former Wisconsin state senator known for his liberalism, is that the high court answers the desires of wealthy people while shortchanging ordinary Americans. Such criticism from a fellow federal judge is startling, although Adelman\u2019s key points have long been detailed by liberal advocates, law professors and other writers. Rarely do jurists break ranks so publicly and personally. He described Roberts\u2019 2005 Senate confirmation testimony as \u201cmisleading\u201d and declared that \u201cthe Roberts Court has contributed to insuring that the political system in the United States pays little attention to ordinary Americans and responds only to the wishes of a relatively small number of powerful corporations and individuals.\u201d John Roberts lays groundwork for Supreme Court to limit abortion In a telephone interview with CNN on Thursday, Adelman said he has been caught off guard by attention to his law review essay. \u201cAll this fuss has disarmed me,\u201d he said, but quickly added, \u201cI felt it needed to be said. Other people have written on this subject. But it\u2019s such an important issue. You can\u2019t say it enough.\u201d He said he wanted to add his unique perspective as a judge. In his essay, he wrote, \u201cWe desperately need public officials who will work to revitalize our democratic republic. Unfortunately, the conservative Justices on the Roberts Court are not among them.\u201d The piece, entitled \u201cThe Roberts Court\u2019s Assault on Democracy,\u201d will be in the Harvard Law & Policy Review, a student law journal published by the liberal American Constitution Society. Adelman\u2019s assessment has burst forth amid Roberts\u2019 recent efforts to rope off the Court and just a week after scorching exchanges at the fulcrum of the law and politics. Roberts issued a rare statement to defend conservative justices against attacks by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer during an abortion-rights case, and President Donald Trump separately lashed out on Twitter against liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Roberts did not respond to a request for comment. Adelman, who is 80 and still hearing cases in Milwaukee, has spawned a heated round of critiques, from conservatives, who have denounced him, and liberals, praising his candor. \u201cThis screed could have come from a Bernie stump speech,\u201d Professor Josh Blackman wrote on the right-leaning Volokh Conspiracy legal blog. \u201cIt has no place in a publication by a federal judge. \u2026 There is nothing new or original here. Judge Adelman merely repeats the same tropes we have heard for a decade.\u201d Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, also suggested Adelman compromised judicial ethics by publishing his complaints, which included a biting critique of Trump, and then by talking to reporters. From the opposite perspective, Slate commentators Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern acknowledged in a piece on Tuesday that in the past the judge might have been challenging the usual norms in his scathing essay. But they wrote, \u201cIt is in the finest tradition of the judicial branch to sacrifice decorum and politeness to calls for actual justice, especially when the rights of minorities, women, the poor, and the disenfranchised have been hollowed out by monied interests and the political branches that answer to them. \u201cThe real tragedy here,\u201d Lithwick and Stern added, \u201cis that progressive judges will be pilloried for saying out loud what conservative judges have secretly, and not so secretly, crowed about themselves for decades.\u201d Adelman told CNN he believes he crossed no line and, rather, fulfilled a duty. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to criticize decisions of the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that I\u2019m bound by them. And I\u2019ve done that (in rulings). But I think I have a duty to criticize decisions that are flawed.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The middle of the country could prove the end of the road for Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Midwestern states that begin voting Tuesday with primaries in Missouri and Michigan represent the Vermont independent\u2019s best \u2013 and possibly last \u2013 chance to regain his footing in the Democratic presidential race after former Vice President Joe Biden reestablished himself as the front-runner with commanding Super Tuesday victories last week. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race If Sanders can\u2019t win in the states that vote over the next month across the industrial heartland \u2013 a list that extends from Michigan and Missouri on Tuesday to Ohio and Illinois on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7 \u2013 the senator may find it difficult to justify continuing what he calls \u201ca campaign of the working class, by the working class and for the working class,\u201d as he put it in a Detroit rally Friday night. If Sanders loses all or most of these heavily blue-collar states, \u201cyou don\u2019t really have much of an argument anymore,\u201d says Addisu Demissie, who managed Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign. Sanders has work ahead: A flurry of polls released Monday showed Biden holding at least a 15-percentage-point lead in Michigan, while a CNN survey released the same day gave Biden an advantage of 16 percentage points nationwide. The stakes are so high for Sanders in the coming Midwestern showdowns partly because the region was among his strongest in his 2016 presidential bid. Back then, he beat Hillary Clinton narrowly in Michigan and commandingly in Wisconsin and lost by less than 1 percentage point in Missouri and only about 2 points in Illinois. Those represented some of the strongest performances last time in more populous states for Sanders, who generally ran best in 2016 in smaller states and caucuses. Only in Ohio did Clinton win comfortably. 6 key moments from Bernie Sanders' interview with CNN If Sanders can\u2019t collect more delegates than Biden from these Midwestern battlegrounds, he may find it virtually impossible to make up the difference elsewhere, especially since Biden\u2019s strength among African American voters will provide him huge delegate advantages in the remaining Southern states on the calendar, including Mississippi on Tuesday, Georgia later in March and Louisiana in April. Just as important, losses to Biden in these states would undermine Sanders\u2019 case that he is uniquely positioned to recapture enough working-class white voters to win back the industrial states that tipped the 2016 election to President Donald Trump, particularly Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. A Biden victory in Michigan on Tuesday, many Democratic analysts believe, could trigger enough further consolidation around the former vice president to effectively decide the race. \u201cMichigan is must-win for Sanders,\u201d says Adrian Hemond, a Democratic consultant based in Lansing, Michigan, who is not affiliated in the race. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out a path to the nomination for him if he can\u2019t win Michigan.\u201d Sanders certainly understands the stakes, especially in Michigan. Canceling a planned rally in Mississippi, he spent the weekend addressing big rallies across Michigan \u2013 in stark contrast with Biden, who did not appear there until Monday. Sanders also aired two new ads attacking Biden and sharpened his criticism of the former vice president in his stump speech on issues from gay rights and abortion to Social Security and, above all, trade. Four years ago, trade was the issue that keyed Sanders\u2019 upset victory in Michigan, as he hammered Clinton for her support of the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trading relations with China. Sanders is banking on those issues to help deliver him Michigan again as he lashes Biden for his support of those agreements \u2013 as well as his backing of the updated version of NAFTA that Trump negotiated \u2013 in language reminiscent of his attacks on Clinton four years ago. \u201cIn Michigan we were able to win in 2016 because we pressed the case on trade and, guess what, we are able to do that again this time,\u201d says Ben Tulchin, Sanders\u2019 pollster. \u201cThe contrast is clear.\u201d The big question, though, is whether the contrast will work as effectively for Sanders against Biden as it did against Clinton. Four years ago, Sanders enjoyed broad success across the region against Clinton. According to exit polls, he beat her comfortably among whites with at least four-year college degrees in Michigan, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin, losing them only in Ohio. Although Clinton won about two-thirds of African Americans in the region, Sanders ran much more competitively among them than he did in the South: he carried 28% to 32% of black voters across all five states, according to the exit polls. Perhaps most important, Sanders, with his full-throated attacks on free trade and unflinching economic populism, posted some of his biggest margins anywhere among white voters without a college education: exit polls found that he beat Clinton among them by 5 percentage points in Missouri, 13 points in Illinois, 15 points in Michigan and 18 in Wisconsin. (In Ohio, the two essentially split those voters.) Those gains mattered because such blue-collar whites still represented a third or more of the total Democratic vote in each of these states except Illinois \u2013 considerably more than the one-fourth they composed of the national Democratic primary vote last time. None of those breakthroughs will be easy for Sanders to replicate this year. But the most difficult may be his performance among college-educated whites. During the race\u2019s first contests in February, those voters appeared leery of both Sanders and Biden, with as many as half or more of them gravitating toward Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, all of whom have now exited the race. But when the field dramatically narrowed just before Super Tuesday, those voters flowed more toward Biden than toward Sanders (with Warren, who was still in the race at that point, also retaining a solid base of support among them). Leaving aside California, Sanders\u2019 strongest state, college-educated white voters across the other 11 Super Tuesday states with exit polls preferred Biden over Sanders by 34% to 23%, according to a cumulative analysis by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta. Many observers believe that Biden might extend that advantage even further in Michigan. One key reason is Warren\u2019s departure from the race. Even with her campaign on life support by Super Tuesday, she retained significant support among college-educated white women, attracting fully one-fourth of them in all the states polled outside of California, according to Agiesta\u2019s analysis. Those women were especially resistant to Sanders: He won just 1 in 5 college-educated white women in the states beyond California, much less than Biden\u2019s one-third (and for that matter much less than the 27% Sanders drew from college-educated white men). Now, with Warren\u2019s departure making more of those voters available in Michigan, Biden has received endorsements from three prominent local women popular among them: Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens, two first-term Democratic US representatives elected from swing districts in 2018, and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was also elected that year. Hemond said that signal will likely reinforce the concern among many white-collar voters that Sanders is simply too extreme to beat Trump. \u201cA big part of that is because they live around these other affluent white voters who are not base Democrats, and they know pretty clearly those people are not voting for Bernie, and they are terrified about that,\u201d Hemond said. More difficult to predict is whether Sanders can repeat his success from 2016 at holding down his rival\u2019s advantages among African American voters outside of the South. His campaign believes he can, and early exit polls offer evidence to justify that optimism: Biden\u2019s margins over Sanders among black voters have been much smaller in places such as Nevada, Minnesota, Massachusetts and California than in the Southern states. \u201cBlack people in the North are much more warm to [Sanders] than black people in the South,\u201d says Demissie. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get blown out 80-20.\u201d Still, it may have been an ominous sign for Sanders that his rally Saturday in heavily African American Flint drew a preponderantly white crowd. Even if he can suppress Biden\u2019s margins among black voters across the Midwest, all sides recognize that the key to any possible revival for him will be approaching his 2016 advantage in the region among working-class white voters. Sanders won a plurality of non-college white voters in each of this year\u2019s first four contests and posted especially dominant numbers among blue-collar whites younger than 45: Exit polls found that he carried at least half of them in each state, while Biden, incredibly, drew only 1% to 7% of those younger working-class whites. The Working Families Party endorses Bernie Sanders following Elizabeth Warren's departure Sanders lost ground with blue-collar whites on Super Tuesday, as he did with all other groups, but the decline was not as precipitous as among their college-educated counterparts. Across the 11 Super Tuesday states with exit polls apart from California, Biden beat Sanders by only 5 percentage points (37% to 32%) among all whites without college degrees and Sanders routed the former vice president among blue-collar whites younger than 45 by more than 3 to 1, according to the CNN analysis. Tulchin, Sanders\u2019 pollster, says the contraction of the race into a one-on-one competition will help the senator sharpen the contrast on issues his camp believes will prove especially persuasive for working-class voters of all races, such as Biden\u2019s support for free trade agreements and openness at various points to cuts in entitlement programs as part of a grand budget deal. \u201cWhat happened after Tuesday, it\u2019s a reset,\u201d said Tulchin. \u201cNow it\u2019s a binary choice. The onus is on us to draw a contrast with Biden. And the good news for us is that on issue after issue, Bernie has consistently been on the right side of history and on the correct side of the Democratic Party.\u201d Sanders at last minute scraps speech tailored to black voters But one senior Biden adviser, who asked not to be identified while discussing the campaign\u2019s internal strategy, said they remain confident that the former vice president\u2019s broader persona as a middle-class candidate will blunt Sanders\u2019 efforts to portray him as a threat to voters\u2019 economic interests. In particular, Biden\u2019s allies believe that his work in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on the auto industry bailout, combined with his argument that America must sell to the world to prosper, can neutralize Sanders\u2019 protectionist appeal to free-trade skeptics. Trump\u2019s trade wars have also dampened enthusiasm for a confrontational trade strategy, they believe. \u201cThere is a trust among these voters they know who he is and they know he stands for working families,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThe combination of his argument about how he believes that trade is necessary in order to have markets and consumers, I think that resonates for these people but it works because it\u2019s combined with a real sense of who he is and standing with working people.\u201d And while Sanders is using his opposition to free trade agreements to present himself as a defender of the domestic auto industry, he could face his own difficult questions on that front. Sanders\u2019 version of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to combat climate change would ban the sale of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by 2030, just 10 years from now. Though virtually all Democrats now support a long-term shift toward electric or fuel-cell vehicles, such a rapid change could disrupt the domestic auto industry centered in the Midwest: Electric vehicles accounted for just 1.4% of all new sales last year. \u201cOf course, people want to move toward less dependence on fossil fuels,\u201d said the senior Biden aide. \u201cBut I think that kind of overwhelming change that quickly is a really tough thing to do and maintain the great American automobile industry. It\u2019s not something we have leaned into explicitly yet but I would imagine that would be a difficult sell in a lot of places in the Rust Belt.\u201d Biden vs. Sanders: How they compare on key issues Given the likelihood that Sanders won\u2019t perform as well among college-educated white voters across the Midwest this year, he will face enormous pressure to replicate, or even exceed, his 2016 margins among working-class whites. Hemond is one of many analysts dubious that Sanders can meet that test. While Sanders might win most blue-collar whites in Michigan, Hemond says, \u201che doesn\u2019t have the benefit of running against Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton did not present well with that constituency, certainly not compared to her husband. I expect Senator Sanders to do well with [those voters] but he blew Secretary Clinton out with that constituency, and that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Sanders left it all on the field with a grueling schedule across Michigan over the weekend. But if he can\u2019t win in such a brawny blue-collar state, Michigan could prove the burial ground for his dream of a \u201cmultigenerational, multiracial working-class coalition\u201d that would transform the Democratic Party and propel him to its nomination.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday that his campaign raised $22 million in just five days following  a remarkable comeback in the Democratic primary, nearly matching the same amount he raised in the last three months of 2019. Biden \u2013 in a phone call to supporters at a Bethesda, Maryland, fundraiser \u2013 also warned against negativity that could come from what he referred to as \u201cBernie brothers,\u201d saying that the primary cannot become a \u201cnegative bloodbath.\u201d An aide told CNN that the money was raised in the days after Biden\u2019s victories in the South Carolina primary andon  Super Tuesday. The haul is significant for Biden, whose campaign lagged behind that of his rivals in fundraising in the last few quarters. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for 2020 news On the phone call, Biden appeared to reference Sanders\u2019 new lines of attack, but also to the Vermont senator\u2019s more aggressive supporters, who have become known as \u201cBernie Bros.\u201d \u201cWhat we can\u2019t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run. But we can\u2019t tear this party apart and reelect Trump. We have to keep our eyes on the ball, in my view.\u201d Mike Casca, Sanders\u2019 communications director, responded to Biden\u2019s comments late Friday night. \u201cTens of millions are uninsured while coronavirus spreads, the planet is warming at an accelerating rate, working people haven\u2019t seen a real raise in decades, and Joe Biden is worried about some damn tweets?\u201d Casca said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s try to stay focused on the big issues.\u201d As the Democratic primary has rapidly narrowed to a two-man race, Sanders has stepped up his criticism of the former vice president, slamming him on a range of issues including Social Security, the Iraq War vote and the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Sanders has also adding new lines of attack on Biden\u2019s record on LGBTQ and reproductive rights, specifically the former Delaware senator\u2019s past support on the military\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy and the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortion in most cases. Biden supported the 2010 repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d and said in June 2019 he no longer supports the Hyde Amendment \u201cWhen we talk about differences with my friend Joe Biden \u2013 and he is my friend \u2013 I think it\u2019s important for people of Michigan and people of America to know difference in our record,\u201d Sanders said Friday during a rally in Detroit. \u201cJoe\u2019s been around for a while, I\u2019ve been around for a while, how do we differ, what\u2019s our records? Who stood up when the going was tough?\u201d The former vice president conceded that he would be attacked in the general election if selected as the nominee but added that Sanders was likely to continue throwing punches as well. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard. This guy\u2019s going to come at me and throw everything including the kitchen sink,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean Bernie, I mean in the general election. But Bernie is going to throw \u2013 he\u2019ll at least throw the dishwasher at me.\u201d The former vice president apologized to his supporters for not appearing at the fundraiser in person because he had to \u201cshow up somewhere for a major endorsement\u201d that would be announced \u201cvery soon.\u201d It is unclear who the possible endorser could be.

It\u2019s the 100th anniversary of women getting the right to vote, which means conditions were perfect, in a sense of moral justice, to send a woman to the White House this year. But it ain\u2019t happening. (Yes, even though Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is still in the race.) We still don\u2019t know who will be on the general election ballot in November, but we do know it\u2019ll almost certainly be one of two white men approaching their late 70s against President Donald Trump, also a white man and in his early 70s. From a historically diverse field, the two Democrats left standing are Joe Biden, a Catholic who personally opposes abortion rights, and Bernie Sanders, who tends to do better with male voters, according to exit polls. One of those guys will take up the banner of a party that will certainly build its case in 2020 around the political priorities of progressive women \u2013 including access to health care and to abortion. What happened? If a majority of Democratic primary voters are women, why did a woman did not do better than third in any of the primaries so far? Warren even trailed Biden and Sanders among female voters in her home state of Massachusetts. Why, according to exit polls, did female voters not vote for female candidates? LISTEN: Elizabeth Warren was the main subject of the Daily DC podcast today and I talked about the race with David Chalian and Mark Preston. As Warren suspended her campaign in the driveway of her house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was asked if sexism played a role in her failure as a presidential candidate. Here\u2019s how she replied: Gender in this race? You know, that is the trap question for every woman.If you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says, \u201cWhiner.\u201dAnd if you say, no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, \u201cWhat planet do you live on?\u201d She added that she plans to tackle this subject in the future. Read CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston on how Warren\u2019s departure from the 2020 race resonated on Thursday. Polls don\u2019t do very much to explain what\u2019s going on here, since the polls suggest far fewer voters are comfortable with someone over 75 (Biden and Sanders) or someone who has had a heart attack in the last year (Sanders). When you look only at Democratic primary voters, a majority said they would be full-on enthusiastic about a female candidate. Comfortable with a woman on the ballot. In a February NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 33% of Americans said they would be enthusiastic about having a woman run and 51% said they would be comfortable with it. Just 9% said they would have some reservations and 5% said they would be very uncomfortable. More and more women in office. The number of women on Capitol Hill and in the Senate continues to grow. About a quarter of Congress and the Senate is composed of women. Nine of the nation\u2019s 50 governors are women. So are 15 lieutenant governors, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics. In a January poll, NBC News/WSJ asked voters what, on a scale of 1-10, was most important to them with their primary ballots: defeating Trump, picking someone with big policy ideas, choosing a candidate who would continue the Obama agenda or electing the first female president. Seventy-three percent gave defeating Trump a 9 or a 10. Just 21% said the same of electing the first female president. And we know from 2016 that Trump could beat Hillary Clinton. Voters who don\u2019t like him appear to have determined that means he could beat any woman. While the polls suggest enthusiasm for (or at least comfort with) a female candidate, the reality is this: Women did not vote that way for Warren or Amy Klobuchar. Other women who ran campaigns \u2013 Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Marianne Williamson \u2013 did not make it to the primaries. Progressives chose Sanders. Moderates chose Biden. \u201cYou know, I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes \u2014 a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for, and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for, and there\u2019s no room for anyone else in this,\u201d Warren said Thursday. \u201cI thought that wasn\u2019t right, but evidently, I was wrong.\u201d That does not speak to major policy differences. Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s policy proposals were near carbon copies. In fact, you can trace her decline in polling directly to her inability to explain during a CNN debate how to pay for the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan she borrowed from him. (That may be former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s lasting legacy on the trajectory of the race, along with his decision to get out before Super Tuesday to clear the path for Biden.)  Sanders, by the way, borrowed the idea of a wealth tax from her. He also borrowed elements of a free child care program from her. Warren\u2019s 2020 campaign may be most remembered for the way she took out the billionaire Michael Bloomberg, stomping on his rise in the polls during a debate in Las Vegas with a fierce line of questioning about nondisclosure agreements signed by former employees of his Bloomberg LP financial-data and media company. That moment could have been evidence that she\u2019d slice and dice Trump on a debate stage in the general election. Instead, it cleared a path for Biden. Read: This VOX piece on how Warren\u2019s support was always concentrated among affluent white professionals \u2013 who are not a majority of any political party. Hard to believe that it was just a month ago that Senate Republicans acquitted Trump at his impeachment trial. (Yup. It was February 5.) In the meantime, the Democratic race has consolidated to two leading candidates and the coronavirus has become a full-fledged global public health crisis, blotting out the political drama that came with the Ukraine scandal. But it\u2019s clear that Republicans are preparing to bring back their Ukraine obsession in a big way. Reminder: Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his potential 2020 general election rival, were at the center of the President\u2019s impeachment trial. Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that Biden or his son, Hunter, acted corruptly in Ukraine. If you\u2019re wondering whether the Senate Republicans\u2019 Biden and Burisma investigation is political, consider that they put it on hold while Biden was floundering. Now that he could be the Democratic nominee, they\u2019ve resurrected it. Trump said this to Sean Hannity about Burisma on Fox News: \u201cThat will be a major issue in the campaign. I will bring that up all the time, because I don\u2019t see any way out. I don\u2019t see any way \u2013 for them, I don\u2019t see how they can answer those questions.\u201d Here are 27 odd lines from Trump\u2019s Fox News interview Wednesday night. The American system of government has been challenged to deal with a singular President and a divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House. Stay tuned to this newsletter as we keep watch over the Trump administration, the 2020 presidential campaign and other issues of critical interest.",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court\u2019s pivotal vote, asked just three questions during an incendiary Louisiana abortion rights case on Wednesday, guarding his actual views of whether the tough regulation was constitutional. But Roberts has clearly laid the groundwork for an important Supreme Court decision that would reverse precedent and uphold new restrictions on physicians who perform abortions. Before he engaged in a highly public war of words with top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Wednesday, Roberts was more crucially indicating receptivity to state restrictions on abortion. The Court, over Roberts\u2019 dissent in 2016, struck down a Texas law similar to Louisiana\u2019s, saying it was medically unnecessary and burdened a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy. At the time, Roberts was actively critical of the physicians challenging the law that required them to obtain certain hospital credentials and that had led to the closure of abortion clinics in Texas. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to strike down the Texas law, has since been replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The cemented 5-4 conservative majority, reinforced by Roberts\u2019 overall record of never voting to strike down any abortion restriction, could lead to a significant retrenchment on abortion rights in America. Because of the limited nature of the Louisiana case, a ruling would not constitute an outright reversal of the 1973 milestone Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide. Rather, it would mark a step in that direction, limiting access to abortion. And in this election year, such a ruling would accelerate controversy over presidential appointments and the future of America\u2019s highest court. Yet signals from Roberts are not the end of the matter for judging the chief justice today. Roberts\u2019 influence on the nine-member bench has been transformed since he last staked out a position on abortion rights. Roberts became the justice at the ideological center after Kennedy\u2019s retirement. The 65-year-old chief justice has inched slightly to the left on some issues since then and demonstrated a stronger desire to shield the Court from accusations of politicking. He is testing public assumptions about a bench deeply split between five Republican-appointed justices and four justices appointed by Democrats. Trump's 2020 message behind his attacks on liberal Supreme Court justices tHis interest in asserting the justices\u2019 independence was on display in a statement from Roberts that the Court\u2019s Public Information Office issued late Wednesday, in which he called remarks Schumer made at a rally earlier in the day \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d Schumer, a New York Democrat, referred to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and said he wanted them to know: \u201cYou have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d Roberts responded: \u201cJustices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.\u201d In Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments, Roberts was quieter, leaving the toughest scrutiny of the challengers\u2019 position to Justice Samuel Alito, whose dissenting opinion Roberts joined in the 2016 case, known as Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. Yet Roberts raised a line of inquiry that would differentiate the Louisiana law, requiring physicians to obtain \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d from a hospital within 30 miles of clinics, from the similar Texas regulation. In 2016, the majority found that the admitting-privileges requirement reduced the number of physicians available to perform abortions while offering virtually no health benefits for women. Addressing Julie Rikelman, lawyer for physicians who have sued Louisiana, Roberts said, \u201cCounsel, do you agree that the inquiry under Hellerstedt is a factual one that has to proceed state-by-state? \u2026 You have to have the district court (judge) examine the availability of specific clinics and the admitting privileges of doctors, so that the \u2026 results could be different in different states?\u201d Rikelman said the Texas decision should control the current case, and the consequences should not be different for Louisiana. \u201cThis court held in Whole Woman\u2019s Health that the Texas admitting privileges law was medically unnecessary and its burdens were undue,\u201d Rikelman said. \u201cThat holding should clearly apply to Louisiana\u2019s identical law, and certainly the Court\u2019s reasoning is applicable in Louisiana. Now, the burdens of a law may vary, but a law that has no benefits and doesn\u2019t serve any valid state interest is much more likely to impose an undue burden.\u201d Roberts later asked Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill about state comparisons but focused on the benefits of regulation, rather than any burden. \u201cDo you agree that the benefits inquiry under the law is going to be the same in every case, regardless of which state we\u2019re talking about?\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI understand the idea that the impact might be different in different places, but as far as the benefits of the law, that\u2019s going to be the same in each state, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cI think that a state could certainly show greater benefits,\u201d Murrill said, \u201cdepending on what their regulatory structure is and what the facts are on the ground in that state.\u201d Louisiana officials said in their written brief that the 2014 law was intended to protect women from \u201cunscrupulous and incompetent abortion providers.\u201d The Trump administration is siding with Louisiana, and Roberts asked Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall whether the advantages of regulation could vary from state to state. Wall said they could vary, but that there\u2019s likely to be more of a variance on whether a particular law poses a burden in a state. Louisiana is arguing that its physician regulation would not have the severe impact on clinic operations that occurred in Texas. The challengers disagree and stress that a trial court judge found abortion in Louisiana to be safe and declared the new regulation would not enhance women\u2019s health or safety. Four years ago, in the Texas case, Roberts suggested by his questions that he believed the essential question for courts was whether women\u2019s right to end a pregnancy was truly burdened, irrespective of the state\u2019s asserted benefit. It would have been difficult back then to foresee how much would change at the Supreme Court in four years and the evolution of Roberts\u2019 power, particularly in an abortion case. READ: Transcript of US Supreme Court arguments in Louisiana abortion case Justice Antonin Scalia had died only a few weeks earlier, on Feb. 13, 2016, and it looked as if then-President Barack Obama would be naming his successor and flipping the ideological majority of the bench. For the first time in more than a half century, the chief justice would be in the minority ideologically. Instead, of course, Obama\u2019s choice of Judge Merrick Garland for the Scalia seat was blocked by Senate Republicans for nearly a year, and Roberts retained his majority. After President Donald Trump won the White House, he named consistent conservative Judge Gorsuch to the Scalia seat in 2017. That nomination did not change the ideological lineup of the bench or, likely, alter the abortion equation. But when Trump named Judge Kavanaugh as the successor to centrist Kennedy in 2018, the balance shifted to the right, and the influence of Roberts at the center expanded. How that mantle of the weighty middle vote shapes Roberts\u2019 position on abortion will not be known for months. On Friday, according to their usual practice, the justices will take a preliminary tally in a private session on the case of June Medical Services v. Russo. Their final decision would be issued by the end of June, when the justices recess for the summer.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court appeared divided after over an hour of arguments Wednesday concerning a controversial Louisiana abortion access law that critics say will leave just one doctor in the state to perform the procedure. Key justices indicated that they could be poised to uphold the law that is similar to a Texas law the Court struck down just four years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh both asked questions suggesting that the Louisiana law that requires doctors to have admitting privileges in local hospitals could serve a valid purpose. But Roberts\u2019 vote could be essential, and at the end of oral arguments it wasn\u2019t completely clear where he would come out. The case marks the first time President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees \u2013 Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh \u2013 have heard an abortion-related dispute at the high court. Supporters of abortion rights fear the Court\u2019s solid conservative majority is poised to cut back or even gut court precedent. It comes as Republican-led states are increasingly emboldened to pass laws that mark a potential rollback of abortion rights. Justice Samuel Alito emerged as the strongest and most vocal supporter of the law and even questioned whether the doctors and clinics could actually bring the challenge because they might have a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d with the women seeking abortion. The doctors\u2019 interests in new regulations, Alito suggested, may not align with a patient seeking treatment. Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing. While Louisiana argues the law will increase public safety, supporters of abortion rights say it will have a disastrous impact on women. The liberal justices, led by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, strenuously questioned the law, suggesting it was unnecessary and the procedure is safe. Back in 2016, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was still on the bench, the court struck down a similar law out of Texas in a case referred to as Whole Woman\u2019s Health. Much has changed since then, however, as Kennedy has been replaced by Kavanaugh, who is considered more conservative on the issue. Roberts, more than once, seemed to be trying to determine how bound the Court should be by that recent decision. Although he is a conservative justice, he has  institutional concerns about the Court and may not like results to swing wildly just because the Court\u2019s membership has changed. The Chief Justice questioned whether \u201cresults could be different\u201d state by state but he also noted that an inquiry regarding the benefits of the law may not vary. \u201cI understand the idea that the impact (of the law) might be different in different places, but as far as the benefits of the law, that\u2019s going to be the same in each state, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. Kavanaugh pushed a lawyer for the clinics. \u201cAre you saying,\u201d he said, that such admitting privilege laws are \u201calways unconstitutional\u201d? He asked whether such a law could ever have a \u201cvalid\u201d purpose. Ginsburg pressed repeatedly on the notion that the law was not medically necessary. She noted that \u201cmost\u201d abortions don\u2019t have complications. And she asked \u201cwhat sense\u201d it made to require a doctor to have admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles if a woman would more likely travel to a hospital near her own home if she needed to see a doctor after the abortion. Ginsburg noted that abortion is \u201cfar safer\u201d than other procedures, including child birth. Justice Elena Kagan said that doctors can be denied privileges under the law for reasons having nothing to do with their medical expertise. She, too, pushed on the claim that in one clinic, thousands of abortions had been performed, but the clinic had only ever transferred four patients to a hospital. \u201cIs it right that there is evidence in the record that Hope Clinic has served over 3,000 women annually for 23 years, so that\u2019s around 70,000 women, and has transferred only four patients ever to a hospital?\u201d she asked. The case will be decided by July, just as the presidential election is heating up. If Louisiana prevails, it will likely embolden other states to pass similar laws. Future of Roe v. Wade in spotlight as Supreme Court considers Louisiana abortion access case \u201cDisappointingly, we find ourselves back at the Supreme Court this term challenging a Louisiana law designed to shut down clinics,\u201d said Nancy Northup, the President of the Center for Reproductive Rights, the group behind the challenge. She charged Louisiana with \u201copenly defying\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 ruling. Louisiana\u2019s Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, blocked since its enactment in 2014 is an effort, state officials argued, to \u201cimprove abortion safety by means of doctor credentialing.\u201d Louisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Murrill says that clinics in the state have a \u201clong disturbing\u201d history of serious health and safety problems, abortion carries \u201cknown risks for serious complications\u201d and that the act would bring abortion practice \u201cinto conformity\u201d with the privilege requirements for doctors performing other outpatient surgeries. The penalty for violating the law is not more than $4,000 per violation. As a threshold matter, Murrill argues that the justices shouldn\u2019t even get to the merits of the case because the doctors and the clinics bringing the case don\u2019t have the legal right \u2013 or \u201cstanding\u201d \u2013 to  be in court. Murrill notes that Louisiana women can challenge abortion regulations if they wish to do so \u2013 \u201cas individual women have done in numerous other abortion cases across the country\u201d \u2013 but that the clinics and doctors can\u2019t stand in their place. She said that\u2019s because the interests of a for-profit business that exchanges medical services for a fee might not align with patients seeking an abortion. READ: Transcript of US Supreme Court arguments in Louisiana abortion case More than 200 members of Congress, including two Democratic House members, filed a brief in support of Louisiana on that point. They say there is an inherent conflict of interest between abortion providers and their patients when it comes to health and safety regulations. \u201cIt is impossible for abortion clinics and doctors to share or represent the interests of their patients when they seek to eliminate the very regulations designed to protect their patients\u2019 health and safety,\u201d the lawmakers stated. The Trump administration supports that position and argues that the law is valid. \u201cAct 620 would not create a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion for a large fraction of Louisiana women seeking one \u2013 let alone all such women,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Court. The administration argues that the Court might need to narrow or overrule the Texas case from 2016 because it conflicts with the Court\u2019s older precedent. The claims are rejected by lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing two doctors and an abortion clinic in the state who say that if the law had been able to go into effect when it passed, it would have forced the closure of two of the state\u2019s three remaining clinics and left only one doctor with the ability to provide abortion care. Trump's 2020 message behind his attacks on liberal Supreme Court justices They argue the law serves no valid credentialing function and will force women to increase travel times and wait longer for the procedure. \u201cBecause Act 620 provides no benefits, it unduly burdens a woman\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to pre-viability abortion,\u201d Julie Rikelman, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued. She said that it is extremely hard to obtain admitting privileges in the state and that denials often have nothing to do with a doctor\u2019s competency to provide abortion care. Rikelman also rejects the notion that only women seeking abortions could bring the suit, noting that a woman would only have a narrow time frame to bring such a suit and that such litigation often lasts for years. She stresses the close relationship between doctor and patient. Rikelman prevailed when a district court ruled in her favor after a trial, but then a panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed it. The appeals court took the unusual move of engaging in some fact finding, a task often handled by district courts, and concluded that the doctors had not made a good faith effort to get the credentials. \u201cThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that, had the doctors put forth a good faith effort to comply with Act 620, they would have been unable to obtain privileges,\u201d the court held. \u201cInstead of demonstrating an undue burden on a large fraction of women,\u201d the court said, the law \u201cat most shows an insubstantial burden on a small fraction of women.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Nancy Northup\u2019s name.

Warren, after claiming she would disavow all super PAC help in the 2020 Democratic nomination fight, has declined to do so for the help she is now receiving from Persist PAC. The super PAC announced Thursday that it planned to spend over $12 million on pro-Warren television ads in Super Tuesday states. The group, because of when it organized and filed with the Federal Election Commission, will not have to disclose their donors until March 20, long after millions of people vote on Super Tuesday on March 3. Kristen Orthman, Warren\u2019s communications director, told CNN on Friday that the Massachusetts senator \u201cbelieves Persist PAC and all other super PACs should disclose their donors before Super Tuesday.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race A spokesman for Persist PAC told CNN after Orthman\u2019s comment that it will not honor Warren\u2019s request. \u201cWe are not putting out donors outside the mandatory deadlines,\u201d said Joshua Karp, the group\u2019s spokesman. When pressed on the fact that the candidate it is supporting has requested that it do so, Karp added, \u201cWe are just not going to add anything than we have previously said\u201d and will \u201cstick to March 20.\u201d The pro-Warren super PAC announced earlier this week that they would spend more than $3 million on ads in eight Super Tuesday states, including North Carolina, Minnesota, Virginia and California. The group then upped that investment Thursday night to more than $12 million, with more ads set to be run in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Houston and Boston \u2013 all expensive markets where running ads would have drained substantial resources from Warren\u2019s campaign. At least one donor to the super PAC is known: Emily\u2019s List, a powerful Democratic organization that helps elect women candidates who support abortion rights. The group, according to spokeswoman Christina Reynolds, gave $250,000 to the super PAC. Warren has benefited heavily from Persist PAC. The senator, according to data from CMAG, has just over $1 million in Super Tuesday ad reservation as of Thursday, a figure that represents under 10% of the amount the super PAC plans to spend on ads in the key states. \u201cSo here\u2019s where I stand: If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs, count me in, I\u2019ll lead the charge. But that\u2019s how it has to be. It can\u2019t be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don\u2019t,\u201d Warren said in Nevada last week when she declined to disavow the group. Warren\u2019s support is a backtrack on previous statements she made in opposition to super PACs, including her repeatedly faulting other candidates for accepting their help. \u201cI heard everyone here talking about as Democrats, we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending,\u201d Warren said during the Democratic debate earlier this month in New Hampshire. \u201cYeah, except everyone on this stage except Amy (Klobuchar) and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending.\u201d CNN polls: Bernie Sanders holds big leads in California and Texas ahead of critical Super Tuesday vote She added: \u201cSo, if you really want to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign website also says she would \u201cdisavow any Super PAC formed to support her in the Democratic primary. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to overturn Citizens United because our democracy is not for sale,\u201d the site says. \u201cIn the meantime, Democrats should show some moral backbone by refusing their own Super PACs in the 2020 primary.\u201d Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been on the receiving end of blistering criticism over fundraising practices from Warren, said Friday that \u201cthe focus right now can\u2019t be on process purity tests.\u201d He declined to directly respond to questions about Warren\u2019s hypocrisy on Super PACs, saying only: \u201cIt certainly seems inconsistent.\u201d CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The battle over abortion rights made its way to the Senate floor on Tuesday when Republicans \u2013 helmed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 brought two longstanding bills with little chance of passage up for votes before the chamber. The bills, which both failed and have been introduced annually over the past few years, pinned down senators\u2019 stances on a divisive 2020 issue as several senators face tough reelections and followed through on a request from President Donald Trump. They allowed Republicans to capitalize on last year\u2019s state-level anti-abortion momentum in the lead up to November\u2019s election, as well as to bolster Trump\u2019s recent efforts to secure the support of anti-abortion voters by painting Democrats as extremists on the issue. While neither measure was expected to garner the 60 votes needed to advance, bringing them up for a vote gave Senate Republicans fodder to pressure moderate Democrats on their voting records \u2013 particularly competitive Senate races as McConnell seeks to energize conservative voters to help keep the GOP\u2019s majority in the chamber. The first bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, would ban abortion at 20 weeks based on the scientifically disputed notion that a fetus can feel pain at that point in development. The measure, sponsored by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, would clash with the 24-week threshold established by Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalized abortion nationwide prior to viability. The bill failed 53-44, with Democratic Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia voting in support of the measure and Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska opposing it. When asked why bring up the bill now, Graham said Tuesday before the vote that \u201cwe vote on it every year.\u201d He also acknowledged his bill\u2019s low odds of success, saying that while he hoped the bill would do well, \u201cI know we won\u2019t get 60 but I think we can get 50 (votes).\u201d Trump specifically named the issue during his State of the Union address earlier this month. \u201cTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.\u201d The second bill to be considered Tuesday is the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sponsored by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, pertains to cases in which \u201can abortion results in the live birth of an infant.\u201d It would require abortion providers to \u201cexercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\u201d Opponents have argued that such measures restrict abortion access by threatening health care providers. Only three Democrats broke rank on the second bill, with Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones joining Casey and Manchin to vote for the bill for a final tally of 56-41. Both Sasse and Graham are up for reelection in 2020. Speaking on the Senate floor before the vote on Tuesday, Sasse looked to differentiate his bill from Graham\u2019s 20-week bill, claiming that while he supported both measures, his bill \u201cis not in any way an abortion bill.\u201d \u201cIt is addressing some cases of infant mortality by making sure that babies that have survived abortion get care.\u201d Casey and Manchin both indicated Monday that they would again back both bills. \u201cThey\u2019re the same two bills that we\u2019ve had votes on the last couple of years, and I\u2019ll be yes on both,\u201d Casey said. Manchin pointed to his consistency on the issue, saying, \u201cI always voted for them, just check the record \u2013 nothing changes.\u201d Anti-abortion supporters lauded the bills ahead of the vote, referencing Trump\u2019s strong stance on the issue and slamming Democrats\u2019 stance as extreme. \u201cAs Republicans continue to support important pro-life policies, Democrats are bowing to the most radical elements of their party & refusing to protect babies still in their mother\u2019s womb,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence tweeted Tuesday. \u201cWe urge Americans everywhere to call their Senators & tell them to put life FIRST today.\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the major anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List that has long backed Trump, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cDemocrats have an opportunity today to stop their abortion extremism by joining Republicans to ban painful late-term abortions and infanticide.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump stands ready to sign both these popular, life-saving bills into law \u2013 it is only the abortion extremism of the Democratic Party that stands in the way,\u201d she added. Abortion rights supporters attacked the bills as thinly veiled attempts to curtail abortion access. Jacqueline Ayers, Planned Parenthood\u2019s vice president of government relations and public policy, said in a statement Monday that \u201cthese bills push misinformation meant to end access to abortion, and serve no other purpose than to shame patients and deny people the ability to make the best medical decisions for themselves and their families.\u201d She asserted that \u201cthe politicians behind these bills have one ultimate goal in mind: to ban access to safe, legal abortion in this country.\u201d The ACLU tweeted Tuesday, \u201cAnti-abortion politicians are attempting to attack our rights on the federal level again. Reminder to the Senate: Abortion is a constitutional right.\u201d Senate Republicans have already taken other steps this year to advance anti-abortion efforts. Last month, 39 Republican senators joined 168 members of the House of Representatives, almost all of them Republicans, in filing a brief to urge the Supreme Court to reconsider \u2013 if not overrule \u2013 Roe. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more precisely reflect the language used in Sasse\u2019s bill. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic presidential contenders are racing to refill their campaign coffers \u2013 following costly battles in the early nominating states and the looming Super Tuesday threat from New York tycoon Michael Bloomberg, who has plowed nearly half a billion dollars of his fortune into the fight to become the party\u2019s standard-bearer. The campaign filings rolling into the Federal Election Commission on Thursday evening underscored the sharp money divide in the Democratic campaign as the race moves into an expensive coast-to-coast battle for delegates. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts spent more than twice what she raised in January and took out a $3 million line of credit to ward off running out of cash, her campaign reported late Thursday to federal regulators. And Pete Buttigieg on Thursday made his own urgent plea to supporters to help him raise $13 million \u2013 or roughly $1 million a day \u2013 before Super Tuesday\u2019s contests in 14 states after collecting just $6.16 million in January. Aside from the billionaires in the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont entered the nominating season in the best financial position. He raised a staggering $25.1 million in January \u2013 and, despite spending more than he took in, still had $16.8 million in cash reserves before the opening contests of 2020. By comparison, former Vice President Joe Biden started February with $7.1 million remaining in his campaign accounts, followed by Buttigieg at $6.6 million. In an email to supporters, Buttigieg said his campaign had collected $11 million this month after strong finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire but it wasn\u2019t enough to meet the challenges ahead. \u201cThe goal posts have changed,\u201d the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor wrote in an email obtained by CNN. \u201cWe are no longer just up against Bernie Sanders, the Washington politician who has been running for president for years. We are now also up against a billionaire who is throwing colossal sums of money on television instead of doing the work of campaigning,\u201d Buttigieg said in the email, which was first reported by Politico. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota raised a little less than Buttigieg in January, $5.5 million, and burned through $7.6 million that month, the new filings show. That left her with $2.9 million remaining in her campaign war chest. But Warren opened February in the most precarious financial position of any top-tier candidate in the Democratic field. She had the smallest cash reserves: just $2.3 million, after spending $2 for every $1 she raised in January. Her campaign used the line of credit it secured to set aside $400,000 to guard against running out of money before the Iowa caucuses. Campaign spokesman Chris Hayden said Warren did not have to use borrowed funds in the end. And her aides said the senator\u2019s commanding performance during Wednesday\u2019s debate in Las Vegas had paid off  \u2013 driving $5 million into her campaign coffers in the day after the debate and attracting legions of first-time donors. So far in February, her campaign has raised $17 million \u2013 its best monthly financial showing to date, Warren officials said. Thursday\u2019s filings also underscore the lopsided spending by the billionaires seeking the Democratic nomination. Bloomberg, who has skipped the first four contests to focus on the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states, is in a class of his own after donating an unprecedented $464 million of his media and financial-data fortune to his campaign. Meanwhile, former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer plowed more than $267 million of his own funds into his campaign through the end of January. One sign of the the changing financial terrain in 2020: Warren \u2013 who made the rejection of big money a cornerstone of her presidential bid \u2013 on Thursday indicated she would not disavow help from Persist PAC, a new group that cropped up this week to boost her prospects. Speaking to reporters, Warren said that all the men remaining in the race \u201chad either super PACS or they were multi-billionaires, and could just, you know, rummage around in their sock drawers and find enough money to be able to fund a campaign.\u201d \u201cThe only people who didn\u2019t have them were the two women,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd at that point, there are some women saying, \u2018You know, that\u2019s just not right.\u2019 So here\u2019s where I stand: If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACS, count me in, I\u2019ll lead the charge. But that\u2019s how it has to be. It can\u2019t be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don\u2019t.\u201d The super PAC, which can raise unlimited funds from virtually any source but must operate independently of Warren, is spending nearly $800,000 on ads in Nevada, according to a tally by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Another super PAC has emerged to aid Klobuchar. Dubbed Kitchen Table Conversations, the pro-Klobuchar group has spent $1.1 million on ads in Nevada, which holds its caucuses Saturday, and the South Carolina primary a week later. Klobuchar\u2019s campaign officials said in October that they didn\u2019t want help from a super PAC. An aide said Wednesday that they stand by that position. The groups won\u2019t have to disclose their donors until mid-March \u2013 after Democrats in more than two dozen states have already weighed in. However, EMILY\u2019s List, a group that works to elect female candidates who support abortion rights, has donated $250,000 to each super PAC, EMILY\u2019s List spokeswoman Christina Reynolds said. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Daniella Diaz contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Doug Collins\u2019 Senate campaign in Georgia has prompted a raging intraparty fight leading to the departure of some of his top political advisers and recriminations with the Senate GOP\u2019s main campaign arm. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is accusing Collins of running against Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican incumbent appointed by the governor, out of his own \u201cselfish\u201d interests \u2013 while raising alarms that the bid has jeopardized the party\u2019s chances to hold onto two GOP seats and made it harder for President Donald Trump to carry the Peach State in the fall. The spat has squeezed Trump between Senate GOP leaders who have closed ranks behind Loeffler and Collins\u2019 allies who argue that the Georgia congressman helped lead the fight against the President\u2019s impeachment in the House and would be a loyal warrior for Trump in the Senate. Caught in the middle are a host of influential GOP strategists who have worked for Collins in the past but are reticent in getting caught up in a nasty battle that could hurt Republicans\u2019 chances at keeping control of the Senate majority. The congressman\u2019s pollster, John McLaughlin, who also polls for the President, won\u2019t join Collins\u2019 Senate campaign after the Trump campaign made clear that their consultants will not be working against sitting GOP senators, according to multiple sources. Several sources also told CNN that Collins\u2019 consultants from the firm Convergence Media, which worked on digital and email strategy for his House campaign, will not sign on with his Senate campaign. The internecine warfare has GOP leaders increasingly worried that the Georgia race is one of their two biggest vulnerabilities as they seek to hang onto the Senate majority in the fall, according to multiple officials. The other is a Republican primary for a US Senate seat in Kansas featuring the divisive conservative Kris Kobach. Mike Pompeo just created a major headache for Senate Republicans In Georgia, the Collins campaign is now accusing the NRSC of playing hardball by seeking to blackball its vendors, alleging the organization of  \u201cthreatening\u201d its vendors in a bid to choke off assistance to his campaign. The campaign would not specify which vendors had been threatened. \u201cThe Senate committee doesn\u2019t want any pesky voters getting involved in their version of democracy \u2026 they are trying to shut down any competition,\u2019 said Collins spokesman Dan McLagan. \u201cThe NRSC is threatening vendors, calling their clients and pressuring them to not work with us. Now, instead of a normal group of consultants, we are forming a group of grizzled freedom fighters taking on the establishment.\u201d McLagan, the Collins spokesman, added: \u201cDoug is clearly the best candidate, we\u2019re way ahead and we are facing a Romney Republican who has been bubble-wrapped by her many, many, many handlers because she\u2019s not a very compelling candidate. I\u2019d rather be us than them.\u201d The NRSC fired back. \u201cCollins is everything Georgians hate about Washington,\u201d said Kevin McLaughlin, the executive director of the NRSC. \u201cHe is a swamp creature that claims to be conservative. \u2026 Now, having made an emotional, ill-informed and selfish decision, he finds himself at a crossroads. Republicans who are working to reelect President Trump and retain the Senate majority hope he has a moment of clarity, does the right thing and walks away from this poor decision. Otherwise, voters will make it for him.\u201d In a statement, Loeffler spokesman Stephen Lawson praised the senator\u2019s record in Washington during her short tenure. GOP Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler, a businesswoman and co-owner of the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream, to fill the seat vacated after Sen. Johnny Isakson retired in December due to health concerns \u2013 even though the President urged Kemp to pick Collins. But the unusual setup of the special election has alarmed Senate Republicans because, they argue, multiple GOP candidates could split the electorate and elect a Democrat in November. Isakson calls for true bipartisanship and praises colleagues on both sides of the aisle in farewell speech The special election won\u2019t have a typical party primary. Instead, all the Democratic and GOP candidates will compete in the general election in November. And if one candidate gets above 50%, they will be elected to the Senate. If no candidate reaches a majority of the vote, then there will be a two-person runoff in January. Republicans worry that a bitter battle between Loeffler and Collins will divide their voters and make it easier for the Democratic candidate to secure a majority vote in the fall. Some state legislators, including some of Collins\u2019 allies, have pushed to change the rules to end the free-for-all and create party primaries in the race. But that prospect appears unlikely, especially since Kemp has threatened to veto the bill. Instead, Senate Republicans are privately hopeful that Collins changes his mind and decides to run for his House seat since the filing deadline isn\u2019t until March 6. Collins was forced to give up his leadership spot atop the influential House Judiciary Committee as he pursued the Senate seat, but at the request of the congressman, the House GOP made clear that the change won\u2019t take effect until March 12, according to GOP sources. Moreover, there\u2019s also another Senate seat on the ballot in the fall: David Perdue of Georgia. And there are fears that the nasty party fight could spill over to Perdue\u2019s race \u2013 and undercut his ability to secure an outright win in November. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see two Republicans fighting each other in a jungle general election, very unusual setup here,\u201d Perdue told CNN. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for anybody in Georgia.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s supporting Loeffler, Perdue said: \u201cI have one objective and that is to get this President reelected. The second objective is get myself reelected. And right now, we have a sitting US senator, and I\u2019m doing everything I can to help her be effective up here.\u201d The GOP divide has given Democrats\u2019 new hope in the state, whose changing demographics and rapidly growing population could help them win not only its first Senate seat in Georgia in 20 years, but also pick up a few House seats and even the White House. Democrats running in the Senate race against Loeffler and Collins include Rev. Raphael Warnock, Matt Lieberman, son of former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, and Ed Tarver, who served as a US attorney during the Obama administration. Other Democrats are also hoping to unseat Perdue this November. Warnock, the leader of Atlanta\u2019s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, has already gained the support of the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign-arm and state leaders like Stacey Abrams. \u201cHaving Congressman Collins in the race is not something we asked for, but we\u2019ll figure out how to navigate the situation and ensure all of our Republican colleagues are successful,\u201d said Sen. Todd Young, chairman of the NRSC. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bright future ahead of him \u2013 he has to decide what\u2019s right for him and his family.\u201d Collins, a chaplain in the Air Force Reserve who previously worked as a floor leader in the Georgia House, has strong ties to the base of the state party and proven himself as one of Trump\u2019s key defenders during the House impeachment proceedings. Loeffler, a major GOP donor and a first-time politician, immediately came under attack from anti-abortion groups for serving on the board of a major hospital in Atlanta. In November, Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said that alone \u201cshould disqualify her.\u201d But this week, in a sign of how conservative groups are coalescing behind Loeffler\u2019s candidacy, the anti-abortion group\u2019s candidate fund endorsed her. The conservative Club for Growth, which has spared with the NRSC in the past, has also announced plans for a multi-million ad campaign against Collins. The race has quickly turned into a contest for who can earn Trump\u2019s praise. Loeffler has expressed her support for Trump, while the NRSC\u2019s McLaughlin attacked Collins for withholding his \u201cearly support\u201d of Trump despite claiming \u201cto have been there from the beginning.\u201d (In the 2016 Republican primary, Collins first supported then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.) During the impeachment trial, Loeffler said that Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, wanted \u201cto appease the left\u201d in calling for witnesses during the impeachment trial, a highly unusual broadside launched by a sitting senator of the same party. Collins\u2019 campaign then criticized her in a digital ad for donating nearly to Romney\u2019s presidential races while giving nothing to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Some Collins strategists told CNN that the NRSC was privately blunt about the challenge in running against Loeffler. A Collins strategist said the NRSC \u201cdesperately wanted to get a hold\u201d of Collins the day before his announcement \u201cto try and convince him not to run against Loeffler.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of talk about the amount of money that she and her husband were going to spend,\u201d said the Collins strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to deter Doug.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you can even say for centuries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNearly every top Democrat in Congress now support taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth.\u201d Trump\u2019s claim is false. Although Democrats generally favor looser abortion laws and several states allow so-called \u201clate-term\u201d abortions, the procedures do not occur \u201cup until the moment of birth,\u201d as Trump claimed. He also reiterated an incendiary and false accusation against Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, saying he would \u201cexecute\u201d a baby even after it is born, a mischaracterization of a remark Northam made last year in which he was discussing fetuses that are nonviable. No Democrat has signaled support for killing infants after birth, as Trump suggested. \u201cSadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights, shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cThey are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice, and we will win because we know how to win.\u201d The Trump administration has consistently worked to regulate or restrict abortion access, appointed two Supreme Court justices seen as holding anti-abortion views and on Friday announced it will take legal action against California over the state\u2019s mandate that insurers, including private health insurance policies, cover abortions. The march aligns with the week of the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade this year, as per tradition, in an anti-abortion response to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide. The event was founded in 1974 by anti-abortion activist Nellie Gray, and typically attracts about 100,000 participants hailing from across the country. The plan is to continue the event until Roe is overturned, according to the march\u2019s organizers. Crowds had assembled on the National Mall on Friday morning well ahead of the event\u2019s 12 p.m. ET kickoff time. There was a festival-like atmosphere as music blared from speakers near the main stage. Many in attendance, including priests and school tours, had come from across the country to attend, some wearing pins and buttons. Among the messages on printed signs were \u201cLove Life / Choose Life,\u201d \u201cSave the Baby Humans\u201d and \u201cPro-Life Voices for Trump.\u201d Nancy Weber, 57, of St. Charles, Illinois, told CNN she left home at 4 p.m. Thursday in order to make the 15-hour drive to Washington to \u201cshow our support for life.\u201d She said an unplanned pregnancy earlier in her life, which resulted in her giving the child up for adoption, helped change her views. \u201cWhat is a world without children? Our greatest asset is people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do believe adoption is the loving option.\u201d The Nieves family of Connecticut, calling themselves \u201clifelong pro-lifers,\u201d made the decision to attend this year\u2019s march before they knew Trump was speaking. Although he\u2019s \u201cnot a huge Trump fan,\u201d said 22-year-old Matthew Nieves, \u201cit\u2019s fantastic that he\u2019s supporting this.\u201d After the rally\u2019s featured speakers concluded, attendees took to the streets for the march itself. With several blocks closed off to traffic, thousands of marchers sporting signs, flags, banners and clothing representing their group or home state flooded Constitution Avenue. While some groups posted graphic abortion-related images alongside the route, the march in many ways resembled a parade, with several groups singing and dancing \u2013 one group with yellow sweatshirts featured a drum line. Chants of \u201cwe love babies yes we do, we love babies how \u2018bout you?\u201d and \u201cI believe that we will win\u201d burst out among marchers. Trump is the first president to attend the march, March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said. He was also the first president to speak at the march via satellite feed when he addressed participants in 2018. Trump regularly discusses the need to restrict abortion rights on the campaign trail and has taken numerous actions in office to do so. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has reinstated a ban on US government funding for international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions, appointed anti-abortion judges and opposed abortions later in pregnancy. The Department of Health and Human Services has also advanced multiple measures to regulate or restrict abortion access, some with the professed aim of protecting health care providers\u2019 religious freedom, during his tenure. The Trump campaign will also create another anti-abortion rights coalition going into the 2020 election, as it did in 2016, to be helmed again by anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group\u2019s national spokeswoman announced on the eve of the march. The Friday event \u2013 themed \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman\u201d \u2013 features a rally on the National Mall followed by a march that concludes at the steps of the Supreme Court. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, and GOP Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey also spoke at the march. The march has enjoyed support from multiple Republican administrations in the past and Trump\u2019s has been no different. In 2017, Vice President Mike Pence and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway both spoke at the event, with the vice president doing so again in 2019. Former presidents have made telephone calls in to the march, with both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressing the event via phone.

The Democrats acting as the House\u2019s impeachment managers have spent the week arguing why President Donald Trump should be impeached, and have sought to aim their message at convincing four Republicans to vote with them for witnesses in the trial. Republicans, meanwhile, say the Democrats aren\u2019t doing anything new. Sen.

            "article_content": "Flanked by an independent counsel whose name is already etched into impeachment history and a marquee constitutional scholar who has stood beside some of the most notorious defendants in a generation, most lawyers would run the risk of being overshadowed. But Jay Sekulow, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorneys since his first few months in office, is just as accustomed to the spotlight. Having weathered the former special counsel\u2019s probe into Russian election interference, Sekulow has also proven himself adept at waging battles on behalf of the President \u2013 even when working off less-than-ideal facts. Sekulow will serve as a prime-time-tested counterweight to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel expected to lead Trump\u2019s defense team, when the Senate trial begins in earnest on Tuesday. The team is rounded out with Ken Starr, the famed independent counsel who made the last impeachment case, against Bill Clinton, and Alan Dershowitz, who represented OJ Simpson and Jeffrey Epstein. A litigator and media fixture for much of his career, Sekulow has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court. His turn as a top defender on the Senate floor starting this week, however, will be his highest-profile role on the biggest stage to date. Trump's 'strong, silent type' lawyer to take center stage during impeachment Sekulow, Cipollone and members of their team have spent more than a month shaping their arguments in preparation for the Senate trial \u2013 and yet sources close to the legal team say the speaking order of the lawyers involved and precise content of their arguments remain fluid heading into the start of the trial. A person familiar with the preparations said the legal team has built such flexibility into their defense because House Democrats have the opportunity to argue first, and Trump\u2019s lawyers expect to mold their presentation into a direct rebuttal of that case. Even so, the lawyers have settled on a general plan for how they\u2019ll proceed. Cipollone is expected to deliver the key opening argument, and Sekulow is expected to follow with a sweeping look at what he will portray as the unfair Democratic targeting of Trump going back to the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who has been assisting the White House for weeks, Jane Raskin, an attorney brought in to bolster the President\u2019s legal team during the Russia probe, and two deputies from Cipollone\u2019s office \u2013 Pat Philbin and Michael Purpura \u2013 are expected to have speaking roles on the Senate floor. Starr and Dershowitz, a constitutional expert, will also present limited arguments, with Cipollone and Sekulow likely appearing at multiple points during the defense, a person familiar with the legal team\u2019s preparations said. Sources close to the legal team said Trump\u2019s lawyers have prepared for the \u201ccontingency\u201d of having witnesses called during the trial, but the White House and Senate Republicans have fought to delay the witness question until after opening statements and questions from senators, citing the model used to try Clinton. Senate Democrats have argued the case is different due to what they allege is the administration\u2019s stonewalling, and have pushed to vote on calling witnesses at the outset of the trial. Trump lawyer: President was aware of 'nothing' Sekulow\u2019s association with Trump began years ago, when the two formed a relationship after attending several of the same events. His role on Trump\u2019s legal team, however, started in the throes of controversy over the President\u2019s decision in May 2017 to fire then-FBI Director James Comey as the bureau investigated his campaign\u2019s ties with Russia. Sekulow quickly became the most visible part of Trump\u2019s legal team, frequently going to bat for his client on cable news and on the eponymous daily radio show he has hosted since 1997. But his advocacy for Trump in the court of public opinion was not without its stumbles; in July 2017, Sekulow told CNN and other news outlets that the President was not involved in crafting a misleading statement about a Trump Tower meeting his son, son-in-law and campaign manager held in 2016. Trump had in fact dictated the statement from Air Force One. Sekulow\u2019s deep involvement in defending the President through the Russia investigation and after the publication of the special counsel\u2019s final report will inform his presentation before the Senate, which is expected to feature a review of some aspects of the Russia probe. The House didn\u2019t impeach Trump over his dealings with Russia or because of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. But the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, included a clear allusion to the Mueller probe when it mentioned Trump\u2019s \u201cprevious efforts to undermine United States Government investigations into foreign interference in United States elections.\u201d Raskin said the time she, Sekulow and others spent on the Russia case has made them ready to take on the challenge of defending Trump in his impeachment trial. \u201cWe went through the crucible and came out the other side,\u201d Raskin told CNN. \u201cWe thought it was over. When you\u2019ve had a special prosecutor on your tail, that has a tendency to focus the mind.\u201d \u201cIt prepared us for this. We\u2019ve done this once,\u201d she added. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any easier, but we came into this with a team who already worked together and it helped.\u201d Before he joined Trump\u2019s legal team, Sekulow argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court \u2013 many of them dealing with First Amendment and religious freedom issues. As the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, Sekulow has taken on a number of cases that involve Christian advocacy \u2013 including one case where he helped students successfully fight a Nebraska school that was preventing them from establishing a Bible study and another where he argued in favor of anti-abortion protesters\u2019 right to demonstrate outside abortion clinics. An enthusiastic drummer since he was 7, Sekulow continues to play in a band \u2013 named after himself \u2013 with touring musicians, although he said he\u2019s had far less time for music since impeachment accelerated through the House. Hinting at her colleague\u2019s musical inclinations, Raskin said of the legal team\u2019s reunion post-special counsel: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the band back together.\u201d \u201cJay is definitely the leader of the band,\u201d she said. Impeachment guide: Voting on the trial rules Trump\u2019s legal team hopes to end the impeachment trial as quickly as possible and has already laid out a pair of filings demonstrating its plan to argue primarily against the legality of the articles of impeachment \u2013 both because of what Trump\u2019s attorneys describe as an unfair procedure in the House and because of what they will argue was Trump\u2019s right as President to conduct diplomacy and deny congressional requests using his executive authority. William Consovoy, an attorney working with Sekulow on multiple cases, including another high-profile Trump case involving the President\u2019s tax returns, suggested Sekulow and others will also have to contend with the pressure to perform. \u201cThere\u2019s the strategic aspect, core legal aspect and presentation aspect,\u201d said Consovoy, who is himself an accomplished appellate attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s terrific at all of it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been involved in and leading serious cases on the national stage for a really long time now,\u201d he added. Trump has long wanted a robust, even theatrical defense aimed at vindicating, not just acquitting, him on the Senate floor. Known for his media savvy almost as much as his legal work, Sekulow is seen as someone who can bring more flare to the defense team, presenting alongside another lead attorney \u2013 Cipollone \u2013 who has less experience trying to shape public narratives. Sekulow likened his relationship with Cipollone to that of \u201cLennon and [Paul] McCartney,\u201d noting everything they\u2019ve done on Trump\u2019s legal team has been the product of total cooperation. The two had known each other for years through legal circles, but forged close working ties through their evolving roles representing Trump. Although Starr, Dershowitz and Robert Ray, Starr\u2019s successor during the Clinton administration, are expected to play more limited parts on behalf of Trump, Sekulow and Cipollone are leading what a person familiar with the preparations described as the \u201ccore team\u201d of Bondi, Raskin, Philbin, Purpura and others who have helped them prepare over long sessions since even before the House voted to advance articles of impeachment. Under a rules resolution proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, each side will have up to 24 hours to make their case, but they must do so over the course of just two days each. Senators will then have 16 hours for questioning, and only after the first portion of the trial is complete do Senate Republicans want to address the question of calling witnesses. But even with the proposed rules of the trial finally made public, uncertainty still surrounded the timeline heading into the first day of proceedings on Tuesday. People involved did not know, for example, how long the debate over the procedures would last, or whether a day designated for filing motions, Wednesday, would be consumed by the procedural moves or set aside for House managers to begin their opening arguments. Sekulow suggested the preparations have been grueling. \u201cTrying to sleep is a good accomplishment,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "A major anti-abortion group announced on Friday a $52 million budget in battleground states to reelect President Donald Trump and an anti-abortion Senate majority in 2020. The group Susan B. Anthony List and its super PAC Women Speak Out PAC unveiled a campaign that \u201cwill include boots on the ground, voter contact mail, phone calls, and digital ads, and is part of the organizations\u2019 overall $52 million budget for the 2020 cycle,\u201d according to a press release. SBA List has long been a strong Trump ally \u2013 the group\u2019s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, served as the national chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign\u2019s Pro-life Coalition. The group\u2019s announcement suggests a 2020 funding showdown over abortion rights brewing between rival advocacy groups. Planned Parenthood unveiled a $45 million 2020 electoral program in October focusing on battleground states \u2013 the group\u2019s self-identified largest program to date. SBA List\u2019s ground team \u201cwill expand in phases to Iowa, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin and will make four million visits to voters overall before Election Day,\u201d the press release continued. The group currently has about 200 canvassers working in Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, and has made more than 460,000 home visits so far in battleground states, according to a memo on the campaign. \u201cThe stakes of this election could not be higher,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, national spokeswoman for SBA List and its super PAC, adding that \u201cPresident Trump has governed as the most pro-life president in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d Quigley also falsely claimed that Democrats favor infanticide \u2013 the practice of killing a child after it has been born. Although Democrats widely support abortion rights, no candidate has expressed such a position. She indicated that the group would target demographics that historically backed Democrats. \u201cFrom now until Election Day, our team will go door-to-door visiting traditional Democrat voter groups who may simply be unaware of the Democrats\u2019 support for extreme pro-abortion policies,\u201d Quigley continued. \u201cOur focused, battle-tested voter outreach method will ensure we reach the voters who can provide President Trump and pro-life Senate candidates the winning margin on Election Day.\u201d Trump and SBA List have shown mutual support on several fronts. The group has cheered the administration\u2019s surge of judicial nominees and Department of Health and Human Services measures to regulate or restrict abortion access, as well as condemned the impeachment inquiry. Trump offered a keynote address at the group\u2019s Campaign for Life Gala in 2018.",

Matt Lieberman announced his hopes to follow in the footsteps of his father in a campaign video featuring his two daughters whom he raised as a single father. \u201cTo me it\u2019s personal. In 2000 I watched as the Supreme Court stole the election and changed the course of history. We need a Voting Rights Act for the 21st century,\u2019\u201d Lieberman says in his announcement video referencing the Florida recount battle that ensued following the 2000 presidential election in which his father was on the ticket. The Senate opening comes following the retirement of Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who plans to leave Congress at the end of 2019 with two years remaining on his term citing health reasons. The Republican governor will appoint an interim replacement for the seat and a special election will be held in November 2020 to determine who will fill Isakson\u2019s seat for the remainder of his term. In his announcement video, Lieberman \u2013 who does not have a history of elected office \u2013 highlights his experience as a teacher and an entrepreneur. He says he will push for a ban on so-called assault-style weapons and fight for abortion rights and voting rights. Lieberman also said he would refuse corporate PAC donations, which has been a growing trend among Democrats. Although Lieberman is the first Democrat to announce his bid, on the Republican side, high-profile lawmakers like Rep. Doug Collins \u2013 the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 have been among those mentioned as possible candidates, and Speaker Pro Tempore of the Georgia House, Jan Jones made public her interest in the seat earlier this week.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Lawrence C. Levy is executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University and a former columnist and editorial writer at Newsday who has covered eight presidential elections. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Once again, moderate suburban voters got their way and this year determined that Joe Biden will get the keys to the White House. While we\u2019ve seen the suburbs shift from red to purple and blue since the early 1990s, these voters delivered a message to both parties this year: Change, yes, but not so far, not so fast and not so furious. The question is whether Democratic progressives and Republican conservatives are listening. From self-styled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes to Donald Trump wannabes, firebrands from both parties must understand that rallying the base and taking a more polarized position might work in the primaries but appealing to moderates is the key to winning general elections. As we\u2019ve seen with Biden, middle ground consensus or compromise isn\u2019t always a cop-out to be avoided at all costs. As Trump learned, moderate \u201cswing\u201d suburbanites prefer to be soothed, not scared. In the 40 years that I\u2019ve been conducting research and writing about the suburbs as a journalist and academic, one thing has been abundantly clear: suburbanites tend to shy away from what they see as extremism of any stripe. This suburban sensibility cost Democrats during the counterculture battles and protests against the Vietnam War in the 60s and 70s that many blue-collar Democrats saw as unpatriotic. It also hurt Democrats in the 70s and 80s when suburbanites feared crime waves in large metropolitan areas could spread to their own neighborhoods. The party also took a hit soon after the 1992 election of Bill Clinton, whose moderate, triangulating instincts made the party seem safer to suburbanites. The backlash against Clinton\u2019s 1993 Health Security Act, nicknamed \u201cHillarycare\u201d by Republicans, was swift.  Moderates saw the health care reform package as an example of the federal government\u2019s overreach, and it helped usher in the GOP\u2019s Gingrich Revolution. With 'husbands' remark, Trump has sealed his fate with women Moderates have also been turned off when Republicans strayed too far to the right. Ironically, it was the overzealousness of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s pursuit in impeaching President Clinton, and his promotion of an uncomfortable \u201crevolutionary\u201d social and fiscal agenda that marked the start of the Suburban Retreat from the national GOP. According to exit polls, suburban voters turned \u2013 and turned out \u2013 against President Donald Trump this year. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the suburbs 49% to 45%. In Election 2020, Biden outpaced Trump 50% to 48%. As a mirror of the nation, it\u2019s not surprising that the two-point gap between the candidates nearly reflected the three-point gap in the national popular vote totals. A superb study of 373 suburban counties by The New York Times provides further evidence of the suburban shift. Biden averaged about 4.6 percentage points better among suburbanites than Clinton. He did even better in Georgia, widening the gap to eight points. And while it was only three points in Michigan and Wisconsin, the additional suburban votes may have been enough to flip those states Democratic. In Pennsylvania, which literally turned out to be the 2020 Keystone State, most of the media attention seemed to be on Philadelphia. But it wasn\u2019t the \u201cBrotherly Love\u201d in the city that put Biden over the top. Trump\u2019s paltry 18% there was actually three points better than he did four years ago. It was being blown away in the four Philadelphia \u201ccollar\u201d suburbs and suburban-ruralishexurbs beyond them that proved decisive this year. Democrats' all-out battle over who deserves credit for Biden win In the Atlanta suburbs, Biden\u2019s net gains over Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance was even more powerful, with increases in individual counties higher than that in the traditionally Democratic city itself. Where Clinton scored 69% in Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County and Biden 73%, suburban DeKalb County voters gave the now President-elect an amazing 83% on 17% higher turnout. In Michigan, another competitive state, Oakland County, a longtime Republican suburb outside Detroit continued its swift shift from red to blue by handing Biden at least 56,000 net votes more than Clinton, more than reversing her shocking statewide deficit four years earlier. By contrast, in Detroit, which most Democrats were watching intently as the votes rolled in, Biden did no better percentagewise than Clinton on similarly higher turnout. It\u2019s clear that moderate suburban voters were turned off by Trump in both style and substance, and his strategy of stoking race-based fears may have backfired. Poll after poll during the campaign showed the President underwater on issues suburbanites cared about, from the environment and health care to race relations and, most importantly Covid-19. His standing was especially low with minority suburbanites, who comprise an increasing share of the suburbanites, and suburban women, the so-called Volvo moms, who appeared to be abandoning President Trump in droves. Suburban Trump 2016 voter has a message for the President But in the 2020 election, the suburbs seem to have rendered a decidedly split decision, which could give Republicans hope that they\u2019ve slowed or stopped their suburban slide heading into a post-Trump era. Down ballot, it was the Democrats who paid a price this year in many swing suburban congressional districts. The Blue Wave of 2018, which washed away many Republican incumbents and challengers from once reliably suburban seats, receded significantly. Instead of expanding their majority, congressional Democrats lost ground in suburban and exurban neighborhoods, where suburbanites worried about the party\u2019s seeming leftward tilt, as reflected in the growing number of outspokenly progressive members (some of whom identify as democratic socialists). And that gave a lot of moderates pause. Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger put the blame squarely on progressives tossing around phrases like \u201cdefunding the police\u201d and \u201csocialism,\u201d as if every district were in bright blue Manhattan. \u201cWe need to not ever use the words \u2018socialist\u2019 or \u2018socialism\u2019 ever again. Because while people think it doesn\u2019t matter, it does matter. And we lost good members because of it,\u201d she said during a call with her colleagues. How to listen to Trump voters No, the Democratic underperformance nationwide wasn\u2019t enough to lose control of the House \u2013 overall, the party still held most of their gains. And changing demographics are working in the Democrats\u2019 favor. People of color, who tend to vote Democratic, are the fastest growing group in suburban communities. But, hopefully, the 2020 results were enough to remind Democrats \u2013 particularly impatient progressives \u2013 that the zeal for quick, transformational change could threaten the party\u2019s hold on power and make it more difficult to achieve its goals. While many suburban voters have come to embrace progressive causes over the years, from same-sex marriage and abortion rights to environmental protection and even income equality, they have tended to do so gradually. For those on the left and right who saw Joe Biden as a joke or worse, his success in suburbs throughout the nation should give them pause. They should see him not as an ideological impediment but as the embodiment of a widely appealing middle ground. And they should see the suburbs as a place from where compromise and consensus solutions can gain acceptance. In the end, Biden, with all his imperfections, was the perfect suburban candidate. It wasn\u2019t only his instinct for the middle, which manifested itself in both style and substance. This is a man who lived for decades in a suburban community in Delaware, and even from the exalted perch of a US Senator, engaged with his neighbors and commuted every weekday by train. Biden speaks the language of moderate suburbanites.  Former President Barack Obama may have chosen Biden as his running mate in 2008 based on his foreign policy chops and relationships with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. But it was Biden\u2019s ability to attract moderate, suburban swing voters that proved most valuable to Obama. The choice of Biden paid off for the urban and urbane Obama \u2013 just as the party\u2019s nomination of Biden has worked with the suburban gatekeepers through whose portal all presidents must pass.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. After four long years of chaos and lies from the Trump administration, it\u2019s time to prepare for the worst, even as we hope for the best. Every time we thought he could stoop no lower, that there were no boundaries of legality or decency left for him to violate, he has outdone himself. After praising dictators, attacking veterans, demeaning women, discrediting our democracy, and surrendering to a raging pandemic, we can only hope that Trump has also undone himself. We cannot know exactly what Trump will do in these final days, only that whatever it is, he will be thinking only of himself. If he declares victory on election night, regardless of the uncounted ballots, what then? What if he calls the entire election a fraud, a hoax, and demands that the counting stop? Or if armed Trump supporters heed his call to intimidate voters at the polls? What if he takes to Twitter with \u201cLIBERATE AMERICA!\u201d and his MAGA zealots respond? You may roll your eyes, but such things are not unimaginable, or even unrealistic. Normal people don\u2019t like to imagine terrible events, which is why autocrats consistently surprise them. (As when I wrote here back in April that it would seem logical to someone like Trump to try to sabotage the US Postal Service if he thought it could help his electoral chances. Unimaginable, until it happened.) You could make a very long list of things pundits insisted autocrats would never do that they eventually did. I made such a list myself, about Vladimir Putin. In my 2015 book, \u201cWinter Is Coming,\u201d I called it the \u201cPutin would never\u201d list. It included things like taking over private media companies, arresting Russia\u2019s richest man for dabbling in politics and invading Georgia and Ukraine. If Trump loses and won't leave, it could get ugly \u201cDoesn\u2019t Putin realize how bad this looks?\u201d became the experts\u2019 refrain after he crossed line after uncrossable line. As if he cared how things looked. Why should he? Dictators don\u2019t ask \u201cWhy?\u201d They only ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d They don\u2019t stop unless someone stops them. No one stopped Putin. For years, my colleagues and I in the Russian democracy movement warned that Putin was building a dictatorship. Even when it was crystal-clear that Russian democracy and civil society had been gutted, the free world fiercely resisted acknowledging that truth. Putin laid bare the huge disconnect between autocrats and normal people \u2013 the autocrats\u2019 ability to do things that simply don\u2019t occur to people with a sense of decency and a respect for norms and traditions. Autocrats are aware of the consequences they might face for the damage they do, but they believe they can avoid those consequences by staying in power, forever if necessary. Trump might have been indicted several times over were he not protected by his office, and a sense of impunity tends to make one sloppy. Trump no doubt believes that he has more to lose by leaving office than by fighting \u2013 lawlessly or not \u2013 to stay. The oligarchs and thugs he so admires surely agree. They won\u2019t easily let go of such a lucrative investment \u2013 one of their own kind in the Oval Office. Putin and Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, to name two, have surely reaped many benefits from Trump, beyond political ones. It will take years to untangle the web of his financial dealings and how the treasure and might of the United States was exploited to serve the President\u2019s personal interests and those of his cronies. If defeated, Trump will likely spend his last months in a flurry of self-dealing, tossing out pardons and trying to discredit his opponents and the system itself. But what if he wins? Even the dire scenarios I just outlined are predicated on avoiding the worst outcome of all. Let\u2019s say Trump stays in office, either by a shocking electoral upset or by his hand-picked Supreme Court justices doing what he chose them to do.  Rolling your eyes again? Do you really think Trump cares about limiting abortion rights or Constitutional originalism or anything else he cannot fit into his pockets? Or that Mitch McConnell and the GOP rushed Amy Barrett\u2019s appointment for any reason other than having her seated before the election? She and Brett Kavanaugh were political appointments to achieve political ends, which is always how autocrats view the judiciary. A Trump victory would legitimize his politics and policies the way his election in 2016 normalized his rhetoric. Then, after four more years of Trumpism, the only question would likely be: Who is the next Trump in line? The autocrat\u2019s heirs could be expected to carry on the assault on the remaining pillars of American democracy. When one side fights for power at all costs against those defending the rule of law, time is not on the side of the law. Defeating Trump overwhelmingly at the polls is the most important step, but it\u2019s only the first step. Americans who want to see the rule of law restored and strengthened must be ready to fight for it \u2013 in the courts and in the streets if necessary, peacefully but persistently \u2013because there is little doubt that Trump and his supporters will not go quietly. Trump has spent five years dehumanizing his opponents and painting them as America\u2019s mortal enemies while conditioning his followers to see things as he does. They will not leave the field easily, but leave they must, or American democracy will not outlast them.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. When I moved from California to Texas in 2006, I felt an overwhelming sense of coming home. My conservative values, including a reverence for God and a desire to preserve small government, were accepted and reinforced by the culture in the Lone Star State. And it was in Texas that I left the ranks of news and began my career in conservative talk radio and television. Fast forward 14 years, and Americans are facing an election unlike any other we\u2019ve experienced. In an effort to better understand and gauge the strength of conservative voters in Texas ahead of the 2020 contest, I recently posed two questions to my radio audiences in the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth areas: Why are you voting for President Donald Trump, and what do you want from Washington, DC? The responses I received coalesced around two themes. The first was the preservation of our liberties and freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. The second was a fervent desire for the federal government to get the hell out of our way. Many conservatives are devoted to the idea that the government that governs least, governs best. One listener, Frank, called in and told me he and his wife voted at a packed polling place in the Woodlands, a community just north of Houston. He explained that his vote for Trump was an expression of his conservative values and said, \u201cLess government is best.\u201d He was concerned, as am I, that Democrats have expanded the authority of the government beyond what the founding fathers intended. Take Obamacare, as an example. It\u2019s highly unlikely the founders envisioned a government would force its citizens, under threat of tax, to buy a product they may or may not want. And Trump\u2019s move to strike down this provision of the bill was exactly what Frank and I believed necessary to preserve one aspect of our freedoms. The three biggest myths about battleground states Another listener, Karl, from Itasca, Texas, a small community outside the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, told me that he\u2019d prefer Trump because, \u201cI want to remain free in this nation.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that many on the right share, and it highlights the divide between conservatives, who champion the rights of the individual, and liberals, who are willing to limit some of those rights in service of what they consider the \u201ccollective good.\u201d Ironically, it\u2019s the American conservative who understands the sage advice often attributed to the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu: \u201cGovern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it.\u201d For many Texas conservatives, it\u2019s worrying that Democrats have been far more critical of Trump\u2019s response to what he calls the \u201cChina virus,\u201d than they have been of China\u2019s withholding of critical information that exacerbated the spread of the pandemic. As of writing this article, Democrats on the campaign trail have not placed a strong emphasis on holding China responsible for its role in concealing intel at the start of the pandemic. Texas state Sen. Paul Bettencourt also called in to the show and expressed pride in Trump\u2019s achievements on the courts, including the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy left by the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. Like Bettencourt, many conservatives have watched in horror as the courts, stacked by liberals during the Obama years, have turned into political entities. From abortion to voting integrity to national security, liberal judges have worked to stymie laws and executive orders issued by Republicans, arguing in many cases that they violate the US Constitution. To demonstrate the absurdity of their logic, one court said that even though it is illegal for foreign nationals to vote in US elections, it was unconstitutional to ask for proof of citizenship when someone registered to vote. The judges who decided the case? Judges Mary Beck Briscoe, Monroe McKay and Jerome Holmes, who were nominated by Presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, respectively. The new Texas 'Spindletop' might be ready to blow From the right\u2019s perspective, it has been Democrats who have used the courts to advance their political agenda when they can\u2019t get that agenda passed in Congress. Even Ginsburg said the Roe v. Wade decision, legalizing abortion, might have come to soon. \u201cMy criticism of Roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum on the side of change,\u201d she said in remarks at the University of Chicago Law School. Conservative critics would take it would one step further and argue that Roe led to increased rancor in the country because we never had the chance, as a people, to debate the issue and pass a legislative solution. When it comes to what conservatives want from our federal government, David, from Midlothian, Texas, expressed frustration with the tumult and vitriol in Washington, DC. He told me that he recognized that we \u201ccouldn\u2019t go back\u201d to a more unified time, but he wished lawmakers would be more \u201crespectful\u201d of one another. In my view, tensions have escalated largely because of Democrats, who destroyed many of the norms that have kept the peace in Washington for decades. It was Democrats who first went nuclear, when they removed the filibuster for most presidential nominees in 2013. It was Democrats who ignored GOP input and passed Obamacare, which has done little to lower the costs of premiums and deductibles for many many Americans, according to a 2020 analysis from The Kaiser Family Foundation. In fact, since 2008, Kaiser reports that \u201caverage family premiums have increased 55 percent, twice as fast as workers\u2019 earnings (26%) and three times as fast as inflation (17%).\u201d And it was Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee this month who, in a brazen, yet predictable act of incivility, boycotted the vote to advance the nomination of Barrett, a highly qualified judicial thinker and legal mind.  Of course, Texas conservatives aren\u2019t looking to eliminate government. Rather, we seek a government that is a servant of \u201cwe the people.\u201d Former President Ronald Reagan once said government should \u201cstand by our side, not ride on our back.\u201d That\u2019s a clever way of saying that government should limit its involvement to its clearly delineated constitutional functions. This vision of government is in alignment with many of my conservative listeners, who believe that Democrats and their democratic socialist allies wish to place an unfair financial burden on every American, and at the cost of our rights and liberties. When Trump was elected, many of us marveled at how we elected our second \u201cCitizen President.\u201d Trump was not a lifelong politician or creature of the government establishment. He brought a fresh energy and perspective to politics. And like many of our listeners, I worry that if he loses on November 3, we may never have another citizen president like him again.",

The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. I am haunted by the memory of a very young, pregnant girl I met at a clinic in Kisumu, Kenya. She had been raped. Her mother had brought her to the clinic saying she had a stomachache. The girl stared at the floor and didn\u2019t speak. No one told the girl that terminating the pregnancy was an option, even though there was an abortion clinic literally across the road. Looking at her tiny frame, I wondered if she would survive a pregnancy. I was witnessing the Trump administration\u2019s handiwork. Kenya had liberalized its abortion law in an effort to reduce maternal mortality, but the country\u2019s decision and that girl\u2019s choice was effectively overridden by our government. Time and again, President Donald Trump and his administration have taken the political stance that it is they who should control the bodies of women and girls. Now, right before the election, Trump and Senate Republicans have installed on the Supreme Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who holds anti-abortion views and \u2013 deflections during her confirmation hearings aside \u2013 whose vote could help cement a majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, which would destroy a decades-long precedent for abortion rights in the US. One of the very first acts of his administration in January 2017 was to reinstate and expand the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule (GGR), which strips funding from any foreign non-governmental organizations that perform, provide counseling on, make referrals for abortion or lobby for the liberalization of abortion law. First implemented by former President Ronald Reagan, the policy had been in place under Republican presidents and rolled back under Democratic presidents since. Trump's ban on global abortion funding has led to more abortions Earlier iterations of the GGR were more narrow applying to only those receiving funding for reproductive health. President Trump expanded the policy\u2019s impact by extending it to all types of US global health assistance (such as for HIV and malaria) to ensure the policy is \u201cenforced to the broadest extent possible\u201d and has even extended the ban to any group working with a group receiving US global health assistance even if the partnering groups do not receive US funding. This administration clearly does not respect science or women. But as we hurl towards November 3, it is important to recognize that when it comes to reproductive rights, their rhetoric does not match the evidence. This policy has not reduced abortion, it has not succeeded. It has only managed to wreak havoc on modest gains in sexual and reproductive health outcomes and rights for women and girls. To stop this, we must end the GGR. Americans are not just voting for ourselves \u2013 we are voting for women around the world. The truth is that abortion has never just been about the medical procedure itself. It is about women and girls having bodily autonomy and economic equality, It\u2019s about the very high rates of sexual and physical violence around the world. It\u2019s about access to contraception and preventing maternal mortality due to unsafe abortion or children giving birth. This policy, the expanded GGR, has not achieved the administration\u2019s stated goal to decrease abortion rates. What it did do was reduce global access to contraception, reproductive health care, HIV treatment and other basic health services for women. Michelle Obama and Melinda Gates: We can't ignore adolescent girls in Covid-19 response A recent study conducted by my colleagues and I examined the impact of the GGR since 2017 in three countries heavily dependent on US global health assistance: Nepal, Madagascar and Kenya. According to our published findings from Kenya, and forthcoming publications from Madagascar and Nepal, the GGR caused critical funding losses to organizations and health systems in all three countries. Clinics have been forced to close. Doctors and nurses have lost their jobs. Basic supplies have run low, and training has ended. In the past, the GGR restriction only applied to sexual and reproductive health. Under the expanded GGR, restrictions now apply to all global health assistance funding, which was 7.5 billion in FY2020. The result has been particularly devastating for women in rural areas, where there is often just one clinic providing an array of services. Make no mistake: women and girls suffer because of this policy. Needed clinics have closed. Family planning methods that were previously free or subsidized now cost more, forcing women to switch methods or stop using contraception altogether. In Madagascar, I have seen women who have to choose between buying food for their families or paying for their contraceptive method. Because so many providers are afraid to lose their funding if they have even a slight connection to an organization which makes abortion referrals, these policies propagate fear and disrupt basic sexual and reproductive healthcare.  Each country we studied has vastly different laws and policies on abortion, yet no matter how varied the policies, our data make clear that the GGR still doesn\u2019t significantly impact abortion rates. Nepal and Kenya changed their policy in recent years in an effort to reduce high maternal mortality rates, recognizing that unsafe abortion was killing women and girls. Nepal, Madagascar and Kenya all have high rates of sexual and gender-based violence, according to data from UN Women and the US policy only hinders these countries\u2019 ability to address this crises. In the wake of sexual violence, access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare is critical If the US truly wants to reduce abortion rates at home and abroad, Americans should vote in political leaders whose policies will increase access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and services for gender-based violence, not decrease it.",

In a season of campaign schwag, a baseball cap caught my eye. Beneath an American flag were the words \u201cMake Lying Wrong Again.\u201d It framed the stakes of the election in a simple way. Does lying matter anymore? Honesty has always been considered a keystone of character. Even children know lying is wrong. This is clearly communicated in our faith traditions as well.  For example, the Bible warns against some form of lying at least 116 times. It\u2019s right there in the 10 commandments \u2013 \u201cThou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\u201d and echoed from the Old Testament (\u201cA righteous man hateth lying\u2026\u201d Proverbs 13:5)  to the New Testament (\u201cDo not lie to one another\u2026\u2019 Colossians 3:9-10). Whether lying matters is, of course, not an idle question. A core component of President Donald Trump\u2019s coalition is evangelical Christians \u2013 people who have righteously railed against a lack of character and ethics in the White House in the past and advocated for a return to family values. This presumably does not include lying. But the fact is that conservative Christian voters supported Donald Trump in 2016 at a higher rate than they did George W. Bush, a born-again Christian whose faith shaped his \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d politics. Few would use the same phrase to describe Trump, who commands evangelical respect, even though the respect is not necessarily returned in private. He does not seem preoccupied with questions of Christian ethics in action and there is no evidence that he feels a particular fidelity to the truth. Let me say it more plainly: it is not biased to describe Trump as a liar. It is a matter of objective and demonstrable fact. The Washington Post has catalogued more than 22,000 false or misleading claims over the course of his time in office \u2013 and those are just the ones that he\u2019s uttered in public. And he has lied as much as 50 times a day during the final stretch of this campaign. \u201cThe depths of his dishonesty is just astounding to me,\u201d Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, Marine Gen. John Kelly has told friends, \u201cThe dishonesty, the transactional nature of every relationship, though it\u2019s more pathetic than anything else. He is the most flawed person I have ever met in my life.\u201d Trump is battling a new disease: empathy envy Historians generally agree that character is the most important quality for a president. There\u2019s a reason that our greatest president\u2019s nickname is Honest Abe. But in Donald Trump\u2019s Washington, lying has become normalized. Perhaps the most recent and stark sign of it was in the abandonment of alleged principle to push forward the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. More than 40 Republican Senators declared that they would not advance a Supreme Court nomination in an election year to justify the unprecedented blocking of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 pick Merrick Garland. The most notorious was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said: \u201cI want you to use my words against me: If there\u2019s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, \u2018Let\u2019s let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination.\u2019 And you could use my words against me and you\u2019d be absolutely right.\u201d When that exact circumstance occurred, Graham shrugged it off. You can call it situational ethics. You can call it the triumph of partisan politics over principle. You can also call it shameless lying. The irony is that perhaps the most religious and socially conservative Supreme Court nominee in decades will have been put in place by an abandonment of the basic ethical standard known as the Golden Rule, articulated in the Bible as \u201cDo to others as you would have them do to you.\u201d For many conservative Christians, the ends may justify the means in this case. Other partisans will reach for whataboutism and point to lies by previous Democratic presidents.  But in terms of the sheer volume of lies, we\u2019ve never seen anything like President Trump. For voters motivated by questions of faith and ethics, how should they view the President\u2019s lying and the effect it seems to be having on our politics? I asked two priests what role they thought it should play in election calculations. Refugees like my ancestors are part of what made America great \u201cHow should Christians account for a pattern of lying in casting their vote?\u201d reflected the Reverend Don Waring of Grace Church in New York. \u201cQuite simply, they should not vote for anyone who deliberately deceives. Lying is a mortal sin, and the kingdom of God is not advanced through unrighteous means. It never does anyone any good to have public officials in office who play fast and loose with the truth. One lie leads to another, and it always catches up to them. Then we are all embroiled in distracting public scandals that taint the whole political process.\u201d In his view, normalizing lies threatens to drag our whole democracy down. But the Reverend Al Zadig, of St. Michael\u2019s Church in Charleston, South Carolina, no doubt reflects the views of other conservative Christians by weighing lying against other sins. \u201cCertainly, there is a presidential character that requires truth telling,\u201d Zadig says. \u201cLying is a sin. There is no hierarchy of sin in the eyes of God although the consequences may be different in society. This creates a real struggle for many clergy and people of faith with the sin of murder from the perspective of abortion. \u2026Again, sin is non-hierarchical, but the consequences between lying and murder are so vastly different. As a priest, it provides an honest and powerful dilemma. But the common nature of what we call the seven deadly sins is that they kill the heart and the soul of a person.\u201d Good people can disagree about abortion \u2013 especially if they see a difference between personal decisions and political prohibitions. But a look back at the seven deadly sins \u2013 lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride \u2013 is a reminder of just how many Donald Trump embraces as a matter of his core brand. He has long been an avatar for greed and conspicuous consumption (chased by platters full of fast food), with tabloid sexcapades he wore both as a badge of honor and a sign of virility. Pride defines him \u2013 and many of his lies are about bolstering his reputation. His ego also reflects his insecurity and envy while wrath defines his political style. Regardless, all of these are overlooked or unremarked upon by Trump partisans.  Instead, the President\u2019s favorite weapon\u2014projection \u2014 is deployed at political opponents, regardless of truth. Even Joe Biden\u2019s political opponents in the Senate acknowledge that he is a decent and honest man even if they fundamentally disagree with him on policy. But to muddy the moral waters, the Trump campaign has tried to spread totally baseless accusations \u2013 some truly sordid and others simply designed to deflect, including a series of Facebook ads that claim \u201cJoe Biden is a liar and needs to be held accountable.\u201d The goal is to try and convince folks that both candidates are liars, and so they can take that issue off the table. In perfect circularity, the ads are themselves lies. All of this is to say that if religion and virtue matter when casting your vote, then lying should matter as well. Because honesty matters. Character matters. On the flip side, campaigns that focus on fear or greed run counter to basic tenets of faith. If we overlook these bedrock virtues to focus instead on one or two policy positions \u2013 no matter how deeply held \u2013 we lose sight of the most fundamental teachings of faith and run the risk of reaping the whirlwind as a society.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Ilya Shapiro is director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute and author of the new book Supreme Disorder: Judicial Nominations and the Politics of America\u2019s Highest Court. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. No real news came out of the three days of Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. As expected, Democrats focused on Obamacare and abortion, with a little bit on guns and voting rights. Also as expected, the nominee declined to discuss any pending or potential cases, or any legal issue on which she hadn\u2019t already opined in scholarly or judicial writings. For their part, Republicans allowed Barrett to show her intellect and verbal facility by explaining such frequently used terms as \u201coriginalism\u201d (interpreting constitutional provisions according to their original public meaning), \u201ctextualism\u201d (interpreting statutes according to the plain meaning of their text as opposed to legislative purpose), and stare decisis (letting erroneous precedents stand because correcting them would cause more social harm than allowing the error to persist). In all, no senator\u2019s vote was changed. However, the public, which according to a CNN poll last week was divided on Barrett\u2019s nomination, did get a chance to sympathize more with the judge, who showed grace and poise under pressure. Like it or not, she will be confirmed before the election, barring a black swan event, like a massive Covid-19 spread that prevents the Senate from meeting or some Kavanaugh-like post-hearing allegations. Does that mean the hearings are pointless, a kabuki process that wastes everyone\u2019s time? Elsewhere I\u2019ve written that they once served a purpose but have at best devolved into empty platitudes and gotcha games. I won\u2019t rehash those arguments here, other than to note that it may have served the Democrats better to parallel the Merrick Garland maneuver of four years ago by abstaining from what they consider to be a pointless exercise \u2014 refraining from attacking Barrett\u2019s views while making a process argument to the voters. Ashley Judd: Women, we are in the fight of our lives Of course, they didn\u2019t do that, so we\u2019ve been treated to what then-professor Elena Kagan called a \u201cvapid and hollow charade.\u201d But even if we didn\u2019t learn anything this week, there was refreshing clarity on the parties\u2019 divergent judicial philosophies. By that I don\u2019t mean whether Roe v. Wade was correctly decided or the scope of the Second Amendment, but the difference between law and policy. To take two contrasting examples from Wednesday\u2019s session: (1) Republican Senator from Texas Ted Cruz discussed how he favors school choice \u2014 calling it \u201cthe civil rights issue of the next century\u201d \u2014 but that it\u2019s not the place of a federal judge to impose it, while (2) Democratic Senator from Hawaii Mazie Hirono called the distinction between law and policy \u201cartificial\u201d  in arguing that the Affordable Care Act must be constitutional because so many people depend on it. Indeed, each of the Democratic senators had blown up pictures of constituents who would be harmed if Obamacare went away. Now, emotional arguments are all well and good if you\u2019re trying to appeal to an electorate \u2014 as California Senator Kamala Harris used most of her time to do with regard to everything from health care to climate change, because she\u2019s the Democratic nominee for Vice President. But judges are supposed to do something else: They\u2019re supposed to apply the law, which sometimes leads to unpopular outcomes. Judicial power is not a means to an end, but an enforcement mechanism for the strictures of a founding document intended just as much to curtail the excesses of democracy as to empower its exercise. Amy Coney Barrett grilled on voting rights as 2020 election is underway In a country ruled by law, the proper response to an unpopular legal decision is to change the law or amend the Constitution. Any other method leads to a sort of judicial abdication and the loss of those very rights and liberties that can only be vindicated through the judicial process. Nevertheless, given the expansion of federal power, and then the shifting of that power away from the people\u2019s legislative representatives and toward executive branch administrative agencies, the judiciary affects public policy more than it ever did. And court decisions increasingly hinge on the partisan affiliation of the president who nominated the judges making them. With the two parties adopting incompatible judicial philosophies, it\u2019s impossible to find an \u201cuncontroversial\u201d nominee. That\u2019s doubly so when a nominee\u2019s philosophy represents a big shift from that of the previous justice. As Democratic Senator from Delaware Chris Coons highlighted, Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were often on opposite ends of close cases. Replacing Ginsburg with Scalia\u2019s former clerk Barrett would mean a bigger change than replacing the moderate Anthony Kennedy with his former clerk Brett Kavanaugh.  Those jurisprudential differences, and their alignment with ideologically distinct parties, are a relatively new phenomenon; in the grand sweep of American history, things didn\u2019t always line up so neatly. But regardless, the Barrett hearings showed that the parties do have different approaches to the law \u2014 and that Democrats don\u2019t see legal questions as divorced from political ones.",

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Judge Amy Coney Barrett delivered a relatively flawless showing in her controversial Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. A few hours into the questioning a senator asked her to display the notes she was using to provide her detailed answers. She picked up a white notepad with nothing on it but the inscription, \u201cUnited States Senate\u201d as the hearing room erupted in laughter. With six of her seven children, her husband and other family members watching proudly from the seats behind her, Barrett demonstrated a keen intellect, along with a formidable self-confidence leavened by just the right splash of humility under hours of senatorial questioning. That questioning was mostly respectful. Those waiting to hear Sen. Kamala Harris deliver the kind of fierce prosecutorial attack she aimed at Brett Kavanaugh during his 2018 confirmation hearing instead heard her launch into what sounded like a stump speech about the evils of Donald Trump and his attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act. After a couple of fearsome sounding \u201cPlease answer with a yes or no\u201d questions about nothing even remotely memorable, Harris lapsed into another monologue about Ruth Bader Ginsburg and abortion rights. Virtually all her questions were a retread of questions and topics covered earlier in the day. The vice-presidential candidate didn\u2019t even lay a glove on the unscarred Barrett. Also notable was the absence of focus on Judge Barrett\u2019s active and devout Roman Catholicism. Politicians are afraid of offending the 70 million Roman Catholics in the United States. Although most Catholics probably don\u2019t practice their faith with the fervor of Judge Barrett, throwing stones at a smart Catholic woman with a large family would have been a monstrous mistake \u2013 and it showed in the tepid questions directed at her. Republicans might have been fearful that her association with the charismatic Catholic People of Praise group would lead to her being unfairly characterized as a religious nut like a character from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d She, however, exceeded all expectations, never losing composure and maintaining that even judicial temperament. There's no good case against confirming Amy Coney Barrett Barrett deftly fielded questions about Roe v. Wade, honoring it as a reaffirmed precedent of the Supreme Court but denying it the title of \u201csuper precedent.\u201d She patiently explained that according to legal experts \u201csuper-precedent\u201d status is only awarded to legal cases like Brown v. Board of Education and other cases which are not disputed by \u201cany serious person.\u201d Nonetheless she declined any comment on overruling Roe, pledging an open mind and never allowing her \u201cpersonal\u201d opinions to interfere with a correct interpretation of the law. In an obviously coordinated effort, Democrats complained about a \u201crushed\u201d confirmation process taking place while Americans are already voting in a pandemic-hit presidential election. They displayed posters depicting seriously ill constituents stating their lives would be destroyed if the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, were ruled unconstitutional. The senators with their \u201cShow & Tell\u201d displays looked like they were pleading with Judge Barrett for favorable rulings in future cases because they have no way to prove her unqualified for a Supreme Court slot. Throughout the hearing Democrats repeatedly asserted that Barrett would likely rule against the Affordable Care Act (ACA). When confronted with the possibility that she might overturn the Affordable Care Act based on comments she made in a law journal article, Judge Barrett said even though it would be improper to talk about a pending case, there might be a way to save the statute using  the judicial concept of \u201cseverability,\u201d which sometimes permits an unconstitutional part of a statute to be \u201csevered,\u201d saving the remainder of the act. While not committing to how she would rule, Barrett claimed to have a completely open mind about the constitutionality of the ACA in its current form now that Congress has removed the \u201cpenalty\u201d provision. \u201cI have made no promises and I have no agenda,\u201d she said repeatedly. Democrats know they will lose on Barrett, but are aiming for a bigger win Much of the hearing focused on such matters as Barrett\u2019s judicial philosophy of Constitutional \u201coriginalism\u201d and \u201ctextualism.\u201d She believes the Constitution should be interpreted with the original intent of the founding fathers in mind and statutes should be interpreted in accordance with the actual words or \u201ctext\u201d used by legislators. Judges should not impose their own policy beliefs to advance changing cultural norms. One of the more interesting lines of questioning of the day was pursued by Judge Barrett\u2019s fellow mid-Westerner, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar recalled going on hiking trips with her mother on snow covered trails in northern Minnesota. They would follow the footprints of deer or other animals hoping to get a glimpse at one. Klobuchar\u2019s point: that the only way to determine Barret\u2019s likely decisions on such controversial issues as abortion and the ACA is to follow her tracks in prior writings and published decisions. Klobuchar added that following these tracks suggests to her that Barrett will deprive needy Americans of their health insurance and deny women the right of abortion as defined in Roe v. Wade. Barrett strongly disagreed, stating that she decides matters on a case by case basis applying the law as it is written, not as she would personally like the law to be. Throughout the day she invoked words of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when asked similar questions at her own confirmation hearing about pending cases: \u201cNo hints, no previews, no forecasts.\u201d  Judge Barrett\u2019s journey through Klobuchar\u2019s snow-covered trail was a great metaphor, but it only led to Harris\u2019 uninspired video appearance during the early evening hours. Harris, who refused to attend the hearing in person because of Covid-19 fears, looked a bit harried as she questioned Barrett. When the senator was done, the judge still had the blank, white piece of Senate stationery sitting untouched before her. No one in \u201cThe World\u2019s Greatest Deliberative Body\u201d had asked a question tough enough to require even a scribbled note.",

He is the author of the new book, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has been part of a shadowy group that recruits like-minded people and seeks to impose strict, even extreme, control over those below them.  The group is ultra-conservative and is well on its way to taking control of your sex life, your family life, your economic rights, your voting rights. I am not referring to any religious group \u2013 attacks on Judge Barrett\u2019s religious affiliations are, in my opinion, unfair, unwarranted, and unwise. As a faithful Catholic myself, I defend Judge Barrett\u2019s right to belong to the ecumenical People of Praise and for that association to never be held against her. What I do hold against her is that she has been part of  a different group \u2013 one far more powerful than a religious organization: The Federalist Society. Barrett was a member from 2005-06 and 2014-17. She ended her membership when she joined the appeals court, but she continues to be a panelist and speaker at Federalist Society events. As Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has said (and I have written in my book), The Federalist Society is more than a group of right-wing lawyers sucking up for clerkships and judicial jobs (though it is that). It is also, Whitehouse alleges, a \u201cvehicle for powerful interests, which seek not to simply \u2018reorder\u2019 the judiciary, but to acquire control of the judiciary to benefit their interests.\u201d Having studied the group, Whitehouse has concluded, \u201cThe evidence is that the Federalist Society is funded by massive, secret contributions from corporate right-wing groups that have big agendas before the courts.\u201d Citing reporting by the Washington Post, Whitehouse and fellow Senate Democrats Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) claim Federalist co-chair Leonard Leo, \u201cis at the heart of a network of more than two dozen right-wing nonprofit entities \u2013 groups that raised over $250 million between 2014 and 2017 alone\u2026to promote far-right policies and legal doctrines and the judicial nominees who advance them.\u201d On abortion, Amy Coney Barrett doesn't speak for American Christians The Senate Democrats\u2019 study cites Koch Industries and the Charles & David Koch foundations, the Scaife Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the US Chamber of Commerce as among the organizations funding The Federalist Society. The analysis suggests that more than a quarter of all Federalist funding flows through a group called Donors Trust, whose \u201cstructure hides the real identities of politically motivated megadonors.\u201d Whitehouse is a former federal prosecutor and Attorney General of Rhode Island. He is also a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  When Judge Barrett comes before that committee, expect more fireworks about her being part of the Federalist Society than any religious group. After all, many of us believe in an all-powerful God.  Few believe in an all-powerful corporation.  But those few seem to be in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to selecting the members of the Supreme Court. The Federalist Society, according to former Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn, plays an outsize role in choosing the judges Trump nominates. McGahn told the pressure group as much in 2017, boasting that rather than outsourcing judicial selection to the group, Trump had brought them inside the White House. \u201cOur opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges. That is completely false,\u201d McGahn said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the Federalist Society since law school \u2014 still am. So, frankly, it seems like it\u2019s been insourced.\u201d Amy Coney Barrett a perfect choice for half of America The Federalists, lawyers that they are, baffle us with BS about being \u201coriginalists,\u201d \u201ctextualists,\u201d and judges who \u201cwon\u2019t legislate from the bench.\u201d  Baloney. They seek nothing less than a fundamental reordering of American life.  On the economy, for example, Federalist member Justice Neal Gorsuch has ruled that a corporation had the right to fire a truck driver who refused to stay with his trailer, even though remaining with the trailer may have meant freezing to death. Corporations should have the power of life and death over their employees \u2013 in Federalist Society America. In our personal lives, Federalist Society members seek to give government power over whether a woman can choose to have an abortion. Federalist hero Justice Clarence Thomas has written that Roe v. Wade is \u201cwithout a shred of support\u201d in the Constitution. After Roe, I fear the Federalist group on the court will come after contraception, marriage equality, and privacy itself. Think I\u2019m overreaching?  All four of the dissenters in the marriage equality case (Obergefell v. Hodges) were Federalist heroes:  Scalia, Roberts, Alito, Thomas.  And Justice Thomas has bitterly denounced the very notion of a constitutional right to privacy, excoriating the 1965 case guaranteeing married couples access to contraception as \u201ca free-floating constitutional right to privacy.\u201d  Thomas argues that \u201cthis general \u2018right of privacy\u2019 was never before considered a constitutional guarantee protecting citizens from governmental intrusion.\u201d In our civic life, our nation\u2019s most powerful Federalist role model, Chief Justice John Roberts, manipulated a fairly small case about an anti-Hillary movie into a wholesale rewrite of the nation\u2019s campaign finance laws to benefit big money corporate interests in Citizens United. He also gutted the Voting Rights Act, which Congress had reauthorized in 2006 by a vote of 98-0 in the Senate and 390-33 in the House. Sen. Ted Cruz: We are one vote away from losing our fundamental liberties So much for not legislating from the bench. While others are focused on November 3, Election Day, Trump\u2019s special interest base has another day in mind: November 10, when the Affordable Care Act comes before the court. If Judge Barrett becomes Justice Barrett, I fully expect her to eviscerate the patient protections in the Affordable Care Act. The case, California v. Texas, seeks to do through the courts what the GOP has failed to do in Congress: destroy the Affordable Care Act and its protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. This case is for all the marbles \u2013 or, at least, a lot of them. The Center for American Progress estimated last year that 135 million Americans under the age of 65 have a pre-existing condition. The popularity of that provision has, I believe, made it politically impossible for elected Republicans to abolish it, despite at least 70 attempts.  But rather than live with it, they want unelected, unaccountable judges \u2013 with lifetime appointments \u2013 to do their dirty work for them. Sadly, Judge Amy Coney Barrett seems willing to do so. \u201cChief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\u201d Ms. Barrett said in 2017, when Roberts was part of a court majority that ruled Obamacare is constitutional. Judge Barrett\u2019s selection may prove to be a big win for the base of Trump\u2019s party \u2013 and by \u201cbase,\u201d I do not refer to the people who wear MAGA hats and risk their lives at Covid-19 super-spreader rallies. The real base: corporate powers who hide in the shadows and have nothing but contempt for those MAGA folks.  Those shadowy corporate interests are the winners in the Barrett selection. Judge Barrett could form a phalanx of Federalist icons that includes Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh. Together they will have the power to make corporate interests even more dominant. The rest of us will simply be their handmaidens.",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion asked contributors for their takes on how Mike Pence and Kamala Harris did at the vice presidential debate. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own. Ah, it was nice to be back in 2012\u2026if only for a night.  The vice presidential debate was substantive on issues ranging from China to fracking to tax policy. It was unquestionably a face-off between two polished, long serving politicians trading barbs in the cadence of Washington. And it was boring. Perhaps we\u2019ve forgotten how lovely boring could really be. Sen. Kamala Harris came in on sky-high expectations but had a much tougher needle to thread. She and former Vice President Joe Biden are leading in the polls, so her campaign didn\u2019t need or want to change the trajectory of the race. Her deliberative tone was important. But there would be no upside at this point, for the Biden campaign to have her get into the weeds on policies\u2014whether they support limits on abortion or whether they would add seats to the Supreme Court\u2014that could only turn off uncommitted voters.  She avoided these. Vice President Mike Pence, as the underdog, had no such downside and tried to move the needle by focusing on the details. Did it matter? Nope. Has the race changed as of tonight because Pence kept talking over his time and Harris wouldn\u2019t answer whether she supported adding justices to the Supreme Court? Definitely not. Because this isn\u2019t 2012. And all anyone will care about from tonight is the fly on Pence\u2019s head. Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst. She is a staff writer at The Dispatch and an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. She previously worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and graduated from Harvard Law School. There is a fundamental asymmetry between Democrats and Republicans: As Trump\u2019s former advisor Steve Bannon once said, Republicans go for the head wound, Democrats for the pillow fight. Tonight, this was on display. Given her immense skill as an orator and in debating, Harris was incredibly restrained \u2013 even sticking to her time when Pence kept going over. Facing the Vice President of an administration whose record can only be compared to James Buchanan, Herbert Hoover, and Richard Nixon, the Senator still didn\u2019t go for the jugular. The two candidates were literally separated by acrylic glass barriers because Pence might be one of the people who has caught Covid-19 in the reckless policies within the White House\u2014a symbol for their entire response to the pandemic. There are so many moments in this debate - -and in general conversations about the campaign \u2013 where the basic unreality of the moment is something left unsaid. Sometimes it seems that the handful of disaffected Republicans in the Lincoln Project are more willing to just say the obvious. In the end, the limitations of tonight\u2019s debate might not matter. Harris is a skilled debater and conveyed the key points. It is easy to imagine her being president one day. She is also working with a candidate, Joe Biden, who enjoys a much stronger standing in the polls. As long as she is not making mistakes, then, right now, she is winning. The goal of a vice presidential debate is do no harm. She didn\u2019t do any harm. But still, there is so much more that Democrats can say about everything that has happened since 2017. This isn\u2019t a debate about differences in policy \u2014 it\u2019s a debate about what the state of our nation and democracy will be in decades to come. Our health, our politics, our economy, our public life is sick. It\u2019s time for Democrats to be more direct about the threats that the nation faces under a Trump presidency. Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. California Sen. Kamala Harris easily won the debate, as Vice President Mike Pence showed an unexpectedly rude side of his personality. Pence came across as Donald Trump-light, telling falsehoods, interrupting others and ignoring the rules, almost as much as the boss he praised with his usual unctuousness. But because (unlike his boss) he can put together complete sentences, Pence was able to pack in more whoppers per second than Trump did in last week\u2019s deranged presidential debate. Pence spoke over the two women in front of him, condescendingly ignoring moderator Susan Page\u2019s repeated entreaties to stop talking when his time was up, and frequently interrupting his rival, who tried to keep her cool, as women often feel they must, saying \u201cI\u2019d like equal time.\u201d Harris won because she had so much more material to work with. All she had to do was cite the facts about the Trump administration\u2019s catastrophic handling of the coronavirus. Incidentally, the failures were evident in Pence\u2019s very presence there, when he should have been in quarantine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control\u2019s guidelines. Harris pointed to Trump\u2019s failuress in paying his taxes, his efforts to get rid of Obamacare in the midst of a pandemic, the dismal state of the economy, Trump\u2019s reluctance to clearly condemn white supremacists, and on and on. Pence responded with the familiar lies and evasions we have been hearing from Trump for months, including a few new doozies. It was hard to contain a laugh when he claimed Trump has been very good on the environment and is listening to the scientists, when he said Trump has always told the truth and when he repeatedly misrepresented Biden\u2019s foreign policy record.

Debate moderator Susan Page was fabulous, even though it\u2019s already clear she will be assailed by the left to explain Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s failure. Pro tip for the left: complaining about the moderator means you lost. Kamala Harris flopped in epic fashion tonight, while Vice President Mike Pence followed in the footsteps of Joe Biden (2012) and Dick Cheney (2004), former vice presidents for incumbents presidents who had tanked in their opening debate, and then saw their number two\u2019s step up and right the ship. Pence conducted a masterclass in how to prepare for and execute a clear, winning debate strategy. He sliced and diced his way through taxes, fracking, the Green New Deal, and which ticket is best to handle America\u2019s future recovery, winning every exchange on those topics. Pence did what Trump failed to do in his debate against Biden\u2014recognize his opponent\u2019s mistakes and then clearly drive home the winning point. The exchange over packing the Supreme Court was an epic failure by Harris (and Biden last week), and Pence played it perfectly. Pence flawlessly weaved in people and stories he brought along to Salt Lake City to score several points. Harris\u2019s record, combined with a relative lack of experience and success at this level on the national stage was a real problem for the Democratic ticket tonight. Biden clearly wants to run a moderate campaign, but he picked a running mate who has said she would repeal Trump tax cuts, was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, had said she would ban fracking, and voted against the USMCA trade deal (even though it had wide bipartisan support). Biden was so eager to check identity politics boxes in picking Harris that he never stopped to ask: Is she any good at this, and does her record match my desires?

We do not have vice presidential debates so we can hear the same talking points from different people. The point is to figure out if the people on the stage can serve as commander in chief. Sen. Kamala Harris made history tonight as a Black woman. After 90 minutes of debate, no one is saying she could not serve as President of the United States. People will quibble with her answers, or disagree with her policies. That is normal. But no one is saying this woman could not do the job. She cleared the bar. Harris knocked the tar out of Vice President Mike Pence on the Covid-19 pandemic in the beginning and ended strong, talking about justice for all Americans. In the middle, she had to walk that tightrope that all women, especially Black women, know too well. Strong, but not too strong, empathetic but not too emotional. It was not a perfect performance, but she did what she had to do. Vice President Pence was masterful at one thing: normalizing conservatism. He can take right-wing conspiracy theories and President Donald Trump\u2019s grievances and make them sound mellow and unthreatening. But he also did it by being Mike the Mansplainer in Chief, constantly talking over Harris and the moderator. CNN host Van Jones is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. As always, I watched and listened to the vice presidential debate through the eyes and ears of white suburban women \u2013 not just because I am one, but because those voters may very well determine the fate of the election. And what I saw was a man who talked over not just his female opponent but also the female moderator. He mansplained and condescended. He ignored the rules, the format, the questions, and moderator Susan Page\u2019s attempts to cut him off. It wasn\u2019t as buffoonish as President Donald Trump\u2019s performance last week\u2014Vice President Mike Pence remained calm, avoided petty insults and stuck mostly to talking points \u2013 but that was, in a way, worse. Trump doesn\u2019t have the dexterity, discipline or knowledge base to stay on topic, answer questions directly, follow the rules and avoid ad hominem. Pence does, and instead chose to disrespect the two women on that stage. For the white suburban women who have fled the Republican Party and Trump in droves, it was an echo of the past few years, where they\u2019ve felt disrespected and turned off by this administration\u2019s divisiveness, fear-mongering, incompetence, corruption, bigotry and politics of revenge. It wasn\u2019t just a bad look for the Trump-Pence ticket, it was an insult to the very women they need to stay in office. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d The American people saw a much more normal debate tonight. And it allowed them to understand that there are stark differences in policy between what four more years of Donald Trump would look like, as compared to a Biden-Harris administration. The differences across issues as wide ranging as energy policy, criminal justice policy and taxation were particularly striking. Vice President Pence\u2019s ability to characterize Kamala Harris and the Democratic ticket more broadly as overly progressive was his biggest accomplishment of the night. For example, Pence\u2019s assertion that Biden\u2019s interest in repealing the Trump tax cuts will mean tax hikes for all voters on day one of a new administration was an effective attack that was largely left unanswered by Harris. Also impactful was his claim that both Biden and Harris have, at times, embraced energy policies that could have real economic impacts in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. These are the economic issues on which the Trump-Pence ticket should focus their fire in the closing weeks of the campaign. It\u2019s unlikely that the VP debate will ultimately have any real impact on the election unless Trump can execute these substantive attacks against Joe Biden in the same disciplined way that Pence did on Wednesday. He\u2019ll have the first real chance to do so when he meets Biden at the second presidential debate next week. Lanhee J.

He served as policy director of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign and senior adviser to Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign in 2016. On style, substance and strategy, the clear winner of the debate was Kamala Harris.  She seemed simultaneously passionate and relaxed as she prosecuted her case against the Trump administration. Right from the start, she mentioned the devastating numbers of the coronavirus pandemic (over 210,000 Americans dead), as well as January 28 \u2013 the date the President and Vice President reportedly knew about the potential impact of the pandemic. Harris deftly brought up Trump\u2019s taxes and his failure to clearly and forcefully condemn White supremacy, while pushing back against Mike Pence\u2019s repeated interruptions. Most importantly, she spoke affirmatively to Biden\u2019s record, mentioning his faith, his role in saving the auto industry and his fundamental belief in science. Harris never lost her cool, which says a lot \u2013 given the high stakes of this matchup. With Trump behind in most polls, this was Pence\u2019s last real chance to change the trajectory of the race. But he was not up for the job and looked miserable for nearly the entire debate. Several times, he brought the focus back to the coronavirus, a topic he would have been wise to avoid as much as possible. His vague answers on climate change and racial justice made him seem out of step with the national mood.  And his attempts to speak over the moderator were no doubt grating to any women who has been \u201cmansplained\u201d or similarly talked over. The missed opportunity of the evening was immigration.  Out of the nine topics the moderator Susan Page introduced, not one question about Trump\u2019s signature issue? Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. If there was one omen about Wednesday night\u2019s debate, it came from the fly that landed on Mike Pence\u2019s hair and stayed there. Its unexpected appearance distracted from Pence\u2019s message and indicated that the night was going less than perfectly for the Vice President. Going into Wednesday night\u2019s debate, I thought the expectations for Kamala Harris were unreasonably high. By the end of the night, however, she met them. She prosecuted the case against Donald Trump. She defended Joe Biden and her own record. And she managed to do it all while walking a racist, sexist tightrope that holds professional Black women to unfair standards of decorum. Trailing badly in the polls, Pence needed to score a knockout to change the momentum of the campaign. Instead, he repeated empty platitudes and talking points that contradicted the truth about the coronavirus and the economy. And after months of struggling under the weight of the pandemic and an economy in freefall, Americans knew Pence was defending the indefensible. In the end, nothing that happened in the debate did anything to move the needle. And that\u2019s bad news for the Trump-Pence 2020 ticket. Keith Boykin is a CNN political commentator and a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton. The vice presidential debate was the one America needed. Before this debate, the American people wondered which Kamala Harris would show up \u2013 the loyal running mate or the liberal warrior? Now we know. She showed that progressives are trying to be Joe Biden\u2019s boss. And that cost her the debate. Last year, Harris was rated more liberal than any other US Senator by GovTrack.us, and her performance on Wednesday proved nothing has changed. She promised a repeal of Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which a Heritage Foundation study shows help the middle class, refused to disavow the Green New Deal she co-sponsored, and dodged the court-packing question. Wednesday\u2019s performance showed progressives like Harris still have the same goals as ever \u2014 but now they\u2019re using Biden to achieve those goals. Mike Pence, in contrast, offered a clear vision for America. An America of law and order, one that provides economic opportunity for all Americans, and one that takes on China. Most importantly, Pence has the same vision for America as President Donald Trump. There is no space between them. Trump and Pence are a team, playing for the same goal \u2013 the same cannot be said of Biden and Harris.

It wasn\u2019t so much a debate as a time machine. For approximately 90 minutes, the country was transported to a post-Donald Trump era of politics. Mike Pence and Kamala Harris gave us a preview of where each might lead their parties after their septuagenarian ticket-toppers retire. If the VP debate was any indication, the Democrats\u2019 future is smart, strong and powerful. The GOP\u2019s future is, apparently, shameless obeisance to Trump and all he stands for. Harris showed the world why Joe Biden\u2019s first presidential decision was a masterstroke.  She indicted the Trump regime with a relentless, remorseless command of the facts.  She was cutting yet charming; righteously indignant yet likeable. A former talk radio host who billed himself as \u201cRush Limbaugh on decaf,\u201d Pence was uncharacteristically rude. Pro tip: if you\u2019re 31 points behind among women, don\u2019t talk over your female opponent and the female moderator. When he wasn\u2019t interrupting, Pence was fawning over Trump\u2019s supposed accomplishments. One day Trump will exit the stage, and Pence will want to take over. If, as I suspect, Trump is leading his party off a cliff, few will thank Pence for cheering, \u201cKeep going, boss!\u201d Both in style and on substance, the night belonged to Harris. Her case that the Trump administration has been a miserable failure is self-evident in the deaths of over 210,000 Americans from Covid-19.  What could be a more apt metaphor than the fact that debate organizers required an acrylic glass barrier to protect Harris and others from being infected \u2013 from the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force? One piece of breaking news:  we finally found a wall the Trump team doesn\u2019t like. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is the author of the new book, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris won the debate the moment she said, \u201cYou respect the American people when you tell them the truth.\u201d When speaking in defense of the Trump Administration\u2019s record, no surrogate should ever utter the words facts, truth, and honesty. Pence made this mistake early in the debate by praising the \u201ctransparency\u201d of Trump\u2019s Covid-19 response and was quickly called to the mat by Harris, who used the word to pivot to Trump\u2019s obfuscation on his taxes, personal health, and myriad other issues. Four years into the Trump administration, Pence trying to claim the moral high ground of truthiness is a transparent lie.  By contrast, Harris\u2019 statement that \u201cDonald Trump does not know what it means to be honest\u201d rang clear and true. In the absence of being able to defend Trump\u2019s veracity, Pence used his soothing voice to sound reasonable as an intentional contrast to the belligerent approach of the man at the top of his ticket. Where Trump scared off voters with his aggressive debate performance, Pence went overboard when he commended VP Biden\u2019s public service and Senator Harris\u2019 historic nomination. Trump has dug such a deep hole on perception that Pence literally resorted to  praising his opposition, just to gain some needed nice points. What Pence did achieve was reminding voters about the policy positions adopted by the entire Republican Party. Pence\u2019s calm approach belied the extreme positions supported by the current GOP \u2013 support for dictators, tax cuts for the wealthy, ending reproductive freedoms, and repealing health care protections. Senator Harris made it clear to viewers what is at stake with the Trump-Pence ticket: \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you.\u201d Nayyera Haq is a host on SiriusXM Progress and CEO of an international communications firm. She served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser in the State Department and a senior director in the White House. Yes, this may have been the most important vice-presidential debate in American history. But even with two of the oldest presidential candidates in history, it\u2019s hard to imagine that a vice-presidential pick is going to directly influence voters\u2019 preference for president. It probably won\u2019t. But before dismissing Wednesday night\u2019s encounter as a Seinfeld show about nothing, consider a couple of takeaways. First, had Sen. Kamala Harris melted down, committed some galactic stumble, bumble or tumble, and failed to effectively defend former Vice President Joe Biden and attack Vice President Mike Pence, she might have hurt Biden badly, raising public concern that would have reflected badly on his judgment on a vice-presidential pick. Instead Harris performed very well (in fact better on the debate stage than her putative boss) demonstrating competency, compassion on the issues and humor and toughness in standing up to Pence. Second, the not so invisible force hanging over the debate was the coronavirus. From the acrylic glass dividers to President Donald Trump\u2019s infection and the Covid-19 cluster in the White House to the Administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic, this \u2013 and health care in general \u2013is perhaps a defining issue in influencing voter perceptions and the area in which the Administration is most vulnerable. Harris did well in taking apart the administration\u2019s record, helped by Pence\u2019s talking points untethered from reality that made it unmistakably clear that Democrats take seriously the gravest threat to America\u2019s public health in a century and Republicans don\u2019t. The bottom line is: Harris held her own and then some. So did Pence. The debate won\u2019t change the numbers or many folks\u2019 minds. Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of \u201cThe End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\u201d He was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. Coming into tonight\u2019s debate, the Trump campaign was already behind in the polls  and facing an enormous gender gap with suburban women. With Election Day only weeks away, President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign had to stop its downward trajectory if they have any chance of turning things around. Pence\u2019s debate performance did not do that. At best, polls remain unchanged. At worst, the gender gap widens in favor of Biden-Harris. Why? Mike Pence pandered. Kamala Harris prosecuted. While Pence was condescending and canned, Harris was in command and confident. Unlike Pence, who seemed to think Americans wouldn\u2019t notice his feeble attempts to gaslight them on Trump\u2019s failed Covid-19 response, Kamala Harris talked directly to millions of American impacted by Trump\u2019s ineptitude. Harris\u2019 ability to tick off Trump\u2019s failures on not only Covid-19 and health care, but on Trump\u2019s his feckless foreign policy favoring dictators over allies, pattern of dishonesty and insults against US service members, was a devastating indictment of the era of Trump. Pence peddled propaganda. Harris brought facts. Harris did her job presenting the voters with a clear choice between vastly different visions for America\u2019s future. Winner, Harris. Tara Setmayer is a former GOP communications director, host of the \u201cHonestly Speaking with Tara\u201d podcast and a CNN political contributor. She is a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project. This vice presidential debate was significantly more civil and more watchable than that shambolic event of last week. Even so, I doubt it rescued Donald Trump from the crumbling of his presidency. Mike Pence gave the best defense any Republican has made of the Trump record, but he was dealt a bad deck of cards. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris performed steadily across the night, avoiding gaffes and protecting the Democrats\u2019 lead. That the debate probably changed few minds does not make it insignificant, however.  The Trump White House is falling apart at an astonishing pace. With time running out, they desperately needed a victory tonight. According to CNN\u2019s post-debate poll, though, the Trump teamed failed to do so \u2013 with 59% of voters saying Harris won the debate and only 38% saying Pence won. This debate was also important in advancing the political stature of Harris.  She missed a few opportunities to score points, including when she failed to attack the Trump\u2019s administration handling of a Covid outbreak in the White House itself. But, overall, her capacity to assemble strong arguments and deliver them with an infectious smile showed she is a real pro. Harris has come a long way in demonstrating that we would be in sound hands if fate calls her to the presidency. Final point: the debate commission needs to change the structure of these debates.  Moderators ask about so many topics so quickly that there is no time left for in-depth conversation. Nine topics in 90 minutes are about five too many. David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School, where he founded the Center for Public Leadership. Wednesday\u2019s debate between Vice President Mike Pence and would-be vice president California Sen. Kamala Harris was a pleasant reminder of a more genteel era of polite droning, when campaign speeches masqueraded as principle. This is perhaps why a reality show host won the last bout. Scoring the round, it seemed that Pence edged Harris slightly, if only because he spoke to more than just his base. Harris effectively reminded her audience of the many Covid-related failures of this administration, but otherwise failed to move much beyond the standard Democratic Party talking points. Pence, on the other hand, effectively underscored what to many is one of the more frightening likelihoods of a Biden-Harris administration: A packed Supreme Court. The fact that Harris refused, like former Vice President Joe Biden before her, to answer the question of whether a Biden administration would support upending the court in order to secure a liberal majority only further implies that this is indeed likely their plan. There is much \u2013 so very much \u2013 to abhor in what has already come and may yet come from a second Trump term. Yet, with all its failings, Trump\u2019s presidency has only accentuated the strength of American institutions (often to his chagrin). A Biden administration, coupled with a Democratic Senate and House, would potentially upend those institutions in order to secure outcomes congenial to their base. On Wednesday night, Americans were reminded of that danger. Danielle Pletka is a senior fellow in foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where she focuses on US foreign policy generally and the Middle East specifically. Until January 2020, Pletka was the senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at AEI. Vice President Mike Pence had an impossible task Wednesday night. As the head of the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, Pence had to defend the administration\u2019s record when more than 210,000 Americans are already dead from Covid-19. Pence flunked that test, not least because his boss has Covid and is working in the Oval Office without quarantining himself, in defiance of his own administration\u2019s guidelines about what to do if you have the disease. The Trump administration always focuses on the visuals. The images from the debate told one story as both vice presidential candidates were separated by acrylic glass and sat more than 12 feet away from each other \u2013 while Pence resorted to his usual set of bromides about the greatness of the Trump presidency, At one point, Pence was asked why the US had fared worse than a similar industrialized democracy \u2013 Canada \u2013 with its response to the pandemic. Pence really had no good answer to that question, instead blaming China. The Chinese certainly deserve some blame for their early missteps in Wuhan, where the virus originated, but that was back in late 2019 and early 2020. Nine months later and Pence articulated no real plan about how a second Trump administration might try and finally lick this virus. Peter Bergen is CNN\u2019s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is senior editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book \u201cTrump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\u201d What a difference a week makes. The vice presidential debate had less sizzle, but a lot more civility than last week\u2019s fiery presidential debate. Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris did meet rule #1 of vice presidential debates: Do no harm. Vice presidential debates don\u2019t generally change the trajectory of a campaign, but the undercard debate is an opportunity to win over voters who are still on the fence. Undecided voters often decide on style and substance over policy. With that in mind, Pence won the night. Hands down. He was calm and in command as he outlined the contrast between the Trump ticket versus the Biden-Harris ticket. Harris\u2019 smirks and laughs came across as abrasive and not likeable. Persona often outweighs policy with the swing voters. While there is room for debate about the current administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Vice President did well to outline what has worked, including restricting travel from China, providing resources to doctors and nurses and prioritizing the development of a vaccine. Harris did little to dispel the notion of a progressive Biden agenda, including raising taxes, following the Green New Deal framework and showing potential leniency toward China. She refused to answer the question of packing the courts, and this is an important question that needs to be answered by Biden or Harris in the next few weeks of the campaign. Rule #2 of VP debates: Support the top of the ticket. Both candidates did do that without question and without hesitation. We can only hope the next presidential debate comes off without interruptions and insults.

View more opinion at CNN. When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away on September 18th, she left a vacancy on the Supreme Court just 46 days before one of the most consequential presidential elections in our nation\u2019s history. This past weekend, President Donald Trump nominated an eminently qualified judge \u2013 Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ginsburg, and I believe the Senate will confirm her before Election Day. Republicans in the Senate and President Trump rightly are taking action to fill Justice Ginsburg\u2019s vacancy on the court \u2013 much to the consternation of Democrats, who were all for filling a Supreme Court vacancy when Justice Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016. At the time, the Republican Senate wisely decided to follow a historical precedent and not confirm then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, in an election year. Democrats also play politics with Supreme Court seats So why is this time different? Historically, when the president and the Senate are of the same political party, the president nominates and the Senate confirms Supreme Court justices in election years. When the president and the Senate are not of the same political party, the Senate hasn\u2019t typically taken up the president\u2019s Supreme Court nomination in an election year. Republicans followed historical precedent in 2016 by declining to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, and Republicans are likewise following historical precedent now by taking up President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nomination. Further, in 2014 the American people voted for a Republican Senate to be a legislative check on the Obama-Biden administration. They felt the country was moving too far to the left, particularly the federal judiciary.  The Senate\u2019s role is to advise and consent on the president\u2019s nominations. By not confirming Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, we were doing the job the American people mandated us to do. Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court With the Supreme Court vacancy on the line, the 2016 election became in part a referendum on the type of nominee that should replace Justice Scalia. The vacancy became one of the important issues in the 2016 presidential campaign. For many Americans, myself included, it was the single most important reason we voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. As I lay out in my new book, \u201cOne Vote Away \u2013 How a Single Supreme Court Seat Can Change History,\u201d I agreed to endorse then-candidate Trump only when he agreed to a specified list of people he would consider nominating to be Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement. He agreed to the list, and two weeks into his presidency President Trump nominated one of the 21 judges on the list, Judge Neil Gorsuch, to fill Justice Scalia\u2019s seat. The reason American voters picked Trump over Clinton, and the reason they ushered in a Senate majority in 2014 and 2016 and expanded that majority in 2018, is because the constitutional liberties fundamental to our democracy \u2013 free speech, religious liberty and the Second Amendment \u2013 hang in the balance of the court. In my book, I make the case for why filling the vacancy left by Justice Ginsburg is so important. On so many issues, we are just one vote away from losing our liberties \u2013 such as religious liberty and our right to keep and bear arms \u2013  and seeing our country fundamentally changed.  I examine eight critical constitutional issues and landmark Supreme Court cases that every American should know about, such as Van Orden v. Perry, a landmark religious liberty case, District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, and Gonzales v. Carhart, where the Supreme Court upheld the federal ban on the gruesome practice of partial-birth abortion. Most of the cases I write about in the book were decided by just one vote. Almost all of them I helped litigate, and I aim to explain what really happens at the Supreme Court when our constitutional rights are at stake. And in a matter of weeks, the result of this presidential election could come down to the court. If the election results are challenged, a four-four court can\u2019t decide anything. We need a full Court on Election Day, given the high likelihood we\u2019re going to see litigation that goes to the court. We need a nine justice Supreme Court that can give a definitive answer for the country. When it comes to our fundamental rights and contentious policy issues, we are one vote away from either upholding the Constitution and preserving our liberties or destroying them. For ourselves and for posterity, we have a solemn obligation not to let that happen.",

It wasn\u2019t a surprise that President Donald Trump announced Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to serve on the US Supreme Court Saturday. Barrett\u2019s conservative Catholic faith was a flashpoint during her confirmation hearings in 2017 to serve as a federal appeals court judge and is coming up again now.

She has cast doubt on stare decisis \u2013  the principle that justices should follow legal precedents set by previous decisions. So far, the public debate about faith and Barrett\u2019s nomination has focused on her controversial 1998 law review paper about Catholic judges recusing themselves from cases where the law conflicts with the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching. While that\u2019s an important topic, the discussion has obscured a more important aspect of her nomination: how her extreme legal views are rejected by American Christians overall. Over the past few decades, the loudest voices on the Christian right have largely come to represent what it means to be a Christian in the United States, but they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to distort the actual views of people in the pews. Since the 2016 election, progressive Christians are increasingly stepping forward to insist on being heard in our national conversation. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Trump\u2019s pick must believe Roe v. Wade was \u201cwrongly decided\u201d and that Barrett \u201cmeets that standard.\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, a leading anti-abortion activist, said Barrett is \u201cthe perfect combination of brilliant jurist and a woman who brings the argument to the court that is potentially the contrary to the views of the sitting women justices.\u201d The reality about what the majority of American Christians believe about reproductive health care is far from how politicians and anti-abortion activists portray it. According to Pew Research Center, 59% of Christians do not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade. Barrett\u2019s fellow Catholics are some of the most opposed to her conservative vision for the Supreme Court. They oppose overturning Roe v. Wade by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Amy Coney Barrett a perfect choice for half of America Not only do most  American Christians not want to overturn Roe v. Wade, many Christian denominations are part of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice,  an advocacy organization that supports abortion rights. \u201cMost Christians are committed to upholding our God-given right to bodily autonomy, including our reproductive freedom, as essential to the abundant life that Jesus proclaimed,\u201d the Rev. Katey Zeh, the group\u2019s CEO and a Baptist minister, told me in reaction to Judge Barrett\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. \u201cThe political anti-abortion movement weaponizes Christianity and does not value life; it values the power to control those living on the margins, the very ones that Jesus calls us to center.\u201d \u201cWhat is at stake with Roe v Wade is the right to bodily autonomy for all women, and while Judge Barrett may disagree theologically with Roe v Wade, the Constitution does not authorize her to legislate her religious beliefs,\u201d the Rev. Traci Blackmon told me in an email on Saturday. She\u2019s the Associate General Minister of Justice & Local Church Ministries at the United Church of Christ, one of the founding members of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Abortion is not the only issue where Judge Barrett\u2019s views conflict with many American Christians. \u201cJudge Barrett\u2019s long expressed preference of constitutional interpretation toward originalism is understandably a matter of concern for those of us not equitably included in the ethos of the original document,\u201d Rev. Blackmon wrote in reference to Black Americans, women, and other groups who were denied equality under the Constitution at our nation\u2019s founding. The most stinging rebuke of her nomination so far has come from Sister Simone Campbell, a leading voice for Catholics in Washington, DC. \u201cI know that Judge Barrett shares my faith, but her past words and actions prove that she does not hold all life to be sacred,\u201d Campbell wrote in a statement. \u201cCatholics cannot support judges or politicians who blatantly ignore the breadth of Catholic Social Teaching on women\u2019s rights, voting rights, immigrant\u2019s rights, health care, environmental protections, and so much more.\u201d Of particular concern is the Affordable Care Act, which Sister Simone Campbell\u2019s group NETWORK lobbied for intensely. Barrett has criticized a previous Supreme Court decision to uphold the law and Democrats have made defending it a key part of their opposition to her nomination.  All of this comes on top of what Democrats are saying and many Americans believe is an illegitimate process to nominate Judge Barrett. \u201cHaving aggressively blocked the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland by former President Barack Obama, citing such nominations should not occur in the final year of a presidential term, elected officials who lack the integrity to honor their own stated convictions have far graver implications than any appointment,\u201d Rev. Blackmon told me. Sister Simone Campbell called the nomination a \u201ccrass partisan power grab,\u201d and \u201can insult to our democracy.\u201d If the Senate is going to go ahead and consider Judge Barrett, we need to at least be clear about what American Christians actually believe. Among many other concerns, the push to overturn Roe v. Wade at the heart of this confirmation battle is deeply unpopular not only for Americans in general but also for Christians.",

Brenner Johnson is the Vice Dean and Professor of Law at California Western School of Law. The views expressed here are their own. Read more opinion on CNN. When President Bill Clinton selected Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the nominee from his Supreme Court shortlist in 1993, women\u2019s groups\u2014both conservative and liberal\u2014raised concerns. As we discuss in our book \u201cShortlisted,\u201d some feminists criticized Ginsburg\u2019s position on equality as one that ignored the historic oppression of women. She advocated that men and women should be treated equally under the law, rather than receive special treatment based on their sex. Additionally, abortion opponents and champions alike expressed trepidation about her appointment. That voices from the left and right contested her confirmation turned out to be a good thing, bringing consensus among senators who voted overwhelming in her favor, a vote of 96-3. Media reports described her as a \u201cmoderate\u201d who deserved the \u201ceasy approval\u201d based upon her qualifications as a civil rights lawyer and federal court judge. Ginsburg was the last SCOTUS nominee to receive nearly unanimous support. (The vote for Justice Stephen Breyer, who followed her, was 87-9 and since that time opposition for every nominee has been in double-digits, most recently with the one of the closest votes ever confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh 50-48). Many Senate Democrats already have pledged to vote \u201cno\u201d on Trump\u2019s nominee to fill Ginsburg\u2019s seat because they believe the nomination should be delayed until after presidential election results are in. That Ginsburg had such a favorable vote from the Senate reflects the reality that she was not, at the time, thought of as the feminist icon she would later become. Rather, she was viewed by many as the embodiment of a Clinton moderate \u2013 a center-left thinker who might bring that sensibility to the bench. In 1993, one could hardly anticipate the ferocious advocate \u2013 and dissenter \u2013 Justice Ginsburg would be during her tenure. As America mourns her momentous loss and prepares to face a confirmation process for her replacement where both gender and ideology promise to be primary issues, it\u2019s worth pausing to remember the sweep of history that brought \u201cmoderate\u201d Judge Ginsburg to the nation\u2019s highest court. Ginsburg\u2019s nomination to fill the seat vacated by retiring Justice Byron White occurred on the heels of the debacle of the Clarence Thomas confirmation. Anita Hill\u2019s highly credible accusations of his sexual harassment (which Thomas denied) and the humiliating spectacle of how some senators treated Hill during the 1991 hearings ushered in 1992\u2019s \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d during which women swept into political offices in unprecedented numbers. Ginsburg rode that wave, but she was not Clinton\u2019s first choice. His top pick was reportedly New York\u2019s governor Mario Cuomo, whom Clinton had courted for months. When Cuomo let the opportunity pass, Clinton apparently mused about other possible candidates, including his own wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. This question changed the face of the Supreme Court At the same time, Judge Ginsburg\u2019s husband and champion Marty Ginsburg was working behind the scenes to secure support for his wife\u2019s candidacy from across the country, seeking letters authored by lawyers, legal scholars and political organizations. Soliciting that support was not so challenging. Ginsburg\u2019s impeccable background made her particularly well-suited for the Court. She attended Cornell University for her undergraduate degree and started law school at Harvard, where she was one of only a handful of women in a class of more than 500. She transferred to Columbia Law School, where she tied for first place in her graduating class and later served as a tenured professor after beginning her academic career at Rutgers School of Law. Ginsburg argued six cases\u2014and won five\u2014in front of the Supreme Court before she became a judge, all of which dealt with gender discrimination in some way. She went to work for the American Civil Liberties Union in 1973 and was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1980. Although President Carter made no nominations to the Supreme Court during his term, he implemented a plan for diversifying the federal bench more successfully than any other president before him. Carter understood that judicial appointments are among the most powerful roles of a president as most of the judges remain in office long beyond a presidential term. In February 1977, Carter issued an executive order establishing the United States Circuit Judge Nominating Commission with the explicit goal to increase diversity. 'RBG' filmmakers: How Justice Ginsburg wanted to be remembered Thirteen panels were created representing regions across the country, with a specific mandate that each include men, women and minorities. Charged with nominating appropriate candidates for the federal judiciary, the panels were required to identify steps taken to give public notice to minorities and women, including the names of organizations and groups receiving notice, as well as lists of all women and minorities who responded as well as who had been considered. The Carter administration also required the panels to ask targeted questions of judicial candidates like, \u201cHow have you worked to further civil rights, women\u2019s rights, or the rights of other disadvantaged groups on a national, state or local level?\u201d \u201cHow many women attorneys and minority attorneys does your office or law firm include?\u201d \u201cHow many women partners?\u201d \u201cMinority partners?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think the most crucial legal problems of women and minorities will be over the next few years? How should these problems be remedied?\u201d Under Carter\u2019s leadership, a personal commitment to diversity became a qualification for a federal court appointment. Remembering 'Notorious RBG' is complicated Carter\u2019s effort led to five times more the number of women in federal judgeships than the presidents before him combined by the end of his presidency. As Carter said in a speech to the National Association of Women Judges in 1980, \u201cWhen I became President, only 10 women had ever been appointed to the federal bench in more than 200 years. I\u2019ve appointed 40 more.\u201d Let that sink in. Among those women? The Notorious RBG, whom he appointed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1980. But for Carter\u2019s efforts to diversify the federal judiciary, she might never have gained this judicial experience that made her candidacy so attractive to President Clinton when he selected her for the Supreme Court. Whether Trump succeeds in filling the vacancy left by Ginsburg\u2019s death in the coming weeks or it is delayed until after the presidential election, the judicial selection process would benefit from reforms reflecting the priorities of Carter\u2019s judicial commission. It is appalling that less than 4% of the justices serving on our Supreme Court have been women and that women still do not comprise an equal number of judges sitting on lower federal courts.  When President Barack Obama greeted RBG at Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s swearing-in, he asked her: \u201cAre you happy that I brought you two women?\u201d Ginsburg replied, \u201cYes, but I\u2019ll be happier when you bring me five more.\u201d We will be happier too, seeing more women selected for the Supreme Court and positions of power across all professions.",

She was previously head of the US Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Not all heroes wear a cape; some wear a robe. When the nation lost Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, we lost an American heroine whose superpower was harnessing the law to protect millions of women, members of the LGBTQ community, people of color and those with disabilities. We are living in a moment of deep uncertainty \u2013 one in which countless people in America know that equal justice is still an aspiration, and it feels like we are regressing as a nation. And for good reason: President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are seemingly committed to rolling back progress on civil rights and blunting the positive change so many Americans seek. And they are doing this in part by reshaping the federal judiciary. The Senate\u2019s dereliction of duty to the people in this country is reprehensible. The governing body has failed to hold a vote on the HEROES Act, much-needed Covid-19 relief passed by the House of Representatives this spring, even as more than 200,000 lives have been lost in America. And yet McConnell is prioritizing holding hearings and voting on a third Trump-appointed Supreme Court justice without knowing for certain who the nominee will be. The message is clear: Republican senators couldn\u2019t care less about which of Trump\u2019s nominees is selected. They already know the agenda he or she is likely to bring to the bench. GOP push to fill RBG's seat could backfire spectacularly And the stakes could not be higher. Trump and McConnell have been intent on stripping away health care for millions of people \u2013 and that dream could become a reality, as the Court is set to decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act this term. In fact, the justices are scheduled to hear arguments on that issue right after Election Day. In addition, in recent years, the Supreme Court has delivered a number of historic victories for the LGBTQ community. Justice Ginsburg stood on the right side of history each time. With several cases already in the pipeline, including a hospital denying gender-affirming care to transgender people and a business\u2019s refusal to sell flowers to a same-sex couple for their wedding, more cases about LGBTQ equality are likely to reach the Supreme Court. Decades of hard-fought progress made by the LGBTQ movement could be threatened if Trump gets a third justice. The fate of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is also likely on the line. The past term, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end this critical program for immigrants brought to the United States as children \u2013 by one vote. And the Trump administration has already begun to set the stage for another legal battle to end these protections for good. Republicans have also weaponized the Court against voting rights. In 2013, five justices declared the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 unconstitutional, effectively paving the way for many of the barriers to the ballot box we are witnessing today. From strict voter ID laws to polling places closures in Black and brown neighborhoods to mandates that people who have committed felonies pay outstanding fines and fees before being allowed to vote, these barriers undermine our democracy. During the 2020 election season, the Supreme Court has let stand numerous state laws that have disenfranchised communities of color. Those include finding that Wisconsin should not have extended its deadline for absentee voting during the Covid-19 crisis and declining to reinstate a ruling that would have allowed all Texas voters to submit ballots by mail due to the pandemic. Many more cases are in the pipeline. GOP's Supreme Court hypocrisy in their own words In addition, Trump explicitly promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would \u201cautomatically\u201d overturn Roe v. Wade. More than a dozen challenges to abortion access could reach the Supreme Court \u2013 and one of Trump\u2019s shortlisters has come out unfavorably on some of them. With one potential nominee subscribing to the anti-reproductive rights movement, Trump\u2019s appointee may try to gut or overturn this landmark decision. This will vastly diminish the ability of people to safely exercise control of their bodies. Trump has outlined specifically what he hopes his nominee will do. Almost every person on his short list has a background that tells us we must believe him. Much has been said about Senate Republicans and their transparent hypocrisy. But their recent about-face on whether a Supreme Court nominee should be appointed and confirmed in a presidential election year reveals a stark reality: Nothing is more important to them than consolidating their power. And to do so, they are willing to destroy our democratic norms and processes along the way.  Part of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s great legacy is reminding us that the Supreme Court belongs to all of us \u2013 and not to one party or politician. And right now, many of the rights and freedoms we cherish are on the line as the Trump administration challenges this simple truth. Let\u2019s fight Trump\u2019s nominee like our lives depend on it \u2013 because they do. For those who are outraged, let us channel that anger in two ways: Demand the Senate not confirm any nominee until after inauguration, and make sure you and everyone you know is voting this year to hold elected officials accountable. Voting is the language of democracy and, this year, we can\u2019t leave anything on the table to save it.",

Lewis, \u201cis what you do when no one is watching.\u201d I\u2019ll add to it: Integrity is when you do the right thing even if it\u2019s against your own self-interest. Sen. Mitt Romney has failed both tests. This week, Romney said he would support a floor vote to confirm a new Supreme Court justice to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just weeks before a presidential election. He did this despite Senate Republicans\u2019 avowals that preventing President Barack Obama from filling the seat left vacant after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in 2016 was justified in an election year. Even though the election was many months away when Scalia passed in February, they said the voters should get to decide. Fast forward to the power-grabbing hypocrisy of 2020 and it\u2019s easy to see why Democrats are outraged \u2013 and why all Americans should be as well. Just two Republicans \u2013 Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2013 have said they will honor their previous commitments to not confirm a new Supreme Court justice when an election is looming. And Romney? He has said he is willing to vote. And this is despite McConnell\u2019s cynical precedent. If Romney approves of Trump\u2019s pick, that person will surely get a seat on the bench. \u201cMy liberal friends have over many decades gotten very used to the idea of having a liberal court, but that\u2019s not written in the stars,\u201d Romney said, adding that it is \u201cappropriate for a nation that is \u2026 center-right to have a court which reflects center-right points of view.\u201d Putting aside the factual errors \u2013 the current Supreme Court is actually much more conservative than liberal, and that there is plenty of evidence that the United States is not a center-right nation \u2013 the question isn\u2019t whether it is \u201cappropriate\u201d for the court to lean more left or more right. The question is what a fair, democratic process looks like. What Senate Republicans are pushing isn\u2019t fair or democratic; it\u2019s seat-stealing. And it\u2019s disappointing, if not unsurprising, to see Romney join right in. Mitch McConnell is going to turn me into a socialist In the Trump era of unfettered greed, democratic norm-destruction, ethical destitution, and wannabe-autocracy, Romney has positioned himself as a better sort of Republican. He was the only member of his party to vote to convict the President after Trump\u2019s impeachment trial early this year. He compared the President to an autocrat, back then, and in branding himself a man of character and integrity, he quoted a line from a hymn: \u201cDo what is right; let the consequence follow.\u201d He should take his own advice. Doing what\u2019s right is often difficult. Romney is a conservative, and there is no doubt that he wants a conservative justice in Ginsburg\u2019s seat. The consequences would of course be vast: Ginsburg\u2019s own legacy would likely be undone; reproductive rights, including contraception access, would almost surely be threatened and even walked back, and abortion could wind up outlawed in some states entirely; even progressive electoral victories would be defanged, as a right-wing court could handily undo liberal policies (the Affordable Care Act, hardly the left-wing dream of universal health care, for example, could be on the chopping block). This is apparently what Romney wants. He\u2019s never suggested otherwise. But he did suggest, in the February vote, that even as he was aligned with the conservative agenda, the means to achieving it were as important as the ends \u2013 that democratic processes were too cherished to be traded away in favor of conservative outcomes. It appears this particular prize is simply too big for Romney to maintain his principles.  Perhaps Romney has put away his hymnal for now. If he\u2019s looking for some new inspiration, he might want to revisit what former First Lady Michelle Obama said at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, when Romney was competing against her husband for the presidency. Through family, she said, \u201cWe learned about honesty and integrity \u2013 that the truth matters. That you don\u2019t take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules. And success doesn\u2019t count unless you earn it fair and square.\u201d",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Friday brought an outpouring of tributes for a freedom fighter whose determination and skill led to landmark changes in the law. It also immediately prompted a partisan battle over her replacement that is likely to supercharge the November election, already considered the most consequential in decades. \u201cHaving repeatedly beaten cancer, Ginsburg had come to almost seem invincible,\u201d wrote law professor Mary Ziegler. \u201cShe was a larger than life figure who became a hero to many young women \u2026 Even before joining the Supreme Court, she convinced an all-male Supreme Court that laws enforcing sex stereotypes violated the Constitution \u2013 and demonstrated how those laws harmed men as well as women. Ginsburg helped to make sense of how discrimination against pregnant workers could be pernicious. On the court, Ginsburg offered the clearest and most cogent defense of abortion rights.\u201d When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Republicans refused to even hold hearings for the nominee \u2013 Judge Merrick Garland \u2013 submitted by President Barack Obama, insisting that the choice should be deferred until after the presidential election. (\u201cIt\u2019s called delay, delay, delay,\u201d then-candidate Trump counseled Sen. Mitch McConnell from a debate stage.) Now Republicans, led by McConnell, are blowing up their own precedent and saying they would vote on a Trump nominee for Ginsburg\u2019s seat in the remaining months of Trump\u2019s term. (They are unlikely to be deterred by Ginsburg\u2019s hope which she expressed to her granddaughter: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d) \u201cFilling the seat in the next 46 days \u2013 or, if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins in November, before January 20, 2021 during the lame-duck portion of Trump\u2019s term \u2013 would take American democracy to the breaking point,\u201d wrote Joshua A. Douglas, who teaches law at the University of Kentucky, the school where McConnell got his law degree. \u201cBoth sides would dig in their heels. The nominee, whoever he or she is, will face mud-slinging and partisan attacks that would make the extremely vitriolic confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh look tame in comparison. At least half of Americans would never view a new justice under these circumstances as legitimate. Ever.\u201d McConnell and the Republicans could rethink their stance and wait, Douglas said.  \u201cOr they can push forward to grab power at all costs, knowing that doing so will damage democracy even further. Senator McConnell: how do you truly wish to be remembered?\u201d In the American version of the mockumentary series \u201cThe Office,\u201d the needy, dim lead character Michael Scott, branch manager of Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Scranton, Pennsylvania office, displays a fascination with the glitz of New York City. As played by Steve Carell, Scott is the archetype of cluelessness: \u201cDo I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked, but it\u2019s not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised.\u201d The city, two hours away from Scranton by car, is where he goes clubbing, tries (and fails) to impress executives at the fictional paper company\u2019s headquarters and crashes corporate parties to gorge on leftover sushi. In real life, the distance between Scranton and New York City is suddenly an issue in the race for the White House. Speaking at CNN\u2019s drive-in town hall Thursday in that rust-belt city which is his birthplace, Joe Biden framed the campaign as \u201cbetween Scranton and Park Avenue.\u201d Clearly, he would like voters to see the contest as a choice between the authentic son of working-class Pennsylvania and Donald Trump, the privileged son of a multi-millionaire. Trump won the state four years ago by less than a percentage point. And it\u2019s expected to be crucial again this year. \u201cRight now, Pennsylvania looks like the single most important state of the 2020 election,\u201d wrote Nathaniel Rakich in FiveThirty Eight. Trump also faced voters in Pennsylvania, in this case for a town hall Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. College professor Ellesia A. Blaque told him of her lifelong struggle with the disease sarcoidosis and asked how he planned to protect people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cRather than allowing me to finish my question \u2013 as I had to respectfully demand him to do  \u2013  or answering my question directly and honestly, the leader of the free world made me feel like an inanimate object,\u201d Blaque wrote for CNN Opinion. \u201cHe rambled and repeated the same claim that a new health care plan \u2013 better than the Affordable Care Act \u2013 was on its way.\u201d More than three-and-a-half years into the administration, there is no new health care plan, and Trump\u2019s team is backing a court case that aims to kill Obamacare, which does provide insurance for people with preexisting conditions, wrote John Avlon. \u201cTrump and his administration just can\u2019t stop talking about his nonexistent health care plan. It\u2019s going to be great, \u2018everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of\u2019\u2026 there will be insurance for everybody \u2026 no one will lose coverage \u2026 \u2018there will be no cuts\u2019 to Medicaid \u2026 and \u2018no one will be worse off financially.\u2019 Those are just some of the repeated promises President Trump and his administration have made about his phantom plan. And like some two-bit con man, he keeps saying it is just about to be unveiled, just a few weeks around the corner \u2026 just you wait.\u201d The town hall format didn\u2019t \u201cgo well\u201d for Trump, wrote conservative commentator Scott Jennings: \u201cThe President had a few decent moments\u201d but is better off \u201cin a pugilistic debate with an opponent than he is in addressing individual voters.\u201d Trump \u201coften drifts into difficult-to-follow tangents\u201d and \u201ctried to have a compassionate moment with the immigrant who recently became an American citizen, but he didn\u2019t understand her mom had died of breast cancer and not coronavirus.\u201d To Frida Ghitis, Trump \u201clooked like a fast-talking salesman hawking an inferior product.\u201d She argued, \u201cThe most obvious conclusion one can reach watching Trump lie about his own record and about what Biden proposes, is that Trump simply does not believe he has a superior plan to offer voters.\u201d Trump\u2019s lukewarm reception in Philadelphia contrasted with the acclaim he receives at his rallies. But that comes at a price for his audience, noted Dean Obeidallah. \u201cTrump held a rally in Nevada that violated the state\u2019s rules on limiting events to 50 people, ignored the state\u2019s mask mandate and jammed people on top of each other \u2026 Trump is not just exposing his supporters at the rally to the virus. He\u2019s also sending an alarming message to the nation that social distancing mandates can be ignored. This is beyond irresponsible, it borders on sinister given that Trump fully understands how easily transmittable and fatal this virus could be.\u201d In Scranton, \u201cBiden was prepared and he was angry,\u201d wrote Democratic strategist Jess McIntosh. \u201cIt was a tautly restrained outrage as he described the failings of President Donald Trump, and he seemed to hold back tears multiple times as he fielded questions from Americans experiencing overwhelming fear and loss amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic.\u201d Biden demonstrated authenticity and empathy, wrote Alice Stewart, a Republican commentator. That will help him with voters, she argued, but he made mistakes that could cost him in the upcoming debates. Biden retreated from an earlier comment that as president he would impose a national mask mandate and suggested that he would phase out fracking, \u201cthus transitioning countless Pennsylvania fracking workers out of jobs, with no clear sense of how they could find new ones.\u201d  \u201cThe real test comes when both candidates take to the first debate stage on September 29th,\u201d Stewart wrote. \u201cNo amount of on-stage social distancing can diminish the impact of that face-to-face contrast of candidates.\u201d In a column for the Financial Times, Janan Ganesh laid out an intriguing argument that Biden\u2019s flat affect could be an advantage. \u201cThe US has had two consecutive presidents with messianic followings, and it is worse off for the 12-year surge of emotion. No democracy is riper for a period of tepid leadership \u2026 The problem, in other words, is not Mr. Biden\u2019s failure to kindle passion in people. It is our psychic need for such a person in the first place. His election might reacquaint the US with politics as it should be and has been: a machine for the arbitration of conflicting claims, and not as the basis of one\u2019s whole identity.\u201d Michael Caputo, the chief spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, is taking a two-month leave of absence after he shared false conspiracy theories that scientists in the administration are plotting against Trump and that Biden will refuse to concede if Trump wins. \u201cAnd when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,\u201d Caputo said in a live video hosted on his Facebook page. These are not the first inflammatory remarks Caputo has made, noted Michael D\u2019Antonio, who called him \u201ca person perfectly suited for the Trump administration\u201d and said, \u201cothers in the administration show a similar flair for chaos, ignoring the norms of their offices\u2026\u201d Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, also came under scrutiny this week for controversial comments. Speaking at a Hillsdale College event, Barr said, \u201cyou know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.\u201d Many were stunned by the remark. Brandon Tensley wrote, \u201cThat Barr painted a few months of being told \u2013 or as it was in many cases, asked \u2013 to stay home during a global pandemic as being even remotely in the same category as the practice of enslavement is ridiculous.\u201d As he noted, \u201cFor hundreds of years, enslaved Africans were beaten, tortured, raped and treated as property.\u201d Barr\u2019s comments on the election have drawn equally strong criticism. \u201cBy repeating false and misleading statements about the potential for voter fraud and post-election violence, Attorney General William Barr has stepped out of his role as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and marred the 2020 elections,\u201d wrote election law expert Richard L. Hasen.  \u201cThis parroting of President Donald Trump\u2019s unsupported rhetoric is irresponsible and dangerous, turning the job of the Department of Justice as the protector of voting rights on its head.\u201d Meanwhile, Barr\u2019s Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into John Bolton\u2019s publication of a book harshly critical of the President. Elie Honig called it \u201cequal parts futile and dangerous \u2026 the move appears to signal a pernicious effort to use the Justice Department\u2019s might to punish perceived political enemies of President Donald Trump.\u201d For more on politics: Dan Berschinski: I lost my legs fighting for America.

Siberia hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit this year. Death Valley, 130.

We\u2019re already living with the dystopian results.\u201d The nation\u2019s 75-year long relationship with science is undergoing a divorce, wrote Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University. The bargain, struck in 1945, was that \u201cAmerica would support science\u201d by funding research \u201cand in return science would support America, through technical innovation that would better our material conditions and information that would enable us to face life\u2019s challenges and solve them.\u201d But, as news spread of the appointment of a climate science denier to help run NOAA, the agency that provides guidance on climate, that deal is off, Oreskes wrote. \u201cThis administration has repeatedly placed people who have questioned or rejected science in positions of authority throughout the federal service. Vice President Pence rejects evolutionary theory and suggested that smoking doesn\u2019t kill, and the President himself, as is well known, has claimed that climate change is a hoax.\u201d For an example of what science can achieve, read Sara Seager\u2019s account of the work her team did on a sign of potential life on Venus. Covid-19 is spreading rapidly on reopened college campuses, and there have been at least 88,000 cases, according to a New York Times tally. Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert, wrote, \u201cwe find ourselves in a self-inflicted debacle with equally grim options for moving forward and a disengaged federal government. Leaving infected students in colleges will only amplify the infection numbers and\u2026threaten to overwhelm a town; but sending them home also promises a disastrous, if different, ripple of cases and chaos.\u201d \u201cIn allowing their students to return, leaders, who are the heads of universities where Covid-19 spikes have happened, have failed miserably,\u201d he argued. The reopenings happened for two reasons, wrote Lincoln Mitchell. \u201cColleges and universities needed to make sure students enrolled for the fall in order to get revenue from housing, food and related fees. That meant they had to persuade families that college would be safe and relatively normal when the new academic year started.\u201d And in red states, there was political pressure for state universities to align with Republicans\u2019 push for reopening. Last month the Big Ten conference suspended the football season as a result of the pandemic, noted Christine Brennan in USA Today. Then \u201cTrump, desperate to win votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, told the conference to play football,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOriginally, the league stood its ground. Rutgers president Jonathan Holloway aptly called it \u2018cheap politics.\u2019 But wouldn\u2019t you know, the university presidents ended up following right along, giving Trump exactly what he wanted.\u201d Wednesday became \u201cthe darkest day in Big Ten sports history, the day the vaunted conference caved. It choked. It got scared.\u201d Kelly Hammond: I watched \u2018Mulan\u2019 so you don\u2019t have to Allison Hope: A monstrous allegation against ICE can\u2019t be ignored Jeffrey Sachs: Red and blue states took different paths.

Living through her family\u2019s fourth straight fire season in the Bay area, she had already experienced a couple of red flag warnings and so was ready to leave at any moment. When daytime darkness set in a week ago Wednesday, she packed the contents of her refrigerator into a cooler and the family set out for a cabin friends rent out on the eastern side of the Sierra Mountains. But the mountain range was \u201ccompletely obscured by falling ash.\u201d \u201cMy husband and I looked at each other. We could not bring ourselves to drive home.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University, is the author of \u201cAbortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present\u201d (Cambridge University Press, 2020). The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s passing marks the end of an era in more ways than one. Having repeatedly beaten cancer, Ginsburg had come to almost seem invincible. She was a larger than life figure who became a hero to many young women trying to follow the path she forged in the legal profession. Ginsburg\u2019s age and frail health were no secret, but her loss still comes as a shock. Perhaps more than any other jurist, Ginsburg transformed the law of sex discrimination in America. It is hard to imagine the Supreme Court without her. Even before joining the Supreme Court, she convinced an all-male Supreme Court that laws enforcing sex stereotypes violated the Constitution \u2013 and demonstrated how those laws harmed men as well as women. Ginsburg helped make sense of how discrimination against pregnant workers could be pernicious. On the court, Ginsburg offered the clearest and most cogent defense of abortion rights. She showed that sex discrimination involved often-baseless generalizations \u2013 a conclusion that helped advance successful equality claims made by LGBTQ+ groups. Ginsburg has become an icon for a reason. Her impact on constitutional jurisprudence is hard to overestimate. Attention Mitch McConnell: Filling RBG's seat now could break American democracy Her loss also promises to have a seismic effect on American politics. In 2016, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell famously refused to hold hearings on Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, because the nation would soon choose a new president. Now, McConnell has vowed to replace Ginsburg less than two months before voters go to the polls. Democratic candidates have already experimented with the idea of overhauling the court \u2013 expanding the number of  justices, imposing term limits, and more. If the majority leader makes good on his promise to replace Ginsburg, the temptation to pack the court may well be irresistible. What\u2019s more, a court without Ginsburg will no longer be defined by Chief Justice John Roberts. While Roberts is unquestionably a conservative, he also takes a profound interest in the reputation of the Supreme Court \u2013 and in his own legacy. The chief justice often served as the swing vote this term in cases on everything from the DACA program to abortion. Should a Republican Senate confirm Ginsburg\u2019s replacement, Roberts\u2019 vote will matter far less. The court will likely be much more conservative. Outcomes that once seemed off the table \u2013 including the complete reversal of Roe v. Wade \u2013 will become realistic, if not expected.  President Trump has hinted that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, widely believed to be a skeptic of Roe, will be the next in line for the high court. With Barrett\u2019s nomination, abortion would no longer be a sleeper issue in the 2020 election. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of the right to choose hinges on who replaces Ginsburg, and when. Starting today, both political parties will hustle to determine who shapes what is to come after Ginsburg. But no matter what happens next, Ginsburg\u2019s legacy should not be forgotten. Whenever anyone thinks of equal protection under the law in the United States, they will likely think of equality between the sexes. We have Ruth Bader Ginsburg to thank for that.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book \u201cOK Boomer, Let\u2019s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.\u201d Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. President Donald Trump is gunning for the women\u2019s vote, and so to great fanfare, he announced his plans to pardon one very prominent woman: Susan B. Anthony, who died in 1906. Anthony was arrested for voting in Rochester, New York, in 1872, a time when it was illegal for women to do so. She was on the frontlines of the movement for women\u2019s suffrage, and by the time her fight was at least partly won and women secured voting rights in 1920, Anthony was long dead \u2013 and even then, women of color continued to be excluded from the ballot box by widespread racist attacks on voting rights. It was the conservatives of Anthony\u2019s time who fought back against women\u2019s rights, arguing that politics was harsh business too vulgar for women\u2019s participation, and that women, as the moral centers of the family, were essentially too good (and too intellectually lacking) to participate. Politics, their argument went, could even drive a wedge between husbands and wives \u2013 better to have women serve as private keepers of the house and home and let men dominate public, political and economic life. Now, 100 years after Anthony\u2019s cause was attained and the 19th Amendment was ratified, it is this anti-feminist legacy that Trump and his Republican Party carry forward. Nearly 150 years ago, Susan B. Anthony was arrested for voting when women weren't allowed to. Today, she'll get a pardon Trump ran against the first woman who had real potential to be the president of the United States, and ran a campaign that was shockingly and often crassly misogynistic. He has appointed fewer women to his cabinet than any president taking office this century. And he\u2019s not an outlier in his party. While Democrats ran a record number of women in the 2018 midterms and a record number won, the number of Republican women in both Congress and state legislatures actually went down. The number of GOP women in the House is the lowest it\u2019s been in 25 years. Women make up nearly a quarter of House seats and close to 40% of House Democrats, but Republican women do far worse: Women make up less than 7% of Republicans in the House. And those anti-suffragists did get one thing right: Letting women vote would indeed allow them increased independence, including from their husbands. Today, the gender gap in voting is wider than ever. A majority of men vote for Republicans, and have since 1980. Most women vote for Democrats, including huge majorities of women of color. Yet despite waning Republican support both to and from women, conservative groups have gone so far as to lay claim to Anthony\u2019s legacy \u2013 which is perhaps one reason why Trump chose her for a pardon. Right-wing groups claim she was anti-abortion, without any substantial historical evidence, and in the face of ample proof that she was a radical progressive in her time and a vocal advocate for women\u2019s freedoms. Today\u2019s GOP continues to oppose many of the feminist goals Anthony advocated for, and certainly the feminist movement she helped to found. But as always happens with social progress, conservatives claim ownership of the gains made by liberals \u2013 even as they try to walk those gains back. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. As Trump announces that he is pardoning a woman whose life\u2019s work was expanding voting rights and was arrested for voting, he\u2019s simultaneously trying to make it more difficult for Americans to carry out their fundamental civic duty of political participation. In the midst of a deadly pandemic when it\u2019s simply not safe to be in close proximity with other people indoors for extended periods of time, Trump  has been hard at work undermining the US Postal Service \u2013 the agency that will be in charge of ferrying millions of absentee and mail-in ballots to the vote counters. Gergen: Trump traps GOP in boneheaded position Trump and his wife have requested mail-in ballots, despite claiming (without presenting evidence, even when told to do so in a court of law) that voter fraud is a rampant and serious problem with voting by mail. In fact, thanks in part to the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the Republican Party is planning a widespread campaign of vote suppression and voter intimidation, or as they put it, rooting out fraud; to this end, they\u2019re \u201crecruiting up to 50,000 volunteers in 15 key states to monitor polling places and challenge ballots and voters deemed suspicious,\u201d The New York Times reported in May. And Trump has more or less admitted he is using his office to suppress the vote. The US Postal Service has requested emergency funding to keep them afloat \u2013 like many businesses, they have been hit hard by the coronavirus, and an impending election with what is on track to be a record number of ballots cast by mail is going to require an injection of resources. Trump gets that: \u201cThey need that money in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,\u201d he said. And that\u2019s also, he said, why he\u2019s refusing to fund the post office (though he did also say after outcry he\u2019d sign a bill including it). He doesn\u2019t want them to be able to take all of these millions and millions of ballots. One hundred years after women won the right to vote, American women are still underrepresented in politics; our basic rights are still up for debate; women who run for office are attacked as unfeminine harpies; and the President of the United States is a man who has boasted about sexual assault and denigrates women with misogynist slurs.  Now, while he\u2019s paying lip service to a fighter for women\u2019s suffrage, he\u2019s working to disenfranchise millions of American women. Trump praising a woman who fought for the right to vote while undermining the voting rights of millions of Americans is perfectly Trumpian: An empty spectacle notable only for its shameless hypocrisy.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s not that hard.\u201d So said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Friday when asked about lost productivity, as parents care for children out of school during the pandemic. \u201cJust go back to school, we can do that.\u201d Can we? How should we? Those are the questions doctors, parents and public officials are asking in a chorus, its volume increasing as July ticks toward August. That\u2019s when many school districts would normally resume classes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s guidelines for school opening during the surge in Covid-19 cases do not align with President Donald Trump\u2019s desires: in tones that many perceived as threatening, he issued a tweet on Friday implying that schools that don\u2019t open for in-person instruction may be denied federal funding. While Trump isn\u2019t empowered to do that unilaterally, he could try to restrict pandemic relief money or refuse to sign future grants or bailouts for education. \u201cThis would be a detrimental move,\u201d warned primary care pediatrician Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, \u201cadding more fear and confusion during an already chaotic time.\u201d The reopening of schools is a goal, not a mandate or a foregone conclusion, wrote Bracho-Sanchez. Stuck in the middle are students and their parents \u2014 and teachers. Elana Rabinowitz, an ESL teacher in New York City, where teachers were among the pandemic\u2019s first victims, implored the \u201cparents and especially politicians expressing their opinions\u201d to consider educators\u2019 perspective and the \u201cteachers, teachers\u2019 aides, administrators, office employees, food service workers and others (who) have died\u201d when making life-and-death decisions about going back to school. \u201cI love my students,\u201d she lamented, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to be next.\u201d Rabinowitz, who favors a community-driven combination of limited in-person instruction (with appropriate resources) and virtual learning, offered public officials this message: \u201cStop pretending there is a one-size-fits all solution that will work for an entire state, much less the entire country \u2026 What schools need from the top is support, flexibility and money \u2014 not control.\u201d As the school debate gained momentum, it renewed attention on treatment for Covid-19 and questions about the possibility of a vaccine to fight it. Biologist Erin Bromage explained that any vaccine\u2019s efficacy depends on how well it trains our bodies to respond to infections. With vaccine trials ongoing in multiple countries, \u201cscientists around the world will focus on understanding how our immune systems respond to the virus that causes Covid-19,\u201d he wrote, and what \u201cwe learn will have major implications for how vaccines are designed, the cells they train, and how long immunity might last.\u201d Dr. Phoebe Danziger, a pediatrician, warned in The New York Times that an effective vaccine will work only when patients are willing to take it, which is far from a given: \u201cAs repeated measles outbreaks demonstrate, we haven\u2019t done a great job addressing people\u2019s concerns about vaccines. And if we don\u2019t learn from our failed response to them, a coronavirus vaccine program will be doomed.\u201d Even without a Covid-19 vaccine, there\u2019s still reason for hope, affirmed William Haseltine. Drug treatment \u2014 probably antivirals or monoclonal antibodies \u2014 \u201ccan likely help us bridge the gap between where we are today \u2014 with only masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing to protect us \u2014 to where we hope to be tomorrow \u2013 with a vaccine in hand.\u201d Smart takes on self-care: \u2013 Dr. Ford Vox: What Covid stress is doing to your body \u2013 Dr. Vivek H. Murthy and Dr. Alice T. Chen: The best way to take care of your mental health during the pandemic In a widely anticipated move on Friday evening, Trump commuted the sentence of political operative and longtime ally Roger Stone just before he was to begin serving 40 months behind bars. This exercise of the most presidential of executive powers drew widespread outrage and also held up a mirror to just how powerless Trump is feeling right now, wrote Errol Louis. A Friday night bombshell isn\u2019t rare for this White House, but the \u201cangry announcement\u201d that accompanied this one \u201creflected the rage of an administration that is besieged and bewildered, hemmed in \u2014 this week alone \u2014 by skyrocketing Covid-19 cases; wretchedly bad poll numbers; the looming release of a tell-all book by President Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump; and a Supreme Court decision that means Trump\u2019s personal taxes could be seen by prosecutors soon.\u201d Trump can\u2019t change much of that, but he can use his \u201cunreviewable power to commute federal sentences\u201d to lash out at enemies, wrote Louis. For an advance take on Mary Trump\u2019s book: \u2013 Michael D\u2019Antonio: Mary Trump\u2019s disturbingly credible assessment of her \u2018dangerous\u2019 Uncle Donald \u201cForget MAGA,\u201d opined Frida Ghitis. \u201cThe snappy new motto of the Trump 2020 campaign would be more fittingly changed to \u2018Hate One Another.\u2019\u201d Citing the President\u2019s stances \u201cin defense of all things Confederacy\u201d at a time when most Americans support a national reckoning on race, Ghitis assessed that Trump is \u201cpunching back against his collapsing poll numbers with a new campaign aimed to appeal to his most racist supporters and hoping to expand that core by creating more divisions and more fear.\u201d The GOP must rescue itself from the doom Trump is bringing down on his party and evolve to survive, wrote former Republican congressman Charlie Dent, who observed: \u201cSpeaking to people of color, religious minorities and the LGBTQ community will demand a policy platform that is socially tolerant and sensible, constructively engaged on the international stage and supports reasonably regulated free markets. Trump and \u201cTrumpism\u201d make it virtually impossible to accomplish these objectives.\u201d For more: \u2013 Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan: Democrats, it\u2019s too soon to cheer Trump\u2019s defeat \u2013 Robert Redford: This is who gets my vote in 2020 After Goya CEO Robert Unanu said on the White House lawn Thursday that \u201cwe are all truly blessed \u2026 to have a leader like President Trump,\u201d the world \u201cstood on its head,\u201d wrote Ed Morales, who like most of his friends and family, has Goya products in his cupboard. The ubiquitous brand has long been a way for Latinos, himself included, to stay connected to traditions \u2014 and even for \u201cmany non-Latinos, consuming Goya products is a fairly authentic, if superficial way to practice Latinidad.\u201d Morales pointed out that the outrage and boycott that sprung up on social media have changed all that for now, even as they quickly also became a new pawn in Trump\u2019s culture wars and allowed the president and his supporters, like Ted Cruz, to cry \u201ccancel culture.\u201d  A boycott is not likely to change Unanue\u2019s mind, he wrote, but many, many Latinos will cook on \u2014 without him. Elie Honig said Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 efforts to put the Supreme Court before politics have yielded a variety of surprising recent stances for a conservative jurist, including voting to save DACA, defend the rights of transgender Americans in the workplace, block a controversial and restrictive abortion law in Louisiana. But these were all a prelude to Thursday\u2019s much-anticipated rulings on the President\u2019s tax returns: \u201cRoberts joined with the liberal bloc, plus Trump-appointed justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, to flatly reject Trump\u2019s legal claim that he is above the reach of prosecutors or Congress. However, by sending the cases back down to lower courts for further consideration, the court left Trump with enough wiggle room to delay and run out the clock, likely past the November election.\u201d These most mixed-bag decisions reflect an important reality, insisted Honig: Roberts \u201cowes nothing to anybody, and has nothing to gain from playing politics, for or against either party.\u201d Ed McCaffery wrote that Roberts\u2019 opinion on Trump\u2019s taxes \u201cgoes back to the 1807 trial of Aaron Burr\u201d to affirm \u201cthat the President is not above the law. Grade school students in America are supposed to know that. Maybe it is time to pass simple laws that make this simple point even simpler \u2026 Two laws I humbly suggest: One, every President must disclose his or her tax returns. Two, every President must wear a mask in public just like everyone else.\u201d In a 5-4 decision, the court also held that based on 19th-century treaties, much of the eastern part of Oklahoma is, legally speaking, a Creek reservation \u2014 which will have wide-ranging practical and symbolic ramifications in the state. Writing at Bloomberg Opinion, Noah Feldman noted, \u201cIf this attitude of acknowledging broken promises and fulfilling them were to be adopted by the courts, not to mention by the American public, it would go a long way toward repairing the nearly unimaginable wrongs done to the first peoples of the North American continent over the centuries.\u201d For more on the Supreme Court: \u2013 Robert Alexander: Court\u2019s ruling on Electoral College won\u2019t fix much \u2013 Ilyse Hogue: Court\u2019s contraception ruling spotlights Trump administration\u2019s end goal: controlling women\u2019s bodies \u2013 Lisa A. Tucker: Just how far will Clarence Thomas go? This week, outcry arose after Immigrations and Customs Enforcement announced new rules requiring international students to leave the United States if their universities or colleges, facing the ongoing threat of Covid-19, implemented online-only learning environments for the fall \u2014 something some leading institutions of higher learning have already done. These rules are \u201canother disgusting, transparent Trump administration attack on foreigners and immigrants, one that is solely about malice,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. Anushay Hossain responded to the new guidance by reflecting on how the journey from Bangladesh to go to college in the US changed the course of her life. \u201cLet\u2019s look around us,\u201d she appealed. \u201cWho are our doctors? Who are our medical researchers? Who are the country\u2019s top scientists? Ask yourself \u2014 who works to make America stronger than she already is?\u201d Writing for Made By History at the Washington Post, education anthropologist Chenyu Wang wrote that while international study in the US has changed before during significant moments like World War II or the Cold War, the Trump administration\u2019s stance marks a \u201cshift in the country\u2019s political agenda \u2026 Today, rather than focusing on foreign policy goals, the administration is using its power to define an admissible foreign student as one who is willing to risk their life in exchange for studying on a reopened college campus with in-person classes.\u201d Another smart take, from CNN Business Perspectives: \u2013 Charles A. Goldman and Rita T. Karam: College in America could be changed forever \u201cFor those discouraged by the recklessness of policymakers, some solace can be found in the work of a group of healthy young American millionaires who are using science to punch their way forward through the pandemic and its restrictions: Professional athletes.\u201d You read that right. In the weeks to come, according to infection control expert Kent Sepkowitz, athletes, coaches and support staff of America\u2019s major league sports who are working to reopen safely \u201cwill become volunteers in a vast national experiment to see whether an evidence-based, rather than miracle-based, program might allow the rest of us to gradually resume an orderly and un-isolated life.\u201d More on sports: \u2013 Roxanne Jones: The WNBA has come too far to be silenced by Kelly Loeffler \u2013 Brad Balukjian: When baseball players retire, they turn into accidental Buddhists It\u2019s become known as \u201cthe letter\u201d \u2014 formally titled \u201cA Letter on Justice and Open Debate,\u201d published by Harper\u2019s Magazine and signed by more than 150 scholars, journalists, artists and intellectuals ranging from J.K. Rowling to Noam Chomsky and warning of the dangers of cancel culture. Jeff Yang described it as an elegantly written affirmation of privilege: \u201ceven if the letter were warranted \u2014 even if it weren\u2019t an off-note, Olympian statement that reads as self-interested and elitist at best \u2014 it\u2019s sure to be used by serial bad actors on the list (of signatories) as a shield against legitimate criticism.\u201d Megan McArdle characterized the backlash thus in the Washington Post: \u201cUnsurprisingly, the letter triggered some of the very tactics it implicitly condemns.\u201d \u201cWho signed the letter in Harper\u2019s is just as important as what\u2019s written in it,\u201d opined Jessica Valenti for GEN \u2014 and for many, that significance rested most heavily on the signature of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d creator J.K. Rowling, long embattled for transphobia and just this week for a tweet comparing gender affirmation care with gay conversion therapy. \u201cBoy Erased\u201d author Garrard Conley, a survivor of this toxic process \u2014 and a \u201cPotter\u201d fan \u2014 categorically refuted her comparison as bigoted and painful, noting: \u201cAny time someone tells you they want to protect you from what you know and feel to be true, that person does not have your best interests at heart.\u201d It seemed like all of America tuned in to stream the newly-released film version of \u201cHamilton\u201d on Disney Plus last weekend like they were running out of time. And yet, in Ed Morales\u2019 estimation, the film entered a cultural landscape in 2020 nearly unrecognizable by the standard of the 2015 Broadway hit. The multicultural production seems now \u201cat odds with Black Lives Matter\u2019s strident call for radical change to an America where the legacy of white supremacy lives on,\u201d wrote Morales. \u201cTo reassess Hamilton now is to note a crucial incompatibility with our current moment: Its hero and its message are essentially ambivalent while today\u2019s politics around America\u2019s racial sins requires taking a strong stance.\u201d Despite its dissonances now, \u201cHamilton\u201d may yet have much to teach us about our own moment, asserted S. Mitra Kalita, who interviewed Thayne Jasperson, one of the White actors from the original cast. Recalling her own experience seeing the production on stage and again on screen, Kalita wrote: \u201cI noticed the few White faces on stage and wondered if they might have some insight on what it was like to live the revolution that was \u201cHamilton,\u201d what that means now and if they might have advice on what it means to be an ally to people of color.\u201d \u2013 Julian Zelizer: What Trump learned from Newt Gingrich \u2013 Penny Pritzker and Jack Markell: Six ways to fix America\u2019s broken safety net \u2013 Joey Jackson and Diana Florence: What the Amy Cooper case really reveals \u2013 Andrew Peterson: How to decide who gets the Covid-19 vaccine first \u2013 David Andelman: Trump\u2019s risky nose-to-nose challenge to China in the South China Sea \u2013 Peggy Drexler: Naya Rivera\u2019s disappearance is a hard reminder The news that ABC is rebooting \u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d \u2014 set in 1960s Alabama with a Black family and with former child actor Fred Savage and director Lee Daniels at the helm \u2014 roused nostalgia, critique and anticipation. Skeptical of nearly every other remake as recycling at best, Gene Seymour speculated that \u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d would be different. Where the original looked back at the 1960s from the vantage of the late 1980s, this new version offers the prospect of looking at the civil rights-era South through a 21st-century, Black Lives Matter-focused lens \u2014 with the ultimate hope of opening up nostalgia, previously the \u201csole property of White America,\u201d to new potential intimacies and channels of empathy. \u201cSo many Black children like me knew those \u2018wonder years,\u2019 too,\u201d observed Seymour. A reimagination of a beloved show presents \u201can intriguing test case for how much empathy has grown between Black and White Americans in a post-George Floyd time frame. \u2026 The grownups who found communion in the original \u2018Wonder Years\u2019 could find similar communion with this one.\u201d",

She conceived of and edited the forthcoming \u201cHamilton and the Law: Reading Today\u2019s Most Contentious Legal Issues through the Hit Musical.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN. \u201cI would have gone further.\u201d If you follow the Supreme Court, you probably know that \u201cI would have gone further\u201d is a maxim usually associated with Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, given that he often has a more extreme view of the Constitution than his fellow justices. And even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve probably gotten the basic idea that \u201cCT,\u201d as he\u2019s called around the Supreme Court building, is \u2014 in Sesame Street-ese \u2014 not like the others, even the other conservative justices. Until the court took its arguments virtual, he almost never asked questions of advocates. Unlike other justices who teach courses in Austria during the court\u2019s recess, Thomas spends his summers driving around the country in his RV, often parking overnight at the nearest Walmart. And he\u2019s known to many as the court\u2019s most loyal conservative \u2014 so much so that his dissents often carry a \u201cwhy stop here?\u201d kind of parlance. \u201cGoing further\u201d is a position he seems to be taking with respect to his tenure on the court as well. Nominated and confirmed in 1991, Thomas is the longest-serving current justice, and already in the Top 20 for longest-tenured justices ever, despite the fact that two others are considerably older than he is. For almost thirty years, progressives like me have shrunk back in horror at the thought that Thomas\u2019s outlier view of the Constitution might eventually become law. In many dissents, he has advocated for gun rights, against abortion, for government establishment of religion, and against school speech. We don\u2019t like Thomas\u2019s approach to those cases.  But in the case of whether Thomas decides to stay on the court as he approaches his 30th anniversary? Going further \u2014 in terms of time \u2014 sounds great. Clarence Thomas says he was 'radical' while at Harvard It\u2019s not like having Clarence Thomas on the court for another year is something for progressives to celebrate, 30 years or no. In that year, important law could be made and lasting precedent set (although, as we saw in last week\u2019s abortion decision, Thomas, on the whole, does not view precedent as nearly as important as what he considers a \u201ccorrect\u201d result). But if Thomas does not follow the recent tradition of justices retiring during or just after the last week of the Supreme Court term, he will almost certainly be on the court until the November election. With polls showing Biden ahead by 10 points, it\u2019s likely that a Thomas vacancy would be filled by a liberal justice, a paradigmatic example of karma coming home to roost. But you might say even if Thomas retired this week, Trump could not appoint his replacement, right? In 2016, when Justice Antonin Scalia died and President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and friends blocked the nomination, citing the \u201crule\u201d that no Supreme Court appointments should take place in a Presidential election year. Yeah, no. Not that it really was a \u201crule\u201d in the first place, but McConnell weaseled his way out of that one last year, \u201cexplaining\u201d that the \u201crule\u201d had something to do with the Senate and the President and the parties they represented. Republicans would consider replacing Thomas, even later this year, to be fair game. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they haven\u2019t approached Thomas, asking him to consider it. Indeed, just last week, Trump announced that he\u2019ll have a list of potential nominees ready to go by the end of the summer. Supreme Court's ruling on Electoral College -- chaos could still ensue Without Thomas, what would the Supreme Court look like? With a Biden victory, one of two things will happen: Its composition of one chief and eight associate justices will remain the same, but Biden will nominate younger liberals to the court to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, both past the age of 80; or his administration could change course to follow the advice of some to convince Congress to add additional seats which a President Biden could fill. While Biden has strongly opposed the idea of expanding the court, it\u2019s an idea that has gained popularity in the Democratic Party. If the court is still \u201cThe Nine,\u201d a retirement by Justice Samuel Alito is a strong possibility in the next year or two, as rumor has it that his family is ready to leave Washington, DC. If Biden has the opportunity to appoint a liberal replacement for a conservative stalwart, Thomas could be more heavily outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered and out planned than he is now. What would that mean? That his predictable votes for far-right interpretations of the Constitution would be even further outnumbered by those of the progressive wing, especially as Chief Justice John Roberts increasingly (albeit unreliably) sides with his liberal peers on some important social justice issues. Even if Thomas decided to go further and further and further, his decision not to retire this week might well present an opportunity for progressives to replace him. First, consider Thomas\u2019s age. Sure, he\u2019s \u201conly\u201d 72 (he celebrated a birthday last month), and other justices have served well into their 80s. But there\u2019s a real chance that Thomas would also have to serve into his 80s to prevent a President Biden or a Democratic successor from replacing him with a young liberal.  But it\u2019s an uncertain proposition at best. As his predecessor Thurgood Marshall explained upon his reluctant retirement at the age of 82 under a Republican President, \u201cI\u2019m getting old and coming apart!\u201d One of Thomas\u2019s close friends recently stated that Thomas will \u201cdie on the court.\u201d Marshall had similarly declared that he had \u201ca lifetime appointment and \u2026 intend[ed] to serve it.\u201d But some years later, Marshall was forced to admit the impossibility of that plan. He stepped down. Thomas was his replacement. And so, we wait. And we speculate. And we wonder: Is this the week that Clarence Thomas decides that he has gone far enough?",

Senate Republicans should be careful what they wish for \u2013 and that includes South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who this weekend said out loud what many of his fellow Republicans are thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate, but I think appointing judges is a high priority for me in 2020,\u201d he told Greta Van Susteren, host of \u201cFull Court Press.\u201d Should a Supreme Court seat open up, President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have five months to jam through another conservative. If the next available seat is vacated by one of the liberal justices, then their new appointee could cement the nine-member court\u2019s conservative tilt for decades to come. Don\u2019t think that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to press pause and abide by the election year rule he designed when denying Judge Merrick Garland a Senate hearing in 2016. Just consider the nomination of Justin Walker, a district court judge with limited experience on the bench who McConnell is aggressively pushing through the Senate confirmation process during a pandemic. Few Democrats want to talk about the possibility of a liberal vacancy. After all, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the oldest justice at age 87, is an icon who broke through gender barriers to become one of the most influential and committed progressive voices on the Supreme Court in history. As a proud owner of a \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d shirt, I get it. But remember, she and Justice Stephen Breyer, another liberal member of the court in his 80s, cannot be justices forever. And if Republicans are talking about this, Democrats should be, too. I was the communications director in the White House when then-President Barack Obama nominated Garland. We naively thought that someone who had been confirmed to the DC Court of Appeals with 76 votes in the Senate would face some opposition \u2013 but would ultimately be confirmed. Clearly, we were wrong. McConnell was not going to let that happen. Not only did Garland not get a hearing, he barely had any meetings with Republicans. Democrats have every right to still be bitter about this. I still am. McConnell flips, changes his rule on Supreme Court confirmations But Democrats should also turn that bitterness into action \u2013 and take a lesson from Trump and McConnell, making the next Supreme Court vacancy a centerpiece of the 2020 election. Unlike in 2016, when the Garland nomination was not mentioned during the Democratic National Convention, it should get top billing this year. The good news is that Democrats have a lot to work with. Unlike in 2018, when there were a number of vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election in red states (like North Dakota and Missouri) where all Republicans had to do was win reliably Republican voters, this year McConnell\u2019s majority hinges on vulnerable Republicans winning states with a plethora of moderate suburban voters \u2013 the same voters who helped Democrats win back the House in the midterms. More specifically, McConnell has to defend the seats of Maine Sen. Susan Collins, whose approval rating sunk following her vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He also has to protect Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who represents an increasingly purple state with a Democratic opponent \u2013 former Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2013 who is leading by double digits in early state polling, and Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, who not only lost her first Senate race, but is now running against a highly admired astronaut. And while Republicans won some Senate races in reliably red states in 2018, Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was a drag on Republican House candidates in districts that look a lot more like the states where 2020 will be decided. Republican incumbents are already running with Trump at the top of the ticket during a global pandemic that has already cost more than 90,000 American lives \u2013 and millions of jobs. But they will also be running at a time when the Supreme Court is considering a Republican-led lawsuit to end the Affordable Care Act. If there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, a vote for a Republican incumbent would be a vote for killing the Affordable Care Act, which is more popular now than it has ever been, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The stakes of Trump's tax return case couldn't be higher Democrats should be clear that confirmation of another Trump judge could be the death knell of the Affordable Care Act, which Trump is currently asking the Supreme Court to overturn. In other words, they should make this vote the 2020 version of the ACA-repeal votes that contributed to the downfall of so many Republican members of Congress in 2018. Anyone voting to confirm a Trump nominee is voting to kick tens of millions of Americans off their health care in the middle of a pandemic that\u2019s reminding families everywhere how important access to care really is. And Democrats should not let Senate decorum get in the way. It\u2019s basic campaign 101 \u2013 when a candidate is down, you don\u2019t let up. You deliver the clear knockout punch. When talking about the Supreme Court, Democrats too often spend time trying to look reasonable \u2013 saying they need to consider all the details of a nominee\u2019s record. There\u2019s a time and a place for that, but we shouldn\u2019t pretend that there\u2019s any question what kind of nominee Trump\u2019s going to pick. He\u2019s told us and shown us time and again: he\u2019ll pick a judge hand-selected by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization, who will side with him on issues like ending the Affordable Care Act, expanding executive authority and overturning the landmark abortion case of Roe v. Wade.  Finally, Democrats can\u2019t hem and haw for weeks. Democratic Senate candidates should announce the stakes of this election immediately and begin to mobilize grassroots opposition, putting vulnerable Senate Republicans in the hot seat. No one on the Democratic side wants to be fighting a conservative replacement to Ginsburg, perhaps because they want her to live forever. But preserving her legacy also means being prepared for the fight. And if Graham and McConnell are getting ready, Democrats must be, too.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. There must be something in the water in Kentucky. At a time when partisanship still runs rampant, despite a pandemic, Kentucky\u2019s leaders have found a way to come to a bipartisan agreement on how to administer the upcoming primary on June 23. That agreement \u2013 which expands vote-by-mail for all voters, permits in-person voting for those who need it, and allows the state to begin the process of cleaning up the voter rolls \u2013 pales in comparison to the debacle in Wisconsin, where partisan bickering and court decisions that fell along ideological lines led voters to face an unfathomable choice between their health and their fundamental right to vote. Officials in other states should copy Kentucky\u2019s lead. Senator Mitch McConnell should look to his own backyard to see how working across the aisle can actually produce positive results for the people. Maybe if McConnell emulated his state\u2019s leaders\u2014and learned how to work in a bipartisan manner \u2013 he would not be so unpopular. The Kentucky deal gives something to each side, but most importantly, it prioritizes the protection of voters. Democratic Governor Andy Beshear and Republican Secretary of State Michael G. Adams \u2013 who under state law can jointly alter the \u201cmanner\u201d of an election during a state of emergency \u2013 have changed Kentucky\u2019s strict election rules substantially to make it easier to vote. Although the agreement applies only to the June 23 primary, they should expand it to November and beyond. Kentucky is one of 16 states that normally requires an excuse to vote absentee, but the agreement allows any voter to claim a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d because of the coronavirus. That\u2019s common sense: We are all suffering from a medical emergency right now, even if we have not personally contracted the virus. The state will create an online portal for voters to request an absentee ballot. That will ease the process on voters and minimize the amount of paper requests that county clerks must process, though voters can still request an absentee ballot through the normal means. Absentee ballots must be postmarked by Election Day but can arrive up to four days later, ensuring that voters are not disenfranchised because of delays within the postal service. The state will trace every absentee ballot, minimizing the concern of fraud. There is virtually no fraud in our elections, including through vote-by-mail, but ballot tracing will hopefully make people feel even more secure about the process. Opening America now is ludicrous Voters can still vote in person during two weeks of early voting \u2013 which the state does not normally have \u2013 as well as on Election Day, and they can even make an appointment to do so in an effort to avoid crowds, though they cannot be turned away for not having an appointment. Polling places must scrupulously follow the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on social distancing and sanitary practices. Counties can use vote centers and drive-through voting. The goal is to minimize direct contact between poll workers and voters as much as possible. In addition, the state will mail a postcard to every voter in the state to notify them of these procedures, which will include the URL to request an absentee ballot (the State Board of Elections is still finalizing the portal). If the postcards are returned as undeliverable, then the state will use that fact in the first step of a process to clean up the voter rolls, though federal and state law forbids the state from purging any voters unless the person both fails to respond to an additional mailed notice and then fails to vote in two subsequent November federal elections. The deal therefore maximizes the goals of both Democrats and Republicans: It makes it much easier to participate in the election during a pandemic by expanding vote-by-mail. It also prioritizes security measures within the new procedures, and allows the state to start the process of cleaning up the voter rolls. This is a model for the rest of the country to consider. To be sure, it would better for the state to mail every voter an absentee ballot automatically without the voter needing to request one, as occurs in five other states, but Kentucky Secretary of State Adams refused to do so given his concerns, overblown as they may be, about bloated voter rolls. This next best solution \u2013 allowing any voter to request an absentee ballot through a secure online portal \u2013 is a good compromise. In addition, voter purges must be done with care, lest valid voters lose their right to vote, especially given that voter purges often harm minorities the most.  None of this progress is to suggest that partisanship no longer exists in Kentucky. Republicans are aghast that Beshear vetoed a new abortion bill and criticized his statement that signing it would itself be divisive. Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron has joined a lawsuit against Beshear to challenge his executive order that restricts travel out of the state. Democrats, for their part, were justifiably apoplectic that, during a pandemic, Republicans pushed through a new photo ID requirement for voting \u2013 though that bill does not go into effect until the November election. But on the vitally important issue of how to ensure our elections will proceed during a pandemic, Kentucky\u2019s leaders from both sides worked together with one goal in mind: how to best protect voters. It\u2019s a lesson that other states should take to heart.",

Will Rogers once quipped, \u201cI am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.\u201d That joke has bite in 2020 as Democrats are terrified that they will tear themselves apart before the election ever takes place. The tumult of the Iowa caucuses seemed to symbolize the worst nightmares. Bernie Sanders is the current favorite for the nomination, but several frontrunners have the money and organizational support to take this competition all the way to the convention. And with the decision still apparently far off, the factions within the party will continue to go after each other with hammer and tong. In the party\u2019s worst-case scenario, President Trump is the last person standing as Democrats are bloodied and beaten up by what they do to themselves. But those fears don\u2019t have to be realized. Political parties can survive the most intense factionalism. With a skillful leader guiding them, parties can even use internal divisions as a source of electoral strength. It's unanimous: a horrible night for Bloomberg This is what happened in the 1980 election. A former governor of California, Republican Ronald Reagan, brought the conservative movement into the halls of power by defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter. Most historians consider this a turning point that shifted American politics to the right and changed the national debate in ways that continue to influence us today. Reagan\u2019s Republican Party faced deep fault lines of its own. The conservative movement that had swept through the nation in the 1970s, of which Reagan was a part, consisted of a multiplicity of factions \u2013 all of which opposed the persistence of American liberalism. There was the religious right, which consisted of Evangelical Christians who had decided to mobilize politically to fight abortion, champion \u201ctraditional\u201d cultural values, and defend the tax-exempt status for largely white private academies. The business community also increased its presence in Washington, seeking deregulation of policies that impacted industry as well as tax reductions that would lower the burden on corporations and wealthy Americans. Meanwhile, neoconservative Democrats and hawkish conservatives wanted to see a buildup of military spending and an end to Richard Nixon\u2019s policy of d\u00e9tente, which had eased relations with the Soviets and China. The most radical 2020 candidate The factions of conservatism were not always in agreement and, in many cases, were at odds over public policy. While the Republicans did not have nearly as many candidates as Democrats do today, Reagan was challenged by two formidable opponents. There was George H.W. Bush, who had served in a number of major jobs in Washington \u2013 including CIA director \u2013 and who blasted Reagan\u2019s economic theories as \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d Then there was Illinois Republican John Anderson, a skilled moderate who had supported civil rights and environmental protection and could boast of deep experience on Capitol Hill. His \u201ccampaign of ideas\u201d held great appeal to moderates who feared that Reagan\u2019s extremism would lead him to suffer the same fate as Barry Goldwater in 1964. Yet what made Reagan so effective as a candidate in 1980 was that he could find ways to unite the factions of conservatism into a temporary, albeit fragile, alliance. Reagan, who was a master communicator from his acting career in Hollywood, honed in on two key themes that cut across the conservative divide: tax cuts and anti-communism. Above all, he consistently prioritized cutting down the progressive income tax system and boosting the defense budget. After fiasco, Iowa results matter less Reagan also used Carter as a focal point for his supporters, understanding that Republican outrage about the possibility of two terms would overwhelm any discomfort that different parts of his coalition had with each other. Throughout the fall campaign, Reagan kept returning to Carter in his ads and speeches, blaming the President for the miserable economy and pointing to the administration\u2019s inability to free the American hostages in Iran. In one of his most potent quips, with the Statue of Liberty behind him, Reagan told followers at a rally that, \u201cRecession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.\u201d The campaign worked. Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 Electoral College votes to Carter\u2019s 49, and 50.7% of the popular vote. The defeat was stunning for Carter and the Democratic Party.  \u201cDespite pre-election polls that had forecast a fairly close election,\u201d Hendrick Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cthe rout was so pervasive and so quickly apparent that Mr. Carter made the earliest concession statement of a major Presidential candidate since 1904, when Alton B. Parker bowed to Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d  The tensions within the conservative movement never disappeared. They would flare early in Reagan\u2019s first term, as some elements in his coalition, such as the religious right, felt the president was ignoring their concerns. But Reagan would continue to find ways to keep them united enough, going on to win a second term and seeing his Vice President succeed him in 1989. Factionalism is a difficult challenge for any party. But it need not be a barrier to victory. And in 2020, Democrats can look back to one of their most devastating opponents, Ronald Reagan, to see how the problem can be overcome.",

While it may be easy to dismiss a significant number of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as members of a worshipful cult of celebrity, underneath that storyline is a stark policy reality \u2013 one that\u2019s inadequately understood and reported on. In Trump, politically conservative America has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally alter the direction of the nation. It is an opportunity to abandon the US\u2019 commitment to engaging politically and militarily around the world after World War II and alter the relationship between Americans and their government \u2013 one built in the New Deal and solidified since. Meanwhile, the press is too unprepared, under-resourced and distracted by the noise surrounding the White House to grasp the momentousness of this shift. This opportunity also involves reshaping the judiciary, and abortion rights in particular. This issue is discussed widely among Democratic candidates and somewhat more quietly by mainstream Republicans. When Trump delivered a speech at last month\u2019s March for Life, becoming the first US president to do so since the annual event began more than four decades ago, many supporters agreed with his own claims of being the \u201cmost pro-life president in American history.\u201d If Trump wins a second term, he will likely have the opportunity to add at least one justice to the Supreme Court. Trump will also continue to appoint conservative judges in the federal court system \u2013 all but guaranteeing the most concerted legal and legislative attack on abortion rights since Roe V. Wade. In a piece written a month before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I suggested that the media was unprepared for both the policies the Trump administration was about to unleash, and the communications strategy that would be implemented. There was an inadequate sense at the time about the level of drama and change that would characterize these years. The Trump administration has ushered in daily fact-checking challenges for journalists and policy initiatives with grave consequences that have not been sufficiently explored or analyzed. Russia learned this lesson from the 2008 election. Have our presidential candidates? While national media has received generally deserved plaudits for covering the scandals surrounding Trump\u2019s presidency, it has largely fallen down on covering the administration\u2019s impact on social policy, federal regulations and foreign affairs. To be fair, some of the changes under President Trump have been previously unimaginable. In the run-up to the 2016 election, how seriously did the media assess the possibility of truly disruptive change in US foreign policy and the strain Trump would place on our country\u2019s relationship with our allies? Was the rapidly shrinking role of the State Department contemplated before Inauguration Day? And how much reporting has really been devoted to understanding the implications of that kneecapped department? How much attention in late 2016 and early 2017 was given to the possibility of a $1 trillion deficit by the end of Trump\u2019s first term and the implications of such a quick reversal after decades of Republican orthodoxy about balanced budgets? Then there\u2019s Trump\u2019s embrace of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and other strongmen, and the revolving door of the Trump cabinet (recall former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, among others, left the administration under clouds of scandal). Their policy legacies and the condition in which they\u2019ve left their respective agencies or departments are, frankly, a bit of a great unknown. What did those three actually get done? And what did former Energy Secretary Rick Perry actually do, other than get caught up in the Ukraine debacle? There\u2019s little evidence that our news diets and the priorities of major news organizations reflect these critical but often uncovered events. Smaller publications and local newspapers face dwindling resources. Many of the Washington and national bureaus of once large metropolitan newspapers, news magazines and TV group bureaus are hollowed out or gone entirely. Are Dems so worried by Trump they're willing to let Bloomberg buy the election? Beyond the news industry\u2019s resource limitations, there\u2019s also what was famously called in the government report after the September 11 attacks the \u201cfailure in imagination\u201d and the inability of policymakers to see what might lie ahead. More than ever, the media has a responsibility to address the stories and coverage requirements ahead with renewed imagination. Today Trump\u2019s approval ratings are rising and despite impeachment, the prospects for a second Trump term are improving. What will a second term bring once President Trump no longer has to face the prospect of winning another election? Certainly, there\u2019s the possibility of a further US withdrawal from global agreements. A US withdrawal from NATO has received some attention, but what about a US pullback from the United Nations? What would come of the UN, based in New York City, if the US threatens to limit funding or withdraw entirely? What would a more dramatic restructuring of the federal environmental apparatus mean? Is there any doubt that some influential members of the Trump universe would like to see the Environmental Protection Agency shut down or folded into another federal entity with bare-bones staffing? Then there\u2019s regulation around public lands that have already being systematically dismantled in places like Utah. Just this week the administration gave the go-ahead to development in previously protected sites there. Pick just one piece of the national regulatory infrastructure and imagine it a target of significant disruption: What would the possible effects be in 10 years?  Do you think the GOP\u2019s loyalty to Trump is simply about celebrity adoration? It\u2019s not \u2013 here is a President who is willing to break the norm to fulfill the conservative agenda. Contemplating the possibilities of a GOP control over the legislative and judicial branches, along with a second term under President Trump \u2013 and the indifference to oversight, congressional investigations and transparency, requires a media with properly deployed resources and the continued growth of new entrepreneurial news organizations that can cover both local news and underreported issues. It is no time for a \u201cfailure in imagination.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Amanda Litman, a former staffer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, and Ross Morales Rocketto, a longtime progressive political operative, are co-founders of Run for Something, an organization that recruits and supports young progressives running for local offices. The views expressed here are theirs. Read more opinion on CNN. As of earlier this month, Democratic presidential candidates have raised upward of $500 million (not including the self-funding billionaires) and are likely to spend significantly more to try and beat President Donald Trump. But even if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2020, the party remains at risk of losing any chance at building lasting power. Why? Because many Democratic donors are failing to meaningfully invest in state and local elections. To them, defeating Trump is the only point of 2020. That myopic focus on winning the White House is a critical failure of the Democratic party\u2019s strategy. We\u2019ve heard this refrain first-hand as co-founders of Run for Something, an organization created to fill a gaping hole in the Democratic ecosystem \u2013 the lack of support for young people considering running for office. \u201cI love what you do,\u201d one supporter told us, echoing what we\u2019ve heard from countless more, \u201cbut we have to beat Trump. Everything else is on hold.\u201d This approach to resource allocation is part of why too many people don\u2019t have health care, why abortion rights are on the line, why black and brown voters are kept from the polls in multiple states, and why so many people have a negative perception of the Democratic Party \u2013 even while its positions and policies are more popular and would make many Americans\u2019 lives better. For decades, Republicans (and especially Republican donors like the Koch brothers) have better understood how political power in a federalist system works. They invested hundreds of millions of dollars in winning state legislative races, and while their local and municipal work is harder to track, they\u2019ve also focused on elections as local as those for school board. In 2018, according to Jane Mayer, author of \u201cDark Money,\u201d the Koch Brothers spent money in 74 different elections in Texas alone, all the way down to county commissioner. The history lesson 2020 Democrats can't afford to ignore In 2020, Democrats can make up for lost time. Turnout this November is expected to skyrocket, giving Democrats a chance to multi-task: By spending more time and money on local elections, our party can win sustainable power while also winning the White House, the Senate and ensuring their hold on the House. There is significant value in recalibrating focus to state and local elections. While Democratic presidential nominees are debating endlessly about what they\u2019re going to do on health care, abortion, climate change, and more (assuming they have reasonable governing partners in Congress, of course), city and state governments are simply taking action. Democratic state legislatures are expanding Medicaid now and literally saving lives. Just ask the nearly 400,000 Virginians who now have access to health insurance thanks to Democratic victories there in 2017. Democratic state legislators in New York and Nevada are passing laws that protect a woman\u2019s right to choose, while Republican state legislators in Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri and Georgia are actively trying to take that right away. Climate change, too, may seem like a federal issue, but across the country, Democratic city councils are switching over to solar and wind energy. Democratic state legislatures like New York and California are competing to see who can pass the most ambitious carbon reduction bills. 2020 election is a test America can't afford to fail Passing progressive policies on the state and local level can help people almost immediately. Just as importantly, passing such policies at the local level proves and normalizes them \u2013 making them easier to eventually pass on a federal level. Beyond the policy impact, by focusing locally, Democrats can fix the party\u2019s talent pipeline problem and begin to rescue its brand. Making our government more reflective of the people starts by building a more diverse pipeline of talent \u2013 including women, people of color, LGBTQ and working-class folks \u2013 who can take their experiences working on city councils and school boards today and apply it when running for national office. The future of the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership should look like the officials Run for Something has helped to elect: 55% women, 47% people of color and 18% LGBTQ. None of this is to say that winning in the federal government is unimportant. And on that front, local candidates can play a meaningful (and cost-effective) role in helping a Democrat win the presidency. Our research has identified that fielding a candidate in a state legislative race in a district that previously went uncontested \u2013 as more than 35% of state legislative races often do \u2013 can increase Democratic turnout by up to one percentage point in that district. Why Democrats face an uphill battle against Trump For example, according to Run for Something research, running a full slate of Democrats for Pennsylvania state legislature in 2016 would have generated at least an additional 23,000 Democratic votes \u2013 cutting Trump\u2019s 44,000 vote margin in half and bringing the state into automatic recount territory, without the Clinton campaign making a single decision differently. These races can have the same impact on Senate campaigns, and arguably are even more critical to victory. Democrats can\u2019t count on the presidential campaign to be the major organizing force in the states needed to flip the chamber. Senate candidates in states like Maine, Montana, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Alabama and North Carolina are going to need every last vote to win hard races. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for school board, city council and state legislative candidates in those states to run competitive races and gin up Democratic turnout wherever possible. Even if the local candidate loses, those Democratic votes still count. While Democrats will likely hold the House in 2020, if the GOP in state legislatures can redraw the districts in their favor after the census, Republicans could well retake it in 2022 and hold it for the next decade. In other words, Democrats need to win state legislatures now, so they have a seat at the table in the redistricting process after the 2020 census.  That work starts way before Election Day. For example, Democrats only need to flip nine seats in the Texas state house to control it \u2013 that\u2019s why Run for Something invested more than $120,000 in recruiting candidates in Texas, where more than a quarter of the non-incumbent Democrats running for state house came through our pipeline over the last three years. At least three of those candidates are running in districts Democrats didn\u2019t contest last cycle; all are chances to pick up more votes for the Democratic candidate for Senate, the presidential nominee, and to win a seat in the Texas house. And if and when Democrats do flip the Texas state house, they can pass legislation to expand access to the polls, making it easier for more people to vote. By investing locally over a sustained period of time, Democrats can flip a red state blue \u2013 and make it last. 2020 is a chance for Democrats to do what Republicans have done for decades and do it better: It\u2019s time to build a party from the ground up, with good candidates running strong campaigns in every corner of every state. Democrats, don\u2019t waste this opportunity by only chasing the shiny object at the top of the ticket.",

It looks like most of Obamacare might remain intact after all. The Supreme Court appeared poised to reject the latest Republican-backed attempt to kill the landmark health reform law, based on the justices\u2019 tone during oral arguments. Chief Justice John Roberts, who famously saved the ACA in 2012, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that it wasn\u2019t the Supreme Court\u2019s place to invalidate the entire law. It\u2019s the third time the court has heard a significant challenge to the law, and it seems like Roberts is so over it. If Trump and Republicans wanted to kill the law, they could have done it, he said. About 20 million people have gained coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges and through the expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo yesterday would not acknowledge Joe Biden\u2019s victory, even as America\u2019s closest allies congratulated the President-elect. The Trump administration is also carrying out sweeping changes at the Defense Department. Four senior civilian officials have been fired or have resigned since Monday, and they\u2019ve been replaced with people seen as loyal to Trump. The actions have raised alarms inside the Pentagon, with one defense official calling them \u201cdictator moves.\u201d Despite those efforts, Biden is moving ahead, announcing his transition teams. Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations in the US are higher than ever before, and state leaders are urging residents to stay home. The nation is seeing a dangerous surge: Texas reached the grim distinction of becoming the first state to hit a million cases, with California nearly there, too. Yesterday marked eight straight days that the country reported more than 100,000 new cases per day, and the total number of nationwide cases is more than 10 million. News that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has been shown to be more than 90% effective has provided some hope, but now states are worried the distribution process won\u2019t go smoothly. Countries around the world are hitting new records, too. More than 50 million cases of Covid-19 have been recorded worldwide. The late Pope John Paul II was warned about allegations of sexual impropriety by Theodore McCarrick but promoted him to archbishop of Washington anyway amid his own denials and an \u201cinaccurate\u201d American bishops\u2019 inquiry, an internal Vatican investigation concluded. The report follows two years of investigation and years of scrutiny over how McCarrick was allowed to rise through the hierarchy. McCarrick last year became the highest ranking church figure to be defrocked over sexual abuse after a church trial found him guilty of sexually abusing minors. His attorney declined to comment. The report largely seems to absolve the current pope, Francis, of blame. All 15 of Hong Kong\u2019s remaining pro-democracy lawmakers resigned in protest today after Beijing authorized the expulsion of four of their colleagues. The bold move comes after China\u2019s highest legislative body passed a resolution giving local authorities broad new powers to quash dissent. That ruling would allow Hong Kong\u2019s executive to expel elected lawmakers without having to go through the courts, cementing Beijing\u2019s control over the semi-autonomous city and likely signaling the end of political opposition there.

The police chief there said the teen \u201cwas involved in the use of firearms to resolve whatever conflict was in place.\u201d Nationwide, the unrest stemming from the police shooting of a Black father, Jacob Blake, over the weekend has crystallized into serious action. Several Milwaukee pro sports teams chose to sit out their games last night, which led to a cascade of paused events nationwide. All in all, a slate of NBA games, several MLB games, plus MLS games and the Western & Southern Open tennis event were canceled or postponed as teams and major athletes, like Lebron James, spoke out against the recent spate of police violence. A monster Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight in southwestern Louisiana, the region\u2019s strongest storm in over a century. It\u2019s a rapidly changing situation, but Laura has weakened to Category 3, passing over Lake Charles as it treks inland. It\u2019s expected to weaken more as the day goes on, but the danger is far from over.

            "article_content": "The chief executive officer of Dominion Voting Systems on Thursday did not rule out taking legal action against President Donald Trump as the election technology company has been the target of conspiracy theories about voter fraud after Trump\u2019s election loss to President-elect Joe Biden. CEO John Poulos confirmed on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that the company would be taking legal action against several individuals \u201cpromoting lies and amplifying those lies\u2026on various media platforms since Election Day.\u201d Asked if Dominion anticipates taking legal action against Trump himself, Poulos said the company will \u201cbe looking into absolutely everybody that has made, and repeated, and amplified false statements that have been defamatory and damaging to our company and to our election.\u201d Pressed again on whether that would include the President, Poulos replied, \u201cWe will not be overlooking anybody.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the President, his attorneys and his supporters have baselessly alleged that Dominion\u2019s voting machines were manipulated to change votes from Trump to Biden or delete votes for Trump. A defamation law firm representing Dominion sent letters Tuesday to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani instructing them to preserve all records related to the company, warning Giuliani that legal action is \u201cimminent.\u201d Similar letters were also sent this week to conservative media personalities, CNN reported Thursday. Last week, CNN reported that Trump\u2019s campaign legal team released a memo to dozens of staffers telling them to save all documents related to Dominion and pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell in anticipation of potential litigation by the company against her. During a freewheeling and fact-free Trump campaign press conference last month, Powell claimed that Dominion\u2019s voting machines featured software created \u201cat the direction\u201d of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez \u2014 who died in 2013 \u2014 to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and Democratic donor George Soros. Poulos said Thursday those are\u201dcomplete lies\u201d and that the company looks \u201cforward to showing and proving that in court.\u201d On Tuesday, a top Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, separately sued the President\u2019s campaign, Giuliani, Powell, and a handful of conservative media outlets and personalities for defamation. Coomer, Dominion\u2019s director of product strategy and security, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Wednesday that the accusations that he subverted the election have led to a \u201ccomplete upheaval of my life.\u201d \u201cI am in hiding because I have received many death threats and it\u2019s on a continuing basis. My entire family, their private information has been published online in what\u2019s referred to as doxing. All my private information has been released online. People have taken photos of my house, people have threaten to come by and lynch me, decapitate me, they\u2019ve referred to me as a traitor. It is not safe for me to, you know, go about my daily life,\u201d said Coomer, who added that he\u2019s been on leave from his job due to the security concerns. Coomer said he wants to \u201cset the record straight and try to reclaim my reputation\u201d and that \u201cpeople need to be held accountable.\u201d Dominion itself is not a party to Coomer\u2019s lawsuit, but Poulos told CNN Thursday that hearing of Coomer\u2019s situation makes him \u201cangry\u201d and said the accusations against Dominion have affected all of its employees. \u201cAll of our employees have been forced to remove as much public information of themselves as they can, for fear of their own safety since Election Day. It\u2019s truly without precedent. And it\u2019s something that causes us a great deal of anger,\u201d he said. Poulos said that the \u201cdamage has really been immeasurable\u201d from the allegations and has been \u201ccausing serious doubts\u201d among Americans about the US election systems. Georgia is one of the states that uses Dominion machines for voting, including in the upcoming US Senate runoff races that will determine control of the US Senate and with it, the future of Biden\u2019s agenda. Poulos told CNN that Dominion\u2019s technology has been running successful elections for years and years and that Georgia voters \u201cshould trust the system,\u201d pointing to the machines\u2019 paper ballots that can then be used in a risk limiting audit. There is no evidence that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, and his administration and election officials have called it the \u201cmost secure\u201d election in US history. Biden won the popular vote by more than 7 million votes and the electoral map 306 to 232. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

            "article_content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to fill Vice President-elect Kamala Harris\u2019 Senate seat on Tuesday, choosing the first Latino in state history for the role. Newsom, who had been under intense pressure within California to choose a Black woman to replace Harris because of the lack of diversity in the US Senate \u2013 tweeted that Padilla\u2019s appointment would make history but added that Padilla \u201cis far more interested in changing history \u2013 especially for the working men and women of our state and country.\u201d \u201cI can think of no one better to represent the state of California as our next United States Senator,\u201d Newsom tweeted Tuesday. The California governor extended the offer to Padilla in a video conversation that he released in his tweet. Padilla will serve through the duration of Harris\u2019 term, and will have to prepare for a highly competitive statewide race to fill the seat in 2022. Padilla, the son of a cook and house cleaner who immigrated from Mexico, choked up when speaking to Newsom about his parents on the video as he accepted the position. \u201cI\u2019m honored, man, and I\u2019m humbled, because of them,\u201d Padilla says. In his announcement, Newsom noted that Padilla, 47, had worked his way from \u201chumble beginnings to the halls of MIT,\u201d where he got his bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. He entered politics as an aide to Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, was elected to the Los Angeles City Council at the age of 26 and later became the council\u2019s youngest president in its history. He moved on to the state Senate in 2006, representing the San Fernando Valley. \u201cThrough his tenacity, integrity, smarts and grit, California is gaining a tested fighter in their corner who will be a fierce ally in D.C., lifting up our state\u2019s values and making sure we secure the critical resources to emerge stronger from this pandemic,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cHe will be a Senator for all Californians.\u201d His appointment will make history. But the @AlexPadilla4CA I know is far more interested in changing history -- especially for the working men and women of our state and country.I can think of no one better to represent the state of California as our next United States Senator. pic.twitter.com/xiAzpTS42Y Newsom chose his longtime political ally after what was described as difficult decision-making process as the governor weighed the competing pressures of the desire to see the first Latino from California in the US Senate and the paucity of Black representation in that chamber. There will be no Black women in the Senate after Harris\u2019 exit in January to join President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Top contenders for Harris\u2019 seat included Rep. Karen Bass, who represents much of South Los Angeles, and Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland, but neither had as close a relationship to Newsom as Padilla. When Newsom ran his first campaign for governor in 2009, Padilla served as his campaign chairman until Newsom dropped out when former Gov. Jerry Brown entered the race. (Newsom ultimately served as lieutenant governor to Brown). Padilla, a warm and personable figure who has many allies in California Democratic political circles, had other prominent backers, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 BOLD PAC and Feinstein. The California Legislative Black Caucus and other groups had pushed for Bass and Lee to replace Harris. The Women\u2019s Foundation of California joined the campaign urging Newsom to appoint a Black woman, enlisting Latina labor icon Dolores Huerta, among others, to sign a letter to the governor. \u201cWomen\u2019s voices are desperately needed, but Black women\u2019s voices are especially needed at this time in history,\u201d Huerta said in a video she recorded for the push. She said Newsom should take that step \u201cto correct the terrible history of discrimination that Black women have suffered through the ages. And you will actually cement your own legacy as part of the civil rights movement by doing this.\u201d Lee tweeted Tuesday that Padilla \u201chas a track record as a skilled legislator and a steadfast advocate for justice\u201d and said he would be \u201ca powerful voice in the Senate for those who continue to be denied our country\u2019s promise of equality.\u201d Bass also congratulated Padilla on Twitter, noting they had served together in the state Legislature, where \u201che passed landmark legislation to make California the first state in the nation to require chain restaurants to post calorie information directly on menus,\u201d and praising him for modernizing California\u2019s electoral and vote-by-mail processes as secretary of state. \u201cToday, our state gains yet another champion following a distinguished line of individuals who have shattered glass ceilings and hurdled obstacles in their way,\u201d Bass said of the Padilla pick. \u201cAfter then-Senator Harris\u2019s historic election in 2016 as the first woman of color to represent California, we now have another historic barrier shattered as Alex will be the first Latino to serve California in the United States Senate.\u201d The pick comes at a tough time for Newsom, who is struggling to curb the coronavirus pandemic as it ravages California, lowering intensive care unit capacity to zero in some parts of the state. With soaring unemployment amid the state\u2019s economic downturn as a result of the virus, his decision to revert to shutdowns for parts of the state with limited numbers of remaining hospital beds infuriated some restaurant and business owners. The anger has breathed new life into a recall campaign that was launched by activists last spring and is now serving as a vehicle for California Republicans who would like to see him removed from office. Newsom also recently caught heat for attending a dinner at the French Laundry restaurant at a time when he and other state officials were urging Californians to limit gatherings with people from outside their households, particularly at restaurants. The governor apologized to the state\u2019s voters, telling them he needed to \u201cpreach and practice, not just preach and not practice.\u201d Gavin Newsom is about to determine the future of California Democratic politics for a generation Newsom must also now appoint a replacement for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was chosen by Biden to serve as secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as a replacement for Padilla. Padilla, who has served as secretary of state since 2015, was in charge of the unprecedented task of sending mail-in ballots to more than 22 million registered voters, leading to record turnout this year. Others who were in contention for the Senate appointment included California\u2019s Rep. Katie Porter, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. In a recent interview, Padilla told CNN that the state\u2019s first Latino senator would be \u201ca historic milestone,\u201d and said that California\u2019s \u201crich diversity\u201d is surely \u201cone of the many considerations the governor is pondering as he makes this decision.\u201d   \u201cA lot of people are excited about a potential first,\u201d he said. Padilla told CNN that he was well prepared to serve in the Senate after dealing with the L.A. budget after 9/11, chairing a state Senate committee on energy and telecommunications, and securing the integrity of the ballot box in the middle of a pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no on-the-job training here,\u201d Padilla said.

            "article_content": "Joe Biden will be president in 30 days. Until then, the question is how much damage can be done by a vengeful, delusional soon-to-be ex-President swilling conspiracy theories, whose wild anti-democratic instincts are being encouraged by fringe political opportunists. Donald Trump will retain the awesome powers of the presidency until noon on January 20, and there\u2019s never been a time when he has been subject to as few restraining influences or has had a bigger incentive to cause disruption.   The President is spending day after day in his White House bunker, entertaining crackpot theories about imposing martial law, seizing voting machines and staging an intervention in Congress on January 6 to steal the election from Biden. Surrounded by the last dead-end loyalists, Trump is flinging lies and political venom like King Lear in a crumbling Twitter kingdom, alarming some staffers about what he will do next. On Monday, he huddled with a cabal of Republican lawmakers who plan to challenge the election on baseless claims of fraud at a special session of Congress to ratify the results on January 6. Some White House advisers fear Trump's final days Trump can further damage the United States in the coming days in two ways \u2013 by aggressive design and by his passive neglect of his sworn obligations to lead. His attempts to crush American democratic traditions by claiming a landslide victory in an election that he lost and that was not especially close fits into the first category. The President\u2019s behavior has sown huge mistrust of the fundamental underpinning of the US political system \u2013 fair elections \u2013 among millions of his voters and threatens to compromise the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s White House. CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr reported Tuesday that there is concern among executive office staff and the military\u2019s leadership that Trump could use his power as President and commander in chief in dangerous ways in the last days of his term. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he might do,\u201d one officer in the Pentagon said. Another added: \u201cWe are in strange times.\u201d Pentagon anxiety rises as officers wait for Trump's next unpredictable move Trump\u2019s indifference to multiple crises stirred by his rule make up the second category of his political vandalism. This includes his apathy about a raging pandemic that has infected 18 million Americans and killed nearly 320,000 as an aching nation marks its darkest holiday season in generations. There is no substitute in the US governing system for the engagement of a President during a massive national enterprise. But there is also no sign that Trump cares to offer leadership to ensure the success of the mammoth vaccination program that holds hope of eventually ending the pandemic. This after his denial of the virulence of Covid-19 undoubtably worsened the death toll. Trump is also running interference for Russia, prioritizing the interests of an adversary over America\u2019s after a massive cyberattack blamed on the Kremlin. These infractions add up to the dereliction of presidential duty on a grand scale. It is impossible to imagine any other president of the modern era behaving in such a way or for either of the political parties to tolerate his abuse of power. Former President George W. Bush\u2019s neglect during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 seems tame by comparison. The current President\u2019s anti-democratic behavior since the election is validating the fears of critics \u2013 and more than 80 million Biden voters \u2013 who worried about his unchained behavior in a second term. Like many fading strongmen leaders, his antics are becoming more unhinged as the prospect of losing power becomes tangible. Even Trump\u2019s White House staff is concerned about what happens next, at a time when Washington is already braced for a flurry of politically self-serving or legally dubious presidential pardons in the coming weeks. \u201cNo one is sure where this is heading,\u201d one official told CNN\u2019s White House team on Monday in a disturbing behind-the-scenes glimpse at the mayhem unfolding in the West Wing. \u201cHe\u2019s still President for another month.\u201d The madcap schemes of some of Trump\u2019s acolytes \u2013 such as retired Gen. Michael Flynn\u2019s mooted plan to send troops to battleground states to redo elections that the President lost \u2013 have no chance of playing out. Even if Trump\u2019s renegades had the competence to mount such a threat, the courts have shown zero tolerance for the President\u2019s autocratic attempts to destroy US democracy. It is unthinkable the military would deploy to reverse a popular vote on US soil. Trump\u2019s extremism is also unfolding in the context of a landmark election after which the safety valves of the courts, the electoral safeguards in the states \u2013 and eventually on parts of Capitol Hill \u2013 stood firm in defense of democracy. But the fact that a defeated President is even hearing theories about imposing martial law in the Oval Office is unfathomable in the world\u2019s oldest, most influential democracy. Were it not for the outrageous assaults on the rule of law over the last four years and the evidence of a presidency tethered to the erratic personality of Trump, it would not be at all believable. \u201cThe rest of the world is watching all this. It is just making people wonder. What is going on in America?\u201d an incredulous John Kasich, the Republican former governor of Ohio, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Monday. Trump\u2019s loss of composure is grave enough from a domestic point of view. But it sends a signal to US adversaries of a vacuum of leadership. His bizarre refusal to endorse his government\u2019s assessment that Russia is behind the cyberattack suggests there is a 30-day window of impunity for enemies dedicated to tarnishing US national interests. The thought of an agitated, emotional President faced with any sudden foreign policy crisis is not a reassuring one. Four key ways Barr broke with Trump at the attorney general's news conference The extreme nature of Trump\u2019s final days meltdown is best encapsulated by the fact that Attorney General William Barr, who had accommodated many of the President\u2019s political assaults on the spirit of the law, has comprehensively broken with Trump as he prepares to leave office before Christmas. Barr said Monday that he saw no need to appoint a special counsel to probe baseless claims of electoral fraud. He drew a similar conclusion about Trump\u2019s demands for an investigation into Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who is already the subject of a criminal probe into his business dealings. In his farewell news conference on Monday, Barr said he saw no reason for the federal government to seize voting machines, a step advocated by Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani. And he said the massive cyber breach of the US government \u201ccertainly appears to be the Russians.\u201d Although Trump\u2019s most fervent loyalists have turned against him for his political apostasy toward the President, Barr remains a credible figure among many Senate Republicans and his comments will have strengthened Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s effort to stop any of his caucus seeking to mount a futile challenge to the election during a joint session of Congress to ratify the election result on January 6. But Barr will be gone in a few days, potentially allowing the President to lean on Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who faces a tense few weeks leading the Justice Department before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Should he refuse to bend to the President\u2019s will, it is not impossible that Trump could fire him and seek a willing accomplice for his assaults on the rule of law \u2013 emulating President Richard Nixon in the so-called \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in 1973. In an ominous sign for the days ahead, Trump told young conservative voters in Georgia over the phone Monday that \u201cwe won this in a landslide\u201d and said he needed \u201cbacking from \u2026 the Justice Department, and other people finally have to step up.\u201d House conservatives strategize with Trump and Pence in push to challenge Biden's win Trump\u2019s meeting with Republican lawmakers on Monday was the latest troubling sign that he is prepared to tear down the integrity of the US electoral system on the way out of the Oval Office door. The group is preparing to \u201cfight back against mounting evidence of voter fraud. Stay tuned,\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tweeted, giving fresh life to falsehoods comprehensively debunked by the Supreme Court, multiple judges and Republican state election officials ever since the election. The effort will not succeed in invalidating Biden\u2019s election since Democrats control the House of Representatives and there is no sign that a majority of Republicans in the Senate \u2013 most of whom are now acknowledging that Biden is President-elect \u2013 will play along. But the pro-Trump lawmakers can stage a stunt that would make a mockery of democracy and further sow distrust of America\u2019s political system among the President\u2019s fervent supporters \u2013 a scenario that could cause years of damage.   Fringe figures around Trump besides Giuliani and Flynn include Sidney Powell, the lawyer who only just a few weeks ago was ousted from his legal team over her bizarre claims of a massive international plot involving the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, China, Democrats and the Clintons to steal the election. Trump has floated an idea of embedding Powell as a special counsel inside the White House Counsel\u2019s Office to investigate claims of voter fraud. The current counsel\u2019s office has pushed hard against the idea, sources told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of concern with anything involving Sidney Powell,\u201d one source close to the President told CNN\u2019s White House team. Another of Trump\u2019s conspiratorial fellow travelers, populist guru Steve Bannon, and the hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro also have the President\u2019s ear, the sources told CNN. \u201cI think we are seeing just how desperate Trump is becoming himself. And how desperate the last remaining rats on the ship, if you will, are becoming because of that,\u201d Lawrence Wilkerson, a former top aide to ex-Secretary of State Colin Powell, said Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cOutFront.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Valerie Ponomarev sealed the envelope of her ballot and walked to the silver drop box in Alpharetta, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this day for so long,\u201d she exclaimed. Her absentee ballot disappeared down the narrow metal opening. The excitement she felt in the simple delivery of the early ballot is the opposite of how she felt on November 3. Ponomarev\u2019s birthday is December 2, so she was still 17 on Election Day, too young to vote. Then she learned both of her state\u2019s Senate seats were heading to runoffs on January 5, as no candidate won more than 50% of the vote. \u201cI was just so excited, because I didn\u2019t have to wait another two or four years to vote,\u201d Ponomarev said. \u201cIt was happening right now, and it was happening in my home state. I feel like I\u2019m finally having a say in government.\u201d Ponomarev is one of thousands of new voters coming of age between November 3 and January 5. \u201cIt\u2019s a sweet spot of individuals,\u201d says Ariel Singleton, the lead Black youth vote organizer at the grassroots group Georgia STAND-UP. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting young voters because that opens up a whole new arena, a whole new field of people who are eligible to vote who weren\u2019t eligible to vote before.\u201d Singleton believes they are motivated voters, especially those young voters of color, who were central to Georgia\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cIn this past year, to see so many things unfolding and having an opinion without being necessarily able to vote,\u201d says Singleton, about the frustration of those still-17-year-old voters on November 3. In the runoffs, she believes they will channel that activism toward January 5. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re target rich.\u201d Ariyana Gooden, who will turn 18 on December 21, is one of those new voters, anxious to be heard. She caught the spark of community engagement from a youth leadership program through an Atlanta area nonprofit, Usher\u2019s New Look, and then in the summer saw Black youth fill the streets during Black Lives Matter protests. Gooden longed to vote for the first Black woman to run for Vice President, Kamala Harris, who is also a graduate from Gooden\u2019s college, Howard University. \u201cNow that I\u2019m able to,\u201d said Gooden about voting in the runoffs, \u201cit\u2019s just a whole another level of excitement at this point. I just want to be a part of this group of young people voting to make a change, make a difference.\u201d \u201cThat is an extremely sought-after group, because they\u2019re voters out of thin air,\u201d said Edward Aguilar of Students for Tomorrow, a grassroots group run by and aiming to reach new voters. Aguilar founded the group with Michael Giusto, both seniors at Alpharetta High School. Their goal is to persuade new voters to vote for Democratic Senate challenger Jon Ossoff, not because he\u2019s a Democrat, but because Ossoff, at 33, is closer to their age. They also say his policies, as well as those of fellow Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock, directly address students. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get thousands of Republicans to pledge to vote across the aisle and vote for Ossoff this election cycle because we\u2019re having them vote as students, rather than Republicans or Democrats,\u201d said Aguilar. Ossoff and Warnock both have student policies listed on their campaign websites, addressing college debt, technical college and climate change. In campaign events, both have directly talked about the youth vote and how control of the US Senate could help forward policies that young voters care about. Biden appears in campaign ad for Georgia's Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock The Democrats need to flip both Georgia seats to bring the Senate to a 50-50 tie. Vice President-elect Harris would be the tiebreaker. Young voters understand this, Ossoff told CNN in an interview. \u201cGeorgia has become younger and more diverse every year for the last decade,\u201d said Ossoff. \u201cYoung voters in Georgia are among the most committed and passionate of anybody. And this coalition that we\u2019re building \u2013 a lot of it is driven by youthful activism.\u201d Ossoff has also campaigned where young people congregate \u2013 on TikTok. He posted his first TikTok video on December 1 and quickly racked up 160,000 followers. His most viewed video, showing edited pictures of him with Warnock on the campaign trail, garnered 1.4 million likes on the platform. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite such a hit,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cBut it\u2019s gathered a huge following because there\u2019s so much interest among young people in the outcome here and really an understanding of the stakes and a sense of hope about what we can do after we win.\u201d According to CNN exit polls, 18- to 24-year-olds made up 12% of Georgia voters in the November presidential election. The majority of them preferred the Democrats \u2013 56% of them voted for Joe Biden while 43% voted for President Donald Trump. But compared with their national peers, Georgia\u2019s youth is more conservative. CNN exit polls show that nationally, 65% of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for Biden, while 31% voted for Trump. Georgia\u2019s sitting senators may be banking on those numbers. Incumbent Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler have been slow to court their youngest constituents and relatively mum about policies that directly affect them, such as student debt. Not a problem for 19-year-old Gavin Swafford, who says, \u201cCollege debt is incurred upon people by themselves. That is not a senator\u2019s issue.\u201d Swafford was at a crowded Atlanta art gallery, where a Republican \u201cSave America\u201d event was taking place among colorful portraits of George Washington and Ronald Reagan. Swafford was among the youngest guests. \u201cYou are seeing the newest generation of conservative Republicans come to the forefront of this race,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThere are people my age who are concerned about our country.\u201d Eighteen-year-old Madison Tatham said about voting for Perdue and Loeffler, \u201cA lot of my friends are Republicans, so it\u2019s nice seeing them get all excited about voting. I know they\u2019re very pro-life, which I support a lot, and they\u2019re for the Second Amendment, so those are two things I\u2019m very passionate about.\u201d Still, teens like Tatham and Swafford remain the minority in the deep blue counties of the Atlanta metro area that narrowly flipped the state for Biden last month. Giusto of Students for Tomorrow says the GOP is missing an opportunity to close the gap. Guisto wanted to vote for the Republicans, saying he believes more in the conservative platforms of the Republican Party. But when he looked at the policy pages of the sitting senators, he decided he would instead vote for the Democrats, because of their promises to address college debt and climate change. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people that are being almost entirely ignored,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Falcons are playing a football game and they\u2019re going to throw it in the last few yards when they really stood a chance of winning in the first place. They might have even been in the lead.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A more combative Ivanka Trump has emerged with little more than one month left in her role as adviser to President Donald Trump, as the first daughter makes a conscious effort to publicly push back on her critics. According to a source familiar with her thinking, Ivanka Trump recognizes there is a time stamp on the administration and she\u2019s spent the last several weeks highlighting on social media the causes she feels she has impacted during her tenure, as well as showing hints she is ready for a fight. Trump recently veered from her more milquetoast posts to pushing back against what she described as \u201cpartisan investigations,\u201d and adopting an aggressive posture more aligned with that of her father. On Tuesday, Ivanka Trump was deposed in the Washington, DC, attorney general\u2019s inauguration lawsuit, focused on investigating potential malfeasance during the 2016 Trump inaugural festivities. And though she did not publicly announce her testimony ahead of time, she had something to say afterward. \u201cThis week I spent 5+ hours in a deposition with the Democrat D.C. AG\u2019s office where they questioned the rates charged by the Trump Hotel at the inauguration. I shared with them an email from 4 years ago where I sent instructions to the hotel to charge \u201ca fair market rate\u201d (see below) which the hotel then did,\u201d she wrote in the statement. \u201cThis \u2018inquiry\u2019 is another politically motivated demonstration of vindictiveness & waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d she added. Plotting the future: Trump kids even look to profit from their father's fallen legacy The December 14, 2016, email, attached in Trump\u2019s tweet, said: \u201cJust seeing this. Why don\u2019t you call and negotiate. It should be a fair market rate.\u201d Trump\u2019s tone and charges of \u201cvindictiveness\u201d in process came on the heels of her defense the week prior of two investigations into the President\u2019s tax deductions, which she tweeted were \u201charassment.\u201d \u201cThis is harassment pure and simple. This \u2018inquiry\u2019 by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that there\u2019s nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians are simply ruthless,\u201d she tweeted, later calling it a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and \u201ca continued political vendetta.\u201d The tone and tenor of Trump\u2019s words and actions in the final months of her White House job indicate a transformation from four years ago, when upon moving to Washington she was viewed as a moderate voice, more socially conscious than most conservative Republicans. Yet as time moved on, Trump\u2019s shift to the right solidified. She has \u201cgone full MAGA,\u201d a source said, adopting a more conservative viewpoint in sync with the Trump brand, becoming more closely intertwined with her father. \u201cI am pro-life, and unapologetically so,\u201d Ivanka Trump said in an October interview with Real Clear Politics, taking a public stance out of step with the New York liberals she formerly socialized with.   Trump has publicly maintained a neatly tailored West Wing portfolio. And privately, she advised her father on a much wider range of issues. She also dabbled in diplomacy, meeting with world leaders on various topics and traveling abroad on the administration\u2019s behalf, including trips to India, South Korea, Germany and Japan. During the presidential campaign, as swing states narrowed and the push to lure suburban women voters became more dire for Trump, Ivanka Trump was the one strategically deployed, making several stops in the suburbs of North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona. What Trump also discovered during her appearances was that she was a lucrative draw for the party, pulling in $35 million in nine fundraising events. The ease of wooing donors, plus high demand for her presence and the warm embrace from her father\u2019s base fueled other notions for Trump \u2013 a louder presence, and a desire to continue her own political future. Trump does have an eye toward public office, according to two friends and a small group of White House associates. \u201cIvanka definitely has political ambitions, no question about it,\u201d a source who has been working closely with the Trump family told CNN. \u201cShe wants to run for something, but that still needs to be figured out.\u201d Talk of an Ivanka Trump run for Florida governor in the near future has come up, as has a possible run for Congress in New Jersey, both states where Trump has vacation homes. The Trump-Kushner family currently rents a home in DC\u2019s tony Kalorama neighborhood two miles from the White House. They have kept their sprawling Upper East Side apartment in New York City, a White House official has said, and there is wide belief amongst the couple\u2019s closest friends they anticipate a move back to Manhattan, even if it means an inhospitable homecoming for the pair. Requests for comment by CNN to Trump\u2019s spokesperson were not returned. But another source close to Trump told CNN that speculators assuming she is plotting a political position should pump the brakes. \u201cRight now, all she cares about is her policy initiatives, accomplishing what she can on behalf of the administration in the weeks that remain, and looking out for her three young children,\u201d said the source, adding that Trump has not \u201cclosed the door\u201d on any future opportunities, including a run for office. The feistiness of her recent public comments, lashing out at Democrats and officials investigating both she and her father, is calculated. She is \u201cspeaking out more,\u201d with less concern about \u201csitting back and letting people say what they want and distort facts,\u201d said the source close to Ivanka Trump. The more she swings back, the more she positions herself for a future run as a Republican, said the source who works with the family, and she\u2019s doing so with the blessing of her father. \u201cOf all the children, Trump is focused on her running. He sees Ivanka as the heir apparent,\u201d the source said. CNN reported last month that Trump had emerged as someone looking for a way for the President to save face as he considers his own future. She and her husband Jared Kushner would prefer the President speed up his legal processes around the country, as they have proved fruitless endeavors, and concede the race. A key force playing into the couple\u2019s calculations: an eye toward her future and her husband Jared Kushner\u2019s legacy. Trump is keenly aware of the legs Kushner\u2019s work on Middle East peace could have in the months and years outside of Washington, often tweeting her husband\u2019s accomplishments in the sector. She offered a more calibrated message to her father, asking him whether it was worth damaging his legacy and potentially his businesses to continue his denial about election results. Ivanka Trump is privately realistic about the President\u2019s loss, a source told CNN, but she also knows that her entire future \u2013 now more than ever \u2013 is tied to her father\u2019s and must be handled delicately. Ivanka Trump, says one longtime acquaintance, \u201chas ambition in her bones, she is driven by getting to the top of whatever it is she wants to get to the top of.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel contributed to this report.",

There are not Republicans and Democrats this month. There are people who buy President Donald Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and those who don\u2019t. Those who don\u2019t have less and less patience for their former allies. Trump\u2019s onetime ally Doug Ducey, the Republican governor of Arizona, faced the President\u2019s Twitter wrath for certifying his state\u2019s election results this week. A Georgia election official erupted in frustration at death threats he and other Republicans have faced for doing their jobs.   Trump will not be leaving quietly. He officially threatened to veto the massive annual National Defense Authorization unless lawmakers add in an unrelated provision to strip Section 230 from the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet providers and tech companies like Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for what is posted on their websites or how they manage the content. There\u2019s a valid debate to be had about Section 230, although Trump\u2019s obsessed with it because he says the tech companies discriminate against conservatives in their content moderation. But neither Republicans nor Democrats on Capitol Hill seem to think the defense bill is the right place to talk about regulating Facebook, Twitter and Google. Even Republican senators seem determined to send him the bill as-is. That means Trump will have to choose between his political preference and pay raises for troops. Read more. Related: The 7 most important relationships Biden will have on Capitol Hill CNN reported again Wednesday that Trump could try to preemptively pardon himself, his children or his lawyer. Read what I wrote about that here. The law is murky and the power of the pardon is expansive, although impeachment and pardon expert Frank Bowman at the University of Missouri School of Law has written in a forthcoming paper that neither are okay. I got completely sidetracked by Bowman\u2019s history of the pardon, which includes a story about King Charles II, who took over during the Restoration in the 1660s. He was king, but he didn\u2019t have enough money and Parliament wasn\u2019t giving him enough. So he offered France neutrality in their war with the Dutch in exchange for a salary. Talk about a quid pro quo. Also, he was supposed to convert to Catholicism. Anyway, the House of Commons impeached his confidant, the Earl of Danby. Charles II pardoned him. Years later Parliament excluded pardons from impeachments. And that\u2019s got a lot to do with the Founders doing it here too. Bowman is of the opinion that Biden\u2019s Justice Department won\u2019t spend much time investigating Trump since it wants to move on. But only Trump knows what he, his kids and his lawyer have done during his time in office. Sean Hannity was preemptively defending the principle of pre-pardons on his radio show Monday, arguing Trump needs to protect himself and his family from a witch hunt that, otherwise, will never end. The US on Wednesday hit a new record for daily reported Covid-19 deaths as cases continue to spike. Here are the numbers, according to data from Johns Hopkins University: Deaths reported as of 10 p.m. ET on December 2: 2,674. Deaths reported April 15: 2,603. The record daily death toll marks a sad new reality, even as vaccines are starting to come into play. Britain first. The UK has approved Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine. When shots start going in British arms next week, it\u2019ll be the first Western country inoculating people against coronavirus. The US is not far behind. US vaccine process. Trump\u2019s been frustrated there\u2019s no US-approved vaccine yet. The FDA commissioner met for the second day this week with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Wednesday. The President wants credit for as many people as possible being vaccinated before he leaves office, an official told CNN. An FDA official expressed annoyance that the White House didn\u2019t seem to understand that there was a process. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 our career scientists have to make the decision and they will take the time that\u2019s needed to make the right call on this important decision,\u201d Hahn said in the statement. Front of the line. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says health care workers and those in long-term care facilities should get priority in the US. HHS frontrunner driven by experience with sister\u2019s disease, debt. The top choice of President-elect Joe Biden to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is Michelle Lujan Grisham, a former state health director, congresswoman and current governor of New Mexico, people familiar with the matter have told CNN. From CNN\u2019s report: She was driven to focus on health care because her sister, Kimberly, was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was 2 years old and died of the disease nearly two decades later at 21. Lujan Grisham\u2019s husband, Gregory Grisham, also died of a brain aneurysm in 2004. Lujan Grisham has said her experiences with her sister and the subsequent debt her family was saddled with due to her illness and treatment has \u201cinspired\u201d her to dedicate her life to improve affordable health care. Frustration with restrictions \u2013 In this newsletter I\u2019ve written a lot about our collective US decision to prioritize restaurants and bars over schools and the difficulty of properly opening places of learning. But this Providence Journal story about a woman who wants to hold a small graveside service in Rhode Island for her mother who died from Covid is something else entirely. Her mother died in November, while her father survived Covid and is now in a hospital in Massachusetts. \u201cPeople can shop at Target, get their hair cut at a salon, eat indoors at restaurants but we cannot have a socially distanced burial outdoors for my mother? Her seven grandchildren cannot attend? Her older great-grandchildren cannot say goodbye? How can this be?\u201d Holly Susi wrote to Rhode Island\u2019s governor, according to the Journal. Susi\u2019s frustrations seem completely reasonable. More divisive is the accusation by a rural Virginia town that Gov. Ralph Northam, who has not enacted any of the most stringent lockdown procedures during the entire pandemic, is guilty of tyranny. Northam\u2019s transgression, according to The Washington Post, is mandating face masks in public places where distance is not possible, capping public gatherings at 25 people, and banning the sale of alcohol by restaurants after 10 p.m. Keep an eye on this backlash to restrictions, particularly after Trump leaves office and we\u2019ll have to compare it to the Tea Party backlash of 2010 after Democrats passed a bill that sought to extend health insurance to more Americans in part by charging them a tax for not having it. Anger at authority seems to be more actively piqued when the authority has to do with public welfare. Weird story of the day. These bird researchers went to a remote atoll with no cell or internet service in February. Then they came home to the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasingly inane legal claims and constitutional arson are prompting a growing number of high-profile Republicans and informal advisers that it\u2019s time for him to end his attempt to overturn his election loss. The President, ruining time-honored traditions of a peaceful transfer of power, is firing off long-shot court challenges and heaping pressure on state election officials. His aides are stoking a political storm apparently designed to destroy Joe Biden\u2019s presidency before it starts and to shield Trump from the historic humiliation that comes with losing an election after only a single term. Most congressional GOP leaders are still silent. But the spectacle has some senior Republicans ready to call time. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d GOP Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d Sunday. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a frequent Trump critic, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Trump\u2019s behavior was akin to that seen in a \u201cbanana republic.\u201d And even Trump\u2019s friend, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, speaking on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d branded Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his cohorts a \u201cnational embarrassment.\u201d One of the President\u2019s friends and outside advisers, Steve Schwarzman, an investor and philanthropist, said Monday he is now looking ahead to a Biden administration. \u201cThe outcome is very certain today and the country should move on,\u201d Schwarzman, the CEO of the Blackstone Group, said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cI supported President Trump and the strong economic path he built. Like many in the business community, I am ready to help President-elect Biden and his team as they confront the significant challenges of rebuilding our post-COVID economy.\u201d RELATED: CNN\u2019s live results from the presidential election A critical point, however, may be nearing in the confrontation between the administration and the President-elect\u2019s team over Trump\u2019s refusal to initiate a transition, with vote certifications due Monday in Michigan and in most counties in Pennsylvania. If local officials move ahead despite the interference of a White House flinging baseless claims of mass fraud, they will effectively confirm yet again Biden\u2019s capture of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Trump\u2019s position will therefore become less tenable even if he refuses to back away from false claims that he won on November 3. But Republican officials in Michigan especially are trying to delay certification by creating partisan deadlock on the state canvassing board, which could lead to an even more serious constitutional showdown in the key swing state. Trump\u2019s attempts to throw out millions of lawfully cast ballots in order to win a second term by malfeasance are unfolding as the official leading the Covid-19 vaccine effort warned on CNN Sunday that a proper transition would be preferable, given the vital task of swiftly inoculating tens of millions of Americans. \u201cOf course, smoothness is what we all aim for, and, therefore, it would be better,\u201d vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Slaoui also delivered encouraging news that the US could reach a sufficient level of immunity through vaccinations by May, offering hope of a return to normal life even as raging infections and rising death tolls herald the pandemic\u2019s darkest months and fears rise that Thanksgiving travel will make an awful explosion in cases even more dire.   But as Biden, who\u2019s having to raise his own money to prepare his government since Trump is holding back millions in federal funds, moves ahead with naming several key cabinet members this week, his team warned that the stalled transition could have serious consequences. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is access to real-time information about what\u2019s being worked on with vaccine distribution and with vaccine development and all the plans for that moving forward,\u201d Jen Psaki, senior adviser for the transition team, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. The President-elect is poised to nominate Antony Blinken to serve as secretary of state, people familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Dan Merica Sunday, elevating a longtime foreign policy adviser as Biden makes his first round of Cabinet announcements Tuesday. The President and his self-declared \u201celite strike force\u201d legal team are more interested in amplifying their baseless claims of electoral fraud than working in the interest of all Americans to ease Biden\u2019s assumption of power, however. The campaign\u2019s legal gambit was dealt a death blow on Saturday when a federal judge witheringly accused them of failing to provide evidence to support an audacious request to invalidate millions of votes in Pennsylvania. \u201cThis Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence,\u201d Judge Matthew Brann wrote in a judgment released on Saturday. Giuliani on Sunday lodged an ultra long-shot appeal to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in an approach increasingly disconnected from reality. His team is asking judges to effectively disenfranchise millions of Americans without offering admissible evidence of fraud. Trump's attempt to steal the election unravels as coronavirus cases surge Lawyer Sidney Powell is also pushing an absurd theory that the Republican pro-Trump governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, and other GOP officials are involved in a conspiracy with the CIA, China, Cuba, long-dead Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez and Democrats to fix voting machines to deprive Trump of victory. Sunday evening, Giuliani and another Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis sought to distance themselves from Powell, saying she was not a member of the team even though both appeared with her in an unhinged news conference in Washington last week and Trump previously said she was on the team. In her own statement later Sunday night, Powell said she agreed she was not part of the campaign\u2019s legal team, but added that \u201cwe\u201d are preparing to file an \u201cepic\u201d lawsuit this week. In the hall of mirrors in which Trump\u2019s legal team operates, a stinging rebuke from a judge is simply interpreted as validation for a legal strategy steeped in conspiracy theories, lies and paranoia. Giuliani greeted the humiliating put-down by Brann not as confirmation of a laughable case but as a decision that \u201cturns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d The outlandish nature of such claims is forcing some high-profile Republicans to say enough is enough for Trump\u2019s destructive, democracy-tainting behavior. Hours after Trump\u2019s legal defeat Saturday, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is shielded from being primaried by Trump supporters since he is not running for another term in 2022, said the decision by Brann, \u201ca longtime conservative Republican,\u201d meant the President\u2019s legal options had been exhausted and he congratulated \u201cPresident-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\u201d Christie, who helped the President prepare for this year\u2019s debates, said that for all the bizarre claims that Giuliani\u2019s team makes in court, they do not produce evidence of fraud when they come before a judge. \u201cI have been a supporter of the President\u2019s. I voted for him twice, but elections have consequences, and we cannot continue to act as if something happened here that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Christie, an ABC contributor, said. Upton, the Michigan congressman, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that \u201cthe voters have spoken. I mean, here in Michigan, it was a 154,000 vote margin by President-elect Biden, and no one has come up with any evidence of fraud or abuse. \u2026 It\u2019s not a razor thin margin.\u201d   He pointed to Saturday\u2019s statement from third-ranking House Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who said Trump should respect \u201cthe sanctity of our electoral process\u201d if he can\u2019t prove his claims in court. Hogan, a frequent Trump critic, said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s time for them to stop the nonsense. It just gets more bizarre every single day. And, frankly, I\u2019m embarrassed that more people in the party aren\u2019t speaking up.\u201d The Maryland governor\u2019s comments earned a tweeted rebuke from the President. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Trump ally, did not openly break with the President, but did say a transition ought to begin. And on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d former Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah said that while he hoped Trump, whom he has staunchly supported, would eventually prevail, the White House should \u201cloosen up that money\u201d Biden needs to run his transition in order to assure the continuity of government. Michigan, a battleground that went for Trump in 2016 but where Biden won by more than 150,000 votes this year, will be in the spotlight again on Monday with a key Republican on the state\u2019s canvassing board expected to vote against certifying the election. GOP Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan has said that one of the two Republican members on the board, Norman Shinkle, will vote against certification until an investigation is completed, CNN\u2019s Tapper and Annie Grayer reported. Despite producing affidavits alleging irregularities in the Wolverine State, the Trump campaign hasn\u2019t produced evidence that has stood up in court. The chances of the election being certified on Monday now depend on the vote of the other GOP member of the canvassing board, Aaron Van Langevelde. A failure to certify the election could leave the dispute in the hands of Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or the state\u2019s Supreme Court. Biden won, but the election is still not over. Here are the key dates to watch Trump and his aides have placed considerable pressure on local politicians in Michigan to thwart Biden\u2019s victory. The President summoned two members of the state legislature\u2019s Republican leadership to the White House on Friday. But they emerged to say that they have been made aware of no information that would change the outcome of the election. In Pennsylvania, where Biden\u2019s margin is more than 81,000 votes, most of the county Boards of Elections are expected to meet on Monday to certify their election results. Philadelphia is expected to meet Monday or Tuesday depending on a pending lawsuit filed in state court attempting to delay certification. Counties send results to Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who will award the state\u2019s 20 electoral votes to the winner. The cascading certification deadlines and continued reversals in court mean that Trump\u2019s already thin hopes of overturning the election results are becoming more miniscule by the day.

            "article_content": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s increasingly outlandish claims of election fraud have former federal officials worried that theories peddled by the man once dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d could be dangerous to democracy in the US. In the two weeks since Election Day, Giuliani has become a super-spreader of election disinformation. His eyebrow-raising claims \u2013 from Republican observers being barred from vote counts, to mysterious batches of ballots appearing in the middle of the night, to an election technology company using Venezuelan software to swing results \u2013 have been steadily debunked in courtrooms and by federal officials who have declared there is zero evidence of widespread irregularities. But experts say Giuliani\u2019s avalanche of falsehoods \u2013 along with the President\u2019s \u2013 could still have a long-lasting impact, sowing distrust in America\u2019s electoral system that will be difficult to unwind. That would play into the agenda of US adversaries, a half-dozen national security and elections officials told CNN. Trump puts Giuliani in charge of post-election legal fight after series of losses \u201cReal distrust in the system, casting doubt on the integrity of our electoral system, the constitutional process \u2013 the Russians and the Chinese couldn\u2019t ask for any more,\u201d former Trump national security adviser John Bolton told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria Sunday. \u201cThis is dangerous to the Republican Party, obviously. Of paramount importance, what Trump\u2019s doing, it\u2019s potentially dangerous for the country.\u201d Javed Ali, who served as senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Trump administration, said that Giuliani and Trump questioning the election\u2019s legitimacy makes it more difficult for the US to \u201cwag the finger at other countries where you see similar things happening.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to try to prevent foreign adversaries from engaging in disinformation and misinformation campaigns to influence the elections,\u201d Ali said. \u201cWhen you have the President and his advisers pushing those messages literally from inside the White House, that makes us more vulnerable.\u201d As a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, Giuliani has become a regular presence on right-wing TV, internet shows and on social media, arguing that shady forces stole the election. Fact checking Trump's barrage of lies over the weekend In an appearance on the podcast of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, Giuliani claimed that\u202f\u201cin each state there were ineligible ballots that overwhelm the margin of victory.\u201d But court case after court case has found no substantial batches of ineligible ballots. And Giuliani has repeatedly falsely claimed that officials spirited 100,000 mysterious ballots for Biden into the Michigan vote count late in the wee hours of election night. Federal government agencies have declared that \u201cthe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d \u201cThere is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\u201d a group of officials from various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security and other election groups wrote in a statement last week. Giuliani didn\u2019t answer CNN\u2019s questions about his election fraud claims and declined an interview request. In a statement, he said he had collected dozens of affidavits alleging irregularities in Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cMy team is vigorously fighting on behalf of the President to restore legitimacy and trust in the results of this election and future ones,\u201d he said in the statement. Many of Giuliani\u2019s latest conspiracy theories involve Dominion Voting Systems, a Denver-based election technology company that provides voting machines and other technology to election officials in more than two dozen states. Speaking on Fox News this weekend, Giuliani claimed that glitches in Dominion software swung votes and that the company \u201chas close, close ties with Venezuela and therefore China.\u201d That\u2019s totally false \u2013 there have been no confirmed cases of problems with the company\u2019s software affecting any vote count or results. And while Dominion acquired a separate company that was once owned by another company that had once worked in Venezuela, according to The Washington Post, Dominion has no \u201cclose ties\u201d with the country. Fact checking the baseless claim that millions of Trump votes were deleted \u201cAssertions of voter fraud conspiracies are 100% false,\u201d Dominion said in a statement. \u201cElection safeguards \u2013 from testing and certification of voting systems, to canvassing and auditing \u2013 prevent malicious actors from tampering with vote counts and ensure that final vote tallies are accurate.\u201d Dominion also added that it is a non-partisan company and all vote counts can be audited. Giuliani\u2019s role as a hawker of conspiracy theories is a far cry from his status as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. He launched his political career as a federal prosecutor in New York, where he prosecuted mob bosses and Wall Street fraudsters. After his celebrated role responding to 9/11 as New York mayor, Giuliani became one of the Republican Party\u2019s most high-profile figures. He ran for president in 2008, dropping out after trailing in the early GOP primary contests. Giuliani emerged as a vocal supporter of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential bid, and quickly adopted his latest persona as the president\u2019s conspiracist in chief. He traveled to Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son who had business dealings in the country \u2013 part of an effort that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Intelligence officials told the White House that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation in 2019, according to The Washington Post. Andrew Kirtzman, a New York communications consultant who is working on his second biography of Giuliani, said the former mayor searched for national relevance after failing to win the presidency \u2013 and found it in Trump. \u201cHe is standing by his man because Trump has been his vehicle to power,\u201d Kirtzman said. \u201cThe moment that Donald Trump leaves power is the moment that Rudy Giuliani loses power also, so it\u2019s in his best interest to reverse the election results.\u201d One of the clearest ways to see the falsehoods behind Giuliani\u2019s claims is to follow the Trump campaign\u2019s legal challenges, which Giuliani is \u201cspearheading,\u201d according to a tweet from Trump. On Friday alone, the campaign dropped a lawsuit in Arizona and lost six cases in two counties in Pennsylvania. In one Pennsylvania court case, in which Trump attorneys tried to have hundreds of ballots thrown out, a judge asked the attorney for Trump: \u201cAre you claiming that there is any fraud in connection with these 592 disputed ballots?\u201d \u201cTo my knowledge at present, no,\u201d the attorney admitted. The judge dismissed the lawsuit. \u201cThe cases are falling apart,\u201d said Ben Ginsberg, a high-profile Republican elections lawyer whose work includes the litigation surrounding the 2000 presidential recount in Florida. Giuliani is \u201ccontinuing to file cases with no basis in court,\u201d he said, arguing that the legal effort \u201cjust makes Donald Trump a loser more times.\u201d It is especially surprising to see such wild claims and poorly supported legal arguments coming from someone who was once New York\u2019s top federal prosecutor, Ginsberg noted. But Giuliani has had better luck in the court of public opinion \u2013 or at least among the audiences of Fox News and fringe right-wing news networks like One America News and Newsmax. In bombastic and often rambling appearances, he\u2019s fanned the flames of election conspiracy theories. His mistruths appear to have helped spur thousands of protesters to a pro-Trump rally in Washington, DC, over the weekend. If a significant number of Americans believe Giuliani and come to doubt the validity of the electoral system, that could lead to depressed voter turnout in future elections, broader distrust of the US government, or even outbursts of violence, experts say. And after Biden takes office, his administration could be hounded by false claims perpetuated by Giuliani and his allies, in an attempt to delegitimize Biden\u2019s presidency. \u201cThe nature of democracy is you have consent of the governed. People have to believe that they had a chance to make their voice heard,\u201d said Ben Hovland, a Democrat who was appointed by Trump to lead the US Election Assistance Commission, a federal group that advises on elections. \u201cThat\u2019s an important piece of the building blocks of any democracy.\u201d Brett Bruen, who served as White House director of global engagement during the Obama administration, said that Giuliani\u2019s messaging echoes claims from foreign countries seeking to undermine the US. Russian state broadcaster RT, for example, has written several articles highlighting Giuliani and Trump\u2019s efforts to discredit the election. \u201cGiuliani has become Moscow\u2019s mayor, peddling their propaganda,\u201d Bruen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgraceful final chapter for a man who was heralded for his heroism in the hours after the towers fell.\u201d Former federal prosecutor Kenneth McCallion, who specialized in Russian organized crime in New York\u2019s Eastern District when Giuliani led the neighboring Southern District, agreed that he is unwittingly helping America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is completely, 100% in the interests of Russia, which is to create as much damage and confusion to the US,\u201d McCallion said. \u201cIt is very dangerous and it\u2019s extremely alarming.\u201d Kirtzman, the Giuliani biographer, said that the former mayor has never done anything halfway \u2013 and his wholehearted embrace of election conspiracies is a sign of his dedication to Trump. \u201cThis is a critical moment in Giuliani\u2019s life,\u201d Kirtzman said. \u201cBoth he and Donald Trump are clinging to power by a thread, and he\u2019s throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks \u2013 and so far, nothing is doing the trick.\u201d CNN\u2019s Drew Griffin, Curt Devine and Nelli Black contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Last week, many celebrated Joe Biden for embracing transgender Americans in his victory address \u2013 the first president-elect to do so. \u201cAnd to all those who supported us: I am proud of the campaign we built and ran. I am proud of the coalition we put together, the broadest and most diverse in history,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDemocrats, Republicans and Independents. Progressives, moderates and conservatives. Young and old. Urban, suburban and rural. Gay, straight, transgender.\u201d In just a few short sentences, Biden signaled his readiness to usher in an era of renewed LGBTQ protection after four years of the very opposite. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris ran on what Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, billed in August as \u201cour nation\u2019s most pro-equality ticket in history.\u201d Among other things, he was referring to Harris\u2019 pro-LGBTQ track record, which goes back to when she entered politics in 2004, and to the former vice president\u2019s radical shift on LGBTQ rights. Biden went from voting for the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 to getting out ahead of former President Barack Obama in publicly backing marriage equality in 2012. Biden and Harris\u2019 win in the 2020 election couldn\u2019t have arrived at a better time for LGBTQ Americans and those who care about equality. It\u2019s no secret that under President Donald Trump, anti-LGBTQ ugliness has become a newly visible norm. An extensive 2019 report from ProPublica cataloged the Trump administration\u2019s anti-LGBTQ maneuvering and \u201cfound dozens of changes that represent a profound reshaping of the ways the federal government treats the more than 11 million lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.\u201d These changes include reversed, dropped, removed and withdrawn LGBTQ protections in areas such as employment, health care, criminal justice and public life. In particular, the administration has made a target of transgender Americans, whom some LGBTQ advocates say the Trump White House has attempted to use as a wedge against the broader coalition.   During Pride Month this past June, the administration rolled back an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against transgender patients. (In August, a federal judge blocked the rollback, a day before it would\u2019ve gone into effect.) There\u2019s also Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump\u2019s third pick to the high court. During the Senate hearings in October, Republicans and the Christian right sought to brand Barrett as a sort of conservative feminist icon, an approach that hinged on their apparent obsession with her family size. For many LGBTQ Americans, though, the new justice is more like a specter, waiting to strike at their rights. Barrett has limited experience as a federal judge. But that doesn\u2019t mean that she hasn\u2019t participated in important cultural and political conversations and, in consequence, offered insight into her convictions. For instance, in a lecture at Jacksonville University in the run-up to the 2016 election, Barrett supported the dissenters in \u201cObergefell v. Hodges,\u201d the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for marriage equality nationwide. She also signaled that the Title IX rights protecting transgender Americans should be subject to congressional review. \u201cMaybe things have changed so that we should change Title IX,\u201d Barrett said in 2016. \u201cMaybe those arguing in favor of this kind of transgender bathroom access are right. \u2026 But it does seem to strain the text of the statute to say that Title IX demands it, so is that the kind of thing that the Court should interpret the statute to update it to pick sides on this policy debate? Or should we go to our Congress?\u201d In a similar vein, an October report from The Associated Press detailed Barrett\u2019s previous position, for almost three years starting in 2015, on the board of a private Christian school system, one that the AP said has anti-LGBTQ policies. The system \u201ceffectively barred admission to children of same-sex parents and made it plain that openly gay and lesbian teachers weren\u2019t welcome in the classroom,\u201d the AP found. While it remains to be seen whether Barrett\u2019s opinions on the 6-3 conservative majority high court will track with her prior stances and affiliations, the anxiety hovering over LGBTQ Americans is real. \u201cLawyers are sharing advice for how same-sex families can ensure legal protections if marriage equality goes away \u2013 secure second-parent adoption papers, living wills, healthcare proxies,\u201d as Allison Hope wrote for CNN Opinion. \u201cWe don\u2019t and can\u2019t know for sure how Barrett will rule on cases relating to LGBTQ rights, but the overall signs, given past comments and statements from other conservative justices on the Court, are not promising.\u201d Just on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito reiterated in an inflammatory speech his retrograde belief that marriage is only between a man and a woman. \u201cUntil very recently, that\u2019s what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now, it\u2019s considered bigotry,\u201d he said. More broadly, the abiding fear is that Trump \u2013 who\u2019s successfully appointed more than 200 federal judges, including his three Supreme Court picks \u2013 has reshaped the federal judiciary in a manner that could embody his administration\u2019s anti-LGBTQ animus long after he\u2019s left office. One example is Steven Menashi, Trump\u2019s successful appointee to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. Menashi has a \u201chistory of denouncing women\u2019s marches against sexual assault, dismissing education about multicultural awareness and accusing a major LGBTQ group of exploiting the brutal murder of a gay student for political ends,\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile found in 2019. To an extent, the concern over such appointments isn\u2019t even about Trump \u2013 it\u2019s about the kinds of people the President has sought to empower. According to a 2019 report from Lambda Legal, more than a third of the President\u2019s circuit court nominees have \u201crecords of working to undermine LGBT rights and protections.\u201d No one knows the continued attempts to erode equality that a second Trump term might have brought. But it\u2019s no little thing to be able to look ahead to repair and progress instead of injury. The Biden administration won\u2019t be able to fix everything that its predecessor has damaged over the past four years. And there will be no easy triumphalism, especially if Republicans hold the Senate majority. But Biden and his team can take meaningful actions to undo much of the harm. In fact, in March, the Biden campaign previewed how it\u2019d protect and expand LGBTQ rights via the wide-ranging \u201cBiden Plan to Advance LGBTQ+ Equality in America and Around the World.\u201d For one thing, the plan commits to passing the Equality Act, a bill that would protect against anti-LGBTQ discrimination in commercial and public life, with no religious exemptions. In addition, the plan pledges to combat the violence afflicting transgender women of color, get rid of the transgender military ban and restore safeguards for homeless LGBTQ Americans. Gay, transgender. To many, Biden\u2019s words might have seemed unremarkable. But given their centrality in the President-elect\u2019s victory speech, these words registered as a promise \u2013 that come January, LGBTQ Americans will have a champion in the White House.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has long sought advice from different perspectives throughout his career, but at a pivotal moment in defining his legacy as President, he is receiving conflicting advice from his closest and most trusted advisers \u2013 his eldest children \u2013 as he strategizes his next move in the wake of his election loss. While his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are gung-ho, leading the charge for the President to stay in the fight, daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump has emerged as someone looking for a way for the President to save face as he considers his next steps, sources tell CNN. Differing approaches have emerged amongst the Trump siblings: Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are telling their father to aggressively fight to the end, echoing baseless claims that the election has been rigged and the outcome should change. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, meanwhile, are weighing a different political calculus. Ivanka Trump and Kushner would prefer the President concede the race as soon as next week after the Georgia recount has concluded on November 20, whereas Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. would prefer to drag it out until the bitter end.   The couple doesn\u2019t believe legal battles will change the election\u2019s outcome, but are nevertheless advocating for a more measured approach to let the legal fight and recounts continue to ensure future election integrity while allowing them to appear sensitive to Trump, a source familiar with the situation said. Ivanka Trump has offered a more calibrated message to her father, asking him whether it was worth damaging his legacy and potentially his businesses to continue his refusal to concede. She is privately realistic about the President\u2019s loss, a source told CNN, but she also knows that her entire future - now more than ever - is tied to her father\u2019s, and must be handled delicately. A White House spokesperson declined to comment to CNN on the matter. A spokesperson for Donald Trump Jr. declined to comment. Lewandowski just the latest Trump adviser to contract coronavirus For his part, the President appears to be heeding that advice. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s not going to win, but he also knows he holds all the cards right now because he knows that he won 72 million votes and founded a movement,\u201d a source familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking said. The source said Trump believes he was never considered a legitimate candidate or President. \u201cHe was investigated and impeached and people tried to destroy him and his family, so why should he rush to concede anything now when Georgia and Arizona still haven\u2019t been called, and some people are telling him that they have some legitimate legal recourse in Pennsylvania?\u201d the source said. When he does finally come to terms with his loss, Trump is being urged to characterize this election as the \u201clast final act of harassment,\u201d but that he will take his supporters and his social media following and make clear he isn\u2019t going anywhere. The eldest Trump sons, top surrogates during the 2020 campaign and conservative firebrands themselves, have taken to social media to amplify their message. On the last night of the campaign, Eric Trump was telling people aboard Air Force One on the way back from a Michigan rally that he was convinced it would be a Trump blowout. And on Thursday, the campaign sent another fundraising appeal from Eric Trump with the subject line \u201cFIGHT BACK.\u201d \u201cPeople know exactly what is going on in this country\u2026 It\u2019s fraud!\u201d Eric Trump wrote in the fundraising message. Their sister has offered a toned-down statement of support that ignored her father\u2019s more inflammatory, baseless claims about widespread voter fraud. \u201cEvery legally cast vote should be counted. Every illegally cast vote should not. This should not be controversial,\u201d Ivanka Trump tweeted. \u201cThis is not a partisan statement \u2013 free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy.\u201d Every legally cast vote should be counted. Every illegally cast vote should not. This should not be controversial. This is not a partisan statement \u2014 free and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Her husband is playing both sides, with CNN reporting over the weekend that Kushner discussed whether Trump should acknowledge his defeat, while also urging the President to hold rallies pushing for recounts of votes. 'Dejected' Trump continues to waffle over waging baseless election fight Over nearly four years, Ivanka Trump, who previously worked for her father\u2019s real estate company, developed a neatly tailored portfolio focused largely on women\u2019s economic empowerment and workforce development, but her influence with the President on a myriad of topics cannot be understated. While it\u2019s clear the President values the opinions of his eldest three children, only one of them landed a role in the West Wing, Trump\u2019s sons left to helm the family business in New York. Ivanka Trump wrote in her 2009 book that her parents\u2019 divorce brought her closer with her father, while her older brother, Don Jr., had a more complicated relationship at the time, once telling New York Magazine he didn\u2019t speak to his father for a year after the divorce. Ivanka Trump used that time to develop a better relationship with her father. \u201cHe didn\u2019t move all that far away, just a few floors below us. But now I went down to see him every morning before schools, and I also started dropping by his office on my way home in the afternoon,\u201d she wrote in \u201cThe Trump Card.\u201d A key force playing into Ivanka Trump\u2019s political calculations: an eye toward her future and her husband Jared Kushner\u2019s legacy. In her time in Washington, Ivanka Trump has gone \u201cFull MAGA,\u201d one source said, adopting a more conservative viewpoint in sync with the Trump brand, her success closely intertwined with her father\u2019s. \u201cI am pro-life, and unapologetically so,\u201d Ivanka Trump said in an interview with RealClearPolitics last month. The Trump campaign strategically deployed Trump to events targeted at Republican suburban women voters in a series of campaign stops in the weeks before the election. Kushner, another source familiar said, is leaning toward softening the message to prepare for a more graceful exit. Kushner will have to go back to work when the administration concludes, the source said, and there is concern that a bad exit could lead to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s reversal of executive orders that could wipe out what he considers to be his best achievements. But no matter how gracefully Trump exits office, it\u2019s unclear that a Biden administration would protect any of those achievements. Ivanka Trump said this of her husband in times of crisis: \u201cHe (Kushner) finds it unproductive to focus on the problem (versus the solution) or to react emotionally. He\u2019s my greatest teacher in this regard, the calm, soothing voice of reason that guides me to focus on what matters most, even in moments of crisis or chaos, when I naturally tend to be a bit more emotional,\u201d she wrote in her 2017 book, \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201d Now, Trump and Kushner are awaiting the results of recounts and legal challenges. \u201cThey want all legal avenues to be exhausted and come what may,\u201d a senior administration official said, declining to finish that sentence. CNN\u2019s Kate Bennett contributed to this report. This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

            "article_content": "Many of you are ecstatic. Relieved. Say you feel safe. Yet also worried \u2013 not just those who voted for President Donald Trump, but others who are scared at just how divided the country has become. We asked American voters how they feel about the outcome of the election now that Joe Biden is set to be the next president of the United States. Kamala Harris will be the nation\u2019s first Black and South Asian vice president, and the first woman to hold that office. You left us almost 2,000 voicemails. Here\u2019s what you said. \u201cI am elated. I am excited I cried with tears\u201d So many of you mirrored Carmella Visconti\u2019s feelings of excitement and elation at the outcome. Here\u2019s what she said: \u201cHi CNN, it\u2019s November 7th at 12:04 p.m. and Joe Biden has now been elected as President-elect with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. I am elated. I am excited. I cried with tears. I\u2019m still kind of in tears because of all we\u2019ve gone through for the last four years with the president that\u2019s in office now. We have two decent hard-working people that are going to be in the White House come January. Thank you. Congratulations, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\u201d Antonio Gonzalez was one of many whom expressed hope at Biden\u2019s overtures of unity, rather than division, saying \u201clove wins.\u201d \u201cLove wins\u201d \u201cOh my god, Biden just won and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m so shocked and I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m feeling so many things, I just. Wow. Wow is all I can say. Love wins. Everything won today. I\u2019m just so, so happy.\u201d Brian from San Francisco described the change in leadership as being like coming out of an \u201cabusive relationship.\u201d \u201cIt feels like these past four years that the President of the United States has been in an emotionally abusive relationship with the rest of us\u201d \u201cI have to say that I was watching CNN when the call was made for Joe Biden and almost immediately, I felt this wave of relief hit me. That I would no longer have to sit and spend every day devoting time and energy to worrying about what the President was going to say on Twitter, in the news, and what kind of potential hate speech he would spread. That a decent man like Joe Biden was going to be our commander-in-chief. And that I would be able to sleep and not have to worry. It feels like these past four years that the President of the United States has been in an emotionally abusive relationship with the rest of us. And now that that\u2019s over, it\u2019s hard not to feel like we\u2019re free in some way from a tormentor that we put there. Thank you.\u201d A viewer from the transgender community expressed relief for their community, who she said didn\u2019t feel safe under Trump. \u201cPeople need to feel comfortable in their own skin when they walk outside the door and not feel scared of how their life is going to turn out, or if someone\u2019s going to take their life\u201d \u201cThis has been a lot for me and my community and it\u2019s, I\u2019m in tears of joy right now because this country needs change. We need to see change. People need to feel comfortable in their own skin when they walk outside the door and not feel scared of how their life is going to turn out, or if someone\u2019s going to take their life because of someone\u2019s hatred towards another person\u2019s lifestyle or well-being. And Joe Biden is a person that\u2019s gonna change it and have Kamala Harris in the office as well, the first Black female vice president is just tremendous. It\u2019s overwhelming, it\u2019s just too much. Words cannot express how I feel, and this country is headed in the right direction, right direction. Very, very, good. Very good.\u201d In a text call-out we did for people who prefer to write rather than leave voice messages, many people from the LGBTQ community expressed similar sentiments. Alex, Newton from Massachusetts wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s finally over! As an LGBT person I was scared for me and my family\u2019s safety, but it\u2019s finally over!\u201d Liam, from Austin, Texas wrote: \u201cThere is a future for me as a gay man in America.\u201d However, while the overwhelming majority of responses we received expressed jubilation with the outcome, not everyone is happy. \u201cJoe Biden will never be my president\u201d Some people told us they won\u2019t accept the outcome, although many of these types of messages were anonymous. \u201cYeah, Joe Biden will never be my president. Kamala Harris will never be my vice president. I don\u2019t even acknowledge them as existing, you can take that to the bank.\u201d Either way, the fact that the election took days to call with razor-thin margins in some states has people worried about the divisions in this country. \u201cI keep thinking about the 71 million people who bought all of the fear that Trump and his allies sold\u201d Here\u2019s what one viewer said: \u201cI am very glad that Biden and Harris won. But I am also quite sad that it was so close. I keep thinking about the 71 million people who bought all of the fear that Trump and his allies sold. The fear of change, the fear of the other, the fear of nuance and complexity. Maybe Jill Biden, our new FLOTUS, can turn the focus on education because knowledge is especially powerful when it\u2019s a path to better communication all around.\u201d President-elect Joe Biden seeks to unite nation with victory speech However, Vietnam veteran Gary Kelly reminded us that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has alienated many people as well. \u201cI\u2019m not a sucker or loser. I fought for my country and a lot of other men did too\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Gary Kelly from the state of Kentucky. I\u2019m a Vietnam veteran and I\u2019m certainly glad we\u2019re gonna see it change in Washington. Because I\u2019m not a sucker or loser. I fought for my country and a lot of other men did too and I\u2019m glad we got a President-elect who will appreciate that. I\u2019m a senior citizen and I certainly appreciate the people turning out to vote. And we need to continue bringing this country together. United We Stand, thank you and God bless.\u201d Your voicemails confirmed Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus played a big role in the election. \u201cI want to see this virus end and I believe the only one who can end this virus and bring us back to normalcy is Joe Biden\u201d Lucy was one of many viewers who told us they believe Biden will do a better job of getting the virus under control. \u201cThis is Lucy College. I\u2019m calling from Sterling, New York. I am excited and anxious and hopeful, hopeful that the folks will do the right thing. I served my country in the military through three wars over 40 years and I want to see this virus end and I believe the only one who can end this virus and bring us back to normalcy is Joe Biden.\u201d For the majority of the Black community, Biden\u2019s win seems to bring a huge sense of relief. \u201cWe have finally found someone who cares for all of us in this country\u201d Carmel from Texas summed it up with her words: \u201cMy name is Carmel and I\u2019m calling from Texas. I\u2019m very excited as a Black woman being in America to know that we have someone who cares about us. Not just us, but someone who cares about all individuals of stripes, and I\u2019m very excited and I just thank God that Biden and Harris made it our first vice president Black woman and I thank God, praying hard for years of this nonsense and this country being divided. We have finally found someone who cares for all of us in this country. Go, Joe Biden and go Kamala Harris. Amen.\u201d Some pro-Trump supporters told us they worry about Biden\u2019s foreign policy experience, despite him having served as vice president for eight years under Obama. \u201cHe is totally uncapable of handling foreign affairs\u201d Here\u2019s one of them: \u201cMy name is Eugene Ash. As far as Joe, President Joe Biden is concerned, if NATO nations are all favoring him that means much foreign troubles for America. He is totally uncapable of handling foreign affairs.\u201d Concern over what Biden\u2019s policies might be isn\u2019t just coming from the political right. Some progressive Democrats want clarity too, highlighting some of the divisions within the Democratic party. Worried Biden will \u201cstick to only serving the moderate Democrats and not really give any policy boosts to the progressives who helped get him elected.\u201d Marshall says he\u2019s most worried Biden will forget about the critical role progressives played in helping him get elected. \u201cHi, my name is Marshall. Calling on the line from Kansas City, Missouri. The Biden win was really something that America needed to move past the authoritarianism of the Trump presidency. But what I feel most worried about is that Biden will ignore the fact that Bernie supporters and other progressives and leftists that united behind him to help him get elected and get Trump out of office, and he\u2019s instead going to stick to only serving the moderate Democrats and not really give any policy boosts to the progressives who helped get him elected. I just really don\u2019t want to feel like Biden leaves us behind, when we\u2019re one of the people who helped get him elected.\u201d And if Biden didn\u2019t already have his work cut out for him inheriting a divided government in Washington and the difficulty of solving the nation\u2019s Covid-19 crisis, many Trump supporters continue to believe Trump\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud. \u201cThis is the biggest scam I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d \u201cYeah, this is Brian in Colorado. And this is the biggest scam I\u2019ve ever seen, this election. It was clear that Trump won this and I\u2019m not sure why everybody seems to hide this but it\u2019s quite the scam going on.\u201d On Twitter and on television, Trump and his allies continue to bombard Americans with false claims about the presidential election \u2013 falsely asserting Democrats were attempting to steal the election from Trump. There is no evidence for this. Read our fact check of these claims here. \u201cTrump and his legal team are coming\u201d \u201cYeah, this is Jamie Johnson. I\u2019m feeling pretty damn good. I\u2019m in Northport, Alabama. Just letting y\u2019all know that this election is far from over. Sleepy Joe has not won yet. Y\u2019all can claim that all you want but Trump and his legal team are coming in the morning. Bank it. The cheating s*** will end. Trump 2020.\u201d Fact check: Trump doubles down on groundless conspiracy theory that GOP poll watchers across the country were sidelined Overall, the majority of messages we received expressed relief, a sense of freedom, and hope at a better and brighter future. Austin from Illinois summed up those sentiments saying he hugged his loved ones a little tighter. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a huge weight lifted off my shoulders today\u201d \u201cHi, this is Austin from Johnson City, Illinois. I\u2019m feeling a huge weight lifted off my shoulders today. The last four years of this, tyranny is a good word for it is, is over. We know there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. I hugged my daughter really tight. I kissed my wife, I cried a little. It\u2019s, it\u2019s a great day for America, and I\u2019m so ready for Joe Biden to be president. We\u2019re still listening.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is casting doubt on the integrity of vote counting and warning he will deploy squads of lawyers when polls close on Tuesday, as his latest attempts to tarnish the democratic process deepen a sense of national nervousness hours before Election Day. The President\u2019s maneuvering, as he fights to the last moment to secure a second term, is taking place ahead of a court hearing in Texas Monday morning on a Republican request to throw out 127,000 drive-thru votes in a key county. The case is one of a growing number of GOP legal gambits to jam up vote counting or reject ballots and comes amid new concerns that the Postal Service, after reforms initiated by its new pro-Trump CEO, may struggle to deliver a deluge of mail-in ballots before counting deadlines. Fears are also growing that the President might try to declare victory before all the votes are counted as he and Democratic nominee Joe Biden launch a final-day swing through the battleground states that will decide one of the most crucial elections in modern US history. Their sprint is taking place as the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 that Trump has denied and downplayed \u2013 begins to rage out of control across most of the country. The situation further complicates life for millions expected to head to polling places on Tuesday to join the record 95 million citizens who have already cast an early vote. A nation in crisis faces a critical moment in history this election Biden is leading in national polls and by a narrower margin in many key states and has multiple paths to victory. Trump\u2019s route to the required 270 votes is thinner but still viable, meaning either candidate could win. Trump\u2019s campaign is counting on a surge in Election Day turnout from his supporters to fuel the President\u2019s path to reelection. In an extraordinary departure from American political tradition, Trump has been arguing for months that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him, has made false claims that mail-in voting is corrupt and has refused to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power. On Sunday, the President stoked fears of a disputed election that could have corrosive long-term effects by raising the false argument that results not declared on an election night were somehow illegitimate. Many US elections have gone past midnight on Election Day. It is common for some states to take several days to finalize vote counts. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election,\u201d Trump said in the crucial state of North Carolina, which he is battling to keep in his column despite demographic changes that give Democrats hope. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing, and that\u2019s very bad. You know what that thing is. I think it\u2019s a very dangerous, terrible thing,\u201d Trump told reporters. In another ominous comment, the President said that as soon as voting was over in states like Pennsylvania, \u201cWe\u2019re going in with our lawyers,\u201d after railing against a Supreme Court decision that left in place for now a decision by Pennsylvania\u2019s top bench to allow the counting of ballots up to three days after Election Day. Elections are, however, not decided by time limits \u2013 they depend on all the votes being counted. Some states and counties do not start counting mail-in votes until Tuesday, and in many cases the process is more complicated than counting in person ballots, meaning that the post-election period will be protracted. Some of the most crucial battlegrounds, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, have warned it could be several days before a final result can be declared. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map In the latest high stakes legal imbroglio, a federal court in Texas will hear a suit filed by a group of Republicans to invalidate nearly 127,000 ballots at drive-thru facilities in Harris County, a heavily Democratic area that surrounds Houston. The Texas Supreme Court denied a similar petition on Sunday. The showdown is taking place against a backdrop of a dramatic Democratic push to capture Texas, a long-term Republican bastion, without which the President almost certainly couldn\u2019t win a second term. Also in Texas, the FBI has opened an investigation into a caravan of vehicles driven by Trump supporters allegedly harassing a Biden-Harris campaign bus on Friday. In a separate vote counting case in Nevada, a judge is set to rule Monday on a GOP lawsuit seeking to halt early counting in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, over the stringency of signature-matching computer software and how closely observers can watch votes being counted. As the election nears, concern is growing about what could be a chaotic and confusing election night \u2013 given the unusually high proportion of early and mail-in votes owing to the pandemic. Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that she was concerned that Trump could try to declare victory in her state if Election Day voting tallies showed him with a lead before early and mail-in votes were counted. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very real possibility and that\u2019s why we are trying to make sure that everyone in the press understands the volume of votes that are coming in is like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before and it is going to take time to count,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more important that we get a count that is accurate than a count that is fast and might not be accurate.\u201d A Trump campaign advisor told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Sunday that his team will not hold back on claiming a win if it looks like the President is heading for victory, looking at the \u201ccurrent count\u201d and \u201cremaining count\u201d of ballots on election night. Just because a candidate declares victory it does not mean the election is over, but such a move could be used to create a false political reality to build momentum behind subsequent legal challenges. The President has already said he expects the election to end up in the Supreme Court, and rushed to get Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett confirmed before the election to bolster the conservative majority on the top bench. Tuesday\u2019s moment of destiny will unfold as the novel coronavirus emergency surges out of control all over the nation, in the wake of record daily infection rates and with the number of deaths climbing toward 1,000 per day. The President on Sunday night hinted that he could seek to dismiss Dr. Anthony Fauci after the election after rejecting the admired infectious diseases specialist\u2019s science-based recommendations on the pandemic. Biden will campaign Monday in Ohio \u2013 a late addition to his target list \u2013 and Pennsylvania, the state of his birth that could be the tipping point if the election is close. Trump will mount a hectic trip aboard Air Force One through North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in a last-ditch effort to save states he won four years ago and block Biden\u2019s route to the White House. Biden argues that Trump\u2019s denial and neglect of a pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans and is getting worse by the day should deny the President reelection.   \u201cThe truth is, to beat the virus, we first got to beat Donald Trump. He is the virus,\u201d Biden said in Philadelphia on Sunday. The Democratic nominee heads into the final day of campaigning with a big lead in national polls and ahead in sufficient swing states to allow multiple routes to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House, including through the Sun Belt and the Midwest. \u201cWe feel very confident about our pathways to victory,\u201d Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Biden is hoping that wins in states like Arizona, Florida, Georgia or North Carolina could send an early signal on Tuesday night that he is heading for victory. Trump, while trailing Biden, also has a clear, if narrower, chance to get to 270 electoral votes that relies on him sweeping through a swath of battlegrounds he won four years ago with what his campaign promises will be a huge Election Day turnout. The President cannot afford to drop states like Florida, Georgia or North Carolina and then must battle Biden in the Midwest \u2014 the decisive territory in his victory over Hillary Clinton, where he is struggling by comparison four years later. Still, the President is within striking distance in some swing state polls and Democrats are haunted by the idea that he could yet again defy expectations and pull off a stunning Election Day comeback. The President spent a weekend of splenetic campaigning redirecting responsibility for his mishandling of Covid-19, blaming doctors for inflating death tolls and claiming Biden would clamp new lockdowns on the country if he won. At a rally in Florida on Sunday night, Trump\u2019s crowd started a chant of \u201cFire Fauci\u201d when the President complained that everyone heard too much about the pandemic. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,\u201d the President said. Fauci has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. He is respected all over the world and played a major role in the fight against HIV/AIDS and Ebola. In a Washington Post interview published Saturday, Fauci said that the US \u201ccould not possibly be positioned more poorly\u201d for the feared winter spike in Covid-19 cases that is now materializing, contradicting Trump\u2019s claims the disease will imminently disappear. Trump started his day Sunday in snowy Michigan, before traveling through Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and balmy Florida in an exhausting swing that exemplified his stamina but also his defiance \u2013 and that of his big crowds \u2013 of social distancing measures his own government recommends to stop the spread of Covid-19. He again claimed falsely on Sunday \u2014 at a rally in North Carolina \u2014 that the US was \u201crounding the turn\u201d in its fight with the virus and that vaccines that he had at one point hoped to roll out before the election were \u201cright there.\u201d Biden on Sunday sought to convince Black voters, who are historically more likely to vote on Election Day, to show up in the numbers he needs in cities and suburbs to make up for Trump\u2019s dominance of the rural heartland. \u201cEvery generation has to fight to keep the democracy. I never believed we\u2019d have to fight this hard though,\u201d Biden said.",

            "article_content": "Wendy Caldwell-Liddell is in a race against time, all the time. She is racing to wrap up her job as a grant-writing consultant. She is racing to get her 10-year-old son logged in to start remote learning at home since a case of coronavirus shut down his school. She is racing to drive her two-year-old daughter over to grandma\u2019s house for daycare. But now on top of that, three times a week, 29-year-old Caldwell-Liddell is racing to get Detroit voters, especially the black community, to, in her words, \u201cwake up.\u201d Four years after Donald Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since 1988, Caldwell-Liddell is working as a one-woman canvassing machine in downtown Detroit to prevent it from happening again, fighting against what she says is an apathy within the community toward politics. Trump\u2019s Michigan victory was one of the biggest surprises of 2016.  He won the state by just 10,704 votes. Wayne County, which includes Detroit, the largest Black-majority city in the country, was critical to that result. Hillary Clinton still won the county by a large margin \u2013 but she received about 76,000 fewer votes than President Barack Obama did in 2012. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race. While Caldwell-Liddell is motivated and focused on preventing Trump\u2019s re-election, she also says, \u201cthe Democratic Party has not done a good job at all in taking care of communities like ours.\u201d And it\u2019s she clear she struggles with that burden. \u201c(Democrats) take us for granted because they know that Black women are going to help them get the big wins they need, where it matters. But they also know that they can give us the bare minimum, knowing that we aren\u2019t going to choose the other side,\u201d she said.  \u201c \u201cIt says we still got a long way to go when the backbone of the country is the most neglected piece of the country,\u201d she said. She isn\u2019t coordinating with any campaign, but she is pounding the pavement at bus stops and outside convenience stores to try to make sure Detroiters are registered to vote and are going to vote. Many of them are disillusioned by the systemic racism they see within their city, the President\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic that has hit minority communities hardest and the economic inequality that has persisted for decades in Detroit and is only made worse by the pandemic. \u201cI know for a fact that if just a portion of the folks who sat home in 2016 made it to the polls, had someone to empower them to do it, that could have changed the outcome for Michigan,\u201d Caldwell-Liddell said. \u201cOn countless days when I go out and canvass, I will go up and talk to someone and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Listen, lady, I know that what you\u2019re saying is probably right. I know that you just want me to get out and vote. But I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve got gotta feed my kids. I don\u2019t even have time to listen to what you\u2019re saying,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a part of why I started doing this work with Mobilize Detroit\u2026because at this point, this is our survival now. What happens politically is a part of our survival. And there\u2019s no escaping that.\u201d Amber Davis, 29, is one of those people who sat out the 2016 election after supporting Obama in 2012. \u201cI didn\u2019t like Trump and I didn\u2019t like Hillary,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really care who won that election.\u201d Davis, a part-time massage therapist and full-time student pursuing a career in IT, says she cares now. She\u2019s voting for Biden, even though she says she doesn\u2019t really like him either. \u201cIf I get Trump out of office by voting for Biden, then so be it,\u201d she said. Davis adds it is the President\u2019s handling of the pandemic that clinched her vote this time. \u201cThis coronavirus and everything that\u2019s going on, it is horrible. So he got to go.\u201d She says she is disillusioned by politics in general because she says no matter which party wins the White House, her life doesn\u2019t get any easier. \u201cWe feel like our votes don\u2019t matter. We feel like it\u2019s just a waste of time,\u201d Davis said. Caldwell-Liddell knows what it is like to not have time for politics, especially presidential politics. In just the past year, she says her family was forced out of a home they had rented for the past four years. Then the next home had plumbing issues and instead of fixing it, the landlord simply just had the water shutoff, requiring Caldwell-Liddell to take them to court to get anything fixed. In the midst of all of this, she lost her pregnancy. \u201cI ended up having a stillbirth at seven months pregnant, living in a house with no water in a city that did not care to take care of me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd things like that are allowed to happen because when folks like me are too worried about surviving to pay attention to what\u2019s happening down at City Hall.\u201d She is now turning that apathy into action. \u201cI know that as a voter and as a Black woman, that there is a job that I have to do in order to get a representative who will come close to protecting my people in office. But I\u2019m not necessarily excited about having another representative there who really does not inherently understand the needs of our community.\u201d Caldwell-Liddell is voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, spending free time that she doesn\u2019t have trying to get others in Detroit to vote for him, but she\u2019s not excited about it. This election for her is more a vote against Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t really have many feelings towards Joe Biden one way or the other,\u201d she says. \u201cKamala (Harris) makes me feel a lot better than Joe, to be honest with you.\u201d She says getting Trump out of office means life or death for her community. \u201cDonald Trump is a president that does not care about people that look like me, about people like me, in any shape or form.\u201d Sitting out any election is something 63-year-old Markita Blanchard simply does not understand. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted straight down the street,\u201d she says while sitting in her backyard filled with the plants and flowers she shows off with pride. \u201cThere is no justifiable excuse not to.\u201d \u201cPeople died for that right for us to have the opportunity to vote,\u201d she added. Like Caldwell-Liddell, Blanchard has also lived in Detroit her whole life. She and her three brothers still live in the house they grew up in, now all taking care of their 93-year-old mother. Blanchard works as a janitor at a local public school. While she describes her childhood in the westside of Detroit as a \u201cfairytale,\u201d she describes life today as a struggle. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly living paycheck to paycheck. I consider myself living paycheck and a half to paycheck,\u201d she said. The main street in her neighborhood looks nothing like how Blanchard describes it from her childhood. A \u201cghost town\u201d now sits where grocery stores, dry cleaners, Black-owned gas stations and a movie theatre once stood. This economic collapse is one reason Blanchard is voting for Biden. She says she\u2019s with him \u201c100%,\u201d reserving more colorful language to describe Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s full of s***.  I\u2019m saying he has done nothing,\u201d Blanchard says with an apology. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re living in a sitcom and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s not funny at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had people say, well, he\u2019s not my President. I didn\u2019t vote,\u201d Blanchard recalls with visible anger. \u201cI say, if you did not vote, you did vote for him.\u201d One critical pursuit of the Biden campaign in Michigan is to turn out those voters who didn\u2019t vote in 2016. But the Trump campaign is also taking steps to court those same people, including setting up an office just down the road from the Democratic Party\u2019s on Detroit\u2019s West side, covered with signs declaring \u201cBlack Voices for Trump.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it. I\u2019ve never seen it ever, ever before,\u201d said President Pro Tempore of the Detroit City Council Mary Sheffield. \u201cWhat that tells me is the importance of not only Michigan but Detroit in the black vote, the importance of the black vote\u2026because both parties need us.\u201d Sheffield says she is worried about what she senses is still a lack of enthusiasm this late in the game among Democrats in Detroit. She thinks the coronavirus pandemic is partly to blame. \u201cJoe Biden is not really the most exciting person. And I think, unfortunately, in light of COVID, we lost that personal touch with him that a lot of communities need to get them excited and to get them engaged,\u201d Sheffield said. The coronavirus has disproportionally hit Black communities across the country, and Detroit is no exception. African Americans have made up 62.2% of the more than 14,000 confirmed cases in Detroit and 82.9% of the deaths. While coronavirus may have hurt grassroot engagement for the campaigns, Sheffield says a different issue is sure to motivate Black voters. \u201cWhat we saw with George Floyd did spark a reaction in so many people and I think that\u2019s going to help also increase some of the voter turnout that we see in Detroit,\u201d she said. Federal action in the police killing of Breonna Taylor is the one thing Davis says could actually swing her vote and convince her to vote for Trump. \u201cHe could get Breonna Taylor\u2019s killers arrested, that\u2019s what he could do,\u201d she said. \u201cI would definitely vote for Trump.\u201d Taylor\u2019s death also weighs heavily on Wendy Caldwell-Liddell. \u201cWhen you\u2019re black in America, you know racism is alive and well,\u201d she says when asked about it. She pauses, looks off, and shifts in her chair. \u201cNow I have to battle with that on top of the thoughts of when I send my son into the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s when me and my daughter are at home asleep, minding our business. Now, I\u2019ve got to think about that, too.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign will air a series of ads during a slate of National Football League games over the next week, looking to use their sizable campaign war chest to air spots on some of the most popular real estate in television. The ads \u2013 which will air during five upcoming NFL games \u2013 represent the heart of Biden\u2019s argument against President Donald Trump: An intense focus on how the President has mismanaged the ongoing coronavirus, the importance of voting in November and questioning Trump\u2019s character. The Biden campaign announced a record-breaking $383 million fundraising haul in September, a number that gave the campaign $432 million in the bank. That money has allowed the campaign to spend on some of the nation\u2019s most expensive ad time. The Biden campaign declined to say how much these ads cost but reports have found one 30-second spot during an NFL game cost around $419,000 in 2019, according to AdAge. \u201cOur paid media program definitely places a premium on these high impact, high viewership events,\u201d said Jordan Finkelstein, paid media chief of staff for the Biden campaign. \u201cWe think it\u2019s just a good opportunity to connect with viewers when they\u2019re not just putting the TV on to have something on, they are specifically tuned in to watch a football game.\u201d Finkelstein said that the campaign intentionally looked for games with teams in swing states and tailored the ads to \u201cwho we think is watching to maximize our impact and try to connect with voters and viewers the best we can.\u201d Two of the ads will air during the in-conference matchup between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers, two teams from battleground states in the presidential race. One ad \u2013 titled \u201cThe Blind Pig\u201d \u2013 will air nationally on CBS and tell the story of Joe Malcoun and his Ann Arbor, Michigan, bar and music venue, a once bustling establishment that has been directly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The minute-long ad features \u201cSabotage\u201d by The Beastie Boys. \u201cFor 50 years, the Blind Pig has been open and crowded. But right now it is an empty room,\u201d says Malcoun, the co-owner of the bar. \u201cThis is the reality of Trump\u2019s Covid response. We don\u2019t know how much longer we can survive not having any revenue.\u201d Biden has made Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus central to his campaign against the President. Bars and small music venues have been some of the most dramatically impacted establishments because of social distancing guidance during the pandemic. Malcoun adds: \u201cA lot of restaurants and bars that have been mainstays for years will not make it through this. This is Donald Trump\u2019s economy. There is no plan and you don\u2019t know how to go forward. It makes me so angry. My only hope for my family and for this business and my community is that Joe Biden wins this election.\u201d A campaign aide told CNN it was the first time the Beastie Boys have allowed one of their songs to be used in a campaign ad. The Biden campaign will also air a 30-second ad \u2013 titled \u201cFlex Your Power\u201d \u2013 specifically in Pittsburgh during the Steelers game. The ad features former Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, a one-time Pro Bowler who was involved in a hit in 2017 that left him unable to move his legs and forced to learn to walk again. \u201cIn 2016, I didn\u2019t vote. I didn\u2019t think it mattered,\u201d Shazier says. \u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d With images from his career-ending hit on screen, Shazier continues: \u201cOne thing I learned in life, you have to make the most of every opportunity you get. Right now, you have the opportunity to make positive change in your community \u2013 by voting. \u2026 You want change? Go vote. Use your power.\u201d The Biden campaign will also air a 30-second spot nationally when the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers play during NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football. The ad, titled \u201cWorth Fighting For,\u201d tells the story of a US Army veteran named Matt who returned from service with PTSD. \u201cWhen I first got back, I am looking for snipers, I am looking for IEDs,\u201d says Matt, who is from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, another swing state. \u201cMy friends, they are not suckers.\u201d The ad refers to an explosive report from The Atlantic magazine that alleged Trump has called wounded veterans and those killed in battle \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d Trump has denied the report, but the Biden campaign has seized on it. And the final ad will air during ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football game between the Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys. The ad features Tristen Vance, a linebacker from Northern Arizona University who aspires to play professionally but whose season was canceled due to the coronavirus. \u201cI have been working my whole life towards a dream to play professionally. Missing this season puts those dreams in jeopardy,\u201d Vance says in the ad. \u201cTrump\u2019s failure of leadership is why we can\u2019t play right now. I don\u2019t blame President Trump for the virus, but I 100% blame him for the response to the virus.\u201d The Big Sky conference, which includes the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks, postponed their football season earlier this year because of the coronavirus. These ads are far from the first time the Biden campaign has aired spots during high-profile television moments. The campaign has previously aired ads during the Billboard Music Awards, the Emmy and MTV Video Music Awards, as well as during the Major League Baseball playoffs. The Biden campaign will also target swing states when they air previously released ads over the next week during the Green Bay Packers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers meeting on Sunday, as well as the Thursday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. UPDATE: This story has been updated with corrected information from the Biden campaign about the US Army veteran in one of their ads.",

            "article_content": "As President Donald Trump began a packed day of events Friday, he delivered an unusually somber message to seniors \u2013 a group he won in 2016 and desperately needs to win back \u2013 speaking of the pain and grief inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMy heart breaks for every grieving family that has lost a precious loved one,\u201d Trump said in Fort Myers, Florida, where he also promised the crowd that he would dedicate his life to seniors. \u201cI feel their anguish and I mourn their loss. I feel their pain. I know that the terrible pain that they have gone through, and you lose someone, and it\u2019s nothing to describe what you have to bear. There\u2019s nothing to describe it.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t long before the President\u2019s surprising shift in tone \u2013 one that might have actually helped him win back the many voters he has alienated \u2013 was gone, and he had pivoted back to his old tactics at two campaign rallies later in the day. Nearly two weeks before Election Day, Trump is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by wide margins in national and key swing state polls. But he undercut his own message again on Friday, showing how unwilling he is to stick to any strategy that would broaden his appeal beyond his own base. There were more than 68,000 new coronavirus cases in the US on Friday \u2013 the highest one-day total since late July. But Trump spent the afternoon pushing the fantasy that the virus is receding. \u201cThe light at the end of the tunnel is here,\u201d he told the Fort Myers audience, adding that the US is \u201crounding the turn,\u201d even though all the evidence says otherwise. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the cynics and angry partisans and professional pessimists,\u201d the President said, with no hint of irony about his own angry rhetoric and partisanship. \u201cWe are Americans and we will prevail. We are prevailing. We are.\u201d But instead of outlining a plan to curb the spread of the virus, or his agenda for the next four years \u2013 though it\u2019s unclear if he has one \u2013 he spent most of his day unspooling debunked conspiracy theories about voter fraud, Democratic spying and the Bidens. Fact check: Digging into Trump's false claim that CDC found that 85% of people who wear masks get the coronavirus Slipping into the familiar role of aggrieved victim, Trump overlooked the pressing needs of the nation to define the election as a battle against \u201cbig tech\u201d and the press, angered by the fact that both reporters and social media companies have called out the disinformation he spreads, as well as that of his allies. While minimizing the impact of the pandemic, Trump issued slashing, evidence-free attacks on the Biden family, accusing them of corruption. \u201cThe Biden family is a criminal enterprise,\u201d he claimed in Macon, Georgia, where the crowd chanted \u201cLock him up!\u201d \u201cFrankly it makes Crooked Hillary Clinton look like an amateur,\u201d Trump added. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Throughout the day he referred to Hunter Biden, one of Biden\u2019s sons, as \u201ca vacuum cleaner\u201d to argue that the younger Biden took advantage of his father\u2019s connections. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden. Even Senate Republicans\u2019 probe into the Bidens\u2019 dealings in Ukraine, widely regarded as politically motivated, ended in September without uncovering any evidence that Biden abused his powers or changed US policy because of his son\u2019s business ties. Trump also gave another wink to his conspiracy-embracing supporters with a shout out to Republican  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who\u2019s on track to win a US House seat in Georgia and has praised the pro-Trump conspiracy theory known as QAnon. At a town hall on Thursday night, Trump again refused to disavow the dangerous movement under sharp questioning from NBC moderator Savannah Guthrie. At a time when Trump\u2019s reelection prospects could hinge on whether he can win back middle-of-the-road suburban women and encroach on Biden\u2019s enormous lead among female voters, Trump revived the sexist trope of the hysterical woman to complain about his treatment in the NBC town hall. In echoes of his misogynistic attacks against former Fox News host Megyn Kelly during his last presidential run, he called Guthrie \u201ccrazy\u201d after she aggressively questioned him and fact-checked him in real time. \u201cYou watch last night,\u201d the President told his Georgia supporters on Friday, referring to the NBC town hall, \u201cand you see the anger and the hatred. And I\u2019m saying (to Guthrie) \u2018Look, let\u2019s just do this thing. Take it easy. Relax.\u2019 \u2026 You see that thing where she\u2019s screaming?\u201d Trump and Biden and America's two, polarized political realities live on prime time \u201cWith Savannah,\u201d Trump continued, \u201cit was like \u2013 her face \u2013 the anger, the craziness,\u201d he said, making motions with his hands to suggest a cloud of anger exploding around her head. \u201cI mean, the craziness last night.\u201d \u201cWe got very high marks last night, but they thought it was very unfair,\u201d he added, not specifying who \u201cthey\u201d was, but accusing ABC News of taking a much softer approach questioning Biden during their policy-focused town hall \u2013 even though Trump claimed earlier in the day that he hadn\u2019t bothered to watch Biden\u2019s simultaneous event. Predicting that there will be a \u201cred wave\u201d on Election Day \u2013 in contradiction with all the current polling \u2013 Trump dismissed his own problems with \u201csuburban women\u201d at another point during the Georgia rally. \u201cI heard they like my policies, but they don\u2019t like my personality,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about my personality. They want to be safe, and they want to keep their American dream.\u201d Biden is posting historically strong numbers with female voters, as CNN\u2019s Harry Enten noted in his analysis last week. Biden was up by 25 points among women voters in an average of the last five live interview polls. In the final pre-election polls in 2016, Hillary Clinton had a 13-point edge among likely female voters. Despite the strong polls, the Biden team still needs a big turnout to win, especially given concerns about a tight election and how people can react as Trump stokes skepticism. The campaign announced Saturday that Sen. Kamala Harris will return to the campaign trail after being temporarily sidelined \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d Thursday after her communications director and a flight crew member from her plane tested positive for Covid-19. She\u2019ll travel on Monday to Florida \u2013 where nearly 2.5 million voters have already cast their ballot by mail two days before early voting begins in the state, according to Florida\u2019s Division of Elections statistics. The President\u2019s weakened position as he heads into the final stretch of the campaign is giving prominent members of the GOP greater latitude to express their concerns about the direction that Trump has steered the Republican Party as they look to protect their own ambitions and futures. During a sharp denunciation of Trump on a call with constituents that leaked this week, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse described the risks to his party in stark terms: \u201cWe are staring down the barrel of a blue tsunami,\u201d he said. One factor in that possible blue tsunami is Democrats\u2019 robust fundraising efforts, and the fact that many Democratic Senate challengers are smashing records as the prospects for the GOP in many down-ballot races look increasingly grim. And with just weeks to go until November 3, Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon was urging supporters to remain active and engaged, saying in a memo set to be distributed Saturday, \u201cWe need to campaign like we\u2019re trailing.\u201d \u201cWe cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire,\u201d she wrote in the memo obtained by CNN and first reported by The New York Times. O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign is looking to raise another $234 million before Election Day, after the campaign announced it entered October with $432 million cash on hand. Trump on Friday waved off the concerns, even among his allies, about the fact that his own campaign has fallen far behind Biden in fundraising, with September reports showing that Biden and the Democrats outraised Trump and the Republicans by $135 million. \u201cI could raise more money, I\u2019d be the world\u2019s greatest fundraiser, but I just don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Trump said Friday night in Georgia, claiming that donors would expect him to grant favors in return. In his own \u201cred wave\u201d predictions, he also dismissed the evidence of strong enthusiasm among Democrats in the presidential race, as well as in down-ballot races \u2013 despite long lines at the polls in many early voting states and the fact that some 20 million voters have already cast their ballots. He called it \u201cnegative enthusiasm,\u201d inspired by Democrats\u2019 dislike of him, and claimed enthusiasm from his own supporters could overpower it. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip, 3 weeks from Election Day But after tiptoeing around Trump for three-and-a-half years, some prominent Republicans, including Sasse, have distanced themselves from the President as his support continues to erode nationally. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear recently that he has not visited the White House in many months because he doesn\u2019t think the White House coronavirus protocols are adequate. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who contracted coronavirus and spent seven days in an intensive care unit, bluntly expressed his regrets about not wearing a mask at the White House during debate prep sessions with Trump and at the Rose Garden ceremony where the President nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Christie said he was lulled into a false sense of security because of the supposedly rigorous White House coronavirus testing regimen. During his phone call with some 17,000 constituents, Sasse said the President \u201ckisses dictators\u2019 butts\u201d and that the United States \u201cnow regularly sells out our allies under his leadership.\u201d The Nebraska Republican\u2019s comments were first obtained by The Washington Examiner. \u201cThe way he treats women and spends like a drunken sailor. The ways I criticized President (Barack) Obama for that kind of spending I\u2019ve criticized President Trump for as well,\u201d Sasse said in comments on the call, which were confirmed by CNN with his office. \u201cHe mocks evangelicals behind closed doors. His family has treated the presidency like a business opportunity. He\u2019s flirted with White supremacists.\u201d Sasse also said that the President\u2019s \u201cstupid political obsessions\u201d and his tactics are hurting Republicans with women and young people. \u201cIf young people become permanent Democrats because they\u2019ve just been repulsed by the obsessive nature of our politics, or if women who were willing to still vote with the Republican Party in 2016 decide that they need to turn away from this party permanently in the future, the debate is not going to be, you know, \u2018Ben Sasse, why were you so mean to Donald Trump?\u2019\u201d Sasse said on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be \u2018What the heck were any of us thinking that selling a TV-obsessed narcissistic individual to the American people was a good idea?\u2019 It is not a good idea.\u201d The President dismissed the Nebraska senator as \u201ca liability to the Republican Party\u201d in a series of Saturday morning tweets. But Sasse spokesman James Wegmann hit back in his own, writing, \u201cBen said the same thing to Nebraskans that he has repeatedly said to the President directly in the Oval Office. Ben is focused on defending the Republican Senate majority, and he\u2019s not going to waste a single minute on tweets.\u201d Former White House chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who has criticized the President before, has told friends that Trump \u201cis the most flawed person\u201d he\u2019s ever met, according to reporting in a new CNN special scheduled to air Sunday night. \u201cThe depths of his dishonesty is just astounding to me,\u201d Kelly has said. And Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican who has broken with Trump in the past, released a statement on Friday stating that the President\u2019s refusal to denounce \u201cthe absurd and dangerous conspiracy theory\u201d QAnon during Thursday night\u2019s town hall \u201ccontinues an alarming pattern.\u201d The 2012 GOP presidential nominee said Trump was part of a pattern where politicians and parties \u201crefuse to forcefully and convincingly repudiate groups like Antifa, White supremacists and conspiracy peddlers.\u201d \u201cRather than expel the rabid fringes and extremes, they have coddled or adopted them, eagerly trading their principles for the hope of electoral victories,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAs the parties rush down a rabbit hole, they may be opening a door to a political movement that could eventually eclipse them both.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday.

            "article_content": "Two months ago, President Donald Trump went on with conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt to talk about a MAJOR scandal involving, among others, former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about unmasking, yes,\u201d Trump told Hewitt on August 11. \u201cThat was a big deal. Horrible deal where they unmasked him so many times. I think he\u2019s got to have the record for unmasking. Maybe I do, you know, because we\u2019re still looking how many times did they unmask me. Let\u2019s find that out, too, because look, they were spying on our campaign.\u201d What Trump was referencing \u2013 since it\u2019s, uh, hard to figure out from his quote \u2013 is the practice of senior administration officials requesting to know an individual\u2019s name in order to better understand an intelligence report. (As a matter of policy, all names of individuals are redacted in intelligence reports.) The process, which is known as \u201cunmasking,\u201d is relatively rare but not entirely unheard of. In May, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson (Wisconsin) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) released the names of a number of Obama administration officials who might have sought to unmask Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s identity in intelligence reports in the run-up to Trump taking office. (The names were on a document that had been recently declassified by Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.) Among the names on that list? Biden. Trump, who embraces any conspiracy theory that suits his own political interests, immediately seized on the news as evidence of (yet another) plot against him and his allies by the previous administration. \u201cThe unmasking is a massive \u2013 it\u2019s a massive thing,\u201d Trump said shortly after the release of the names. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 I just got a list. It\u2019s \u2013 who can believe a thing like this? And I watched Biden yesterday on \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 being interviewed by one of your colleagues, George Stephanopoulos, and he said he knew nothing about anything. He has no idea. He knows nothing about anything.\u201d (Sidebar: In a letter responding to Grenell\u2019s request to declassify the unmaking requests, the head of the NSA wrote that the \u201cunmasking was approved by through NSA\u2019s standard process, which includes a review of the justification for the request,\u201d adding: \u201cWhile the principals are identified below, we cannot confirm they saw the unmasked information.\u201d) So important to Trump was this unmasking news that Attorney General William Barr tasked John Bash, the US Attorney in San Antonio, in late May with conducting an investigation into whether the unmasking was politically motivated. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That investigation has ended, according to The Washington Post. And it has ended without any charges being brought against Biden or any other Obama administration official. Or even any public report of its findings. Trump, despite amplifying the initial reports if unmasking, has yet to offer any thoughts about the investigation ending without any sort of findings of wrongdoing. This is my surprised face. There\u2019s a pattern here, of course. From his initial insistence that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election (for which he has provided zero evidence) right through these unmasking claims, Trump has desperately seized onto anything and everything that would suggest that not only did the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d work to keep him from winning but it has also done everything it can to hamstring his presidency. Despite all of that, of course, Trump insists he has accomplished more in his first term than any other president. Ever. Remember how Trump repeatedly raised questions about whether Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election to help him and hurt Hillary Clinton? Well, the intelligence community, special counsel Robert Mueller and the US Senate Intelligence Committee all said that that\u2019s exactly what happened. Or how Trump said that the entire Russia investigation was politically motivated by people out to get him? It wasn\u2019t. Or how Trump said that President Barack Obama and Biden had \u201cspied\u201d on his presidential campaign? Also, debunked. Or how the DNC email server was somehow in the possession of the Ukrainians? It isn\u2019t. Or how Google and social media sites are biased against conservatives? Not quite. Time and time again, the President has attempted to elevate fact-free conspiracy theories solely because he believes they may provide him the life raft that his drowning campaign badly needs. And when facts are presented that clearly refute his baseless claims, he has been unwilling to acknowledge them. If past is prologue, then, Trump will either a) ignore the end of the unmasking investigation completely or b) write it off to the \u201cdeep state.\u201d (Worth remembering: Bash was appointed to look into the unmasking by Barr. And no one can reasonably conclude, based on his actions, that Barr is anything but strongly pro-Trump.) But facts are facts. And yet again, Trump\u2019s attempt to suggest his political opponents were engaged in nefarious behavior has totally and completely fizzled out.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is making a clear attempt to appeal to disaffected Republicans and independent voters in the final weeks of the election, promising he\u2019d be a president that would work hard not just for those who support him, but also for those who do not. Campaigning on Saturday evening in Pennsylvania\u2019s Erie County, which President Donald Trump won narrowly in 2016, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m running as a proud Democrat, but I am going to govern as an American president,\u201d before touting the endorsement of former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican who served as Homeland Security secretary under President George W. Bush. \u201cWe may not agree on everything,\u201d Biden said of Ridge. \u201cBut we agree on this: this is a moment to put country above party,\u201d he said, employing a line popularly used by conservative voters who have thrown their support behind the Democratic nominee. Biden\u2019s remarks focused heavily on the economy as he warned that working class people are \u201cbeing left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history\u201d due to the President\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic. Here are the prominent Republicans backing Biden Erie is just one of a series of counties the former vice president has traveled to on the campaign trail in recent weeks as he hopes to peel away some of Trump\u2019s support and even win back some of the counties President Barack Obama won before they flipped in 2016. Biden campaigned in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and Warren, Michigan, and on a train tour through eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania following the first presidential debate, many of his stops were in areas that Trump won in 2016. After the last stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which went for Trump four years ago, Biden acknowledged, \u201ca lot of white working-class Democrats thought we forgot them and didn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d referring to the Democratic Party. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important that they know.\u201d His campaign is employing Republican surrogates and endorsements to make their case for the Democratic nominee as well. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling On Saturday, the campaign unveiled its first television ad featuring Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996, but the Biden campaign has labeled the state as one in which it believes it can \u201cexpand\u201d support as it considers multiple pathways to victory. Biden\u2019s campaign is also touting support from former Trump voters. In Erie County, Rick Telesz, a soybean farmer from western Pennsylvania who voted for Trump in 2016, introduced Biden ahead of his remarks. Telesz said that while Trump made many promises to farmers and working people four years ago, \u201cit did not take long for me to realize that President Trump is nothing more than a con-man.\u201d Telesz delivered a scathing rebuke of the President, arguing that he is \u201cnot pro-life\u201d but rather \u201cpure pro-profit.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In four years, Sen. Lindsey Graham has gone from Donald Trump\u2019s cutting critic to his dogged defender, a bipartisan dealmaker respected by Senate Democrats to a staunch conservative reviled by liberals across the country. Graham has frustrated the left before but never paid the price in his red state of South Carolina. Now, the three-term senator is in the race of his life, facing an unexpectedly fierce challenge from his Democratic opponent, Jaime Harrison, whose insurgent campaign has raised and spent an unprecedented amount of cash. The race is tied, according to three recent polls. But Graham is banking that South Carolina will send him back to Washington for three reasons: His alliance with Trump, his vigorous defense of the President\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and push to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett before Election Day, and his opponent\u2019s party ID. In the final weeks of the campaign, Graham is attempting to mar Harrison\u2019s hope-and-change message by tying him down to unpopular Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna tell all the liberals talking about South Carolina: We\u2019re gonna kick your ass,\u201d Graham told a crowd full of police officers in Myrtle Beach last week. Graham, who first came to power in Washington by winning a House seat during the Republican Revolution of 1994, had been viewed as a shoo-in for reelection for much of the cycle. But Harrison has swamped Graham across the airwaves, with $51 million in money already spent in ads and in future ad reservations \u2013 compared to just $18 million for Graham, according to Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Is Lindsey Graham in trouble? \u201cI\u2019ve been helping Trump, and I apparently pissed every liberal in the country off,\u201d Graham told CNN here in the state capital. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Graham\u2019s relationship with Trump is a double-edged sword. While Graham has earned many of the President\u2019s supporters, it has also opened him to charges of hypocrisy, going from calling Trump a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d in 2015 to telling CNN in an interview this past weekend that the two are \u201ca team.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people don\u2019t have a stand on their issues,\u201d said Maggie Parker, a voter in Columbia, when asked about Graham. Even some of his supporters are critical of the shift. \u201cI\u2019d rather him be honest and not flip-flop,\u201d said Mike Jackson, a voter in Myrtle Beach who plans to vote the GOP line. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m not crazy about. I like for a man to be straightforward and stay that way \u2013 not to turn out to be a yes man when his boss man turns up.\u201d In the interview, Graham was unapologetic about his shift, contending he has put his past disputes with Trump behind him. \u201cI accepted my defeat,\u201d Graham said, referring to his loss in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. \u201cPresident Trump won my state. I\u2019ve been trying to help him where I can. He\u2019s very popular in South Carolina.\u201d Graham also steered clear of any slight criticism of Trump. Asked about Trump\u2019s own admission that he downplayed the coronavirus, held packed rallies during the pandemic, downplayed the wearing of masks and made repeated false claims that the virus would simply disappear, Graham instead defended the President\u2019s actions. Trump ally Lindsey Graham thinks the President should release tax returns \u201cI think he made the decisions,\u201d Graham said of Trump, pointing to restrictions on travel from China and ensuring ventilators were stocked up, a frequent argument made by the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to get out there and say, \u2018Hey, the whole country is going to blow up.\u2019\u201d Pressed on whether Trump should have held packed campaign rallies and crowded White House events, like the one announcing the nomination of Barrett to the Supreme Court where few wore masks or isolated themselves, Graham said: \u201cPeople came, and I believe in wearing masks and they were social distancing.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t come out of Trump Tower; it came out of China,\u201d Graham said of the coronavirus. Similarly, asked if Trump has made his job harder \u2013 like after he failed to condemn white supremacists at last week\u2019s debate \u2013 Graham didn\u2019t answer directly. \u201cAll I can say about people of South Carolina is it\u2019s not the color of your skin,\u201d pointing to Republican Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican, and Nikki Haley, the former governor and daughter of Indian immigrants. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about where you\u2019re from in South Carolina or the color of your skin, it\u2019s about your ideas.\u201d As he\u2019s gained traction in the race, Harrison has taken an increasingly low profile, sparingly doing media interviews and steering clear of public events. As a father of two young children and a pre-diabetic, Harrison has been cautious during the pandemic, even insisting on acrylic glass to be placed beside him during Saturday\u2019s debate and privately pushing for the debate to be held virtually up until the final hours before the event. But it\u2019s also unclear how Harrison fills his time. His campaign would not provide a list of virtual events his aides said he\u2019s been doing, despite many requests by CNN. And he refused to agree to an interview or answer questions from CNN before and after his debate with Graham. Many voters in South Carolina say they have seen a lot of Harrison \u2013 but only through his ads. \u201cThey have been blitzing us with ads back to back on YouTube, Spotify, you name it,\u201d said Lyric Swinton, a voter in Columbia. \u201cIt\u2019s just about everywhere it\u2019s ads all across the state.\u201d Democrats haven\u2019t had success in South Carolina ever since Fritz Hollings retired fifteen years ago after nearly four decades in the Senate. In the six Senate elections since 2004, the Democratic candidate never cracked 45% of the vote. But Harrison may break that barrier in his race against Graham, boosted by an unprecedented level of financial support. In his final campaign in 1998, Hollings raised $5.6 million. Harrison\u2019s campaign reserved more than that \u2013 over $9.3 million to be precise \u2013 in ads the week beginning October 6, according to CMAG. To date, the Senate contest is the most expensive in South Carolina\u2019s history. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever had a race like this before,\u201d said Walter Whetsell, a spokesman for the pro-Graham Security Is Strength PAC. He said in South Carolina, statewide campaigns traditionally buy 8-10 weeks of television advertising at a cost between $2 million-$3 million dollars. \u201cHe\u2019s spending that damn near every two or three days,\u201d said Whetsell. Bombarded across the airwaves and facing tightening polls, Republican leaders are rushing to Graham\u2019s defense. The Senate Leadership Fund, the Super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has upped its plans to spend in the race, spending or reserving $9.6 million in South Carolina, compared to $6 million in advertising from the Senate Majority PAC, the Super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, according to CMAG. \u201cThe far-left money spigot has been turned on for liberal lobbyist Jamie Harrison, and now he\u2019s flooding South Carolina with his liberal donors\u2019 funds,\u201d said SLF President Steven Law in a statement. J.B. Poersch told CNN that the South Carolina race has been competitive for a long time. \u201cThe problem with Lindsey Graham is nobody seems to trust him,\u201d Poersch said. \u201cThat sentiment of not trusting Lindsey Graham knows no party.\u201d Harrison has to hope for a series of fortunate events to beat Graham. He has to bring out Democratic voters, while appealing to Republicans who are turned off by the senator in the Trump era. Amanda Loveday, a former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said Harrison \u201chas run the most effective Democratic statewide race that we\u2019ve seen in modern history.\u201d She said that white suburban voters, especially women \u201cwho are just tired of Trump,\u201d could \u201cdetermine how this election is won.\u201d Both campaigns are clearly targeting them. Harrison has aired one television ad featuring a woman named Robin from North Charleston, a former Graham supporter now attacking the senator for wanting to slash protections for those with pre-existing conditions like her. \u201cHe might as well cut this tube,\u201d she says, holding onto what helps her breathe. Another Harrison ad from another former Graham supporter, Melissa in Fort Mill, which is south of Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the senator \u201chas changed\u201d and that it is now time for a change. Security Is Strength has responded with one of its own ads featuring a young mother and teacher, Anna Coleman, who says, \u201cI want my family to be safe.\u201d She then attacks Harrison for being \u201cpart of this liberal culture that is tearing our country apart.\u201d It then seeks to tie the Democratic candidate with the left\u2019s defund the police effort, which Harrison rejects, showing images of mobs on the streets. \u201cI mean defund the police,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cThat\u2019s just crazy.\u201d Loveday, the South Carolina Democratic strategist, said that one important factor in the Senate race is Bill Bledsoe, a Constitution Party candidate, whom she said will still be on the ballot in November, even though he dropped out last week and endorsed Graham. The last Democratic candidate to win a statewide race, South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex, defeated a Republican in 2006 by 455 votes when four third-party candidates also ran for the office. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be huge for Jaime,\u201d said Loveday. \u201c[Bledsoe\u2019s] name will appear on every ballot in the state of South Carolina. And if you vote for him, it could potentially determine the results of the election.\u201d Harrison grew up poor in Orangeburg, and was raised by his grandparents before attending Yale University and Georgetown Law. He worked as a staffer for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, led the state Democratic Party, and worked as a lobbyist with clients including Michelin, Boeing and the South Carolina Ports Authority. His message echoes Barack Obama\u2019s slogans from 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s not about left versus right,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cIt\u2019s about right versus wrong.\u201d Graham has attacked Harrison\u2019s lobbying career, noting one of his clients was a hedge fund company that had previously sued Hurricane Katrina victims \u2013 a charge Harrison\u2019s campaign has called misleading since it was before Harrison worked on behalf of the company. But the senator\u2019s overall message is that while Harrison is a liberal, Graham is going to ensure that Barrett will be confirmed this month. Yet even as Trump is more popular in South Carolina then he is in other states where vulnerable Republican senators are running, polls have shown a dip in the President\u2019s standing here. Whether that\u2019s enough to end Graham\u2019s 26-year career in Congress is an open question. \u201cI think we\u2019re a team,\u201d Graham told CNN when asked if his fortunes were tied to Trump\u2019s. \u201cSometimes he says some things that are difficult to be honest with you. But Trump\u2019s going to win this state because of his record. And I\u2019m going to win because of my record. And this is a conservative state.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has tested positive for coronavirus after being exposed to someone with the virus earlier this week, according to his spokesman, making him the third GOP senator to test positive in 24 hours and threatening the quick confirmation prospects of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. In a sign of just how little margin for error there is to get Barrett confirmed by Election Day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote in an email to GOP senators obtained by CNN that he needs all Republican senators back in Washington by October 19. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who sit on the Judiciary Committee, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday \u2013 just days after attending a White House event where President Donald Trump nominated Barrett. Multiple attendees of that event, including Trump, have tested positive in the week since the ceremony, which featured many people not wearing masks and not observing social distancing protocols. Johnson did not attend the Barrett nomination ceremony \u2014 where several people appeared to have been exposed to the virus \u2014 because he was quarantining from a prior exposure, during which he twice tested negative for the virus, according to the spokesman. Johnson was able to get tested before speaking to the Ozaukee County Republican Party Oktoberfest Dinner on Friday night in Wisconsin, he said on a call with reporters Saturday. The senator, who said he had decided to get tested as a precaution after hearing that Lee had tested positive earlier on Friday, learned he had tested positive after the event on his ride home. Unlike Democratic senators, Senate Republicans meet three times a week for lunch. And while they sit in a large room, they remove their masks to eat and to speak. Johnson, Lee and Tillis all attended Senate GOP lunches this week. If the three senators remain out this month, it would effectively prevent Barrett from being confirmed to the Supreme Court until they return, which could be after Election Day during a lame-duck session. A lame-duck confirmation is a situation that GOP leaders are eager to avoid in case they lose control of the chamber next month. Senate Republicans, pushing to get Barrett on the Supreme Court by month\u2019s end, have circled October 15 as a crucial day when they will need Tillis and Lee to return. That\u2019s because they will need a quorum of senators to begin the process of voting on the nomination. On October 15, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham needs to have nine total members of the committee present, including two Democratic members, to officially consider the nomination. At that meeting, Democrats would use their power under the rules to delay the vote on the nomination to the following week, setting up a committee vote by October 22. A floor vote would happen later that week. But Democrats may choose to boycott the October 15 proceeding. If they do, the GOP won\u2019t have a quorum and won\u2019t be able to begin the process. Graham can get around the boycott if Tillis or Lee are back \u2013 and they move forward with a committee vote to approve the nomination. To approve the nomination, the committee rules require a majority of members to be present. The committee is split between 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, so if the two GOP senators are both out and Democrats boycott, they will not have a majority to vote on the nomination. A further complication: Democrats and the GOP appear to be at odds about whether the committee is allowed to even meet if the Senate is not in session. On Saturday afternoon, McConnell announced that Senate floor activity would be delayed until October 19, though committee work could continue. \u201cThe Senate will go into pro forma session until October 19th. On that day, we will need all Republican Senators back and healthy to ensure we have a quorum,\u201d McConnell wrote in the email to GOP senators. McConnell added: \u201cI am mindful, though, that these times are unsettling in the life of our country.  We need to lead now, with extra prudence and care, not just for our own health and well being, but to be able to perform our elected duties and to be examples to the country. Wear masks, stay distant, and come back safely on the 19th.\u201d But that adjustment to the schedule would require agreement from the Democrats for unanimous consent. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized McConnell\u2019s scheduling announcement as \u201creckless and dangerous,\u201d and also called out Graham. \u201cIf It\u2019s too dangerous to have the Senate in session it is also too dangerous for committee hearings to continue,\u201d Schumer said in a statement after McConnell\u2019s went out. \u201cLeader McConnell and Chairman Graham\u2019s monomaniacal drive to confirm Judge Barrett at all costs needlessly threatens the health and safety of Senators, staff, and all those who work in the Capitol complex.\u201d Lee and Tillis both said in statements Friday they would isolate for the next 10 days. Tillis said he didn\u2019t have symptoms, while Lee said he had symptoms \u201cconsistent with longtime allergies.\u201d But if they come back too quickly, they may flout guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which require isolation for 10 days after symptoms first appear and for at least 24 hours with no fever or fever-reducing medicine. It further says that people who have tested positive and don\u2019t have symptoms should also isolate for 10 days. The committee still plans to have the confirmation hearings beginning October 12. Republicans are worried about getting enough votes to confirm a nominee in a lame-duck session after Election Day if they lose their majority \u2013 and the White House \u2013 and Democrats prepare to take power in January. The fear is that one or two GOP senators may break ranks after seeing the election results and citing the will of the voters. Already, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have indicated they are \u201cno\u201d votes if the confirmation vote happens before the election, and could vote against a nominee in a lame-duck session as well. With a 53-47 Senate majority, Republicans can not afford to lose more than three senators in order to get the nomination confirmed. Republicans, who control the Senate, do have some options in moving the nomination along even without senators present. Graham could hold virtual confirmation hearings for Barrett, or hold the hearing in person but have Lee and Tillis attend remotely if they\u2019re still in quarantine. But even if Republicans on the committee don\u2019t have a quorum when it comes time to vote this month, McConnell can always advance the nomination to the floor under the rules without a committee vote. Johnson is not on the Judiciary panel but would not be able to vote on the floor if he were not present. Johnson\u2019s office said the Wisconsin senator was again exposed \u201cshortly after\u201d returning to Washington on September 29 and was tested Friday afternoon. \u201cThis test came back positive. Senator Johnson feels healthy and is not experiencing symptoms. He will remain isolated until given the all-clear by his doctor,\u201d Voelkel said in a statement. Most of the staff in the Republican senator\u2019s Washington office have been working remotely, and the office will go all-virtual for the immediate future, Voelkel said. This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday. CNN\u2019s Megan Trimble, Lauren Fox, Phil Mattingly, Terence Burlij and Rebecca Buck contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "On Thursday morning, Donald Trump tweeted this: \u201cI won the debate big, based on compilation of polls etc. Thank you!\u201d This is, in a word, false. Let me prove it. Here are two major news organizations\u2019 polls that sought to measure public opinion on the first general election debate between Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday night in Cleveland: 1) A CNN post-debate poll showed 60% of debate watchers said Biden did a better job in the debate, while 28% said Trump did. 2) A CBS News poll of debate watchers showed 48% thought Biden won as compared to 41% who thought Trump did. The rest \u2013 10% \u2013 called the debate a tie. Neither of those \u2013 if I am reading them right \u2013 say that Trump won. And a \u201ccompilation\u201d of those polls also do not say he won. They say he lost. Period. What, then, is Trump talking about? Honest answer: I am not exactly sure. But my best guess is that Trump is conflating actual, scientific polls \u2013 like the two I noted above \u2013 with non-scientific, Internet polls which, among other methodological flaws, allow a single person to cast as many votes as they like. Breitbart, a strongly pro-Trump \u201cnews\u201d site, conducts just such a poll. According to its most recent results, more than 87% of respondents said that Trump won the debate. (Who are these people? Do they represent an accurate sample of the electorate? We have no way of knowing!) There\u2019s a similar sort of \u201cpoll\u201d at the bottom of this AL.com article on the debate. (Of the 369,000 respondents, 52% said Trump won the debate while 48% chose Biden.) Trump, never one to dig deep into how a poll is conducted, may have latched on numbers like the non-scientific ones being produced by Breitbart and other sites. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Or, and this is a real possibility too, Trump is just saying he won, without even any bad numbers \u2013 like those in the Breitbart \u201cpoll\u201d \u2013 to back him up. That would also be in keeping with Trump\u2019s lifelong strategy of declaring victory, loudly, in the face of loss. Remember that Trump has long lived in a self-reinforcing bubble in which he is allowed to tell himself a story of his life where he is the star, the winner, the hero. Anyone not willing to play along with him in that story by, you know, noting that the facts often don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s version of events, is removed from his inner circle. Which, over time, produces a senior level of aides who function only as enablers. (Sidebar: Trump\u2019s obsession with being seen as winning the debate seems to overlook what happened in 2016. He was judged by polls conducted after each of the three debates that year to have lost them to Hillary Clinton. He won the White House anyway.) On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted a screenshot of an unscientific online poll from C-SPAN\u2019s Twitter account that showed him winning 69% to 19% for Biden. pic.twitter.com/KIFQOAzeUw Unfortunately for our democracy, there are now lots (and lots) of people who will take Trump\u2019s tweet about his debate performance as fact \u2013 and never do any independent research, which would, of course, show that there is no actual evidence to suggest Trump won the debate. Trump\u2019s supporters wanted to believe that he won because he said what they wanted to hear. Or they didn\u2019t even watch the debate but they support Trump. Or because the media says that Trump lost, he must have won. (The media didn\u2019t say Trump lost; the media conducted polls in which people who watched the debate said he lost.) When facts are sidelined in favor of personal opinion, you get the current crisis of truth in our country. And that impact of that crisis falls on Republicans and Democrats equally.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden made false claims in a Sunday speech in which he urged Senate Republicans to let the winner of the presidential election fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday. We\u2019re still poring over the transcript of Biden\u2019s address in Philadelphia, but here are two initial fact checks. The Trump campaign\u2019s demand for a list Biden argued that it would be inappropriate for him to release a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, as Trump did during the 2016 campaign and did again this month. Biden also claimed that the Trump campaign had not asked him to release such a list until after Ginsburg died. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They\u2019re now saying, after they \u2013 after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, \u2018Biden should release his list.\u2019 It\u2019s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It\u2019s a game for them. It\u2019s a play to gin up emotions and anger,\u201d he said. Facts First: This is just wrong. The Trump campaign and Trump himself had repeatedly said prior to Ginsburg\u2019s death that Biden should release a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees. When Trump released his latest list on September 9, the Trump campaign\u2019s statement said in its title that \u201cBiden must do the same.\u201d The campaign repeated the demand for a Biden list in a statement on September 17, the day before Ginsburg died. Trump had previously issued the same demand himself. In an August 24 speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m demanding, actually, a list: let Biden put up a list of the judges he\u2019s going to appoint.\u201d And in a June 22 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said, \u201cYou ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign: give a list of judges, see where they stand on pro-life, see where they stand on it.\u201d Supreme Court dates To bolster his case that the Senate should wait to confirm the next justice, Biden said: \u201cBy the way, there\u2019s no court session between now and the end of this election.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim is simply inaccurate. The court\u2019s next session is scheduled to begin on October 5, nearly a month before Election Day on November 3.",

            "article_content": "Joy Solomon is a retired businesswoman in Boca Raton, Florida, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But after watching the President\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, she says she\u2019s voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden this time around. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what turned me off the most. I was watching TV with the Covid, which I really think is a very serious thing, and I think he made it like it was no big deal,\u201d Solomon, 65, said. \u201cI think we lost control of the whole situation,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t forgive him for that. I just can\u2019t forgive him.\u201d The Biden campaign is devoting significant resources to winning over more voters like Solomon \u2013 senior citizens in Florida who might have backed the Republican nominee in the past but have been turned off by Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic as well as his inflammatory rhetoric. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race. So far, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent over $40 million on ads in the state, with several directly targeting older voters on the pandemic and Social Security. And it also hosts a variety of senior-targeted outreach events, like workshops teaching supporters how to write letters to the editor. Most recently, it hired a staff member devoted solely to senior outreach and organizing senior members of the community to vote. That effort appears to be paying off. While Trump won Florida in 2016 with a double-digit lead over Hillary Clinton among voters age 65 or older, the latest polling suggests Trump\u2019s advantage with the group is gone, and at best for the President, Trump and Biden are close among Florida\u2019s seniors. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling As Biden visits Florida Tuesday, he will land in a state where his campaign continues to underperform with Latinos compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016, which could make the senior citizen vote even more crucial to victory in a state that has been decided by less than two percentage points in the past two presidential elections. \u201cI think generally the Biden campaign is in better shape to win Florida than we were at this point either in \u201908 or \u201812,\u201d said Florida Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who worked on Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in the state during both election cycles. He also helps lead the pro-Biden PAC, Unite the Country. \u201cI mean, obviously it has a long ways to go and in no way am I saying that it\u2019s anything but competitive, but I feel pretty good about things.\u201d Trump relishes his role as a divider as he vows to be 'vicious' With the stakes high for both candidates \u2013 no Republican has won the presidency without winning the Sunshine State since Calvin Coolidge in 1923 \u2013 and the margins historically tight, the Biden campaign is targeting retirement community areas like The Villages, Sun City and Pinellas County that have high populations of senior citizens in hopes of peeling away some of the senior vote won by Trump in 2016. \u201cKnowing that the state is a 1% state, no matter what we do and how you slice it, seniors are always important and have been in past cycles. They make up so much of the vote that is a critical voting bloc for all of us,\u201d said the Biden campaign\u2019s Florida state director, Jackie Lee. Frank Carlin, a retiree living in Florida\u2019s Tampa area, did not vote in the 2016 election. While he initially supported Trump, he changed his mind at the last minute but was \u201cnot high enough\u201d on Clinton to cast his ballot. It\u2019s a choice he regrets, he says, and this year, it\u2019s different. Carlin, who is not affiliated with a political party, is all-in on Biden. \u201cBiden is like exhaling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a storm, and I know calm waters are coming.\u201d The campaign released a series of ads in the last few months, three of which came out in a span of nine days, targeted directly at senior citizens, hitting the President on his handling of the coronavirus and accusing him of cutting Social Security. In one ad, titled \u201cSwing,\u201d a narrator begins: \u201cDonald Trump stepped off the golf course and signed an executive action directing funding cuts for Social Security.\u201d Two ads center specifically on voters who live in The Villages. In the month of September, the Biden campaign spent $16 million on ads in Florida, counting current reservations and spending during the first week, while the Trump campaign placed $13 million worth of ads. Florida is also the state in which the Trump campaign has invested the most this month. The most common theme across Biden\u2019s ads placed in Florida\u2019s main media markets in the last few months features a positive outlook toward the candidate, while the ads the Trump campaign has placed with the most frequency go negative against Biden. The campaign\u2019s most-played ad in the state\u2019s main media markets, including Tampa and Orlando, since July, attempts to scare voters about the former vice president\u2019s views on policing, suggesting that a Biden presidency would result in 911 calls from senior citizens going unanswered, which is not true. In the ad, an elderly woman notices an intruder in her home and attempts to dial 911 but is kicked to an automated voice messaging system. As the ad ends, the words \u201cYou won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America\u201d appear on the screen as the intruder makes his or her way into the home. Biden drove the Social Security message home in an interview with a local Orlando station last month. \u201cBecause look, in Florida, what\u2019s happening in Florida? I mean you have a President of the United States that just introduced a proposal to wipe out Social Security,\u201d he said, citing a letter from the Social Security Administration\u2019s chief actuary, who wrote that the entitlement\u2019s trust fund could be depleted by the middle of 2023. Trump last month issued an executive measure allowing employers to defer the collection of certain workers\u2019 Social Security payroll tax until 2021, when it would be paid back. He said that if he wins, he would terminate the levy \u2013 though it was unclear whether he meant the deferred amount or the payroll tax itself. Regardless, either step would take an act of Congress, which has indicated little interest in doing so. At the request of four Democratic senators, the actuary found that completely eliminating the payroll taxes could deplete the Social Security trust fund in three years if no other revenue source were put in place. Trump has suggested that the money would come from the general fund, which also would require an act of Congress. The actuary\u2019s analysis was based on hypothetical legislation that would not take money from the general fund. \u201cSocial Security, it\u2019s a lifeline,\u201d explained Carlin. \u201cIf they would mess with Social Security in any way, even reduce the amount, it will cripple people down here.\u201d He added, \u201cIf they mess with Social Security, I think you\u2019d have a revolution with the people that are over 50.\u201d The Trump campaign\u2019s special adviser for Florida, Susie Wiles, has called the Biden campaign\u2019s messaging regarding Social Security a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s mythical,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that the President has been very clear about his dedication to protect Social Security and Medicare.\u201d Biden, who opted to forgo travel in the early throes of the pandemic, makes his first visit to Florida of the general election on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Trump, who became a full-time Florida citizen last year, has flown to there multiple times since March, on both official White House business and for campaigning purposes. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has also continued to physically knock on doors, a strategy the Biden campaign put on hold during the pandemic. \u201cUnlike the other campaign, we never stopped retailing on the ground,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a mode of campaigning we don\u2019t employ.\u201d The Biden campaign has argued that physical door knocking doesn\u2019t have a real impact on reaching voters and chooses instead to count a \u201cquality conversations\u201d metric. And in lieu of in-person events, one way the Biden campaign has been encouraging senior supporters to get involved is by sending letters to the editor in their local papers in favor of Biden. The campaign hosts regular virtual \u201ctraining sessions\u201d to teach seniors how to write letters based on topics they find important, and organizers teach the supporters how to place the letters. Cris Andersen, a retired middle school teacher, moved to The Villages in 2014. While she was somewhat involved in the election in 2016, she has ramped up her efforts this year, and as an officer in the retirement community\u2019s Democratic Party, she has been working every day to teach people in her community how to vote by mail. \u201cAfter 2016, the way it turned out, I, like many people said, \u2018We gotta change this.\u2019 It can\u2019t happen again,\u201d she said. So now Andersen works with a few dozen organizers to identify and call voters individually to remind them to vote. She and the other \u201ccoaches,\u201d as she said she likes to call them, sent fliers with reminders for community members to update their signatures and teach them how to make sure their mail-in ballot was received, among a number of priorities. Andersen said her motivation comes from a combination of factors: disappointment in the quality of her retirement and desire to leave a good future for generations to come. \u201cI\u2019m just passionate about making sure for my nieces and nephews and my great nieces and nephews that I leave the world better. I feel very committed to that,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAnd I\u2019m also scared, you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at the end of my life, but that my retirement years \u2013 it isn\u2019t what I\u2019d hoped it could be.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Katie Lobosco and David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "For President Donald Trump, the past week marked a terrible kickoff off to the fall campaign as he struggled to regain his balance amid multiple revelations that underscored the costly lies that he has told about the coronavirus pandemic and his breathtaking disregard for revered American military leaders. It is still too early to know how Trump\u2019s controversial comments \u2013 some alleged and others on tape \u2013 will influence voters given that many Americans\u2019 opinions of Trump have hardened and the universe of persuadable voters is shrinking. But the unflattering portrayal of the commander in chief in two bombshells reports around the Labor Day holiday \u2013 one in The Atlantic late last week and the other in Bob Woodward\u2019s forthcoming book \u2013 come as the first absentee ballots are sent out and as voters traditionally start tuning into the election. It\u2019s marked an inauspicious start of the home stretch for Trump. Even before those developments, the President was trailing former vice president Joe Biden in the polls and was massively outraised by Biden\u2019s team in August, raising alarm among Republicans about whether the President will have enough money to match Biden\u2019s efforts through Election Day.   Though Trump tried to massage and reinterpret his own words during this week\u2019s news conferences and a Thursday night rally in Michigan, Americans heard him on tape from February admitting to Woodward that the coronavirus was much more deadly than the flu and easily transmitted through the air \u2013 while saying virtually the opposite publicly about a pandemic that has now claimed more than 192,000 American lives. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling As much as Trump tried to shift the conversation to more favorable topics, the week was dominated by coverage of those damning admissions and the continuing fallout over his alleged comments about the military. He seemed particularly stung that he had few defenders in the military after the reports in The Atlantic that he privately disparaged dead American soldiers as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers,\u201d and proceeded to further alienate the military community during a Labor Day news conference where he argued that top Pentagon officials fight wars to keep defense contractors happy. Those two storms buffeted his campaign after a month-long stretch in which the Wesleyan Media Project found that pro-Biden ads dominated the airwaves by a 2:1 margin. Polls show the former vice president maintaining a sizable lead nationally over Trump, with a slender edge in key battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states where the race appears to be tightening. There appears to be no clear leader in North Carolina and Florida. Trump is looking to heighten enthusiasm by hitting the campaign trail, from his rally in Freeland, Michigan, on Thursday \u2013 where supporters did not socially distance and few wore masks \u2013 to his stops in Minden, Nevada, and Las Vegas this weekend, and Wisconsin next week. His campaign operatives are putting their faith in the President\u2019s formidable ground game, noting that while pro-Biden ads are dominating the air war, the former vice president has largely forgone the traditional in-person organizing that the Trump campaign has invested in. Trump Victory, a joint effort by the Republican National Committee and the campaign, says they have 2,000 field staffers in 17 states whose efforts are bolstered by some 2 million volunteers making calls and knocking on doors. The campaign\u2019s current messaging and Biden\u2019s attempts to use Trump\u2019s comments to Woodward as a strike against the President could have a more immediate effect by galvanizing Democratic voters at the same time that the party is leading a push for them to return their ballots early. As of CNN\u2019s count late Friday for states that have made the data available, more than 11.8 million absentee ballots had been requested so far in 12 states, with Democrats leading requests in two key battleground states that disclose the party breakdown of those requests. Trump twists history of Churchill and FDR to cover up pandemic denialism But the Democratic advantage in ballots requested may be driven by the fact that Democrats tend to favor mail-in voting more than Republicans. In a recent CNN poll, 68% of Trump voters said they preferred to vote in person on Election Day compared to 21% of Biden\u2019s backers. In one glimmer of encouragement for the Trump campaign this week, the Cook Political Report shifted two of their electoral college predictions to Trump\u2019s favor \u2013 categorizing the state of Florida as a \u201ctoss up\u201d rather than a state that \u201clean Democrat\u201d and putting Nevada into the more competitive category of \u201clean Democrat\u201d rather than \u201clikely Democrat.\u201d Those moves were a warning sign for Biden because they reflect a narrowing advantage in the Electoral College map, which was Hillary Clinton\u2019s downfall in 2016 even though she won the popular vote. Though demographics in Nevada, where Trump heads this weekend, have increasingly favored Democrats, and Clinton narrowly won there in 2016, the state is notoriously difficult to poll and the anti-government, frontier ethos of its independent voters aligns well with Trump\u2019s message. The economic shutdown walloped the state\u2019s economy, which depends heavily on tourism. And the pandemic has hobbled the Democrats\u2019 ability to organize in-person at the state\u2019s casinos, which has often been a central driver of turnout in Clark County where Las Vegas is located. Trump continues to see reopening the country as his path to victory, blithely tweeting praise Friday for a company that he said had ordered its workers back to the office this month. The night before, at his Michigan rally, Trump again said the country is rounding \u201cthe final turn\u201d in the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, bluntly disagreed with the President\u2019s assertion. \u201cLook at the data, the data speak for themselves,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer when asked about the President\u2019s claim on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d Friday evening. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to listen to any individual. And the data tells us that we\u2019re still getting up to 40,000 new infections a day and 1,000 deaths. That\u2019s what you look at. Look at the science, the evidence and the data and you can make a pretty easy conclusion.\u201d There has been a decline in new cases in 28 states over the past week and 14 states are holding steady, but Fauci has expressed concern about case surges in several states. On Friday, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington increased their projections for American deaths by another 5,000, predicting 415,000 deaths by January 1. \u201cWe are still in the middle of this and in order to get any semblance of normality, you\u2019ve got to get that baseline number of infections way down,\u201d Fauci said, adding that he felt \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the US will have a vaccine by the end of this year. Blitzer to Fauci: Who should we trust, you or President Trump? Fauci also made it clear that Americans may not be able to resume their normal pre-pandemic activities \u2013 like going to a restaurant or a movie theater without a mask \u2013 until the latter part of next year. That is, in part, because the coronavirus vaccine may only be 70% to 75% effective and because it will take time to get enough Americans vaccinated to have \u201can umbrella of immunity.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t letting that reality color his rhetoric about the virus \u2013 or the campaign. While giving those rosy pronouncements about the status of the pandemic at his Thursday rally, he dismissed polls showing him behind Biden, noting that he won some of the states where he was down in the polls during his 2016 race with Clinton. He said he had just seen a poll showing that he was \u201cup\u201d in Michigan: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is good or bad,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re better off being down a little bit.\u201d \u201cMichigan, you better vote for me,\u201d he added. \u201cI got you so many damn car plants.\u201d In a preview of his campaign events this weekend, Trump dismissed Woodward, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist, as a \u201cwack job,\u201d and claimed once again that he was simply trying to keep the nation calm at the beginning of the pandemic \u2013 even though he has centered his entire presidential campaign on creating fear about a broad array of real and imagined threats to American life. That strategy \u2013 and Americans\u2019 ability to recognize the incongruence of Trump\u2019s excuses \u2013 will be tested at the polls this fall. After four years of sowing chaos, discord and mistruths, Trump is facing the judgment of voters once again. The revelations of the last week alone would have been disqualifiers for most other candidates seeking the Oval Office, but Trump has made a career of defying the odds. Still, even if voters ultimately give him another shot, the week\u2019s events are yet another indicator that history will not judge him favorably.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of \u201ca life-and-death betrayal of the American people\u201d hours after journalist Bob Woodward revealed ahead of the publication of his new book, \u201cRage,\u201d that Trump had concealed the true threat posed by coronavirus. While campaigning in Michigan on Wednesday, Biden pointed to Trump telling Woodward in a recorded February interview that the virus was more deadly than the flu, airborne and highly contagious. \u201cHe knew it and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied,\u201d Biden said about the threat posed by the virus, which has now left more than 185,000 Americans dead. 'Play it down': Trump admits to concealing the true threat of coronavirus in new Woodward book \u201cIt\u2019s beyond despicable. It\u2019s a dereliction of duty. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments downplaying the virus come as he is trailing Biden in national polls just three weeks from the first debate. They follow last week\u2019s report in The Atlantic \u2013 confirmed in part by other news outlets but vehemently denied by Trump \u2013 that the President had called those wounded and killed at war \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d Biden told autoworkers Wednesday that Trump \u201chas broken just about every promise he\u2019s ever made to the American worker.\u201d Seizing on Trump\u2019s comments about war dead, he added: \u201cDid you really expect anything different from this guy? From someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform, who have given their lives for this country, losers and suckers?\u201d The former vice president was in Michigan to make an economic case against Trump in Macomb County, rolling out a plan to stop businesses from moving jobs overseas in one of the nation\u2019s most important battlegrounds in November\u2019s election. Macomb County is a swing region that Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016 \u2013 making him the first Republican to win the county since 1988. Biden\u2019s speech is part of his campaign\u2019s efforts to counter Trump\u2019s rosy predictions of a rapid economic recovery once the coronavirus pandemic recedes and a vaccine becomes available. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Biden\u2019s trip comes the day before Trump will visit Michigan for a rally in Freeland, just northwest of Saginaw. Wednesday marks Biden\u2019s first visit to the state \u2013 part of the \u201cblue wall\u201d that also includes Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that Trump toppled against Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2013 since March 9, where he held a rally in a Detroit high school gym on the eve of the state\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. The next day, Biden halted in-person campaign events because of the pandemic. \u201cI believe this race is tightening up. We\u2019ve seen polling to that effect, and I\u2019m not surprised by it,\u201d Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign who won Macomb County by four points in 2018 on the way to a 10-point win statewide, said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s campaign on Wednesday unveiled a new proposed tax policy and package of executive actions that would be aimed at preventing companies from moving jobs overseas. He is proposing adding a 2.8 percentage point surtax on top of a 28% tax rate, for a total rate of 30.8%, on profits from American companies that produce goods overseas and then sell those goods back into the US market. Meanwhile, he is proposing an advanceable 10% tax credit for \u201ccompanies making investments that will create jobs for American workers,\u201d a campaign document said. Biden would also close corporate loopholes in the 2017 tax law Trump signed, and would create a \u201cMade in America\u201d office within the Office of Management and Budget to enforce \u201cBuy American\u201d policies, the campaign document detailing his plan said. In Warren on Wednesday, Biden said he would be the most pro-labor union president in history. \u201cDonald Trump and I have a pretty different philosophy when it comes to giving our word,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMine means something.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to Michigan comes as he begins traveling to swing states ahead of the general election, even as the pandemic limits his events to small, invitation-only crowds. Biden has also traveled recently to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and his campaign said Wednesday he will travel to Florida next week. Biden closed his event Wednesday in Michigan by holding up a note card he carries with him daily. The card includes the number of US troops killed and wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the number of coronavirus cases and fatalities both in the United States and among the US military. \u201cFolks, every one of these lives matter,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEvery one of these lives left somebody behind grieving. We can\u2019t ever forget them \u2013 ever, ever forget them.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Biden on Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump suggested on Monday that China is interfering in the 2020 election and attempting to hurt his reelection bid by encouraging race protests, tweeting an article written by a columnist whose claims do not match the US intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Beijing\u2019s efforts so far. These comments from Trump, and similar claims that have been made by many of his appointees, seek to achieve the same goal: playing up the theory that China is meddling to get Biden elected, while downplaying well-founded reports that Russia is trying to help Trump win again, like it did in 2016. Trump tweeted a Breitbart article quoting author and columnist Gordon Chang, who said the Chinese Communist Party is \u201ctrying to make life very difficult\u201d for the President by \u201cfueling\u201d violent Black Lives Matter protests. \u201cFrom what little evidence we have about China\u2019s troll-farm activity, with its bots and with all of its others, they seem to be favoring Vice President Biden, trying trying to make life very difficult for President Trump \u2014 as well as fueling the protests, of course,\u201d Chang stated. \u201cI think that Beijing has decided that it\u2019s voting for the Democratic Party candidate.\u201d It was not immediately clear where Chang\u2019s information comes from but the US government and Silicon Valley have not offered any public assessment about alleged covert Chinese troll farm activity similar to what he described. Chang did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment regarding the origins of the information he cited. The only public comments from these groups about election meddling on social media have focused on pro-Trump activity that is tied to the Kremlin. Intelligence bulletin warns Russia amplifying false claims mail-in voting will lead to widespread fraud Additionally, the article seems to run counter to what US intelligence officials tasked with protecting the 2020 election from foreign interference have said publicly. Intelligence officials have said they have uncovered evidence that Russia is currently interfering in the election to hurt Biden\u2019s campaign. Separately, some evidence has already emerged about Moscow\u2019s efforts, including Facebook\u2019s announcement last week that a troll group that was part of Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election is trying to target Americans again. But while the intelligence community has assessed that China and Iran prefer Trump to lose in November, officials have offered no indication, to date, that either country is acting on that preference in the same way as Russia, according to public statements issued by the intelligence community and sources familiar with the underlying evidence. \u201cWe assess that China prefers that President Trump \u2013 whom Beijing sees as unpredictable \u2013 does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China\u2019s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,\u201d the top US intelligence official on election security, Bill Evanina, said in an unprecedented public statement issued last month. Evanina went on to say, \u201cChina will continue to weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive action,\u201d but to date has primarily engaged in overt efforts like ramping up public criticism of the current administration over non-election-related issues, including its coronavirus response and move to close Beijing\u2019s consulate in Houston. Russia, on the other hand, is using a range of measures primarily to denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia establishment, Evanina wrote in the same statement. Intelligence community's top election official's statement warning of threats from China, Russia and Iran \u201cThis is consistent with Moscow\u2019s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration\u2019s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia,\u201d Evanina said. \u201cSome Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump\u2019s candidacy on social media and Russian television.\u201d Former CIA officer John Sipher told CNN that there is a clear difference in the way Evanina characterizes the threats posed by China and Russia. \u201cThe simple difference is between covert interference on one side and public preferences. China is using influence, diplomacy and commentary in press and propaganda organs. Russia is using disinformation, fake accounts, bots, covert funding as part of a secret campaign,\u201d he told CNN. While Republicans have consistently raised concerns about China\u2019s influence efforts targeting Americans, several sources familiar with briefings provided to lawmakers told CNN that intelligence officials have yet to present clear evidence showing Beijing is actively interfering in the election or taking specific steps to boost one candidate over the other. Instead, intelligence and election security officials have focused, both privately and publicly, on the holistic threat posed by China, emphasizing that Beijing employs a variety of \u201cmalign tactics\u201d that could have implications on the 2020 race. \u201cChina is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign, and its methods include bribery, blackmail, and covert deals. Chinese diplomats also use both open, naked economic pressure and seemingly independent middlemen to push China\u2019s preferences on American officials,\u201d FBI Director Chris Wray said in July. But Trump has repeatedly blurred the line between those broader national security concerns and allegations that China is actively meddling in the election. At the same time, he has all but ignored the intelligence community\u2019s warning about Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Biden. Last week, Trump retweeted a post from his handpicked intelligence chief, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, that linked to a misleading Fox News story with the headline: \u201cChina\u2019s anti-Trump election meddling raises new alarm.\u201d And on Monday, Trump amplified comments that, on the surface, appeared to bolster the narrative that China is interfering to help Biden but came from a source whose views are considered well outside the mainstream and at times have lacked credibility. The President has also recently decried any suggestion that Russia poses an equally dangerous threat as China as equivalent to the partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him  \u2013 a view that has been factored into the messaging of administration officials, who have focused their public comments on Beijing and downplayed Moscow\u2019s actions, sources told CNN. Monday\u2019s tweet from Trump comes after several of his top national security officials misleadingly suggested there is evidence China is actively interfering in the upcoming US election, according to Sipher, while downplaying what various agencies have characterized as more immediate concerns around Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to meddle in the 2020 presidential race. Schiff accuses Barr of lying over election intelligence National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Friday that he agrees \u201c100%\u201d with Attorney General William Barr\u2019s assertion that China is being more aggressive with its attempts to influence the 2020 election than other malign actors, including Russia, but offered little evidence to back up the claim. \u201cWhat the intelligence community has made very clear,\u201d O\u2019Brien told reporters during a news briefing at the White House on Friday, \u201cfirst you have China, which has the most massive program to influence the United States politically, you have Iran and you have Russia. These are all three adversary countries that are seeking to disrupt our elections.\u201d \u201cSome of them prefer Biden; some people say some of them prefer the President,\u201d he said, notably sounding certain that some are pushing for Biden but casting some level of doubt on whether some are pushing for Trump. \u201cMy position is it doesn\u2019t matter what these countries want, that any country that attempts to interfere with free and fair elections of the United States has to be stopped.\u201d In addition to highlighting the threat posed by China, Barr went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia is again actively interfering in a US election, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Top intelligence office informs congressional committees it'll no longer brief in-person on election security \u201cI accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,\u201d Barr said of Russia. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before.\u201d US intelligence officials and the Senate Intelligence Committee have made bolder assertions warning of the threat Russia poses this year after it hacked the Democrats in 2016 and ran social media influence operations during the 2016 and 2018 elections. \u201cThe threat is ongoing,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who chaired much of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference, said in a statement last month after the panel released the findings of its bipartisan probe. \u201cMy hope is that this report and the Committee\u2019s work will provide the American people with more insight into the threats facing our nation and the steps necessary to stop them.\u201d But the Trump campaign and some Republicans responded to the report with a backward-looking critique and insistence there had been \u201cno collusion,\u201d rather than questioning how American politics may still be vulnerable to foreign disinformation and interference in 2020. That reaction, coupled with recent comments downplaying Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts, have prompted Democrats to accuse the President and his allies of misconstruing what US intelligence shows about the threat of foreign interference ahead of November. Sipher, whose 28-year career at the CIA included a stint running the agency\u2019s Russia operations, called the comments about China from top Trump officials \u201cpure deflection.\u201d Top Democrats demand intelligence chief resume election security briefings to Congress \u201cIf someone says Russia is worse, Republican politicians can point at the larger geopolitical threat from China. True, but not relevant to the issue of election interference. Only one power is trying to subvert the election,\u201d he said. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff went as far as accusing Trump officials like Barr of \u201clying\u201d when saying the intelligence shows China is actively interfering. \u201cIf you look at what the intelligence director Evanina, who runs the National Counterintelligence Center, what he said in his public written statement, he said that Russia was actively interfering, actively engaging across a range of measures to influence the outcome. China had a preference. And if you look at that, you can tell that Bill Barr is just flat-out lying to the American people, and it\u2019s tragic but it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. The California Democrat also said he\u2019s confident he\u2019s seen the same intelligence as Barr and other top officials who have said China is interfering more aggressively than Russia.

            "article_content": "Eighty-one Nobel Prize winners endorsed Joe Biden for president in an open letter on Wednesday, citing the former vice president\u2019s \u201cwillingness to listen to experts\u201d and his \u201cdeep appreciation for using science to find solutions.\u201d The Nobel laureates, winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Medicine and Physics, stressed the importance of elected leaders making decisions based on science, particularly during a global pandemic. \u201cAt no time in our nation\u2019s history has there been a greater need for our leaders to appreciate the value of science in formulating public policy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cDuring his long record of public service, Joe Biden has consistently demonstrated his willingness to listen to experts, his understanding of the value of international collaboration in research and his respect for the contribution that immigrants make to the intellectual life of our country.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The person who organized all of the laureates to endorse Biden is Illinois Democratic Rep. Bill Foster, who is the sole physicist on Capitol Hill, according to a person close to the Nobel Laureate group. More than 180,000 Americans have died from coronavirus, and more than 6 million people in the US have been infected with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump has been heavily criticized for his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic, with critics saying his administration has been too slow to respond to the virus and it hasn\u2019t done enough to protect Americans. Nearly seven in 10 Americans say the US response to\u00a0the coronavirus outbreak\u00a0makes them feel embarrassed, according to a recent CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Sixty-two percent of the public says Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak, and disapproval of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak reached a new high of 58% in the poll. Biden, who has issued blistering criticism of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response, called on Trump to \u201cstop talking and start listening to the medical experts,\u201d in a March interview with CNN. \u201cIn the past, Joe Biden has shown a deep appreciation for using science to find solutions to America\u2019s ailments,\u201d said Harold Varmus, who has served as director of the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute and received the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine. \u201cHis sensible, determined approach to building a cancer research initiative after his son\u2019s death was inspiring. It illustrates the kind of thoughtful leadership that we need to tackle the current global pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe multiple crises facing our country, including one of misinformation, requires a leader with profound admiration for science and truth,\u201d said Roger Kornberg, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in chemistry. \u201cI support Joe Biden\u2019s pro-science agenda and sensible approach to public health decisions. A true leader who will face the truth and be honest with the American people.\u201d The endorsement from the Nobel laureates comes on the heels of a Washington Post report that one of Trump\u2019s top medical advisers was urging the White House to embrace a controversial \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy to combat the pandemic. The approach would mean that many people nationwide would have to get sick with the coronavirus in order to build up a natural immunity across communities, and many could die in the process. White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Scott Atlas explicitly denied that he is pushing a \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy, but an administration official told CNN all of the policies Atlas has pushed for are in the vein of a \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy. View 2020 presidential election polling \u201cNow more than ever, our country needs elected leaders who make decisions based on science,\u201d said Elizabeth Blackburn, the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. \u201cJoe Biden is the strong, compassionate leader we need to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. He\u2019ll listen to the scientific and medical community to create solutions that will finally get us out of this deadly pandemic and improve the health of the American people.\u201d Carol Greider, the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine, said, \u201cOur elected leaders should be making decisions based on facts and science. I strongly endorse Joe Biden because of his commitment to putting public health professionals, not politicians, back in charge.\u201d \u201cI support Joe Biden because of his long record of making policy, informed by science, to deal with large, complicated issues like cancer, climate change and nuclear proliferation,\u201d said Barry Barish, the 2017 Nobel Prize winner in physics. \u201cMore immediately, we absolutely must elect Joe with his science-based approach to successfully lead us out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Biden\u2019s\u00a0plan\u00a0to address the coronavirus pandemic includes offering free testing to all Americans. It\u00a0calls for\u00a0hiring 100,000 people to form a national contact-tracing, and increasing drive-through testing sites. He is also urging Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of protective equipment for health care workers, testing supplies and other items. Biden has said he would mandate that everyone\u00a0wear a mask in public if necessary, and on August 13 called for governors to implement mask mandates for the next three months. His plan includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. The former vice president also said\u00a0he would call Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shortly after being declared the winner of the general election to ask him to remain a member of the White House coronavirus task force.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has found another cause to bang his drum about. He wants college football to come back, after some conferences have delayed their seasons. Trump\u2019s been specifically loud about the lack of football in the Big 10 \u2013 which houses college football powerhouses in key Great Lake battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 while omitting mention of the Pac-12, Mid-American and Mountain West conferences, which have also decided not to play this fall. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling for football to be back, including Big 10. Big 10, get with it. Open up your season, Big 10,\u201d the President said at his Friday rally in New Hampshire. A look at the numbers helps explain why Trump yearns for Big 10 college football to return to these states, but it also reveals why Trump should be careful for what he wishes (i.e. Americans don\u2019t seem to be aching for college life or sports to return to normal). Trump\u2019s path to winning the White House shrinks considerably without winning in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If former Vice President Joe Biden takes the three states and all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he\u2019ll have over 270 electoral votes. Biden would almost certainly win all the Clinton states if he won in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN\u2019s interactive map In order to win the election, Trump knows that he likely needs voters to think that life has returned as much as possible to normal. After all, he\u2019s pretty much blown it in the minds of voters on his handling of the coronavirus. Trump\u2019s approval ratings on the pandemic are around 40% or worse nationally and in states like Wisconsin. Trump probably understands that college football being in full swing is a sign that life is getting back to normal to Midwesterners. According to a 2017 Washington Post poll, 51% of Midwesterners consider themselves fans of college football. That\u2019s more than in the Northeast (30%) and West (36%), and nearly equal to the South (54%). College football being back has the added bonus of being something that appeals to Trump\u2019s base. According to a 2017 study of Google searches and media markets by FiveThirtyEight, college football was the men\u2019s sport most searched for in pro-Trump areas compared to pro-Clinton areas. (Pro basketball, for comparison, was searched most in anti-Trump areas.) A look at the data also shows that a lot of voters do want some sports leagues in action. In a recent CNN/SSRS poll, 63% of Trump supporters think the pro sports leagues should be playing. This is true in the Midwest as well, where 65% of Trump voters said this. Among all voters, pro sports is certainly more popular than Trump, himself, is. The CNN poll found a within the margin of error result for pro sports coming back (48%) to it not (46%). In the Midwest, it was 49% for pro sports to 44% against it. View 2020 presidential election polling But where Trump could be miscalculating is that pro sports may be something different than college sports. Professionals, after all, are paid, while college students currently are not. As Geoffrey Skelley of FiveThirtyEight noted earlier this month, Americans are more apprehensive about starting up the college sports season (including football) than they are professional sports. An average of the polls that have asked about at least delaying college sports shows that a majority of Americans and Midwesterners are for it. That matches how Americans feel about college in general. Last month, a majority of voters (59%), including in the Midwest (51%), said opening colleges would be unsafe in a Quinnipiac University poll. Most Americans either wanted college to not open on-campus learning at all (26%) or with significant changes (48%), according to a July AP-NORC poll. Now, it could absolutely be the case that Trump discussing the issue a lot will bring more voters to his side. But since when did Trump trumpeting an issue make it so that a majority agreed with it? More likely, Trump recognizes that he is trailing in the polls two months out from an election and is looking to see what sticks. Maybe college football will be a good issue for him, but there\u2019s plenty of reason to doubt it.",

            "article_content": "Nearly 7 in 10 Americans say the US response to the coronavirus outbreak makes them feel embarrassed, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, as 62% of the public says President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak. The new poll finds disapproval of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak at a new high, 58%, as the share who say the worst of the pandemic is yet to come has risen to 55% after dropping through the spring. And as the virus has spread from the nation\u2019s cities throughout its countryside, the number who know someone who\u2019s been diagnosed with the virus has jumped dramatically to 67%, up from 40% in early June. And Americans are angry. About 8 in 10 say they are at least somewhat angry about the way things are going in the country today, including an astonishing 51% who say they are very angry. CNN has asked this question in polling periodically since 2008, and the previous high for the share who said they were \u201cvery angry\u201d was 35%, reached in 2008 and 2016. A narrow majority of Americans, 52%, say they are not comfortable returning to their regular routines right now, and in the last two months, this group\u2019s expectations for when they might return to life as it was before the coronavirus have changed dramatically. In June, just 9% overall said they weren\u2019t comfortable now and didn\u2019t think they would be this year. Now, that figure stands at 26%. Two of the most notable markers of resuming regular life \u2013 returning to school and the restart of professional sports \u2013 divide people. Nearly 6 in 10 (57%) say schools in their area should not be open for in-person instruction this fall, while 39% say they should be open. Parents are more apt to say schools should open (47%), but a narrow majority say they should not (52%). This issue is sharply driven by partisanship: 74% of Republicans say their local schools should be open vs. 12% of Democrats. Whether pro sports should continue after disruption to some Major League Baseball games due to outbreaks among the players and staff divides the public about evenly: 49% say they should not be playing games, and 45% say they should. The partisan divisions that have been the hallmark of public opinion on the coronavirus continue in this new poll. Democrats (76%) and independents (58%) are far more likely to say the worst is yet to come in the outbreak than are Republicans (26%), and the poll finds a massive 64-point gap between the percentages of Republicans and Democrats who say they are comfortable returning to their regular routines today (82% among Republicans, 18% among Democrats). Democrats are nearly unanimous in saying they are more embarrassed than proud about the American response to the virus (93% embarrassed, 5% proud), while Republicans are mostly proud (61% say so vs. 33% who are embarrassed). And anger in this election lies more among the backers of former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, than supporters of Trump. In July 2016, 54% of Trump supporters said they were \u201cvery angry\u201d about the way things were going in the US; now, 34% feel that way. Among Biden\u2019s backers, 75% are very angry, up from 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who felt that way. The poll finds a decline in the share of Americans who say they would try to get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine became widely available at a low cost: 56% say they would try to do so now, while 66% felt that way in May. The dip comes across several demographic divides but seems to be concentrated among Trump supporters, 51% of whom said they would seek out a vaccine in May compared with 38% who say the same now. Most Americans, though, are confident that the ongoing trials to develop a coronavirus vaccine are properly balancing speed and safety as they move forward (62% say they are at least somewhat confident, and 37% not too or not at all confident). That includes rare cross-party agreement: 68% of Democrats are confident about that, as are 66% of Republicans. In one positive note for Trump in these findings, his approval rating for handling the economy has ticked up to 51%. But Americans don\u2019t yet see much improvement in the economic downturn caused by th4e coronavirus. In fact, 43% now say the economy is continuing to worsen, up from 36% who felt that way in June. About a quarter (25%) say the economy is beginning to recover and 31% think it has stabilized, no longer worsening but also not yet improving. About half say they are facing financial hardship due to the coronavirus, a figure that has held roughly steady since April. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,108 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 987 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. It is 4.0 points among registered voters.",

            "article_content": "A Florida Republican primary candidate and state party officials are condemning fake text messages and a YouTube video they say spread disinformation as voters headed to the polls Tuesday. The texts, which included a message and video, falsely claimed that Byron Donalds, a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, had dropped out of the race for Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District. Text messages received from at least two numbers said, in part: \u201cHello folks, I\u2019m Byron Donalds, and today I dropped out of Southwest Florida\u2019s race for Congress.\u201d They included a link to a YouTube video, which has since been taken down. It\u2019s unclear how many people received the text messages. \u201cI did NOT drop out of the race,\u201d Donalds tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThis illegal text sent to the whole district is absolutely FALSE and old edited footage from 2012!\u201d Donalds, who describes himself as a \u201cTrump supporting, gun owning, liberty loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man,\u201d is running for the seat left vacant after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney announced last year he would not seek reelection. Donalds was the top fundraiser among the GOP primary field as of July 29, but his campaign was heavily outspent by two opponents, Casey Askar and William Figlesthaler, who both poured significant personal resources into their campaigns. 4 things to watch in Tuesday's primaries in Florida and Wyoming Donalds campaign manager Shawn Frost on Tuesday accused \u201cdesperate opponents\u201d who \u201clobbed a Hail Mary\u201d of being behind the texts. \u201cThis has all the hallmarks of a Jeff Roe production, who is Casey Askar\u2019s consultant,\u201d said Frost, without offering any evidence. \u201cI say that because in 2016 in the Iowa caucuses, there was a rumor put out that Ben Carson had dropped from the campaign by Ted Cruz\u2019s consultant. Ted Cruz\u2019s consultant was Jeff Roe.\u201d Roe denied any involvement, telling CNN by phone that he, the campaign and his employees did not send the text. \u201cHe has just run a tremendously dirty campaign,\u201d Frost said of Askar. Askar campaign spokesperson Kristin Davison also told CNN the text message did not come from their campaign or Roe,saying, \u201cIt is 100% false.\u201d Davison, who working on the campaign as part of Axiom Strategies, which was founded by Roe, suggested the text message may have come from the Donalds campaign or another rival campaign. CNN was able to trace the two numbers back to a company named Twilio, which allows its clients to utilize computer programming to make and receive phone calls, and to send and receive texts. Twilio\u2019s director of corporate communications, Cris Paden, confirmed its services had been used after CNN notified the company of the incident. \u201cTwilio can confirm that two of our phone numbers \u2013 432-287-1621 and 772-794-8439 \u2013 were used,\u201d Paden said. \u201cTwilio takes this very seriously and is giving this the highest priority to identify the full scope of the situation and take appropriate action.\u201d Paden said the company is investigating the incident and that the two numbers have now been suspended. After CNN contacted YouTube about the video, YouTube spokesperson Alex Joseph said the Google-owned company removed it and terminated the channel for violating its community guidelines. Florida\u2019s Republican Party was alerted to the texts by the Donalds campaign and media reports. Ben Gibson, the party\u2019s general counsel, declined to say whether the party agrees with Frost\u2019s accusation. \u201cIt just looks like a dirty campaign tactic that\u2019s really unfortunate,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cTo have something like this dropped on you on election day is concerning.\u201d Gibson said the party condemned the fake texts but that any potential investigation by law enforcement would be the campaign\u2019s call. Frost told CNN that the Donalds campaign would look into such an investigation, but that Tuesday they were focused on correcting the record and the vote. \u201cThat certainly will be part of our future going forward no matter how this turns out, because this is unacceptable,\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe have to stop these dirty campaign tactics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In Florida, Republican Rep. Ross Spano could be in danger of losing his seat on Tuesday as he fights to ward off a primary challenge. The results of another GOP primary in the Sunshine State will solidify who will take on Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell this fall in a battleground district that flipped from red to blue in 2018. Meanwhile, in Wyoming, former Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis is eyeing a political comeback as she competes in a primary to win the GOP nomination for an open Senate seat. Those are a few of the key things to watch in House and Senate primary elections Tuesday with contests taking place in Florida, Wyoming and Alaska. Spano, an embattled freshman, is facing a primary race in Florida\u2019s 15th Congressional District against challenger Scott Franklin, the Lakeland City Commissioner. Spano has been embroiled in ethics issues during his first term in office, which has created an opening for attacks from his opponent. Last November, Spano said that he planned to \u201ccooperate fully with the Justice Department,\u201d after the House Ethics committee announced that at the request of the department it would defer a review into allegations that Spano may have received improper loans in excess of federal campaign contribution limits. Spano said at the time, \u201cwe acknowledged that mistakes were made with respect to the campaign loans, but those mistakes were completely inadvertent and unintentional,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are confident that upon review, the Justice Department will see it that way, too.\u201d Franklin has seized on the issue, with one campaign ad superimposing the word CRIMINAL in all capital letters over an image of Spano. Another ad says via voiceover, \u201cWhether Spano is incompetent or corrupt, he shouldn\u2019t be your congressman.\u201d Spano, meanwhile, has campaigned as a \u201cstaunch Trump ally\u201d and his campaign has accused Franklin of not being a true conservative. The Club for Growth\u2019s political arm has also been on the air defending Spano and attacking Franklin. The congressman has a significant fundraising advantage over his opponent. Spano had raised over $1 million as of July 29, while Franklin had raised $237,000 and loaned his campaign $350,000, by that same date, according to FEC data. Spano has also been endorsed by the top three House Republican leaders: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and House GOP conference chair Liz Cheney. Franklin\u2019s campaign has been bolstered by the endorsement of one of Spano\u2019s own House Republican colleagues: GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who represents the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District. In a video announcement, Gaetz said that \u201cScott\u2019s the right person to ensure that President Trump has the strongest possible campaign in the state of Florida.\u201d If Spano makes it past the primary, he may face a competitive race in the fall. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the 15th District as Lean Republican. A primary election Tuesday will determine who will take on Mucarsel-Powell, a freshman, in what is expected to be a competitive general election race. Miami-Dade county mayor Carlos Gimenez, who has had a prominent platform during the coronavirus crisis, is viewed as the heavy favorite in the GOP primary for the 26th district. Mucarsel-Powell flipped the seat in 2018 after taking on GOP incumbent Carlos Curbelo in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton by 16 points. Gimenez has raised over $1.1 million as of July 29, but the incumbent Democrat has raised considerably more with a haul of close to $4 million by the same date, according to FEC data. Gonzales rates the 26th District as Tilt Democratic \u2013 and it\u2019s one of the few races where recent ratings changes have shifted in the GOP\u2019s favor. Cynthia Lummis, who represented Wyoming\u2019s at-large House seat from 2009 until 2017, is on the ballot on Tuesday in a GOP primary for the Senate race to fill the seat vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Mike Enzi. Lummis, who was the only woman in the House Freedom Caucus during her time in Congress, is competing against a crowded field of Republican candidates, but leads the field in both name recognition and fundraising. Lummis also boasts a long list of endorsements, including from Trump and Wyoming GOP Sens. Enzi and John Barrasso. If she wins the primary, she would be well positioned to pick up the Senate seat in the deep red state in the fall. A victory for Lummis in the fall would add to the ranks of Republican female senators, whose numbers are at risk of falling with four of the conference\u2019s nine women considered vulnerable in 2020. Another race to watch Tuesday is the GOP primary in Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District, a safe seat that has the potential to deliver some diversity to the overwhelmingly White GOP House conference. Byron Donalds, a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, describes himself as a \u201cTrump supporting, gun owning, liberty loving, pro-life, politically incorrect Black man.\u201d If he were to win the nomination in this seat, which Gonzales rates Solid Republican, he would be well-positioned to win in the fall. That would be significant given that there is only one Black Republican currently serving in the House \u2013 Rep. Will Hurd of Texas \u2013 who is not running for reelection. Donalds has been endorsed by the Club for Growth PAC. He was the top fundraiser among the GOP primary field as of July 29, but his campaign was heavily outspent by two opponents, Casey Askar and William Figlesthaler, who both poured significant personal resources into their campaigns. This district is open after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney announced last year he would not seek reelection.",

            "article_content": "On Wednesday morning, the President of the United States tweeted congratulations to a Republican candidate who won a congressional runoff in Georgia on Tuesday. \u201cCongratulations to future Republican Star Marjorie Taylor Greene on a big Congressional primary win in Georgia against a very tough and smart opponent,\u201d wrote Donald Trump. \u201cMarjorie is strong on everything and never gives up - a real WINNER!\u201d Who, you ask, is Marjorie Taylor Greene? Well, aside from being the near-certain next member of Congress in Georgia\u2019s strongly Republican 14th District, she is a public supporter of the QAnon movement \u2013 a broad-scale conspiracy theory that sprung to life in early 2017 and is based on a belief that there is a high-level government official, \u201cQ,\u201d who sprinkles clues on internet message boards about a series of massive \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies at work in the country. (The FBI has said QAnon is a potential domestic terrorism threat.) \u201cQ is a patriot,\u201d Greene said in a nearly 30-minute long video from 2017. She called the conspiracy theory \u201csomething worth listening to and paying attention to,\u201d adding: \u201cHe is someone that very much loves his country, and he\u2019s on the same page as us, and he is very pro-Trump.\u201d In short: Greene is set to be the first QAnon congresswoman. And now she has the very public backing of Trump. If all of this doesn\u2019t concern you, it should. And for a Republican Party in Washington already worrying about what its decision to capitulate to Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP will mean for the future, Greene\u2019s victory is the worst nightmare come true. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of just some of the things Greene has said: * \u201cShe\u2019s a hypocrite. She\u2019s anti-American. And we\u2019re going to kick that b*tch out of Congress.\u201d \u2013 Greene on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California) at her victory party Tuesday night. * Said African Americans are \u201cheld slaves to the Democratic Party.\u201d * Called George Soros a Nazi. * Referred to the election of two Muslim members of Congress in 2018 as the start of a \u201cMuslim invasion.\u201d * Tweeted in the wake of a Washington Post story about her lead in the June primary: \u201cThe Chinese propagandists at the Washington Post are attacking me the same way they attack Donald Trump, and other conservatives.\u201d And that\u2019s entirely apart from her public support of QAnon! Which is a baseless conspiracy theory that believes, among other things, that Trump was recruited by the military to run for president in 2016 because he alone wasn\u2019t beholden to the secret power brokers of the world, and could break the hold that they have on American society. And that \u201cQ\u201d continues to signal that the likes of Hillary Clinton will be rounded up in a mass arrest for alleged crimes against society. While QAnon is not responsible for the Pizzagate conspiracy \u2013 the appalling and incorrect idea that Clinton and her cronies were involved in a pedophilia ring at a pizza shop in Northwest Washington \u2013 there\u2019s considerable overlap among the two belief groups. Including, it appears, Greene. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about that now there\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it,\u201d she said in 2017. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! This \u2013 all of this \u2013 is what Trump embraced on Wednesday morning \u2013 even though the top two leaders of the Republican Party in the House had distanced themselves from Greene following the revelations about her xenophobic and racist comments. This, all of this, is what Trump praised as \u201cstrong on everything\u201d and a \u201creal WINNER.\u201d Why? Because Trump himself loves conspiracy theories. His candidacy for president was rooted in one \u2013 the false idea that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. He has pushed any number of conspiracy theories in office \u2013 from the debunked notion that Obama orchestrated a campaign to spy on him during the 2016 campaign to the idea that Democrats inflated the death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to an unfounded allegation that 3 to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. (For a more fulsome list of Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories, check this out.) While Trump has never fully embraced the QAnon movement, he has retweeted LOTS of QAnon-linked accounts \u2013 and supporters of the movement are forever sifting through his tweets and public pronouncements for evidence that he is sending signals to them about the timing of the planned arrest of high-level Democrats for their role in some sort of massive conspiracy. His embrace of Greene is the most prominent move by Trump to show support for the QAnon movement, however.  While it\u2019s not entirely clear that Trump knows the details of the Q movement (or Greene\u2019s other beliefs), it really doesn\u2019t matter. The President of the United States \u2013 as he has done throughout his time in office \u2013 has given coverage and encouragement to belief system way out of the mainstream. Not only that, he has welcomed these fringe candidates and groups to align with the Republican Party. And Greene won\u2019t be the last of the Q class infiltrating the Washington Republican class. In another show of momentum for the movement, Oregon Republicans nominated a Senate candidate who has spoken glowingly of Q. Lauren Boebert, who beat Colorado Rep. Scott Tipton in a Republican primary last month in a district Trump won handily in 2016, said this during the primary campaign: \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve heard of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means America is getting stronger and better.\u201d Donald Trump has seeded this soil. Now the broader Republican Party will have to deal with what lies beneath.",

            "article_content": "More pillars are fast crumbling in President Donald Trump\u2019s frantic and lie-strewn attempt to convince Americans the nation is back to normal before the election, with chaos already afflicting the return to school and a rite of fall \u2013 college football \u2013 on the brink. Trump\u2019s false insistence that children are \u201cimmune\u201d from the coronavirus and can\u2019t spread it is being undermined by new figures showing that nearly 100,000 kids tested positive for the virus in the last two weeks of July. And some of the first schools that are following his calls to fully reopen are being hit by new viral outbreaks almost as soon as classes begin. The President, in demanding a return to class and for college football to kick off, is making education and collegiate sports the latest area of American life to be contaminated by his false narratives about the pandemic. Almost all of his assurances about the crisis \u2013 which have tended to minimize its impact and ignore science \u2013 have proven to be wrong. First Trump said the pandemic would not take hold of the United States, but it did. Then he said it would simply disappear and it didn\u2019t. Then the President said it was safe to open state economies before the pathogen was fully under control \u2013 steps which helped cause a viral eruption across southern and western states. He\u2019s argued against all the principles of epidemiology that testing doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 even though nations that have done better than the US have used that route to get the virus under control. Last week, Trump said that there might be a vaccine before Election Day in another self-serving political comment. Now firms developing the inoculation and experts say that\u2019s likely impossible. Instead of taking the worst public health crisis in 100 years seriously and working with fact-based and scientific approaches, Trump has devoted his energy and that of the White House to arguing that a response that is clearly disastrous is a glowing success. He\u2019s spent weeks peddling non-cures and portraying the economy in the midst of a \u201cboom\u201d \u2013 even though millions of Americans remain unemployed. But nearly six months into America\u2019s battle with the pandemic, the country has a staggering one-quarter of all the world\u2019s 20 million coronavirus cases. Thousands of Americans are dying every week and there are alarming new signs of further spread of the disease in the Midwest, California, Texas and some northeastern cities, even as there are some limited signs of encouragement, in lower infections in Florida for instance. Yet Trump did what he always did Monday as he identified a preferred outcome \u2013 opening schools and playing college sports \u2013 without providing any evidence that it was safe in a virus-bedeviled nation or a plan got get back to normal. Instead he painted a rosy, fantastical notion that the nightmare is all but over. \u201cAt the end of a fairly short period of time, you are going to be in very, very good shape all over our country,\u201d he said in a meandering briefing that cherry-picked statistics and was packed with misinformation and nonsensical arguments. These are the states requiring people to wear masks when out in public Problems with the return to school and meetings of college football chiefs that could lead to the season being canceled will further fracture the President\u2019s attempts to convince voters that he has led the way out of the viral storm. They will also hamper his efforts to distract from his mishandling of the pandemic that has suppressed his approval ratings less than three months before he asks voters for a second term. Many US school districts and colleges across the country have defied the President\u2019s advice to reopen and are beginning semesters online, raising the prospect of many months more at home for schoolkids, amid growing concern among parents. The President\u2019s claims that it is safe for every kid to go back to class are being challenged by a new report published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association that found that more than 97,000 children tested positive for the coronavirus in the last two weeks of July. The study showed a 40% increase in child coronavirus cases in states and cities during those two weeks. While children are far less likely to suffer complications from the virus, some have died. And the report will fuel fears that children could make teachers sick, will carry the virus home from school and infect their parents and other relatives and that schools could turn into super spreader locations. Asked about the study, Trump again insisted that since most children didn\u2019t get seriously ill it was fine to open schools and without evidence said children do not transmit the virus to other people. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny fraction of death, a tiny fraction and they get better quickly,\u201d Trump said in the White House Briefing Room. \u201cThey may have it for a short period of time. For the most part they do very well. According to the people I have spoken to they don\u2019t transport it or transfer it to other people very easily. I think schools have to open. It\u2019s a very important thing for the economy to get schools going,\u201d he claimed. But Dr. Leana Wen, a CNN medical analyst and an emergency room physician at George Washington University Hospital, said the study showed that it would be impossible to safely open schools in districts where the virus had not been properly suppressed. \u201cImagine if these 97,000 children were all in school. Imagine how many outbreaks there could be,\u201d Wen told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. \u201cThe lesson to take away here is that you cannot keep a school safe from coronavirus if the community is a hotbed of infection. There is just no way.\u201d There are already signs, in the minority of schools and districts that have already started in-person learning, of trouble ahead. At least nine of 12 county public school systems in Florida are planning to reopen this week in areas that have a coronavirus testing positivity rate of over 5%, according to Mark Richard, Florida Education Association Attorney. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield said last month that officials in counties with a positivity rate higher than 5% might consider keeping schools closed. New York City, which is planning to reopen its schools in an in-person/blended system had by contrast a positivity rate of 1% on Monday. In Georgia meanwhile, at least 826 students and 42 staff are under quarantine after multiple positive tests in the first week of school in an Atlanta suburb. And in Mississippi, 22 schools are reporting Covid-19 cases. The cases do not necessarily make an iron clad case for keeping all schools closed for the months and even years that it might take to conquer the virus. Parents are desperate for kids to go back to school. The prolonged closures have had a devastating educational and psychological impact on America\u2019s kids. Many low-income students rely on schools for their only nutritious meals. And Trump is right in the sense that the economy cannot fully recover if millions of parents lack child care with schools still out. But the early problems with the return to classes show that arrangements are often chaotic and expose the lack of a national approach to schooling that Trump and his government could have overseen if they were serious about governing. The CDC did put out national guidelines for safe schooling \u2013 but they were heavily criticized as too draconian by the President. Trump calls on college football games to resume amid coronavirus pandemic There were hardening indications also on Monday that the 2020-21 college football season will not take place \u2013 at least according to its traditional fall calendar. Leaders from the top five conferences in college sports have discussed calling off the season and other fall sports, according to reports from multiple sports news outlets including ESPN, Sports Illustrated and CBS. No decision has so far been reached. But the loss of big-time college football would deal another devastating blow to Trump\u2019s claims that regular life is returning or that the pandemic is relenting. College athletes are by definition students and are harder to quarantine than professional athletes paid high salaries for their troubles. Two major pro sports, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, have successfully relaunched their suspended seasons in bio-secure \u201cbubbles\u201d in Florida and Canada respectively. But Major League baseball has had to cancel multiple games after ballplayers \u2013 traveling from series to series in the traditional manner tested positive for Covid-19. A bubble for college football, with its huge squads and coaching entourages, is impractical and it is almost impossible to envisage how the season can go ahead in any recognizable even in empty stadiums. Yet Trump appears desperate for the games to go ahead \u2014 even if he is characteristically ignoring the consequences of playing on and is not providing any scientifically based suggestions for how to keep players and coaches safe. \u201cThe student-athletes have been working too hard for their season to be cancelled. #WeWantToPlay,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon. In fact, if the college season cannot go ahead, Trump\u2019s failure as President to put in place an effective campaign against the pandemic \u2013 including saturation testing and tracing and his resistance to tough measures to stop the spread of the disease \u2013 will be a major reason why.",

            "article_content": "Bill Hagerty, President Donald Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Japan, has won the Senate Republican primary in Tennessee on Thursday, CNN projects. Last year, Trump publicly endorsed Hagerty before he even announced his campaign. That should\u2019ve been enough in a conservative state where Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the President. But the primary election on Thursday to replace retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander turned into a bitter, competitive contest between Hagerty and Dr. Manny Sethi over who could be Tennessee\u2019s Trump. Hagerty and Sethi campaigned as Trump loyalists, even though they found things in each other\u2019s backgrounds to try to suggest otherwise. Hagerty founded a private equity firm and served as the state\u2019s economic commissioner under former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam. Sethi, the son of first-generation immigrants from India, is an orthopedic trauma surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who founded the nonprofit organization Healthy Tennessee. Trump himself intervened in the primary, reminding voters of his endorsement in a tweet last week and agreeing to a tele-town hall with Hagerty on the eve of the primary. Hagerty thanked Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn for their support after his primary victory. \u201cNow more than ever, we need strong conservative Senators who will not kowtow to the angry liberal mob that is tearing apart the fabric of the America we love. President Trump won\u2019t stand for it, and neither will I,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday night. The divisive race extended to the Senate Republican conference. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky stumped for Sethi. And the Protect Freedom PAC, a group aligned with Paul, spent over $1.2 million on ads supporting him. In one spot, Paul said directly to the camera, \u201cTennessee is too conservative a state to keep sending Democrats in Republican clothing to represent Tennessee.\u201d Blackburn and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took Hagerty\u2019s side at campaign rallies, saying he will stand with Trump. \u201cBill is pro-life, he is pro-gun, he is pro-family, he is pro-small business and he is pro-conservative values,\u201d Blackburn said in a recent video posted on Twitter. The race tightened in recent weeks. Of the 15 Republican candidates, Hagerty spent by far the most on advertising, buying over $5 million worth of airtime, according to Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. He spent most of that campaign cash since the beginning of June. Sethi spent over $2.6 million and Dr. George Flinn, another GOP candidate, spent over $1.5 million. Tom Ingram, a longtime Tennessee Republican strategist, told CNN on Wednesday, \u201cThe best I can tell is it\u2019s too close to call.\u201d Hagerty will now be favored to win the seat in November; Tennessee is a deep-red state that Trump carried by 26 points in 2016. In the Democratic primary, Marquita Bradshaw, a Black community organizer and single mom whose campaign raised less than $10,000, won in an upset, beating attorney and former Army helicopter pilot James Mackler, who raised more than $2 million and was backed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. While the Senate GOP nominee hopes to succeed Alexander, a workhorse legislator who left a leadership position to focus on education and health care policy, the race turned into a series of personal attacks. Hagerty and Sethi spent much of two recent separate interviews with CNN sharply criticizing each other. Hagerty called Sethi a \u201cphony conservative\u201d who supported Trump only when it was \u201cconvenient.\u201d Sethi tagged Hagerty as a \u201cMitt Romney Republican,\u201d trying to use Hagerty\u2019s decades-long friendship and campaigning for the former GOP presidential nominee against him. Hagerty defended himself from associations with the Utah senator and Trump critic, criticizing Romney for marching with Black Lives Matter protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got senators like Mitt Romney, who, frankly, have lost their way,\u201d Hagerty said. Hagerty also attacked Sethi for making a $50 donation to a family friend through the online campaign donation portal ActBlue, for receiving a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant and for applying for a nonpartisan White House fellowship during the Obama administration to portray his opponent as a Democrat who supports gun control and former President Barack Obama. Sethi responded that the charges were desperate attacks from a \u201cWashington insider.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in deep trouble, and they know it,\u201d Sethi said. He had tried to mar Hagerty\u2019s conservative bona fides, suggesting that Hagerty was a fan of the Black Lives Matter movement after a brokerage firm whose board he served on expressed support for it. Hagerty subsequently resigned from the board and told CNN that Black Lives Matter is \u201ca Marxist organization\u201d that is \u201cagainst the nuclear family\u201d and \u201canti-Semitic.\u201d But despite the sparring between them, there may not have been much politically different between the two leading candidates. \u201cBoth candidates are not very well-known, and they have battled over who is \u2018too liberal\u2019 for Tennessee,\u201d Vanderbilt University political science professor John Geer, the dean of the College of Arts and Science, told CNN ahead of the primary. \u201cThe truth is, both are conservative and there is little difference between them other than Sethi being more of an outsider.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s barrage of challenges to the reputation, structures and traditions of elections is conjuring up a contentious and potentially constitutionally critical three-month period for America\u2019s democracy. Trump is casting false accusations of massive fraud in mail-in voting, though has now reversed his position on the practice in must-win Florida, leaving the absurd impression it\u2019s only fair in states with Republican governors. \u201cI\u2019m doing our country a big favor by bringing it up, and you know, from a common sense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure basic beautiful intelligence \u2013 you know it can\u2019t work,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. Trump has baselessly claimed that the result of the November 3 vote will not be known for \u201cyears\u201d \u2013 apparently seeking to discredit in advance an election that polls suggest he is currently losing to Democrat Joe Biden. His campaign has now also initiated a new attempt to wring advantage from the customary arrangements for three presidential debates. It wants a fourth encounter added and for the clashes to start before the scheduled date of September 29, to take into account early voting that starts in some key states six weeks before the election. \u201cMove the First Debate up,\u201d Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. This request makes a fair point and is well within traditional parameters of jockeying for position over debates conducted by past presidential campaigns. But Trump\u2019s comment in his tweet that the debates are a \u201cpublic service\u201d is undermined by his campaign\u2019s evidence-free claims that Biden is running away from debating him at all. And the campaign also submitted a list of potential moderators, including Fox News hosts, conservative commentators who\u2019ve given him easy interviews, and opinion journalists who have published work supportive of his presidency. Now the President says he may deliver his speech to the virtual Republican National Convention from the South Lawn of the White House, obliterating the tradition of presidents seeking to safeguard their office from politicization. Some of these steps, like trying to shape the conditions of mail-in voting, are not necessarily sinister and fall more into the category of legal challenges frequently made by both parties to win advantage within the structure of elections. But others come across as the actions of a campaign that believes its own claims it is winning. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Demanding more debates \u2013 as Trump is doing \u2013 is a time-honored tactic of a trailing candidate needing a game-changer. The upshot of Trump\u2019s complaints on mail-in voting often appears to be an attempt to limit the number of people can vote \u2013 when they may fear showing up to a polling place during a pandemic exacerbated by his own mistakes. There is also a key attempt by the Trump campaign to lay the groundwork for legal and political challenges that could discredit Biden\u2019s victory if he wins and to give Trump\u2019s ego an out if voters reject him. None of this is surprising. After all, the President made inaccurate claims of massive voter fraud in the popular vote in the election that he won in 2016. The evidence in the impeachment trial strongly suggested that the President used his power in an attempt to coerce a foreign power into interfering in the election based on false claims of corruption against Biden. And as President, Trump has relentlessly attacked institutions that have held him to account and countered his false narratives, including the courts, the press, US intelligence agencies and independent government watchdogs. Casting doubt on election institutions is consistent with his normal behavior. For his entire life in business before he entered politics, Trump bent rules, laws, traditions and ethics. His willingness to do so now signals that he is prepared to do anything within his power to win the election. And it suggests that he\u2019s also willing to drag the country through a corrosive period of legal and political brinkmanship if the election is close. If he loses power in such circumstances, Trump\u2019s tactics could sow a sense of grievance and disenfranchisement among his voters that would shatter his successors\u2019 attempts to forge unity and could damage US democracy for years ahead. In apparent reversal, Trump encourages Floridians to vote by mail The President introduced a new caveat to his opposition to mail-in voting on Wednesday that may reflect concern among Republicans that he risks suppressing his own vote in several tight swing states. If the system is up and running in a state with a Republican, and presumably pro-Trump governor, it\u2019s fine. Elsewhere, it\u2019s mired in fraud. \u201cIn Florida, they\u2019ve done a very good job with it. In Nevada, it would be a disaster. In New York, it\u2019s been a disaster. In many other places, it\u2019s been a total catastrophe,\u201d Trump claimed on Wednesday in one of those rare flashes of candor that perfectly reveals his true motives. Arizona\u2019s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey walked a fine line when he met Trump at the White House. \u201cIn Arizona, we\u2019re going to do it right. It will be free and fair. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to cheat. And it will be easy to vote,\u201d he said, noting that 78% of Grand Canyon Staters already voted by mail. But he also warned: \u201cThis is no time to experiment. This is a time to go with the tried and true, and in Arizona, our system works very well.\u201d The President has made multiple false claims about fraud in mail-in voting. He has warned that the process is vulnerable to forgery and that ballots will be illegally printed and fraudulently signed and that foreign powers will find it easy to inject millions of false voting papers into the system. US intelligence officials last week discounted the possibility that foreign nations could flood the election with fake ballots. There is little evidence that mail-in voting is any more susceptible to fraud than any other kind of voting. And irregularities remain exceedingly rare in US elections, according to multiple academic studies. View 2020 presidential election polling Trump also makes a flawed distinction between absentee ballots and mail-in ballots. And he claimed on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Wednesday for instance that in Nevada \u201canybody that ever walked\u201d will get a ballot. That\u2019s not true  \u2013 the state plans to send out ballots to all active registered voters who can only be adult citizens of the United States. The President is making claims of fraud in New York primary elections in which counting has been slow. But there\u2019s no evidence there\u2019s cheating. Like all the conspiracy theories that he\u2019s advanced in office, it doesn\u2019t matter from his point of view if he is being truthful. Trump\u2019s goal is to create uncertainty and doubt among voters about the election in order to advance his political goals and destroy any objective view of reality. If the President was really concerned about the efficiency of the election machinery, he could do something about it. Instead, it has been congressional Democrats along with a few Republicans who have pushed to increase funding for the election in stimulus bills. The President has tweeted that there is no way that the Post Office could \u201chandle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation.\u201d But the agency said in a statement on Monday that it had \u201cample\u201d capacity to meet projected election demand. The appointment of a Trump loyalist, Louis DeJoy, to head the agency was a warning flare for Democrats. A slowing of delivery times by new procedures has sparked so far unproven accusations of a deliberate effort to delay the distribution of mail-in ballots. And Trump has resisted efforts to offer more funding to the USPS, with which he has held a long-term grudge. Trump campaign calls for a fourth presidential debate, citing early voting Trump, as he trails Biden in most polls, has a strong incentive to maximize the televised chances for him to goad his opponent into a disastrous mistake. His campaign on Wednesday asked the Commission on Presidential Debates for a fourth encounter \u2013 in a legitimate attempt to press for changes. But its motives are questionable since pro-Trump figures on conservative media have launched a baseless campaign to portray Biden as running away from debates. \u201cJoe Biden will be there. We await Donald Trump\u2019s decision \u2013 and perhaps the president should put as much time into managing COVID as does into this,\u201d Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement on Wednesday. Campaigns often squabble about moderators. But the Trump campaign is again pushing boundaries. On Wednesday, the President\u2019s camp released a list of suggested moderators including down-the-line journalists such as Norah O\u2019Donnell and Major Garrett of CBS. But it also featured several Fox anchors known for friendly treatment of the President, such as Maria Bartiromo and radio host Hugh Hewitt, who just penned a strongly pro-Trump op-ed in The Washington Post. This gambit prepared the way to falsely paint other potential mainstream moderators who have exposed Trump\u2019s lies as biased \u2013 and to therefore lessen the possibility the President will be held accountable in debates. Once, again, as with the campaign against mail-in voting, and the potential use of the people\u2019s house \u2013 the White House \u2013 as a political backdrop, the Trump campaign appears to be pushing for advantage outside reasonable limits. There is a clear attempt to erode the arrangements that have guaranteed a peaceful transfer of power for generations, and to offer him a way out should his own hyperbolic predictions of success not materialize.",

            "article_content": "On the day the US surpassed another tragic milestone \u2013 150,000 coronavirus deaths \u2013 it became ever clearer that pseudo-science, ideological posturing and mocking the idea of a national strategy are no way to fight a deadly pandemic. Yet President Donald Trump, his friends in Congress, members of his Cabinet, senior staff and supporters are still setting out to undermine the fact-based approaches that might get the virus under control and restore normal life. Trump headed to Texas, currently a massive coronavirus hotspot, on a distraction mission, enjoying a photo op at an oil rig after another episode of his traveling medicine show promoting hydroxychloroquine. \u201cAll I want to do is save lives,\u201d Trump said of a drug that his own government regulators say is not an effective cure for Covid-19. But he was not accompanied on his trip by Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, who discovered before getting aboard Air Force One that he had Covid-19. The congressman tested positive for coronavirus Wednesday morning during a pre-flight screening at the White House. Gohmert has ostentatiously avoided wearing a mask. And he used his diagnosis \u2013 thanks to that White House test \u2013 to further trash science and undermine government medical advice by misleadingly suggesting his recent use of a face covering may have gotten him sick. Another Trump acolyte, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, who works within yards of the Oval Office in Trump\u2019s mask-free West Wing, found that he had Covid-19 late last week. Former White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson, now a Trump-style congressional candidate, was seen in Texas heading to greet the President on Wednesday also without wearing a mask. Until there is a vaccine, government health experts say wearing a mask and social distancing are crucial to slowing the spread of the disease. Republican senators, meanwhile, pressed ahead with their effort to reduce unemployment benefits in an effort to force people back to work to fire up the economy Trump needs to win reelection. Democrats want to extend benefits at their full value of $600 a week, arguing that many Americans are worried about getting back on the job with the virus wave still breaking across the country. And Trump\u2019s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos dismissed calls for the Trump administration to release a national plan aimed at opening schools, saying there was no place for such federal power flexing. But she still used her national platform to demand that all schools open even though the virus still rages in multiple hot zones. \u201cThere\u2019s not a national superintendent nor should there be, therefore there\u2019s not a national plan for reopening,\u201d DeVos said during a trip to North Carolina with Vice President Mike Pence. She praised a local private school for its reopening plans. Such institutions typically have smaller classes and more resources than public schools which often cram 30 or more kids in a classroom. Trump ally Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, defended his own decision to reopen schools, ignoring the fact that his state just posted another daily record for Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday. The President is also exacerbating political tensions caused by the pandemic by escalating his effort to make an election that he so far seems to be losing appear illegitimate in the minds of millions of Americans. In his latest assault on mail-in voting, Trump floated the idea of a delay in November\u2019s election. He does not have the power to order such a step \u2013 election dates are the preserve of Congress. But the tweet marked a fresh strike at the traditions and norms of US governance \u2013 a constant trend during his administration. As US passes 150,000 coronavirus deaths, group warns of hundreds of thousands more without action Criticism of those who are brazenly dismissing science, playing down the impact of the virus and calling for an end to lockdowns come what may is not partisan, although most taking such positions tend to be Republicans and close to Trump\u2019s orbit. Rather it is rooted in the fact that months into the pandemic, skeptics, including those with ultimate power, are still ignoring or undercutting the few proven tools, such as mask wearing and social distancing, that could help to quell it. This despite the fact that the impact of such behavior is clear. Trump\u2019s fierce pressure on states to open before they had the virus under control helped unleash a wave of new infections across the sunbelt that caused tens of thousands of infections and likely thousands of unnecessary deaths. Another painful consequence of premature openings emerged on Thursday when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the beginnings of a post-lockdown economic rebound had been stalled by the virus. \u201cThe pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June,\u201d Powell said. \u201cOn balance it looks like the data are pointing to the slowing in pace in the recovery.\u201d Ironically, had Trump leaned on states to adopt US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on safe reopening, rather than goading a swift comeback, he would have been in a far better political position than he is now, with polls showing plunging public confidence in his leadership. As it is, scientific experts are warning that his current approach could lead to an even more sweeping disaster. The Association of American Medical Colleges said Wednesday that if the nation does not change its course \u2013 and soon \u2013 deaths in the United States could be well into the \u201cmultiple hundreds of thousands.\u201d And scholars at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security in a new report warned that federal leadership was badly needed and called for universal mask mandates and stay-at-home orders in the hardest hit states. \u201cUnlike many countries in the world, the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt is time to reset.\u201d Some doctors met with Pence after their group's video was removed for misleading info The President\u2019s efforts at revived White House briefings to improve his standing by showing Americans he has a plan to beat the pandemic have come unstuck because of his indiscipline and conspiratorial mindset. On Tuesday, Trump went out of his way to promote hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that robust clinical studies say is ineffective in treating Covid-19 but is a favorite on pro-Trump conservative media. He defended himself for retweeting videos in which a group of doctors promoted by Tea Party Patriots made false claims about hydroxychloroquine and suggested that mask wearing is not necessary. He specifically defended Dr. Stella Immanuel, a little-known physician from Houston, who has among other things, claimed that sex with \u201ctormenting spirits\u201d is responsible for gynecological problems, miscarriages and impotence. \u201cI was very impressed with her and other doctors that stood with her. I think she made sense, but I know nothing about her,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCertainly you can put her up and let her have a voice.\u201d Trump\u2019s deliberate perpetuating of disinformation from the nation\u2019s most visible platform forced the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, to issue another plea for Americans to trust fact-based science. \u201cI\u2019m very explicit and unambiguous when we say we\u2019ve got to follow the science. If a study that\u2019s a good study comes out and shows efficacy and safety for hydroxychloroquine or any other drug that we do \u2013 if you do it in the right way \u2013 you accept the scientific data,\u201d Fauci said on MSNBC. \u201cBut right now today, the cumulative scientific data that has been put together and done over a number of different studies has shown no efficacy.\u201d Louie Gohmert, who's refused to wear a mask, tests positive for Covid-19 Gohmert only found out about his diagnosis when he showed up at the White House for a coronavirus test before he was due to fly to his home state with Trump. It was the latest occasion when the comprehensive testing system set up to protect Trump spared the President from exposure. But the delays in turning around tests \u2013 in the absence of an effective national coronavirus testing structure \u2013 most Americans lack similar protection. The news about Gohmert quickly caused uproar on Capitol Hill, where the congressman has been one of many Republicans ostentatiously flouting mask wearing guidelines to make a political statement of support for Trump. Rather than use his own, asymptomatic case, to highlight the dangers of not observing social distancing \u2013 he was seen alongside Attorney General William Barr on Capitol Hill on Tuesday \u2013 Gohmert sought to bolster the denial and politicization that has helped lead to 150,000 deaths. \u201cI don\u2019t know about everybody, when I have a mask on I\u2019m moving it to make it comfortable and I can\u2019t help but wonder if that you know puts some germs in the mask,\u201d Gohmert told his constituents in a video message. Such signs that leaders are still not taking the pandemic sufficiently seriously are why many medical researchers are pessimistic. Dr. Ross McKinney Jr., the chief scientific officer of the AAMC, which issued its warning of \u201cmultiple hundreds of thousands\u201d of US deaths, called for a national change of course. \u201cWe\u2019re 150,000 now, we have a lot of states where the epidemic is currently out of control,\u201d McKinney told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. \u201cAnd we\u2019re starting to see some of the states that were in between \u2026 where there is a drastic, rapid upswing in infections, places like Nebraska and Iowa,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important for us to organize as a country, to try and control this infection before the number of cases goes up higher, before the number of deaths goes higher, because we\u2019re not on a good path at present,\u201d McKinney said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump isn\u2019t leading America much as its pandemic worsens. But that\u2019s not stopping Walmart \u2013 along with Kroger, Kohl\u2019s, and city and state leaders and officials \u2013 from making the tough decisions that the President has shirked. Given Trump\u2019s approach, if the country is to exit the building disaster without many more thousands dead, it will fall to governors, mayors, college presidents and school principals, teachers and grocery store managers to execute plans balancing public health with the need for life to go on. There were growing indications Wednesday that such centers of authority across the country are no longer waiting for cues from an indifferent President whose aggressive opening strategy has been discredited by a tsunami of infections and whose poll numbers are crashing as a result. More school districts \u2013 in Houston and San Francisco, for example \u2013 are defying the President\u2019s demand for all kids to go back to class in the fall. Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly signed an executive order to delay opening schools until after Labor Day. Alabama, perhaps the most pro-Trump state in the nation, introduced mask-wearing requirements for public places on Wednesday. Montana issued its own recommendation on masks. Massive retail chains Walmart, Kohl\u2019s and Kroger will require shoppers to wear masks in the coming days, confirming an emerging national consensus that face coverings \u2013 far from being an infringement of freedom \u2013 could be a lifesaver. The Republican governor of Maryland criticized Trump\u2019s leadership during the pandemic in a Washington Post op-ed Thursday, saying \u201cit was clear that waiting around for the president to run the nation\u2019s response was hopeless; if we delayed any longer, we\u2019d be condemning more of our citizens to suffering and death.\u201d Governors \u201cwent their own way,\u201d Gov. Larry Hogan wrote. \u201cWhich is how the United States ended up with such a patchwork response.\u201d One of the NFL\u2019s most storied franchises, the Green Bay Packers, will play the preseason without fans. Even Trump\u2019s frequent protector, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, broke with the President\u2019s magical thinking as he stumped through his increasingly afflicted home state of Kentucky. McConnell said that while \u201cthere were some that hoped\u201d the coronavirus will go away, it isn\u2019t. After five months, more than 137,000 US deaths and some 3.5 million infections, the country is at another turning point in the most severe national challenge since World War II. More and more states and local leaders, after seeing the result of premature openings that ignored scientific advice, appear to be moving toward the painful steps needed to get the virus under control. Those jurisdictions that did succeed in getting the pandemic under control \u2013 such as metropolitan areas around Washington, DC \u2013 are now beginning to face yet another test: enforcing social distancing and mask wearing as cases tick up after slow openings. The latest Quinnipiac University survey shows Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 15 points, a deficit that might help explain the bizarre series of attacks the President leveled at his rival during Tuesday\u2019s news conference and the shake-up in his campaign leadership on Wednesday led by his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Fauci holds his ground against Navarro broadside The White House response to all this is to deny that it\u2019s happening, to politicize grave choices about vital questions of how and when to reopen schools, and to create complete distractions, like Trump\u2019s meandering mess of a news conference on Tuesday. And it starts at the top. The President, who has always been in denial about the pandemic, has laid out no plan for school openings, has failed to set up the national testing and tracing network that could keep the virus under control and is doing nothing to stop the effort inside the White House to discredit the government\u2019s top infectious disease official, Dr. Anthony Fauci. After he was eviscerated in a USA Today op-ed by Peter Navarro \u2013 a trade adviser who has no medical expertise, Fauci told The Atlantic, \u201cI cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that. I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it\u2019s only reflecting negatively on them.\u201d Fauci also appeared at a White House coronavirus task force meeting Wednesday, pictures of which were tweeted by Vice President Mike Pence in a bid to smooth over the flap. But the President left the White House before the meeting started and headed for Atlanta, flouting mask-wearing protocols on the airport tarmac and holding an event on a topic that had nothing to do with the crisis: transportation infrastructure. It wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a President to visit Atlanta during a national medical emergency, given that the city hosts the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but Trump gave the agency a wide berth. Meanwhile, Trump joined his daughter Ivanka in yet another diversionary controversy, flacking for Goya, a major Hispanic-owned business facing a consumer backlash after its CEO appeared at the White House last week and lavished praise on the President. Their marketing pitch, which saw Trump pose behind a range of Goya products at the revered Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, probably broke executive branch ethics rules. But more than anything, it came across as crass and inappropriate a day after 900 more Americans died from Covid and as Wednesday\u2019s inexorable toll mounted. Trump\u2019s decision to ignore the deepening calamity is doing him no good politically \u2013 raising what seems to be a point obvious to everyone but the President that his prospects for November\u2019s election are unlikely to improve when the Covid-19 emergency becomes more dire by the day. The Quinnipiac University poll showed only 36% of registered voters approving of how Trump is handling his job. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey had Biden up 11 points and the President\u2019s approval rating down at 37%. 'From worst to first': These states have tamed coronavirus, even after reopening. Here's how they're doing it, and why they can't let up There is no secret as to what works. Stay-at-home and shutdown orders, combined with social distancing and increasing use of masks, have been shown to peg back the virus in US states such as New York and foreign nations such as Italy, France and South Korea. Other governments, in Hong Kong and Australia, for instance, have taken strenuous steps to tackle new hot spots when they emerge, unlike the US President, who is still pushing for new openings as the disaster worsens. If the current situation \u2013 an average of 60,000 new infections a day, a rising death toll and increased hospitalizations across the country \u2013 is not daunting enough, things could soon get much worse. Talk of a second spike in the virus in the fall has given way to a realization that America is still in a first wave likely to crash into a resurgence of the virus and flu season when people go back inside as the weather cools. Fauci said on Wednesday that America opened and he saw \u201cpictures and photos and films of people at bars with no masks, congregating in crowds,\u201d and \u201cthe inevitable happened.\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re hanging around 60,000. That\u2019s untenable. We\u2019ve got to turn that around, and that\u2019s really the issue we\u2019ve got to address right now,\u201d he told The Atlantic. A closely watched model also warned Wednesday that a total of 224,000 Americans could be dead from the virus by November 1. Dr. Chris Murray, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said a rise of 14,000 from last week\u2019s projection could be put down to fast-rising cases countrywide. \u201cThat increase in our forecasts is being driven by the big upsurge in, you know, the ones we know about in Florida, Texas, Arizona, California,\u201d Murray told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. \u201cThere\u2019s a longer list of states where deaths are going up, as well as hospitalizations. So that includes Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In North Carolina, Sen. Thom Tillis uses his commercials to reacquaint voters with his life story, highlighting his time working as a short-order cook while attending college at night. In her ads, Maine Sen. Susan Collins reminds constituents about the federal money she secured for diabetes research. And in one ad, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s family loads up an SUV with outdoor gear as he touts the new law he helped write to fund maintenance projects at national parks. But, so far this year, one topic has been off the table for these endangered Republican incumbents: the elected official at the top of the ticket this fall. It\u2019s a stark illustration of President Donald Trump\u2019s declining poll numbers and the danger they could pose to the Republican majority in the Senate. The stakes are high for Republicans: Democrats need a net gain of just four seats to flip the chamber (or three seats if the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, captures the White House, giving his vice president tie-breaking power in an evenly divided Senate.) In all, the five Republican incumbents in races viewed as pure tossups by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report \u2013 Tillis, Collins and Gardner, along with Arizona Sen. Martha McSally and Montana Sen. Steve Daines \u2013 have run nearly 37,000 television spots between January 1 and July 9, according to a tally by Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group for CNN. But fewer than 5% of those ads contained pro-Trump messages, the analysis found. And, during the period examined, Tillis, Collins and Gardner ran no ads mentioning the President. None of the five incumbents in tossup races have run any ads during the 2020 cycle that criticize Trump. Those spending decisions underscore the \u201ctough spot\u201d vulnerable incumbents in battlegrounds such as Colorado and North Carolina face, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of \u201cInside Elections\u201d and a CNN contributor. \u201cThey need to form a coalition of voters that includes people who love Trump and people who don\u2019t like him very much,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need every last Trump supporter,\u201d Gonzales added, \u201cbut also the independents and some moderate Democrats.\u201d The careful dance among vulnerable Republicans of distancing themselves from Trump without sharply criticizing the President comes as Democratic candidates find themselves awash in campaign donations as the general election draws closer. The latest sign of Democratic fundraising strength: Retired astronaut and first-time candidate Mark Kelly announced Tuesday that he had raised nearly $12.8 million in the second quarter of this year and had about $24 million remaining in the bank as he prepares for a showdown with McSally in Arizona. Like it or not, \u201cmany of these senators will rise or fall based on how the President is handling his own job,\u201d said David Flaherty, the CEO of Magellan Strategies, a Republican polling firm in Colorado. And in Colorado, where Gardner is a top target for Democrats, the first-term Republican likely will face an electorate that\u2019s less Republican and younger than the group of voters who sent Gardner to the Senate by a narrow margin six years ago, Flaherty said. Voters unaffiliated with any party now outnumber registered Democrats or Republicans in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s a math problem\u201d for Gardner, he said. Aides to Gardner and Tillis did not immediately respond to interview requests. Asked about the lack of Trump advertising, Collins\u2019 spokesman Kevin Kelly said the four-term senator \u201chistorically campaigns on her long record of accomplishments for the people of Maine,\u201d no matter who occupies the White House. And Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said it\u2019s no surprise that Republicans are focusing on their accomplishments. \u201cRepublican senators,\u201d he said, \u201chave incredibly impressive records to run on and they\u2019re making sure voters are aware.\u201d Daines has run the most spots that include pro-Trump messages between January 1 and July 9 among the GOP Senate incumbents in tossup seats: 1,223, according to CMAG\u2019s data. But they account for a tiny fraction \u2013 just 8% \u2013 of Daines\u2019 overall advertising this year. The lion\u2019s share of his ads focus on coronavirus surging through the country and how to restore a US job market decimated by the pandemic. A recent spot argues that the US must hold \u201cCommunist China accountable\u201d for what Daines called lying about the virus and then pivots to touts the first-term senator\u2019s effort to give tax credits to companies that return production and jobs to the United States. In Arizona, meanwhile, McSally\u2019s most-run spot in July features an Arizona voter warning that \u201cthe coronavirus taught Americans that we are too reliant on China for our prescription drugs,\u201d and praising McSally\u2019s work on the issue. Still, the reticence about embracing Trump does not extend to all Republicans running for Congress, particularly candidates in safe GOP seats. Overall, more than four out of every 10 congressionally focused spots run by Republican candidates, PACs, parties and groups during the period examined were classified as pro-Trump by CMAG \u2013 roughly on par with the party\u2019s embrace of Trump during the same period in the 2018 midterm elections. Perhaps nowhere was the pro-Trump sentiment more apparent than in deep-red Alabama in the runup to Tuesday\u2019s Senate primary runoff between two Republicans, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University. Trump endorsed Tuberville and repeatedly attacked Sessions for recusing himself from the FBI investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election while serving as Trump\u2019s attorney general. Tuberville embraced Trump and his endorsement, with CMAG classifying 100% of the nearly 3,000 spots Tuberville aired since early this year as having a pro-Trump message. In one 30-second commercial, Tuberville declared that \u201cGod sent us Donald Trump because God knew we were in trouble.\u201d On Tuesday, Tuberville won easily.",

            "article_content": "This past week, on US President Donald Trump\u2019s watch Russia and China have effectively re-aligned the coming world order. They didn\u2019t do it together, but both took advantage of uncertainty and unpredictability that Trump has helped create. It\u2019s far from clear that the next US President will be able to roll back the consequences of this week, which leave both Presidents Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Xi Jinping in Beijing more decisively in control of their own countries and more able to act assertively. In other words, Trump has made an indelible mark on the world \u2013 and it may not be for the good. It is no coincidence that Putin and Xi have cemented their grip on cherished goals, as the clock runs down on Trump\u2019s first, and possibly only, term in office. This past week, in a referendum on constitutional revisions so predictable that copies were on sale before the vote, Putin has effectively been made President for life, as Xi has moved equally ruthlessly, taking control of Hong Kong through a new national security law, while telling US allies Canada, Australia and the UK to keep out of China\u2019s internal affairs. Both seem to be of the view the US has neither the will nor the consistency to put up resistance. Indeed, Trump\u2019s White House gave evidence of exactly that this week, floundering for a coherent response to allegations Russia paid the Taliban to kill US forces in Afghanistan. The Russian Embassy in Washington and the Taliban have both denied the claims. As David Ignatius wrote in The Washington Post this week, Putin \u201cis in the payback business. He believes the United States destroyed his former country, the Soviet Union. He likes the United States to feel pain.\u201d He now has plenty of years for more payback. According to White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews: \u201cPresident Trump is a world-class negotiator who has consistently furthered America\u2019s interests on the world stage.\u201d Former senior US officials provided CNN contributor Carl Bernstein with a very different take. They thought Trump \u201cdelusional\u201d about his ability to bend other leaders to his agenda, believing he could \u201ceither charm, jawbone or bully almost any foreign leader into capitulating to his will.\u201d But Putin \u201cjust outplays him,\u201d said one of Bernstein\u2019s sources. Trump\u2019s \u201cfawning over authoritarian strongmen, his ignorance of history and lack of preparation\u201d jeopardized US national security, Bernstein was told. Whether it\u2019s Putin\u2019s payback or Xi\u2019s decision to violate and chip away at the Hong Kong agreement signed with the UK in 1984, both leaders appear to see opportunities. Go back three years. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dropped into the Oval Office the day after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director. Comey was overseeing the investigation into allegations of Russian election meddling. An official Russian photographer caught the bonhomie, as Trump told his visitors: \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job.\u201d Two months later, Trump met Putin \u2013 alone \u2013 on the margins of the G20 summit. The White House trumpeted the encounter as a success, highlighting a new ceasefire deal in Syria. The Russians cynically used the deal to freeze the conflict, allowing the Assad regime backed by Russia to pick off rebel-held areas one-by-one. Cracks in the Trump-Europe relationship are turning into a chasm Trump could have protested, ripped up the deal, forged a new US policy on Syria that would have crimped Russia\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East. Instead he bought the lie. It would be a recurring theme. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton recalls in his new book \u201cThe Room Where It Happened\u201d Trump\u2019s 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cPutin had to be laughing uproariously at what he had gotten away with,\u201d writes Bolton, after Trump accepted Putin\u2019s assurances there had been no Russian interference in the 2016 US campaign. So fast forward to this year as Putin, in power for 20 years, needed a constitutional fix to hold on for longer. He appears to calculate that despite tightened US sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine, and the poisoning of exiled former agent Sergei Skripal in the UK, Trump won\u2019t push back for what he does at home. He was right. He is now effectively President for life, hoping to emulate Soviet leaders by stepping down only into his grave. Xi\u2019s experience with Trump has been different. Tangled in a trade war, he has had to calculate Trump\u2019s real intent: on money, human rights issues, such as the Uyghurs or Hong Kong, and simply stopping the rise of the world\u2019s next superpower. At a large and raucous Beijing business dinner two years ago, I sat next to a former Chinese ambassador. The trade war was just beginning to ramp up, but tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, soybeans and aluminum were already biting into China\u2019s bottom line. The diplomat, who had spent many years in Europe, told me in very precise terms that Trump was intentionally preventing China taking its rightful place in the world as a high-tech advanced economy. I can be sure of what he\u2019d say now as the Trump administration tries to persuade allies not to allow Huawei\u2019s 5G technology into their digital bloodstream. But those allies are less willing to say no, partly because of China\u2019s commercial power but also because their relationships with the US have frayed. Only this week German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who Bernstein\u2019s sources say was berated by Trump in phone calls, appeared to reject Trump\u2019s China tactics, saying \u201conly together can the 27 EU member countries have enough weight to achieve ambitious deals with China.\u201d While Trump has been applauded for confronting China on its trade policies, commercial espionage and intellectual property theft, his tactics face heavy criticism. In an analysis for The Council on Foreign Relations, Robert Blackwill wrote: \u201cNow the challenge for the president and his successors is to persuade Beijing, through enhanced US power projection, more able alliances, and adroit diplomacy, that the United States will grow ever stronger in Asia and, with its allies and friends, will robustly confront destabilizing Chinese actions.\u201d All of this will have been in Xi\u2019s calculations about Trump, whether he is an existential threat to China\u2019s rise to be the world\u2019s superpower, or a prelude to a smarter adversary with the same goal. Hong Kong protest leader Nathan Law pledges to fight for democracy in exile after fleeing city Xi appears to have hedged toward the latter, choosing to act now against Hong Kong\u2019s determined pro-democracy movement, and pushing the narrative that the West is behind it,   before it became a real thorn in his side. Hong Kong\u2019s new National Security Law, promulgated in Beijing this week and immediately enforced on the territory\u2019s streets, is a game changer. According to the UK, it breaks the 1984 joint Sino-British declaration of one country-two systems. The question historians may well debate in the future is not whether Trump\u2019s presidency affected Putin\u2019s and Xi\u2019s decisions but by how much his delusions changed the world in their favor.",

            "article_content": "In the midst of a global pandemic with the presidential election just months away, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law that enabled millions of Americans to get insurance coverage and that remains in effect despite the pending legal challenge. In a late-night filing, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said that once the law\u2019s individual coverage mandate and two key provisions are invalidated, \u201cthe remainder of the ACA should not be allowed to remain in effect.\u201d The justices will hear arguments in the case sometime next term, although it is unclear if they will occur before the November election. The dispute ensures another major shift in the political landscape during the election season on an issue that has dominated American politics for the last decade. It will be the third time the court has heard a significant challenge to the law. The case pits a coalition of Democratic attorneys general led by California and the House of Representatives, which are defending the law, against the Trump administration and a group of red state attorneys general led by Texas. Nearly half a million people flocked to Obamacare after losing coverage this year At issue is whether the law\u2019s individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional because Congress reduced the penalty for remaining uninsured to zero and, if so, whether that would bring down the entire law. A federal appeals court in December ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional but punted the decision on which, if any, of the law\u2019s provisions could be retained back to the district court \u2013 which had previously found the entire law to be invalidated. The administration has generally sided with the Republican attorneys general but recently argued that the entire law should fall but that the ruling should only apply to the 18 states that brought the challenge. In Thursday\u2019s filing, Francisco stressed, \u201cNothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions.\u201d He said that \u201cthe entire ACA thus must fall with the individual mandate, though the scope of relief entered in this case should be limited to provisions shown to injure the plaintiffs.\u201d In a statement Friday, White House spokesman Judd Deere called Obamacare \u201can unlawful failure\u201d and called on Congress \u201cto work on a bipartisan basis with the President to provide quality, affordable care.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sharply criticized the administration after the late-night filing. \u201cPresident Trump and the Republicans\u2019 campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty,\u201d she said in a statement Thursday. Earlier Thursday, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, lashed out at President Donald Trump for continuing to support upending the law. \u201cToday, his Administration is filing a brief with the Supreme Court to rip health care coverage away from 23 million Americans \u2014 including 224,000 Wisconsinites,\u201d Biden said, remarking on Trump\u2019s visit to the Badger State Thursday. \u201cEvery American deserves the peace of mind that comes (with) access to affordable, high-quality health care.\u201d Biden, who is planning to make a new health care push on protecting the Affordable Care Act this week, was vice president when former President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in 2010. He is calling for strengthening it by making federal premium subsides more generous and allowing more people to qualify for subsidies. He would also add a government-run public option and would lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60. Meanwhile, Priorities USA, a pro-Biden super PAC, is rolling out a television ad entitled \u201cFailing On Health Care,\u201d which highlights Trump\u2019s continued effort to undermine Obamacare and will run in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Also, it is releasing a digital ad entitled \u201cPull the Plug,\u201d which emphasizes that 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose protections and their costs could rise if Trump\u2019s Supreme Court challenge is successful. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra defended the law at a campaign event for Biden on Wednesday, saying it enabled millions of Americans to gain coverage, particularly Black, Latino and Asian Americans. \u201cThe ACA has been life-changing and now through this pandemic, we can all see the value in having greater access to quality health care at affordable prices,\u201d he said, noting that Black Americans are four times more likely to be hospitalized with coronavirus. \u201cNow is not the time to rip away our best tool to address very real and very deadly health disparities in our communities.\u201d About 11.4 million people signed up for 2020 Obamacare polices on the exchanges, while nearly 12.7 million low-income adults have gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. It allows young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 policies and bans insurers from denying coverage to those who buy their own policies or charging them more because of pre-existing conditions. And it lets many people obtain free birth control, annual physicals, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It affects nearly all Americans, many of whom aren\u2019t aware of the law\u2019s impact. The filings come a day after House Democrats unveiled a bill to enhance the landmark law. Similar to Biden\u2019s plan, it would make Obamacare policies more affordable by bolstering federal premium subsidies \u2013 limiting monthly premiums to 8.5% of enrollees\u2019 income and allowing more middle class Americans to receive the subsidies by eliminating the income cap of four times the poverty level. It also tries to entice more states to expand Medicaid to low-income adults by covering 100% of the cost for the first three years. And it would reverse several moves made by the Trump administration to weaken the law, including restoring funds for marketing and enrollment assistance during Obamacare\u2019s annual sign-up period. The move in the House, led by Pelosi, seeks to draw a sharp contrast between the parties on health care, an issue that\u2019s become even more pressing amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt was wrong anytime,\u201d the California Democrat said of the administration\u2019s stance. \u201cNow, it\u2019s beyond stupid.\u201d This story has been updated with reaction from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House.",

            "article_content": "Former national security adviser John Bolton has leveled a stunning accusation against his former boss, claiming in his new book that President Donald Trump personally asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to help him win the 2020 US presidential election, according to a copy obtained by CNN Wednesday. Bolton also charged that when Xi told Trump last year that China was building concentration camps for the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims, Trump said Xi should go ahead building the camps, \u201cwhich he thought was exactly the right thing to do.\u201d At another meeting during last year\u2019s G-20 Summit in Osaka, Bolton writes Trump \u201cstunningly\u201d turned the conversation to the upcoming 2020 election. The former national security adviser said Trump \u201cstressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome,\u201d adding that he \u201cwould print Trump\u2019s exact words, but the government\u2019s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.\u201d Bolton accuses Trump of lying ahead of book publication Bolton said the conversation turned back to the trade deal, and Trump \u201cproposed that for the remaining $350 billion of trade imbalances (by Trump\u2019s arithmetic), the US would not impose tariffs, but he again returned to importuning Xi to buy as many American farm products as China could.\u201d \u201cHe is a liar,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, adding that \u201ceverybody in the White House hated John Bolton.\u201d He told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity in an interview that Bolton disclosed \u201chighly classified information.\u201d \u201cAnd he did not have approval,\u201d Trump said. The allegation that Trump asked the leader of a major US adversary to help him win the next election will reverberate across Washington six months after Trump was impeached on charges he sought help from Ukraine with his reelection bid. Trump openly asked China to investigate his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden last year, and has refused to accept the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win. The claims come as the Trump campaign has tried to make China a central issue of the 2020 election, framing the President as tougher on Beijing than Biden. The interactions with Xi were just some of the unflattering details about Trump contained in Bolton\u2019s book, titled \u201cIn the Room Where it Happened.\u201d Bolton also writes that Trump directly connected US security aid to Ukraine with an investigation into his presumptive 2020 opponent \u2013 the key allegation in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment case \u2013 and accuses Trump repeatedly of lying. The book has been subject to a months-long legal battle between the White House and the former national security adviser. The fight escalated Tuesday after the Trump administration went to court to try to claw back Bolton\u2019s earnings for the book and to potentially stop its publication, arguing in a lawsuit that Bolton had breached non-disclosure agreements and was risking national security by exposing classified information. But the White House\u2019s legal action has done little to stop details from Bolton\u2019s book from becoming public as CNN and other media outlets reported Wednesday that they obtained advanced copies. It\u2019s scheduled for official release next week. The Justice Department asked a judge Wednesday for emergency help to stop Bolton\u2019s book publication, taking another last-ditch step in court to ramp up pressure on the former national security adviser the week before his bombshell book is released to the public. Several top intelligence and national security officials submitted sworn statements to the judge about classified information in Bolton\u2019s book, amounting to an extraordinary level of firepower in the Justice Department\u2019s latest emergency filing in court. The officials, including Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center William Evanina, wrote in affidavits that the book still contained classified information. In a letter sent to the White House last week, Bolton\u2019s lawyer, Charles Cooper, accused the White House of seeking to block the book for \u201cpurely political reasons,\u201d adding that \u201cas a practical matter, (it) comes too late.\u201d Bolton\u2019s book provides detailed accounts of Trump\u2019s interactions with Xi. At the G-20 summit, Bolton writes that when Xi proved amenable to reopening trade discussions, Trump extolled the Chinese leader as the greatest in that country\u2019s history. Broadly speaking, Bolton characterized Trump\u2019s interactions with Xi as \u201cadlibbed,\u201d bolstered by personal flattery and driven by political ambition rather than policy. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by reelection calculations,\u201d Bolton writes. Trump signs Uyghur human rights bill on same day Bolton alleges he told Xi to proceed with detention camps Bolton described a litany of China-related matters where Trump subverted the US position based on conversations or gestures for Xi \u2013 tariffs, telecommunications, Hong Kong protests, even China\u2019s mass detention of Uyghur Muslims. \u201cAt the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,\u201d Bolton writes. \u201cThe National Security Council\u2019s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.\u201d The US State Department estimates that more than one million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups have been detained by the Chinese government in internment camps, where they are reportedly \u201csubjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and death.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Beijing\u2019s treatment of the Uyghurs \u201cthe stain of the century.\u201d On the massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong last year, Bolton claimed that Trump said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get involved,\u201d and, \u201cwe have human-rights problems too.\u201d In recent weeks, Trump has announced actions against China for its moves against Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Xi was not the only world leader who Bolton says had Trump\u2019s number. In an interview with ABC News, Bolton said he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks he can play Trump \u201clike a fiddle,\u201d according to a clip that aired Wednesday. \u201cI think Putin is smart, tough. I think he see that he\u2019s not faced with a serious adversary here. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s worried about Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton said. Trump has previously claimed that no other president has been tougher on Russia than he has but that claim has been questioned by several of his own advisers, in addition to Bolton. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was also able to manipulate Trump, Bolton says in his book. Bolton writes extensively about his disagreements with Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea before, during, and after the Singapore summit with Kim, which Bolton hoped would \u201ccollapse\u201d before it happened and compared to the appeasement of Nazi Germany, even quoting Winston Churchill. \u201cThe whole diplomatic fandango was South Korea\u2019s creation,\u201d Bolton writes, \u201crelating more to its \u2018unification\u2019 agenda than serious strategy on Kim\u2019s part or ours.\u201d Despite the objections of his advisers, Bolton writes that \u201cTrump was desperate to have the meeting at any price.\u201d Bolton then writes that Kim had Trump \u201chooked\u201d at the Singapore summit as they flattered each other in their meeting. When Trump told Kim he would seek Senate approval of any nuclear deal, Bolton writes Pompeo passed Bolton a note saying \u201che is so full of shit.\u201d Bolton suggests Pompeo was referring to Trump, not Kim. The State Department did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment regarding Bolton\u2019s claim. That was not the only time Trump\u2019s former national security adviser said top aides questioned, and even mocked, Trump in private. Bolton says Trump repeatedly requested military options for Venezuela, a request that shocked several administration and military officials. After one meeting at the White House with Florida Republican lawmakers, Bolton says Trump was convinced to throw his unequivocal support opposition leader Juan Guaido, after repeatedly wavering on doing so, yet still asked for a military option. \u201cTrump still wanted a military option, raising questions with the Florida Republicans who were plainly stunned, except for {Sen. Marco} Rubio who had heard it before and knew how to deflect it politely.\u201d Bolton says he then called then-acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford. \u201cNone of us thought that a military option was advisable at this point. To me, this exercise was solely to keep Trump interested in the objective of overthrowing Maduro, without actually wasting a lot of time on a nonstarter,\u201d Bolton writes. \u201cI had the easy job, closing by saying \u2018All I had to do was make the call,\u2019\u201d Bolton adds, noting that Dunford then responded jokingly, \u201c\u2018Tag, I\u2019m it!\u2019\u201d \u201cAt least he still had a sense of humor,\u201d Bolton notes. Trump\u2019s interactions with Xi are not the only examples of actions by the President that Bolton claims were troubling and should have been investigated as part of the House impeachment inquiry, which only focused on matters related to Ukraine, according to the the book. Specifically, Bolton highlights Trump\u2019s willingness to intervene in criminal investigations \u201cto, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,\u201d noting cases involving law firms in China and Turkey. \u201cThe pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn\u2019t accept,\u201d Bolton writes. Bolton writes that Trump offered to help Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2018 with a Justice Department investigation into a Turkish bank that had ties to Erdogan and was under investigation for violating US Iran sanctions. Trump asked if then-acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker would be reached, Bolton says, before Trump told Erdogan that he would \u201ctake care of things,\u201d saying that the Southern District of New York prosecutors on the case were \u201cObama people\u201d and would be replaced by \u201chis people.\u201d House Democrats wanted Bolton to testify last year, but he refused to do so, threatening a legal battle if he was subpoenaed. Bolton offered to testify during the Senate impeachment trial, but Republicans voted to reject hearing from any witnesses. Bolton wrote that the Democrats\u2019 conducted a hurried, partisan investigation, and accused them of committing \u201cimpeachment malpractice\u201d by only focusing on Trump\u2019s involvement with Ukraine. On Wednesday, Democrats criticized Bolton for caring more about his book sales than Trump\u2019s misconduct, while Republicans questioned Bolton\u2019s credibility and accused him of having an ax to grind. Bolton devotes his final chapter to the Ukraine matter, in which he was part of several key meetings, including some described by other witnesses during the impeachment proceedings. But Bolton leveled an accusation in the book that no impeachment witness did: that he directly heard Trump tie withholding US security aid to an investigation into the Bidens. \u201cThe next morning, August 20, I took Trump\u2019s temperature on the Ukraine security assistance, and he said he wasn\u2019t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,\u201d Bolton writes. Bolton declines to say whether he thinks Trump should have been impeached. \u201cWhether Trump\u2019s conduct rose to the level of an impeachable offense, I had found it deeply disturbing, which is why I had reported it to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his staff and Attorney General Bill Barr, and why Pompeo, Mnuchin, and I had worried over it in our own conversations.\u201d Bolton argued that even if he had been called to testify by the Senate, he is \u201cconvinced\u201d that it would have made \u201cno significant difference\u201d to the outcome. This story has been updated with additional details from the copy of the book obtained by CNN.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting social media companies on Thursday, days after Twitter called two of his tweets \u201cpotentially misleading.\u201d Speaking from the Oval Office ahead of signing the order, Trump said the move was to \u201cdefend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history.\u201d \u201cA small handful of social media monopolies controls a vast portion of all public and private communications in the United States,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey\u2019ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter, virtually any form of communication between private citizens and large public audiences.\u201d The executive order tests the boundaries of the White House\u2019s authority. In a long-shot legal bid, it seeks to curtail the power of large social media platforms by reinterpreting a critical 1996 law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits. But legal experts on both the right and the left have raised serious concerns about the proposal. They say it may be unconstitutional because it risks infringing on the First Amendment rights of private companies and because it attempts to circumvent the two other branches of government. \u201c(Trump) is trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the architect of the legislation that the order seeks to reinterpret. \u201cHe decides what\u2019s legal based on what\u2019s in his interest.\u201d The order marks a dramatic escalation by Trump in his war with tech companies as they struggle with the growing problem of misinformation on social media. The President has regularly accused sites of censoring conservative speech. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged that legal challenges to the order are on the horizon, saying he was \u201csure they\u2019ll be doing a lawsuit.\u201d \u201cI guess it\u2019s going to be challenged in court, what isn\u2019t?\u201d he asked. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re going to do very well.\u201d The text of the order, which was reviewed by CNN, targets a law known as the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 of the legislation provides broad immunity to websites that curate and moderate their own platforms, and has been described by legal experts as \u201cthe 26 words that created the internet.\u201d They didn't all have to die -- a moment of reflection as US Covid deaths reach 100,000 It argues that the protections hinge mainly on tech platforms operating in \u201cgood faith,\u201d and that social media companies have not. \u201cIn a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the internet,\u201d the order says. \u201cThis practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power.\u201d On Tuesday, Twitter applied a fact-check to two of Trump\u2019s tweets, including one that claimed, without evidence, that mail-in ballots would lead to widespread voter fraud. Trump immediately shot back, accusing the social media giant of censorship and warning that if it continued to offer addendums to his messages, he would use the power of the federal government to rein it in or even shut it down. The order accuses social media platforms of \u201cinvoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise punish Americans\u2019 speech here at home.\u201d It specifically cites Twitter for \u201cselectively\u201d applying warning labels to \u201ccertain tweets.\u201d It also faults Google for helping the Chinese government surveil its citizens; Twitter for spreading Chinese propaganda; and Facebook for profiting from Chinese advertising. Tech companies are pushing back on the order. Facebook and Google said Trump\u2019s proposal risks harming the internet and digital economy. \u201cBy exposing companies to potential liability for everything that billions of people around the world say, this would penalize companies that choose to allow controversial speech and encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone,\u201d Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement. \u201cOur platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,\u201d Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said. \u201cUndermining Section 230 in this way would hurt America\u2019s economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.\u201d Twitter said late Thursday that Trump\u2019s order \u201cis a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d \u201c#Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it\u2019s underpinned by democratic values,\u201d the company tweeted. \u201cAttempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.\u201d The move highlights what Trump believes is a fight worth having. In many ways, the latest episode with Twitter feeds Trump\u2019s narrative that there are powerful forces in the media aligned against him, and that his is the only voice his supporters can trust. \u201cThis plays right into President Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d said Jason Miller, the communications director for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and someone who has been directly involved with Trump\u2019s social media strategy. \u201cThey basically handed him a massive gift.\u201d Many of Trump\u2019s political allies rushed to his defense on Wednesday. \u201cTwitter is engaging in 2020 election interference. They are putting their thumb on the scale,\u201d said Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a loyal Trump supporter and surrogate during an appearance on the Steve Bannon-produced podcast War Room Pandemic. \u201cThe notion that they would outsource fact checking to people who have been wrong about everything is an insult.\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that his team no longer pays for advertising on Twitter and accused the tech giant of purposefully influencing the election to hurt the President. \u201cWe always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \u201cPartnering with the biased fake news media \u2018fact checkers\u2019 is only a smoke screen Twitter is using to try to lend their obvious political tactics some false credibility.\u201d The President made the decision to warn Twitter despite the fact that the company and most other prominent social media platforms have allowed him and his associates to peddle unsubstantiated conspiracy theories with few constraints. While Twitter added the fact check to Trump\u2019s tweets on mail-in voting, it did not do so on any of his recent tweets baselessly suggesting MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was somehow involved in the death of a former aide, despite a plea from the aide\u2019s widower to take the tweets down. Fact-checking Trump's recent claims that mail-in voting is rife with fraud Trump\u2019s Twitter habits have been scrutinized for virtually his entire political career, but people familiar with his use of the platform describe less of a strategy and more of a mindset as he or an aide taps out messages. Other people inside the administration, and even some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, are regularly caught off-guard by what appears on his feed \u2013 if not always surprised. While his messages often have the effect of distracting from an unfortunate headline, people close to the President say it is their impression that he genuinely believes many of the more conspiratorial things he sends \u2013 including debunked theories about his predecessor \u2013 and that he isn\u2019t raising them only in the hopes of diverting attention elsewhere. Trump\u2019s top social media adviser, Dan Scavino Jr., was recently elevated to become one of the highest-ranking officials in the West Wing. His title, deputy chief of staff for communications, belies the fundamental role he plays both in Trump\u2019s use of Twitter and in his life generally. Trump trusts Scavino almost unreservedly. Scavino has worked for the President since before the 2016 campaign when he was a manager at one of Trump\u2019s golf clubs. Scavino is usually the person who locates the internet content \u2013 sometimes from fringe sources and often incendiary \u2013 that finds it way to Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, though other friends and advisers have suggested tweets and retweets as well. Scavino\u2019s West Wing office provides him regular access to the President, as does his near-ubiquitous presence on Trump\u2019s trips, where he is often seen videotaping or photographing the President. He is believed to be the only other person with access to @RealDonaldTrump, though the mechanics of the account have never been confirmed by the White House. Trump\u2019s tweet rants have always been controversial. But recently, as the US death toll from the pandemic has approached 100,000, they have become uncomfortable even for some of the President\u2019s most prominent supporters. \u201cI do think the President should stop tweeting about Joe Scarborough in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican. \u201cHe\u2019s the commander in chief of this nation and he is causing great pain to the family of the young woman who died.\u201d But those who understand the President\u2019s social media habits believe it is unlikely that he will change his behavior any time soon. Miller, who has been present as Trump crafts his tweets, said the President views the platform as an outlet where he can speak directly to his supporters. \u201cIt is one of President Trump\u2019s super powers,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe understood very early on that social media, Twitter in particular, gave him unvarnished access to the American people and his supporters. What Trump maximized was social media\u2019s ability to bypass the artificial conversation created by the mainstream media.\u201d Under the order, the Commerce Department would ask the Federal Communications Commission for new regulations clarifying when a company\u2019s conduct might violate the good faith provisions of Section 230 \u2013 potentially making it easier for tech companies to be sued. That is consistent with a draft order whose text CNN first reported last summer \u2013 and which prompted FCC officials to push back on the plan privately. \u201cThis debate is an important one. The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce,\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said Thursday. The order instructs the Justice Department to consult with state attorneys general on allegations of anti-conservative bias. It bans federal agencies from advertising on platforms that have allegedly violated Section 230\u2019s good-faith principles. Finally, the order would direct the Federal Trade Commission to report on complaints about political bias collected by the White House and to consider bringing lawsuits against companies accused of violating the administration\u2019s interpretation of Section 230. The provisions regarding the FTC could raise additional legal questions, as the FTC is an independent agency that does not take orders from the President. \u201cThe FTC is committed to robust enforcement of consumer protection and competition laws, including with respect to social media platforms, and consistent with our jurisdictional authority and constitutional limitations,\u201d FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan said Thursday.

            "article_content": "Two months into the pandemic battle, national politics have hardened into an ugly, dispiriting limbo amid a sense that during a generational crisis, there is no one in charge. Haunted by an invisible pathogen that has drained trademark energy and optimism from American life, the ordeal has clearly not drawn the country together \u2013 it\u2019s tearing it further apart. And there is still no clear path out of the darkness. The stasis is deepened because as every state moves toward some kind of opening, there is no convincing metric to show conclusively whether the battle is being won. In 18 states, coronavirus infections are rising, in 15 states the numbers are steady and in 17 infections are ebbing. Aggressive openers such as Texas and Florida might offer hope \u2013 but now there are reports that infection figures from those states and others may not be as optimistic or believable as they seem. At the apex of political power, a President who ought to be unifying the country seems to be using his office to indulge his own need for attention and is exclusively talking to the sizable minority that supports him no matter what. President Donald Trump will visit a Ford production plant in the critical swing state of Michigan pursued by a controversy over whether he will wear a face mask to comply with his own government\u2019s public health advice. The drama exemplifies sharp political and cultural divides over how to deal with the virus that the President is exacerbating with an eye on his own prospects in November\u2019s election. Amid crushing economic pain caused by shutdowns, a divided Congress cannot decide whether it wants to do more to help, compounding the impression that the fractured national political system and those in it are not equal to the moment. Every four years, the instrument of political renewal, the presidential election, offers a pressure valve for partisan angst and, for all the nation\u2019s acrimonious political divides, legitimacy to the winner. This year the contest is stifled \u2013 with the presumptive challenger, Joe Biden, stuck in his basement. Trump is giving the distinct impression with false claims of voter fraud, which he escalated on Wednesday, that he\u2019s trying to delegitimize an election he might lose \u2013 a scenario that could seed years of discord even if he is forced out of the White House. Trump's tweets offer snapshot of conspiracy mindset In the best of times, and the worst of times, the presidency often sets the mood of the age, in Washington and beyond. But it\u2019s as if Trump, endlessly preoccupied with his reelection prospects, is not engaged in the worst public health challenge in a century and the most debilitating economic crunch since the 1930s. Each day, he gets further drawn into his obsessions and personal feuds. Impeachment did not slow his testing of constitutional constraints, it accelerated them, as his firing of agency inspectors general and his Justice Department\u2019s efforts to rewrite the narrative of his abuses of power show. Trump is making clear that he plans to use every instrument of the federal government to ensure he wins a second term. This ranges from the seemingly trivial \u2013 the use of the Lincoln Memorial as a backdrop to a boosterish Fox News town hall \u2013 to the more sinister, the declassification of intelligence to fuel conservative conspiracy theories. On Wednesday, Trump threatened to withhold coronavirus aid from Michigan and Nevada \u2013 states trying to protect their residents by offering them the option of voting by mail in November. Trump, who previously falsely claimed that millions of fraudulent votes cost him a popular-vote win in 2016, warned of \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of fake ballots. \u201cThis nation can\u2019t go down that path. (It\u2019s a) dangerous path to go down,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.   This all came as the President \u2013 who is dosing up on hydroxychloroquine, a drug that his own government says is ineffective against Covid-19 \u2013 made yet another of his victory declarations over the virus. He seemingly regards more than 93,000 deaths in a pandemic he had said would not trouble the United States as a marker not of personal failure but great success. \u201cWe\u2019ve done, you know, amazingly well,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday in a meeting with the governors of Arkansas and Kansas. The days when the White House, by showcasing top medical officials on television, thought it had a duty to inform the states and Americans about the way forward are long gone. \u201cThere has been very little guidance from Washington,\u201d said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cThe CDC gave us guidelines on when to open \u2013 two weeks of a downward trajectory. They have been radio silent on what should happen now. They haven\u2019t told us what to look for with spikes. They haven\u2019t told us when we should reconsider or tighten what we are doing,\u201d said Gelber, one of a long list of local and state leaders from each party trying to do the best they can. Trump seems more interested in his own political feuds. He built his political career and bond with a particular segment of the electorate on the racist claim that his predecessor Barack Obama was not born in the United States. With polls finding Biden in the lead, Trump has shown he plans to build another campaign on false claims about Obama \u2013 this time alleging criminality in the investigation mounted into his own 2016 campaign\u2019s many and unusual contacts with Russia. It\u2019s an extraordinary spectacle: a President running for a second term and focusing not on his own record but pinning hopes on falsifying the conduct of his predecessor. Trump sows division and confusion as anxious country edges toward opening It\u2019s not news that Washington is dysfunctional. But for all the fury and division of the last three decades, the discombobulation at such a perilous moment is shocking. If ever Washington would come together, a pandemic that has thrown more than 30 million Americans out of work ought to do it. Early on, the Democratic-led House and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did combine to produce trillions of dollars in rescue funds. But as the crisis has dragged on, political differences have reasserted themselves. If small and large businesses and laid-off workers are looking for more help, they must wait. The House passed a $3 trillion stimulus plan last week \u2013 but its move was a highly political gesture given the lack of agreement between Democrats and Republicans on the way forward. Republicans, who passed a massive tax cut bill that favored corporations and the well-off during 2017, are now concerned about further spending and want to see if state openings can rekindle the economy on their own. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need right now,\u201d said the top House Republican, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. Comments like that gave Democrats the chance to complete the layup set up by the bill. \u201cThe Republican pause is a riverboat gamble where American workers will in all likelihood pay the cost of Republican inaction with their homes, their families, their livelihoods,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. Some Republicans, especially those with tough reelection races, are getting antsy. Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado pledged to try to keep the Senate from going into recess Thursday. \u201cThis place is full of people who want to do finger pointing and partisan games. The American people are sick of it,\u201d he said. In the absence of action, Washington is defaulting to name calling. Top diplomat Mike Pompeo, hitting back at criticism of the firing of a State Department inspector general who was investigating him, lashed out at a Democratic senator pushing for a congressional probe. He bashed New Jersey\u2019s Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez as \u201ca man who was criminally prosecuted, Case Number 15-155, in New Jersey Federal District Court.\u201d Bribery charges against the senator were dropped in 2018 after a mistrial. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 admittedly after three years of insults from the President \u2013 now seems willing to join him in the gutter, after misbranding him \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d earlier in the week. The California Democrat said Wednesday that Trump has \u201cdoggy doo on his shoes, and everybody who works with him has that on their shoes, too, for a very long time to come.\u201d The Senate might not be ready to act on another stimulus \u2013 but it\u2019s got time to dig over the carcass of impeachment. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a man who seems ever more out of step with his pro-Trump party, bemoaned efforts by his colleagues to go after Biden on false allegations of corruption in Ukraine \u2013 that caused Trump to become only the third impeached president. Asked whether he thought the probe was political he said: \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump was the victim. \u201cYou are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this President,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cYou would have to be blind not to see one.\u201d Biden, still stuck at home in Delaware as Trump begins to move around swing states, tried to insert himself into the action in a virtual town hall. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s a builder, but he\u2019s a destroyer of everything he touches,\u201d Biden said of his opponent.",

            "article_content": "New developments in the Michael Flynn case have breathed new life into old controversies about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the never-ending fallout. Flynn, who was President Donald Trump\u2019s first national security adviser before resigning and pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, is in a state of legal limbo. The Justice Department reversed course this month and asked to drop the case against him, and a federal judge is reviewing the request. The saga, which has been smoldering for more than three years, includes controversial moves by the FBI, Flynn\u2019s own problematic contacts with a Russian official, a series of high-profile leaks, blatant lies to the public and to the FBI, potential blackmail and almost everything in between. Here are answers to some of the most basic questions about Flynn and the investigation: Flynn, 61, is a retired Army lieutenant general who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. He earned numerous awards during his military career and was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2012 to run the Defense Intelligence Agency, the top military intelligence service in the country. William Barr working to undo Mueller investigation conclusions After two years on the job, Flynn was forced out and retired from the military. He launched a consulting firm and reemerged in 2016 as a Trump adviser. He became a prominent campaign surrogate and gave a polarizing speech at the GOP convention calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed. After Trump won the election, he picked Flynn to become his national security adviser. Flynn\u2019s problems can largely be traced back to his conversations with a senior Russian official during the presidential transition. In a series of calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Flynn undercut Obama\u2019s newly announced sanctions against Russia for meddling in the 2016 election. In the calls, Flynn also undermined the official US position toward a United Nations resolution about Israel, according to court filings. These calls were intercepted by routine US surveillance of foreign diplomats, and US officials leaked details to the press, a potentially illegal leak because the information is highly classified. Flynn misled his fellow Trump officials by saying sanctions hadn\u2019t been discussed, and those officials repeated Flynn\u2019s false denials on television. Mike Pence: 'I'd be happy' to see Michael Flynn back in the Trump administration Because the calls had been intercepted by US intelligence, the FBI and Justice Department knew that the public explanation from team Trump wasn\u2019t true. Days after Trump took office, the FBI questioned Flynn about the calls, and he told four distinct lies, according to court filings. Justice Department officials soon warned the Trump White House about Flynn\u2019s dishonesty, and how Vice President Mike Pence and others had publicly repeated Flynn\u2019s lies, making them vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Flynn was fired in February 2017 after three weeks on the job, and Trump said at the time that Flynn had to go because he had lied to Pence. When Flynn was fired, the Russia investigation was still being run by the FBI. Things ramped up by spring 2017 and special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the investigation. Mueller scrutinized Flynn\u2019s conduct, including Flynn\u2019s undisclosed pro-Turkey lobbying in 2016. Flynn and Mueller reached a plea agreement in December 2017. Flynn agreed to help the probe and eventually provided evidence against Trump. Mueller let Flynn plead guilty to one count of lying to the FBI, and agreed not to bring charges on Flynn\u2019s other lies or on the illegal lobbying. The case progressed relatively normally until June 2019, when Flynn fired his lawyers and brought on an aggressive team of right-wing firebrands. Instead of letting the case wrap up as planned and proceed to sentencing, Flynn\u2019s lawyers started accusing the FBI of bias and misconduct, and he later asked to withdraw his guilty plea. Attorney General William Barr took the unusual step of asking a separate team of federal prosecutors to review the case files. This outside team provided Flynn\u2019s lawyers with some documents last month, even though some of the documents were already in the record. Flynn\u2019s team posted the files on the public docket. Seizing on these documents, Trump and his conservative allies claimed Flynn was \u201cexonerated\u201d and that the charges should be dropped, even though Flynn had admitted his own guilt under oath. Trump said he was considering a pardon and might bring Flynn back into the administration. The Justice Department, in a bombshell announcement last week, told federal Judge Emmet Sullivan it was dropping the case. Its filing renounced years of legal arguments and contradicted past positions. The court papers were signed by a top Barr ally and none of the career prosecutors, prompting accusations from across the political spectrum that Barr was twisting the law to do Trump\u2019s bidding. Barr said the request had been made for legal, not political, reasons. Sullivan is running the show right now. The criminal case isn\u2019t technically over until he grants the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop the charges. Legal experts say he doesn\u2019t have much leeway to reject that request, even if he wants to. Judge signals he won't immediately dismiss Michael Flynn case But he doesn\u2019t have to rubber-stamp it right away, and he made that clear Tuesday by announcing that some outside parties would be allowed to weigh in on the case. Already, a group of former Watergate prosecutors want to argue the case against Flynn. Sullivan could hold hearings, question witnesses and even appoint an outside lawyer to look for improprieties by Barr\u2019s team. In a bold flex of judicial power, Sullivan on Wednesday appointed a retired judge to look into the case and argue against the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop the prosecution. Sullivan also asked the judge to weigh in on the possibility that Flynn had perjured himself, a prospect that came into play when Flynn told the court on separate occasions that he is both guilty and innocent. Meanwhile, Trump could pardon Flynn whenever he wants. Time will tell if that happens before the legal process plays out in court, before the November election or if it even happens at all. This story has been updated with developments late Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Elections are a sacred ritual for Jeremy Rutledge and always have been. But for the first time in his life, the 49-year old minister of a historic Circular Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina, says that he is being forced to make what could be a life-or-death choice because of the risk Covid-19 poses to him. Rutledge, who lives with his wife and son, says he has for nearly 12 years suffered from a chronic autoimmune disorder that has caused scarring in his lungs. His doctors have warned him that a Covid-19 infection could be a death sentence. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted since I was old enough to vote \u2013  in every election,\u201d Rutledge told CNN. \u201cI never imagined that I would have to decide whether I wanted to vote or whether I wanted to live and be healthy.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve really had serious conversations,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of my doctors are worried that if I contract the virus, I could die from it.\u201d For voters like Rutledge, the coronavirus pandemic has turned the simple act of voting into an impossible calculation about whether to exercise his constitutional right or protect his health. And the virus has injected a new sense of urgency to a long-running political battle over access to voting. Wisconsin judge elected amid coronavirus pandemic calls victory 'bittersweet' following an 'uptick' in state's cases After Wisconsin went ahead with its schedule in-person primary on April 7, the state has become a cautionary tale for what could happen if adequate changes are not made to prevent the spread of the virus on election day. The state has now identified several cases of coronavirus among people who participated in in-person voting that day, though it is not clear if they became infected because of in-person voting. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union have filed suit in South Carolina challenging the state\u2019s absentee voting laws ahead of the June 9 primary for federal, state and local offices. Under the state\u2019s laws, Rutledge would have no choice but to vote in person, his lawyers say. They claim that the state\u2019s absentee voting laws do not allow a person in his situation to have a valid \u201cexcuse\u201d for seeking an absentee ballot. And what\u2019s more: The state requires absentee ballots to be signed by a witness. Rutledge said that if schools reopen in the fall, he and his wife \u2013 a public school teacher \u2013  have planned to live in separate homes to protect him. \u201cI\u2019ll still need to be separate from what they might be exposed to every day,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be physically distant from people and then invite them into your home to witness you voting.\u201d More than a dozen similar suits are being filed across the country by advocates and Democratic groups seeking to force the states that still have restrictive mail in voting rules to expand access to absentee ballots for anyone who chooses to vote by mail because of Covid-19. They are also pushing to expand early voting and guarantee pre-paid postage for mailed ballots and ballot applications, among other changes. Already 33 states have some form of no-excuse absentee voting and five vote entirely by mail. Several others \u2013 like New York \u2013 have changed their rules in recent weeks to allow expanded access to absentee voting for upcoming elections. But a number of other states, particularly in the South, have not moved as quickly to adjust. Trena Walker is a single mom who has battled breast cancer, emphysema and is also legally blind. The risk she faces is two-fold. As a cancer survivor who also has a lung condition, she is especially vulnerable if she were to contract the virus. She also fears that if she goes to the polls, she could bring the virus home to her children. As the only adult in her household, the state\u2019s witness requirement would be an impossibility without inviting an outsider into her home. \u201cHer underlying health is really problematic,\u201d said Susan Dunn, legal director for the  ACLU, South Carolina. \u201cEvery time she goes out the front door of her house she has to make a calculation.\u201d \u201cIn states like South Carolina who are requiring people to leave their homes and find a witness, over a quarter of the state are people who live alone and people who are over 65 are more likely to live alone,\u201d said Deuel Ross, a senior attorney for the NAACP LDF. \u201cAfrican Americans as well are more likely than white people to live alone.\u201d Most Americans support mail-in voting but there is a sharp partisan divide Democratic groups and advocates are engaged in legal challenges to states\u2019 election laws in several states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Texas. Already, activists have won critical legal victories in Texas, where a state judge ruled that voters who did not want to vote in person because of the coronavirus could use absentee ballots. But in New Mexico, a state Supreme Court judge ruled in favor of Republicans, rejecting a push by Democrats to automatically send absentee ballots to voters ahead the state\u2019s June 2 primary. In Louisiana, the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, working with the state\u2019s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, proposed expanding absentee voting for July and August elections to wide group of people with concerns about coronavirus exposure. But Republican lawmakers succeeded in blocking that proposal and have instead approved expanding absentee voting to a more limited group of people. Bel Edwards has said he can support the more limited proposal, which must still pass the full legislature. \u201cThe states with a long history of discrimination, particularly in the South, have yet to take all the steps that they need to stop putting barriers in front of voters,\u201d Ross said. \u201cMany of those states are run by Republicans. But some of them, like Louisiana, are run by Democrats.\u201d \u201cThat is born of those states being the states that had literacy tests and other requirements for a very long time,\u201d he added. These longstanding legal battles have also recently taken on a more political hue \u2013 largely because President Donald Trump has vocally opposed the expansion of mail-in voting because of the threat of coronavirus. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that overall, 58% of Americans favor permanently changing election laws to allow everyone to vote by mail, but just 31% of Republicans say the same. And while many Republican election officials are moving to expand mail-in voting for upcoming primaries, Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias said no one should assume Republicans will take the same strategy when the stakes are higher in November. Elias is currently pushing for expanded access to voting in 14 states and he said that the efforts Republicans and the Republican National Committee made to block delaying Wisconsin\u2019s primary this month is a just glimpse of what can be expected in the general election. \u201cJust imagine what they\u2019re going to be willing to do when it\u2019s Donald Trump on the ballot in November,\u201d Elias said. \u201cDonald Trump has set a tone that Republican legislators are going to oppose voting rights across the board.\u201d Even before the virus had spread widely in the US, the Republican National Committee had already pledged $10 million to combat Democratic legal challenges to state voting laws. And the President\u2019s campaign, as well as the RNC, has amplified Trump\u2019s claims that mail-in voting is ripe for fraud, despite slim evidence that such fraud is widespread. \u201cDemocrats are attempting to use this crisis as a way to get wholesale election changes that fit their far-left agenda,\u201d RNC National Press Secretary Mandi Merritt said. \u201cWhile the RNC of course supports efforts to ensure that no voters are disenfranchised due to emergency protocols, national vote by mail would open the door to its own set of problems, such as potential election fraud and ballot harvesting. \u201cImposing a new system onto states unnecessarily will result in significant problems in the November election, and it is critical we work to preserve the integrity of the democratic process,\u201d she added. In recent weeks, the committee has put some of that money to work, weighing in on behalf of the state in several cases where the pro-Biden Democratic super PAC Priorities USA has also been involved in lawsuits seeking to expand access to voting. Most recently, last week, the RNC and the Nevada Republican Party filed a motion opposing the efforts by Democrats to change rules related to signature matching and allowing party officials or advocates to collect ballots on behalf of voters, a practice known as \u201cvote harvesting,\u201d which is legal in some states but largely opposed by Republican officials. Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, said this effort has long been a focus of his organization, but the coronavirus has ratcheted up their efforts. \u201cIdeally you would have legislation that addresses these things, but where legislators aren\u2019t willing to act, we will take them to court,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cThese were all problems before Covid-19, but this has exacerbated it and raised the stakes.\u201d Beyond the state level lawsuits, Priorities plans to weigh in at the county and local level to ensure that both mail in and in-person voting remain accessible during the pandemic. \u201cWhat we want to make sure we are preventing is a two-tiered voting system\u201d in which wealthy cities and counties have more expanded access to voting and poorer cities and counties do not.",

            "article_content": "The White House\u2019s communications staff got a shakeup Tuesday with the announcement that Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump 2020 campaign\u2019s press secretary and high-profile Republican communicator, is joining the team as the Trump administration\u2019s fourth White House press secretary. McEnany comes to the role with a bevy of Republican communications and television experience, beginning with an internship during the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign, where she worked as an intern at a Tampa field office as a high school student. From there, she held internships at a gubernatorial campaign and with a Florida congressman. A 2010 Georgetown University graduate, McEnany earned a law degree from Harvard University, and began a media career in production at Fox News. Like others in the administration, including President Donald Trump, she has made past controversial comments, such as stoking the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory regarding then-President Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship in 2012 with two tweets appearing to make light of the racist attack. \u201cHow I Met Your Brother \u2013 Never mind, forgot he\u2019s still in that hut in Kenya. #ObamaTVShows,\u201d she posted. And in another: \u201cBirth certificates and college transcripts #ThingsThatEnrageDemocrats\u201d McEnany rose to prominence \u2013 and also captured then-candidate Trump\u2019s attention \u2013 during the 2016 presidential election, when she was frequently on air as a paid CNN political commentator. The role of a pundit, she said, gave her a voice that she hadn\u2019t previously found working in politics. Grisham out as West Wing press secretary without having held a briefing \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of political calculus that goes into decision making, every campaign and primary is trying to position themselves one place or another ideologically. But I\u2019ve always been someone who, I just like to speak my mind and I like to say what I believe and media gives you that freedom to \u2013 you don\u2019t feel like you have to say what someone wants to hear, you can say what you think and what you believe. And one of the reasons I think Donald Trump was so successful is taking that attribute of what I find in media to politics,\u201d she told Georgetown University\u2019s \u201cFly on the Wall\u201d podcast in 2018. After the election, McEnany wrote a book about Trump voters and joined the Republican National Committee as a spokeswoman, shifting to the Trump reelection campaign as national press secretary in February 2019. She\u2019s been a frequent pro-Trump presence on cable and local news in the role, an unabashed defender of the President and his policies. \u201cI was that heavily outnumbered blonde girl fighting for Donald Trump,\u201d McEnany said of her time at CNN, saying that she jumped to the RNC position because she \u201cwanted to be in the fight\u201d and have a more active role in political strategy and planning, while still getting to debate on television. The new White House position is also a homecoming of sorts. McEnany interned in the Bush administration\u2019s press shop as a Georgetown University sophomore, where she was responsible for scouring the news in southeastern US newspapers to help write a daily briefing for the chief of staff, she told the university\u2019s podcast. McEnany recalled \u201cwalking into the White House and passing people like Dana Perino, passing these top-level Bush officials, as a young college student.\u201d Now, she\u2019ll be the top-level official. Those who have worked with her describe her meticulous preparation and attention to detail, a smart yet low-maintenance surrogate who came prepared and never asked aides for talking points. Each Trump press secretary \u2013 Stephanie Grisham, Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer \u2013 has made the role their own in an administration that prides itself on its unorthodox press strategy. It\u2019s unclear how McEnany will exercise the position, though she could take a more public-facing role than her predecessor, Grisham, who never held a press briefing during her time as press secretary and made rare appearances on Fox News. With Trump and senior administration officials directly briefing the press on coronavirus each day, the question of how and when McEnany restarts briefings is much less urgent in the press shop shake-up. McEnany\u2019s credibility as a coronavirus messenger could be tested by comments she made in late February appearing to downplay the severity of the outbreak in the United States. \u201cThis President will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens. We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here,\u201d she said on a now-canceled Fox Business Network program. \u201cWe will not see terrorism come here. And isn\u2019t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d McEnany claimed those comments were taken out of context and said she was \u201cwas asked about travel restrictions & stated the intent of those restrictions\u201d in her response. At 31, McEnany is one of the youngest press secretaries to hold the role. Dee Dee Myers, who served in the Clinton administration, was also 31 when she stepped into the job, but Ron Ziegler was just 29 when he held the title in the Nixon administration. \u201cNever feel like you\u2019re too young to ask for something,\u201d McEnany told the Georgetown University podcast. \u201cYou might just get an opportunity if you knock on that door hard enough.\u201d McEnany underwent a preventative double mastectomy in 2018 after learning she carried the BRCA-2 genetic mutation that put her at risk for breast cancer, something she\u2019s spoken about publicly since. \u201cMy post-mastectomy life is not one embattled but emboldened. I live free of fear and full of hope,\u201d she said, one year after her surgery. She is married to Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Sean Gilmartin and the two welcomed a daughter, Blake, in November.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, late on a Friday night amid the coronavirus pandemic in hopes that you wouldn\u2019t know what he did. Or you\u2019d note it in passing, and then quickly move on to other pressing worries like, well, the coronavirus and its impact on the US economy. You absolutely should not do either of those things. Because, while the removal of the intelligence community\u2019s watchdog is less obviously urgent in your own life than coronavirus, the mentality that informs the decision to remove Atkinson is hugely corrosive to our American system of government. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Let\u2019s go through the basics. On Friday night \u2013 the favored night for politicians to dump their worst news \u2013 Trump announced he had fired Atkinson. \u201cAs is the case with regard to other positions where I, as President, have the power of appointment \u2026 it is vital that I have the fullest confidence in the appointees serving as inspectors general,\u201d Trump wrote in a letter to the House and Senate Intelligence committees informing them of the move. \u201cThat is no longer the case with regard to this Inspector General.\u201d At issue was Atkinson\u2019s decision last fall to inform Congress that a whistleblower complaint had been filed to his office about the Trump administration. That complaint eventually turned into the basis for the House impeachment investigation into Trump\u2019s July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and Trump\u2019s eventual impeachment by the House. (He was later acquitted in the Senate.) Republicans argued that Atkinson had overstepped his authority by informing Congress of the existence of a complaint. That job should have technically fallen to then-Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who was legally bound to let Congress know of the complaint no more than seven days after Atkinson had determined that it was credible. Atkinson made that determination on August 26, 2019. Maguire didn\u2019t turn the complaint over to Congress until September 25, saying the slowdown was necessary because the complaint involved the President and therefore he had to work with the Justice Department to see if there was anything covered by executive privilege in the complaint. Put simply: What Atkinson did was nothing more than his job. He is \u2013 or was \u2013 in charge of oversight of the intelligence community. Whistleblower complaints go to him as a matter of course and Atkinson\u2019s job is determine if they are indeed credible and need to be shown to the relevant committees in Congress. That\u2019s the job. Which is the point Atkinson made in a statement Sunday night \u2013 48 hours after learning he had been removed from his job. Here\u2019s the key bit: \u201cIt is hard not to think that the President\u2019s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so. I was legally obligated to ensure that whistleblowers had an effective and authorized means to disclose urgent matters involving classified information to the congressional intelligence committees, and that when they did blow the whistle in an authorized manner, their identities would be protected as a guard against reprisals.\u201d Here\u2019s why Atkinson\u2019s firing matters: Because it reveals \u2013 again \u2013 that Trump doesn\u2019t really get the whole idea of independence and oversight within the administration. Inspectors general are in place to ensure that leaders follow the law and that the rank-and-file within the government feel as though they have a place to raise concerns without fear of reprisal. The independence of IGs is critical to that process because you a) can\u2019t provide adequate oversight if you are in the pocket of the President (or any other leader) and you can\u2019t be trusted as a safe harbor for concerns of the rank-and-file if you are perceived as a lackey of the President. Trump, of course, doesn\u2019t get the idea of independence within the government. He didn\u2019t get it with the Justice Department when they launched a special counsel investigation into Russian meddling attempts in the 2016 election. And he doesn\u2019t get it when it comes to Atkinson and the intelligence community. In Trump\u2019s mind, every single person in the administration works for him and therefore needs to be entirely loyal to him. Job descriptions, oversight, necessary independence are all brushed aside as excuses. For Trump, you either are on his team or you are an enemy. It\u2019s how he has always seen the world as two-sided: Pro-Trump and anti-Trump. While viewing things that way is OK in private industry, it\u2019s a deep misunderstanding of how our government is built to work. The President isn\u2019t a king or an emperor. This is a democracy where the peoples\u2019 will matters. There are checks and balances purposely built into the system to ensure that the voice of anyone in government who sees a problem feels comfortable saying, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t \u2013 or chooses not to \u2013 understand the difference between his old job and his new one. But we shouldn\u2019t make the same mistake. This isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s government. It\u2019s all of ours.",

            "article_content": "Campaign staffers are hunkered down at home instead of working from their headquarters or in primary states. Traditional fundraisers, campaign rallies and speeches are replaced with virtual events that have faced technological snafus. And a candidate with reason to celebrate after a series of wins pushed him closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination has been sidelined not only from the campaign trail, but also the news cycle. Just as people across the country are grappling with a new way of life amid the coronavirus pandemic, Joe Biden is also facing the uncertainty arising from the global health crisis with his team forced to adjust to a new reality of campaigning. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race From his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden told reporters on a call Friday that his campaign had hired a professional team to set up the ability to broadcast live on television networks from there \u2013 potentially with the small group of reporters that travels with his campaign present. He said he aims to be up and running by Monday, holding regular briefings on the response to the coronavirus pandemic and answering questions from reporters. \u201cHopefully by Monday, we\u2019re going to be in a very different place in terms of being able to be in communication with all of you,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI promise you\u2019re going to be hearing more of me than you want, probably.\u201d It\u2019s part of a slew of changes Biden\u2019s campaign is making as it attempts to close out a primary race against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and transition to a general election showdown with President Donald Trump in the midst of unprecedented circumstances. For Biden personally, the pandemic has forced a drastic change in focus. \u201cI find myself literally on the phone with my key advisers, medical advisers and economic advisers literally four, five hours a day, going through detailed memoranda on what we should be doing,\u201d Biden said Friday. \u201cMy whole focus has basically been how we deal with this crisis, and quite frankly, thus far it\u2019s been less about how we campaign or make stark differences between the President and I,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some are just self-evident.\u201d For his campaign \u2013 which was in the process of building out his senior staff for the general election before it had to order everyone in his Philadelphia headquarters and in regional field offices to work from home \u2013 the changes are tactical. Aides say one major focus for Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks is beefing up its digital footprint, including organizing, fundraising, advertising and video production, as the campaign prepares to turn to an online format to relay its message and draw in voters. Biden\u2019s campaign is looking for ways to leverage the former vice president\u2019s skills as a one-on-one retail politician in an environment in which he\u2019s not able to meet people or shake hands. He\u2019s already done virtual events \u2013 an online town hall on video that was derailed by tech challenges and a telephone town hall with several participants able to ask Biden questions. But his campaign is looking for more individualized ways for Biden to connect with voters, supporters and donors. Technical trouble spoils Joe Biden's first 'virtual town hall' In a fundraising email Friday, his campaign told small-dollar donors that Biden would FaceTime some of the people who contributed \u2013 a tactic a former rival, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, often used that sparked social media attention. The campaign is also considering virtual ropelines, where people could wait in front of their phones or laptops to interact one-on-one with Biden on video, said Rob Flaherty, Biden\u2019s digital director. \u201cWe\u2019re really focused on, \u2018OK, how does somebody actually have an opportunity to interact with the vice president?\u2019\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be playing with a bunch of different formats to see what sticks in the space of making sure the VP gets those interactions.\u201d More broadly, Flaherty said, Biden\u2019s campaign is looking for new ways to build a sense of community among Biden\u2019s supporters \u2013 with each other and with his campaign. It\u2019s the kind of digital work that he would have needed regardless to take place as Biden shifts his focus to Trump and builds for the general election \u2013 but now needs to happen on an accelerated timeline. The campaign\u2019s view of the role the former vice president can play is informed in part by the audience a 3-minute, 21-second video of him explaining the Iran crisis in early January had drawn. The off-the-cuff riff is Biden\u2019s fifth-most watched video on Facebook \u2013 and Flaherty said it showed people looked to Biden as an expert who could explain what was happening in Washington and why it mattered. Now, Biden aides are considering podcasts and long-form videos among possible ways to reach people who are now at home and online. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018OK, all this stuff\u2019s going on in Washington,\u2019 and they view the VP as this kind of voice of reason \u2013 calm and understanding,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cThere\u2019s a political benefit to that, which is why people want him to be president right now. But at the same time, that\u2019s a service. The country is looking for somebody like that.\u201d The team is also looking to expand its already existing digital organizing program, aides say, to equip supporters and volunteers with tools to conduct phone banking and send text messages from their homes as traditional field organizing has ground to a halt. The campaign is holding off on airing new television advertisements, instead focusing on digital ads until the primary calendar is more settled, as many states have put off their contests due to concerns over the coronavirus. An ad Biden\u2019s campaign began airing on Facebook and Instagram this week, targeting voters in Wisconsin, could be a model for future ads. The minute-long video features Biden delivering an uplifting message focused on responding to the coronavirus crisis in his closing statement from Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate on CNN, and weaves in stories from local news reports of Americans helping each other. After seeing an uptick in its online contributions earlier this month, Biden has continued his requests for money from small dollar online donors, though aides acknowledge the requests are coming at a time of economic uncertainty for many in this country. The campaign has committed to holding virtual fundraisers in lieu of its in-person money events, with its first on Friday. The Biden campaign has changed its fundraising policy to begin collecting money for the general election, two sources said. But there could be challenges to bringing in the high dollar campaign contributions on which his campaign has relied for most of this primary cycle. One Biden bundler said he put his typical fundraising emails to his donor network on hold as the financial impact of coronavirus is top of mind for many Americans. Another bundler expressed concern about whether the limitations in place due to coronavirus could affect fundraising in the long term as the campaign begins to pivot to the general election. If Biden secures the Democratic nomination, he would be able to raise money through joint committees with the Democratic National Committee, a type of fundraising that includes in person events that can draw large checks from donors. Bloomberg campaign transfers $18 million to DNC \u201cThe DNC certainly has been reasonably successful, but once you have the nominee your fundraising should increase ten or twenty fold, and they kind of wait for that to happen,\u201d the bundler said. A strategist connected to the pro-Joe Biden super PAC Unite the Country says it received a $25,000 check Thursday and a $100,000 check Wednesday \u2013 and that so far, the super PAC hasn\u2019t seen any donors back away from commitments amid the coronavirus pandemic. The source said Democrats connected to the super PAC had all planned to travel to meet donors this week, and that \u201cthat obviously didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re adapting the same way everyone else is, and I\u2019m not at the point yet where I fear that money is not coming in or donors are not answering our calls,\u201d the source said. On Friday, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg transferred $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s organizing efforts, a move the Biden campaign applauded. \u201cWe need to compete with the war chest that Donald Trump, the RNC, and their right-wing allies have amassed, and this will go a long way in ensuring that we can fund the grassroots efforts in key battleground states that will be necessary to win this November,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager and communications director for Joe Biden. The former vice president has yet to secure the nomination as Sanders remains in the race and assesses the state of his campaign. Biden\u2019s team has not directly called for Sanders to drop his presidential bid, with aides publicly saying it\u2019s a decision for the Vermont senator to make. But they\u2019ve clearly outlined their case that Sanders\u2019 path to the nomination is virtually non-existent at this point. \u201cBiden\u2019s delegate pathway to the Democratic nomination is increasingly clear,\u201d Bedingfield wrote in a campaign memo after Biden\u2019s sweep in this week\u2019s primary contests. \u201cIn order to close the delegate deficit he faces, Senator Sanders would need to win every remaining contest by roughly 40 points.\u201d With the nomination within reach, Biden\u2019s campaign will need to build a general election strategy, including bulking up its staff, setting up infrastructures in battleground states, and structuring its messaging, in unprecedented times as it prepares to face off against Trump. In photos: Presidential candidate Joe Biden The campaign is also planning for a \u201cvigorous vetting process\u201d for selecting Biden\u2019s running mate after he committed to adding a woman to the Democratic ticket, a campaign aide said.  The campaign has declined to detail what this process will look like or when it will formally begin, but the former vice president and some close to him are keenly aware of what the process entails, having undergone it themselves when Biden joined the Democratic ticket in 2008. Much of the campaign\u2019s messaging recently has focused on coronavirus, an issue that is top of mind for millions across the country at this time. Biden and his campaign have responded in real-time to President Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, detailed its own plans for responding to the pandemic, and assembled a team of public health experts to advise the former vice president. The crisis has given the former vice president a chance to reinforce his message he could step into the Oval Office on day one ready to lead. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons pointed to Biden\u2019s compassion and empathy and his longtime experience in government, including work implementing the Obama administration\u2019s Recovery Act, as emblematic of a leader equipped to handle a crisis like the coronavirus. \u201cWho Joe is and what his lifetime of public service has been about meets this moment,\u201d Coons said. \u201cJoe understands how to connect with and care for and fight for people who are being hurt. We are about to go through a really tough period where lots of people are nervous and anxious, and they want to see a federal response that is compassionate, effective and well led.\u201d \u201cHaving a crisis like this will focus the attention of the American people on who has the experience to lead us through challenges and who has the values that we want to see,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "The White House insists President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t need a coronavirus test, despite several members of his political circle self-quarantining after they came into contact with a man later diagnosed with the disease. They include Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who rode in \u201cThe Beast\u201d limousine with Trump in the Sunshine State on Monday, before climbing up the steps of Air Force One behind the President. Incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is also staying home until Wednesday despite his test coming back negative. Another Trump friend, Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, was pictured shaking hands with the President on Friday. Revelations that the disease was only one step removed from the President himself underlined how its advance could put any American at risk and are unlikely to quell public anxiety. They also underscore the elevated risk to politicians whose work necessarily brings them into contact with large numbers of people \u2013 especially in the heat of a general election year. The drama is focusing attention on the fact that the three men left vying for the White House are all in their mid-to-late 70s \u2013 a group with a high set of risk factors for coronavirus complications. The issue of Trump\u2019s health coincided with an alarming day as the number of infected Americans rose above 700, hard-hit Italy went into total lockdown and Wall Street stocks crashed to their worst day since the Great Recession amid widening fears that the crisis could tip the economy into a recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday asked all personnel based at its headquarters to work from home due to an employee who may have the virus, becoming the first federal agency to ask its Washington employees to stay home. White House to pitch economic stimulus proposals to wary GOP senators On Tuesday Trump and top economic officials will pitch Senate Republicans on a payroll tax cut and other policy proposals meant to ease the economic fallout of coronavirus during a closed door lunch. Top White House officials have tried to dispense calm amid rising panic, promising significant measures to stimulate the economy and pointing out that the risk to most Americans remained low. But their task was completed by a new volley of chaos, political recrimination and confusion spun around the coronavirus pandemic by the President himself in a prolonged Twitter spree. The spectacle of the virus forcing the isolation of some people who regularly spend time with the President reflects how fast the parameters of normal life are changing. After all, Trump spends his life surrounded by Secret Service agents equipped with the most sophisticated technology to ward off all kinds of threats with every potential risk gamed out in advance. But all of that may offer little protection from a virus that is easily transmitted and is spreading around the world. Gaetz learned soon after the Air Force One took off about his contact with the patient at the Conservative Political Action Conference. He then decided to self-quarantine as a precaution. But White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Trump was not tested because \u201che has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,\u201d Grisham said. US coronavirus cases rise sharply to more than 700 and cruise ship with 21 more patients arrives in port Vice President Mike Pence, who also was at the conference, revealed that he was not tested either. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona earlier revealed they came into contact with the infected man and were self-quarantining as a precaution. Gaetz\u2019s office tweeted that he had been tested even though he was not experiencing any symptoms and expected results soon. The encounters with the infected man all occurred at CPAC \u2013 a pro-Trump conference outside Washington late last month that ironically rang with claims that the media was inflating the threat of coronavirus to damage the President politically. Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist, said the protocols on testing for the President and vice president were not surprising. \u201cTo be fair, the norm would be you would test the direct contact, so the person who actually shook hands with the person with coronavirus,\u201d Gounder said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d For the presidential candidates, coronavirus precautions don't apply \u201cYou would only test the President and others if their direct contacts were testing positive. Now the exception to that would be if the President or others developed symptoms, then you would probably go ahead and test.\u201d Still, the President holds special symbolic value and occupies the highest public trust in the nation, so questions about his health are always elevated \u2013 even in less fraught times. He has his own physician in the White House and his health is more closely watched than that of the average American. Trump seems to be making few concessions to the virus. He shook hands with well-wishers during a weekend in Florida that included a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort. His potential rivals in November, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, also campaigned on the eve of the Super Tuesday II primaries that could go a long way to deciding the destiny of the nomination. Sanders, who says his campaign is in touch with local officials about disease prevention before the rallies, admitted to thinking about the issue on the trail. \u201cI have used more hand sanitizer in the last two weeks than I\u2019ve used in my entire life,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, before pivoting to criticism of Trump\u2019s leadership on the crisis and the plight of Americans who wanted to get tested for the coronavirus but lacked basic health insurance. The drama regarding Trump\u2019s inner circle came on a day when Pence struggled to smooth over the confusion and disinformation sown about the virus by the President himself. His efforts in a White House news conference reflect Trump\u2019s refusal to play the role of calming honest broker traditionally expected of a President during a national crisis. Trump briefly appeared before reporters Monday evening as part of a news conference clearly designed to stem raging stock market contagion after a historic rout on Wall Street fears and rising anxiety about the toll of the virus as it crosses the nation. He vowed the package will be \u201cvery, very dramatic and we have a great economy, we have a strong economy, but this blindsided the world and I think we\u2019ve handled it very, very well.\u201d Trump promised a raft of measures \u2013 including payroll tax cuts, sick leave for hourly workers and support for the travel industry \u2013 and a fuller news conference on Tuesday. The most expansive proposals would require congressional approval and it is not clear whether Trump\u2019s proposals will win favor with Democrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate. Senate GOP cool to new economic stimulus measures Pence then conducted an orthodox news conference, surrounded by experts and top officials, that bore little resemblance to divisive, misleading Trump Twitter tirade only hours earlier. \u201cIt is important to remember what President Trump said \u2013 we are all in this together,\u201d Pence said. The vice president also insisted, after his obligatory praise for Trump\u2019s management of the crisis, that the President had made it a \u201cpriority\u201d to get sick passengers off a cruise ship that docked in Oakland, California, after days in limbo at sea. In fact, on Friday, the President had suggested he\u2019d prefer the passengers remained on the ship to avoid inflating the numbers of coronavirus sufferers in official figures on US soil. Hours earlier, Trump had taken to Twitter to suggest coronavirus was far less problematic than seasonal flu, accused Democrats of weaponizing the crisis and media of inflaming it. Yet the vice president asked those same journalists \u2014 who the President sees as purveyors of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 to perform the public service of transmitting details of new government public health guidelines and to publicize a new website: coronavirus.gov. The message delivered by Pence and top officials is that almost all Americans who get the virus will not die and that the economy will be just fine. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the strong US economy could ride out the pandemic. \u201cThis is not like the financial crisis, where we don\u2019t know the end in sight,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months\u201d While Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters that 2.1 million tests were shipped, waiting to be shipped or ordered, some state officials warned that there still wasn\u2019t sufficient capacity to track the spread of the virus. \u201cIt has been getting better, but in my opinion not at a fast enough rate,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have started in this position anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we saw China happening. It was no secret. We knew someone was going to get on an airplane in China and come to the United States. That we\u2019re saying that China actually had faster testing capacity than we have is not acceptable to me.\u201d UPDATE: This story has been updated with reporting that the President is now expected to attend the Senate Republicans\u2019 luncheon. CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly, Kaitlan Collins, Rob McLean and Caroline Kelly contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The week that gave Joe Biden a sorely needed political comeback also dealt Donald Trump some of the greatest challenges of his presidency. As Biden\u2019s fledgling campaign roared back to life with a stronger than anticipated win in South Carolina and wave of Democratic endorsements, Trump was being tested on a level he hasn\u2019t before: facing a crisis that wasn\u2019t of his own making. For the last several months, Trump and his aides have centered his reelection pitch to voters around a thriving economy. The novel coronavirus outbreak has sparked a public health quandary and threatened to upend that message, all while the candidate who will be Trump\u2019s chief rival for the presidency comes into clearer view. Amid unanswered questions about how damaging the coronavirus outbreak will ultimately be, the events of the week have potentially set the stage for a general election showdown between Trump and Biden, who used his cable news victory lap after his big win in South Carolina to criticize the Trump administration for being slow to distribute test kits for the coronavirus nationwide. When it comes to coronavirus, Trump has often seemed on a different page from health officials in his own government. He has been repeatedly corrected by top health officials on the speed of developing a vaccine, including during a meeting Monday and later after a visit to the National Institutes of Health. Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by scientists and public health experts rather than political spinners, is frequently briefing lawmakers and the press, meeting with stakeholders and experts, and even privately admitting early missteps. Without proof, Trump blamed former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for slowing down diagnostic testing and dismissed death rate assessments from the World Health Organization based on his own \u201chunch.\u201d Trump muddles coronavirus message as response team struggles to match 'wishful thinking' Confusion over the virus has created an unpredictable stock market, with two of the best days in the Dow\u2019s history and one of its worst-ever point losses both this week. And a strong jobs report released Friday morning \u2013 the biggest since May 2018 \u2013 was buried amid the President\u2019s own messaging surrounding coronavirus. New CDC guidance says older adults should 'stay at home as much as possible' due to coronavirus But the Trump campaign maintains that the President\u2019s pitch to voters is still on solid ground. \u201cThe fundamentals of the American economy are so strong \u2013 exceedingly strong,\u201d Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CNN, citing market rebounds this week. Amid questions of how the outbreak could impact campaigning, Murtaugh insisted the President\u2019s signature \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rallies will not be canceled. Murtaugh also suggested there is a value to voters in keeping a high-profile surrogate like Pence focused more on the administration\u2019s response than campaigning. Pence, who traveled to Minnesota and Washington state with task force members on Thursday, postponed a political event scheduled in Wisconsin and sent the second lady to an event in Minnesota in his stead. \u201cAmericans want to see their elected leaders doing their jobs,\u201d Murtaugh said. Biden\u2019s climb back to the top of the Democratic field alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could also force a shift in strategy for the Trump campaign, which has cast the 2020 election as a choice between a roaring economy and socialism, though Trump\u2019s aides have argued they can still make that argument if Biden is the nominee. Biden \u201cis not a moderate candidate,\u201d Trump\u2019s communications director told CNN, citing his positions on gun control, healthcare and the Green New Deal. \u201cWe truly view it as a heads we win, tails they lose situation,\u201d Murtaugh said of the consolidated Democratic field. \u201cThe President is itching for an opponent. We just want to know who it\u2019s going to be.\u201d How Joe Biden's campaign is protecting itself from cyber attacks Privately officials have remained most concerned about a Trump-Biden matchup. Those fears dwindled some as Biden\u2019s campaign seemed to recede, but they have returned since his comeback last Saturday. The campaign has continued internal polls to give them an idea of how the President would perform against Biden in states they view as crucial to victory in November like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Officials believe Biden may get a boost in these states once the Democratic Party has coalesced around a candidate. While there hasn\u2019t been much public polling released since Biden\u2019s Super Tuesday victories, there are some indications that Biden would present Trump with a stronger reelection challenge than Sanders. A Quinnipiac poll of registered voters in swing states conducted last month shows Biden with slightly larger margins against Trump than Sanders in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Trump edges Sanders and Biden in head-to-head matchups in Wisconsin 50 to 43% and 49 to 42%, respectively. There are questions as to what kind of a candidate Biden could be in a general election in light of his performance at the beginning of the Democratic primary season. \u201cHe could be very formidable. He could also be a disaster,\u201d a GOP strategist said, questioning Biden\u2019s long record as a Washington insider. When it comes to attacking potential rivals, the campaign is still taking cues from the candidate. Biden and Sanders brace for one-on-one battle in new phase of Democratic race \u201cUltimately we follow the President\u2019s lead,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cHe is the communications director and the campaign manager and all of those things rolled in. We\u2019ll follow what the President does.\u201d As Biden surges, Senate Republicans are also sharpening their investigations involving Hunter Biden\u2019s work at a Ukrainian energy company. While Republicans publicly insist their efforts have nothing to do with Biden\u2019s campaign, they are using their powers in the Senate to look into a host of matters that they believe could shine negative light on the former vice president \u2013 and help Trump as the race heads into a crucial period. Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted corruptly in Ukraine. \u201cThat will be a major issue in the campaign,\u201d Trump said during an interview on Fox News this week regarding Burisma. \u201cI will bring it up all the time, because I don\u2019t see any way out.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, is leading the charge for an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work at the Ukrainian energy company. The investigation has the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who told Fox News Biden\u2019s work is \u201cworth taking a look at.\u201d Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the race after a poor showing on Super Tuesday, but he could still remain a threat to the President his wealth of ads have irked. Bloomberg endorsed Biden shortly after bowing out of the race \u2014 which could be a significant boon to Biden, a candidate who has struggled with field organization and could eventually be the nominee for a party that has failed to keep up with the Trump campaign\u2019s data juggernaut. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has more than 2,400 staff in 43 states and territories and, now, those staffers will focus their efforts and millions of dollars on making Biden the Democratic nominee and eventual president. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign says it will try to leverage his ground and data operations to help Biden through an existing super PAC. There are practically no limits on what Bloomberg and his super PAC can do to aid Biden, whether that\u2019s running pro-Biden ads or overseeing a field operation to assist the former vice president. The only restriction, experts say: Bloomberg and his aides cannot coordinate their spending decisions with Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden campaign launches its largest ad buy in 2020 election \u201cAs long as Team Bloomberg doesn\u2019t talk to Team Biden about what it\u2019s doing \u2013 how it\u2019s spending Bloomberg\u2019s fortune to support Biden \u2013 it\u2019s not subject to any limits at all,\u201d said Paul Ryan, a veteran campaign-finance lawyer who is now vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause. A Bloomberg apparatus aimed at turning out low-propensity voters, the GOP strategist said, \u201cwill be huge.\u201d \u201cAll these states \u2013 Michigan was decided by 10,000 votes, and if they\u2019re able to organize in Detroit and some of these communities and get people to vote or go vote early, that could make a huge difference.\u201d The campaign downplayed the impact Bloomberg could have. \u201cA super PAC does not have the same impact as direct spending by a candidate. President Trump is going to have every single resource he needs for his reelection. This campaign is not going to be about who has more resources. We will have every penny we need and then some,\u201d Murtaugh said, adding that the election will be \u201cabout the President\u2019s record\u201d and the economy, \u201cversus an extreme left opponent.\u201d CNN\u2019s Cristina Alesci, Fredreka Schouten, Maegan Vazquez, Stephen Collinson and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump likes pictures. Visuals. Maps. And one map in particular: This county-by-county one, which he tweeted out to his 70+ million followers last fall: pic.twitter.com/dOta1Z9gtZ On Tuesday, speaking to the National Association of Counties, Trump returned, again, to that map. \u201cOh I love those beautiful red areas that middle of the map,\u201d Trump told the assembled audience. \u201cA little blue here, a little blue there, and everything else \u2026 everything else is bright red.\u201d You can see why Trump loves that map so, so much. There is, as he says, lots and lots of red on it and very little blue \u2013 evidence of the fact that in the 2016 election, Trump won 2,626 counties to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 487, according to The Associated Press. But that is literally (Chris Traeger voice) the only thing that map proves. What this map doesn\u2019t prove is what Trump thinks it proves and why he loves it so much: That America is overwhelmingly pro-Trump or pro-Republican. Why not? Because Trump\u2019s favorite map doesn\u2019t take into account one very critical piece of the electoral equation: Population. As Haya El Nasser wrote on the US Census website back in 2017: \u201cMore than half of all residents live in just 143 big counties (in terms of the number of residents), according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau county estimates. That means less than half of the population is spread out across the remaining 2,999 small counties.\u201d He also notes that 14 states \u2013 Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2013 don\u2019t have a single \u201cbig\u201d county, defined as having 926 people (or more) for every square mile. So what the county-by-county map shows then is that, if land voted, Republicans (and, by extension, Trump) would be totally dominant as a force in American politics. They aren\u2019t. In fact, remember this underlying fact about the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton: 65,853,516 votes Donald Trump: 62,984,825 votes If you\u2019re looking for a much more accurate representation of what the 2016 election actually looked like, this one by cartoonist Randall Munroe on his XKCD website is pretty good. That Trump\u2019s favorite visual from the 2016 election is one that deeply misleads about not only that election but also about the partisan splits in the country is not terribly surprising. Trump has shown a tendency throughout his life \u2013 in and out of politics \u2013 to bend and break facts to fit his preferred narrative. Trump\u2019s loving embrace of the county-by-county map is just more of the same here. Which doesn\u2019t, of course, make the map say what Trump says it does. Because, well, it doesn\u2019t.",

The door to Tommy Tuberville\u2019s campaign bus said \u201c#MAGA.\u201d Bradley Byrne urged fans at the Alabama-LSU football game to raise the roof when President Donald Trump walked to his stadium seats. For the former attorney general, former Auburn football coach and congressman, the Republican primary race for a US Senate seat in Alabama has come down to one \u201cbig thing,\u201d according to GOP Rep. Robert Aderholt. \u201cWhich candidate is going to support Trump\u2019s principles?\u201d Each Republican has jumped on his competitor\u2019s rare break from the President. A month before the 2016 election, as Trump came under widespread criticism for bragging about groping women, Byrne said Trump \u201cis not fit to be President.\u201d In 2019, Tuberville said he was \u201cpissed off\u201d at Trump because military veterans \u201ccan\u2019t get health care.\u201d And most famously, Trump publicly mocked and ultimately fired Sessions after he recused himself from overseeing the Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference of the 2016 election because he served on the Trump campaign. But Sessions, who held this US Senate seat for 20 years before joining the Trump administration, is expected to emerge on Tuesday as one of two candidates in the fierce runoff election held on March 31. The winner of that race will then face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November, the best pickup opportunity for Republicans in the Senate. Democrat Doug Jones facing reelection headwinds as he votes to convict Trump \u201cSenator Sessions is a known commodity, who has a great deal of personal integrity and people recognize that,\u201d Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re going to respond to him like they have before.\u201d Byrne\u2019s supporters say that his campaign has enough momentum to make the next phase of the race. Byrne campaign spokeswoman Lenze Morris called it a \u201ca three-man race for two spots,\u201d without a guarantee for who will fill them. \u201cPublic and internal polling has been all over the place due to the high number of undecideds and voters changing their minds,\u201d Morris said. \u201cOver the last week, we\u2019ve seen the undecideds breaking toward Bradley because he is the only person with a proven record of supporting President Trump.\u201d The Sessions and Tuberville campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. A looming question is whether Trump would side with the Republican who faces Sessions in the runoff election. Merrill said he thought Trump had kept quiet so far in part in deference to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who has endorsed Sessions. There\u2019s also a debate in Republican circles in the state about how much a Trump attack on Sessions would affect his candidacy. In 2017, the President endorsed appointed Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, who was defeated in the runoff election against former Judge Roy Moore. Trump then supported Moore, who narrowly lost to Jones after women alleged Moore sexually abused them when they were teenagers decades ago. Moore, who denied all wrong-doing from the accusations, is running again but has not broken into the top tier of candidates. Red state Democrat doesn't think vote to convict Trump will hurt reelection chances Instead, the top three candidates are focusing their attacks on each other, while claiming the pro-Trump, Christian conservative mantle. Tuberville has run as an outsider hell-bent on draining the swamp and ousting \u201ccareer politicians.\u201d In one video, Tuberville said, \u201cGod sent us Donald Trump, because God knew we were in trouble.\u201d Meanwhile Byrne has boasted of voting with Trump 97% of the time, calling himself \u201cpro-life,\u201d \u201cpro-gun\u201d and \u201cpro-Wall.\u201d In one Byrne campaign ad, the actors knocked Tuberville for getting fired from Auburn \u2013 even though he racked up an impressive six consecutive wins against in-state rival Alabama \u2013 and Sessions since he \u201clet the President down.\u201d \u201cAnd Hillary (Clinton) still ain\u2019t in jail,\u201d added another actor. In 2014, Sessions was so beloved in the state that he did not face an opponent. Now, he\u2019s likely to not get 50% in the primary. He has responded to the intraparty attacks by reminding Alabama that he was the first senator to endorse Trump \u2013 and never said a \u201ccross word\u201d about him. Sessions has also made an issue of Tuberville\u2019s residency, calling him a \u201ctourist\u201d who moved from Florida to run for Senate. Merrill says the race will turn even more competitive in the runoff. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Some moderate Democrats alarmed by Bernie Sanders\u2019 rapid ascension as their party\u2019s presidential front-runner are scrambling for ways to halt his candidacy ahead of Super Tuesday\u2019s coast-to-coast contests. But, so far, many of the party\u2019s major donors have remained on the sidelines \u2013 holding out hope that another consensus, moderate candidate could emerge from the still-crowded field after the next round of voting and wary of triggering a backlash from Sanders\u2019 devoted supporter base. Meanwhile, supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden, whose own campaign has floundered since primary voters started heading to the polls, are touting a super PAC supporting his candidacy as the best vehicle for wealthy Democrats seeking an alternative to the Vermont senator. The stakes are high: On Saturday, voters in South Carolina head to the polls in the first-in-the South primary. Days later, the nomination fight barrels through 14 Super Tuesday states \u2013 including delegate-rich California and Texas. Sanders, who has campaigned in those states in recent days, could rack up enough wins by mid-March to build an insurmountable delegate lead. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cThere is anxiety about whether (Sanders) can win and whether he will be a drag down-ballot,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, a coalition of Democratic political donors co-founded by financier George Soros. But, he said, \u201cthere is no sign that I pick up among the donors that I deal with of any active \u2018Stop Bernie\u2019 measure.\u201d The party\u2019s contributors have not coalesced around an anti-Sanders strategy, in part, because of the fluid nature of a race that saw Biden in the pole position for most of 2019, said David Brock, a veteran Democratic operative who serves as chairman of an anti-Trump super PAC. Over the course of the campaign, other candidates, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, surged in popularity. Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has spent nearly half a billion dollars on the race, was viewed as a potential moderate foil to Sanders until a shaky performance in his debut on the debate stage last week. \u201cIt\u2019s only been in the last week or so where a real panic has set in that Sanders could be the nominee,\u201d Brock said. \u201cThe donor class is, as usual, way behind the eight ball,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who opposes Sanders. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really perceive a threat from Sanders at the beginning, when it was clearly there. And now they see it, and they think it\u2019s too late.\u201d Bernard Schwartz, a Democratic megadonor, told CNBC this week that he has been trying to reach out to Democratic leaders in Congress to encourage them to endorse another candidate to thwart Sanders. He did not immediately respond to a CNN interview request. But, despite the concerns about Sanders\u2019 hard-left positions, some donors have begun to view his candidacy in a new light, arguing that the self-described democratic socialist might have a narrow path to a general election victory \u2013 given his fundraising strength, loyal supporter base and dogged advocacy on kitchen-table issues, such as health care, that have animated the Democratic electorate. \u201cPeople are taking another look,\u201d LaMarche said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like winning to get people to reconsider their views.\u201d In a Medium post this week, entitled \u201cDon\u2019t Panic,\u201d Democratic donor and activist Dimitri Mehlhorn wrote that \u201cwhile he may not be our best bet, Bernie is a viable general election candidate.\u201d Among his attributes, Mehlhorn wrote: Sanders\u2019 ability to connect with the white working-class voters who skewed heavily toward Trump in 2016, his popularity with young voters and his performance in head-to-head polling matchups against Trump. Apart from a digital video this week that slams Sanders\u2019 past record on guns, Bloomberg has not trained his considerable firepower on the Vermont senator on the airwaves so far. And Democratic strategists warn Sanders is racing to the Super Tuesday states with his decades-long record in public life largely unvetted. Brock, a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton who conducted opposition research into Sanders during the 2016 presidential race, said many voters still know little about Sanders, his policies and past positions. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous that he\u2019s unvetted at this moment when he\u2019s poised to possibly wrap this up,\u201d he said. The job of taking Sanders to task should fall to Bloomberg, Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign in 2012, argued on CNN this week. \u201cForty percent of voters will vote in the next week. People are making up their minds every day, and somebody\u2019s got to point out Bernie Sanders\u2019 flaws,\u201d he said.  Bloomberg has \u201cthe biggest checkbook.\u201d So far, the two anti-Sanders groups to emerge in recent months have not spent substantial sums in a presidential campaign where advertising already is nearing the $1 billion mark. One, the Big Tent Project Fund, has reported spending about $570,000 on anti-Sanders activity, according to its filings with the Federal Election Commission. Another group that had been active ahead of the Iowa caucuses, a political committee aligned with the Democratic Majority for Israel, spent roughly $702,000 on its advertising targeting Sanders, according Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG). Biden is counting on a win in South Carolina\u2019s primary Saturday to revive his candidacy. African Americans are expected to make up about 60% of Saturday\u2019s Democratic electorate, based on past turnout. And Biden got a boost Wednesday with an endorsement there from Rep. Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the US House of Representatives who is the nation\u2019s highest-ranking African American in Congress and a respected figure in the state\u2019s black community. But a few days later, the former vice president faces the 14 Super Tuesday states \u2013 and questions about whether he has the financial resources to mount a competitive campaign across the country. This week, his campaign announced it would run its first ads in Super Tuesday states, which it described as a \u201csix-figure buy\u201d in eight states. By comparison, Bloomberg already has spent more than $160 million on advertising and future reservations in all 14 states that will vote March 3, CMAG\u2019s tally shows. And Sanders has spent nearly $15 million to advertise in Super Tuesday states. Biden entered February with just $7.1 million in cash reserves, according to his campaign\u2019s most recent filings with the FEC. By comparison, Sanders had nearly $17 million remaining in his campaign account. Warren was in the most precarious position among the top-tier Democratic candidates, with just $2.3 million remaining her account, including $400,000 she drew from a line of credit her campaign secured in January. (Warren\u2019s aides say she raised an additional $14 million in the days leading up to Nevada\u2019s caucuses.) Apart from the two billionaires seeking the nomination, Sanders has built a massive fundraising advantage over the rest of the field, driven largely small-dollar donors who contribute online. In all, he\u2019s taken in more than $120 million in contributions during the election cycle. And Sanders\u2019 army of grassroots donors have demonstrated their willingness to rally to his aid when he\u2019s under attack. Earlier this year, the Democratic Majority for Israel\u2019s PAC released its ads in Iowa, questioning Sanders\u2019 electability and his health following his heart attack last fall. His campaign swiftly denounced the effort in an email to supporters and on social media. Within 24 hours, Sanders\u2019 aides said they had raised $1.3 million. Outside of Capitol Hill, Wall Street may be the epicenter of anxiety over Sanders\u2019 march to the nomination. He has said billionaires should not exist and wants to break up big banks \u2013 a step he argues is necessary to ward against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. His plans include introducing taxes on stock trades to help fund his free college proposals and imposing new taxes on income and accumulated wealth. His \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, if enacted, would end private insurance and upend the health care industry that represents nearly 20% of the nation\u2019s economic activity. An example of the intense animosity: Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein recently said on Twitter that Sanders is \u201cjust as polarizing as Trump AND he\u2019ll ruin our economy.\u201d Sanders\u2019 retort: \u201cI welcome the hatred of crooks who destroyed our economy.\u201d Venture capitalist Alan Patricof, a longtime Democratic donor and fundraiser backing Biden, said both Sanders and Warren hold views that are too extreme for him and many in his circle of contributors, but he sees no signs of a coordinated push among donors to stop Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Joe is going to prevail, and if he doesn\u2019t, I hope it\u2019s Mike (Bloomberg),\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re safe. They\u2019re smart. They understand the issues, and they know how to get things done.\u201d Biden\u2019s supporters are urging Democrats to open their wallets to a pro-Biden super PAC, called Unite the Country, as the best way to influence outcome of the race. The group had raised a little more than $7.9 million through the end of December, according to its more recent filing with federal election officials. Amanda Loveday, a spokeswoman for the super PAC said fundraising has improved in recent days, following what she called Biden\u2019s \u201cstrong and steady\u201d performance during Tuesday night\u2019s televised debate in Charleston, South Carolina. \u201cA number of people came to us today and said, \u2018We\u2019re ready\u2019\u201d to give, Loveday told CNN on Wednesday. She would not say how much the group has raised. Unite the Country now is working to reinforce Clyburn\u2019s endorsement with voters ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary with digital and radio ads and mailers. As establishment Democrats wring their hands, Republicans say they are ready to capitalize on Sanders\u2019 rise. The Democratic majority in the House is built on the more than three dozen seats the party flipped from Republican control in the 2018 midterm elections. If Sanders becomes the nominee, the GOP\u2019s longstanding playbook to tie Democrats to socialism becomes even \u201cmore effective\u201d in these Republican-leaning and swing districts, said Calvin Moore, a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading Republican super PAC focused on House races. The voters who tossed out Republican incumbents in 2018 may have sought a \u201creversion to the mean,\u201d he said. But \u201cthey didn\u2019t sign up for the type of wholesale amending of their lives that socialism would bring.\u201d Despite their alarm, Democratic donors and strategists interviewed this week say the party has little choice but to present a united front if Sanders secures the nomination. \u201cMy understanding is that 90% of Bernie\u2019s voters voted for Hillary, but 10% didn\u2019t,\u201d former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell told CNN, referring to the 2016 general election. \u201cThat 10% would have been enough to easily carry Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. That can\u2019t happen again.\u201d Rendell backs Biden, but he said: \u201cIf Bernie is our nominee, we must bite our lip and get in there and do everything we can for him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here\u2019s his speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House. To the Congress of the United States: Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens: Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback.  Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again!  America\u2019s enemies are on the run, America\u2019s fortunes are on the rise, and America\u2019s future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over.  The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.  Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige. In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America\u2019s destiny.  We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back! I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.  Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world \u2013 and it is not even close.  Our borders are secure.  Our families are flourishing.  Our values are renewed.  Our pride is restored.  And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me:  The State of our Union is stronger than ever before! The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world\u2019s most prosperous and inclusive society \u2013 one where every citizen can join in America\u2019s unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America\u2019s extraordinary rise. From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy \u2013 slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American.  We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs \u2013 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration. The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. Incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country.  If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America\u2019s great economic success. The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history.  African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low. African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years \u2013 and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added. The veterans\u2019 unemployment rate dropped to a record low. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history. A record number of young Americans are now employed. Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls.  Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce.  In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent \u2013 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast \u2013 and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election.  This is a blue collar boom. Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded! Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation\u2019s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible \u2013 this, as other countries are not doing well.  Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights. All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent. Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts.  In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.  This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this.  It is all working! Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio.  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family \u2013 he was homeless.  But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones.  He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight.  Tony:  Keep up the great work. Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law.  Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done. Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far.  With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high.  We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our Nation\u2019s manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done.  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built.  We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs.  Companies are not leaving; they are coming back.  Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is. One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.  In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President.  Following NAFTA\u2019s adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs.  Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA \u2013 only to do absolutely nothing.  But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.  Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.  It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity.  This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America\u2019s labor unions. I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China\u2019s massive theft of American jobs.  Our strategy worked.  Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America.  For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi.  They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying:  Enough.  Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing. As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere.  That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.  We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy.  The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.  Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people.  But Maduro\u2019s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken.  Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans.  Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3.  Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.  All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom!  Socialism destroys nations.  But always remember, freedom unifies the soul. To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military.  We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment \u2013 all made in the United States of America.  We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share.  I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. In the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force\u2019s youngest potential recruits:  13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona.  Iain has always dreamed of going to space.  He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy.  He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force.  As Iain says, \u201cmost people look up at space, I want to look down on the world.\u201d Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero.  Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago.  Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen \u2013 the first black fighter pilots \u2013 and he also happens to be Iain\u2019s great-grandfather.  After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam.  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.  A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General.  And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office.  General McGee:  Our Nation salutes you. From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children\u2019s future. Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.  The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country.  We must always remember that our job is to put America first! The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.  Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists.  One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia.  Janiyah\u2019s mom Stephanie is a single parent.  She would do anything to give her daughter a better future.  But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania\u2019s Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children. Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening.  But there is more to their story.  Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over.  I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice! Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received.  Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act \u2013 because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow.  For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative \u2013 to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities.  Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America\u2019s children. My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background.  Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans. My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation\u2019s high schools.  Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth.  Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years.  I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives.  Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive.  I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families:  We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 that is a guarantee.  And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security. The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills.  That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency.  Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform.  It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care. But as we work to improve Americans\u2019 healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely.  One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans.  To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know:  We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare! Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders.  These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration.  This is what is happening in California and other States \u2013 their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money.  If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left.  But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens! This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built.  We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year. My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies.  We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.  I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels.  I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly.  I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices.  Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay. With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic \u2013 drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.  Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent \u2013 and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all. Protecting Americans\u2019 health also means fighting infectious diseases.  We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China.  My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat. We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, and those struggling with mental health challenges.  And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade. Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness.  Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis.  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.  Rush Limbaugh:  Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.  Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor.  Rush, Kathryn, congratulations! As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs.  In 2017, doctors at St. Luke\u2019s hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive.  Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter.  Through the skill of her doctors \u2013 and the prayers of her parents \u2013 little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life.  Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery.  Ellie and Robin:  We are so glad you are here. Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life.  Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive.  Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie.  That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America\u2019s youngest patients.  That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies. Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God! As we support America\u2019s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country.  Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation. Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit.  I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether.  And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately. To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world. We must also rebuild America\u2019s infrastructure.  I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso\u2019s highway bill \u2013 to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land. I am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America. A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe.  That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation\u2019s heroic ICE officers. Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders. Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens.  In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman.  The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York\u2019s sanctuary policies, he was set free.  If the city had honored ICE\u2019s detainer request, his victim would be alive today. The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants \u2013 with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example.  In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault.  But as required by California\u2019s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him. Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence.  He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest.  He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.  He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims.  One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones.  Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood.  Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything.  One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight.  Jody, would you please stand?  Jody, our hearts weep for your loss \u2013 and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies.  I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately.  The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans \u2013 not criminal aliens! In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers \u2013 and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe. My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States. Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.  My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release.  If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed.  We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May \u2013 dropping 8 straight months in a row.  And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down. Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz.  Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants.  Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol \u2013 and he joins us tonight.  Chief Ortiz:  Please stand \u2013 a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol. To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values. With every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom.  Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written.  This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools.  In America, we do not punish prayer.  We do not tear down crosses.  We do not ban symbols of faith.  We do not muzzle preachers and pastors.  In America, we celebrate faith.  We cherish religion.  We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God! Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country.   So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.  Now we must embrace the next frontier, America\u2019s manifest destiny in the stars.  I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts \u2013 using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars. My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.  Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future. Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria.  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS \u2013 the bloodthirsty killer Al\u2011Baghdadi \u2013 is dead! We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller.  After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker.  Kayla once wrote, \u201cSome people find God in church.  Some people find God in nature.  Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering.  I\u2019ve known for some time what my life\u2019s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\u201d  In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself.  After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla.  She was just 26 years old. On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al\u2011Baghdadi\u2019s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room.  He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name \u2013 \u201cTask Force 8-14.\u201d  It was a reference to a special day:  August 14th \u2013 Kayla\u2019s birthday.  Carl and Marsha, America\u2019s warriors never forgot Kayla \u2013 and neither will we. Every day, America\u2019s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.  On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage:  \u201cI will be with you again,\u201d he wrote to Gage.  \u201cI will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also.  I love you son, take care of your mother.  I am always with you.  Dad.\u201d  On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.  That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old.  To Kelli and Gage:  Chris will live in our hearts forever. The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris\u2019s life.  Soleimani was the Iranian Regime\u2019s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.  As the world\u2019s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children.  He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks.  That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever. Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life! In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let\u2019s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them. As we defend American lives, we are working to end America\u2019s wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America\u2019s longest war and bring our troops back home! War places a heavy burden on our Nation\u2019s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children \u2013 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East.  Amy\u2019s kids have not seen their father\u2019s face in many months. Amy, your family\u2019s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace \u2013 we thank you. As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo. The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers \u2013 and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before! This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God. America is the place where anything can happen! America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true! This Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun! Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God\u2019s grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come! Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless America.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s legal team will wrap up its defense of the President in a short two-hour summing-up on Tuesday after arguing that new revelations by former national security adviser John Bolton are irrelevant to the impeachment trial despite Democratic demands that he be called to testify. In a manuscript of his forthcoming book first reported by The New York Times, the former national security adviser says Trump ordered him to maintain a hold on US military aid to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. How Trump's prosecutors reacted when the Bolton news broke At the end of a long day of trial arguments on Monday that largely ignored the new Bolton drama, Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard emeritus professor who joined Trump\u2019s defense team, argued that even if Bolton\u2019s reported claim was true, it would not amount to an impeachable offense. He made a case for expansive presidential power, saying that a quid pro quo alone does not amount to an abuse of power \u2013 the basis of the first article of impeachment \u2013 which he said was not sufficient in itself to justify ending a presidency. \u201cNothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense, that is clear from the history. That is clear from the language of the Constitution,\u201d Dershowitz said in comments that could arm Republicans \u2013 who are on the spot amid calls for Bolton to testify \u2013 with a new argument. But Sen. Jeff Merkley told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash Tuesday that Dershowitz\u2019s theory would in effect hand presidents the ability to interfere in elections and escape consequences. \u201cI really thought Dershowitz disgraced himself,\u201d the Oregon Democrat said. \u201cBecause he said essentially even if a President commands the power of state to corrupt a future election, by seeking the intervention of a foreign power, that that\u2019s not something that impeachment would be appropriate for. It\u2019s exactly the type of foreign interference that the founders talked about.\u201d Trump has repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm. The deep electoral roots of the Senate's impeachment standoff The Times report on Bolton complicated life for a handful of Republicans who are under pressure from Democrats to vote for fresh witnesses who did not testify to the House investigation following Trump\u2019s vow to avoid cooperating with the impeachment push. \u201cThe reporting on John Bolton strengthens the case for witnesses and has prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues,\u201d Maine\u2019s Sen. Susan Collins said. Utah\u2019s Sen. Mitt Romney added: \u201cI think with the story that came out yesterday that it is increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton.\u201d But despite the new focus on Bolton, there is no sign yet that four Republican votes will be forthcoming to piece together a 51-vote majority that would be needed to call new witnesses. Several Republicans seemed pleased by Dershowitz\u2019s presentation, according to CNN reporters in the chamber on Monday night. Tuesday will showcase brief closing arguments from Jay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone and will take around two hours, according to a person familiar with what we should expect. Senate impeachment trial: Trump's defense soldiers past Bolton revelations The President and his most fervent fans must have been delighted as they heard arguments that had been rehearsed for months on Fox News opinion shows echo across the Senate floor. Any vote later this week to depose Bolton or other witnesses could prolong the trial and frustrate Trump\u2019s hopes for an acquittal by the time of the State of the Union address next week. It could also expose the minimum of four GOP senators who would be needed to advance such a step to the President\u2019s certain wrath. But most of Trump\u2019s lawyers essentially offered Republican senators no choice but to buy the President\u2019s case entirely \u2013 despite its many glaring factual deficiencies. For red state senators or those who have concluded their fates lie in sticking closely to Trump, it\u2019s an easy political choice. \u201cThe White House counsel has absolutely shredded, shredded, the case brought forward,\u201d said Iowa\u2019s Sen. Joni Ernst during a dinner break. Texas\u2019 GOP Sen. Ted Cruz added: \u201cI get that the press loves to obsess over the latest bombshell.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe legal issue before this Senate is whether a President has the authority to investigate corruption.\u201d Biden: GOP senator just proved our point about Trump The legal approach pursued by Trump\u2019s team leaves moderates such as Collins and Colorado\u2019s Sen. Cory Gardner exposed to Democratic claims that they will block a fair trial if they don\u2019t vote to hear witnesses such as Bolton. Trump is being tried in the Senate over two articles of impeachment, alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, in connection with his pressure on Ukraine for an investigation into political opponents including Biden. In the evening session, Trump lawyer Robert Ray offered a strongly argued case warning about the gravity of removing a President between elections, saying it would not be in the best interests of the country. \u201cWe have witnessed the endless procession of legal theories to sustain this partisan impeachment, from treason to quid pro quo to bribery to extortion to obstruction of justice to soliciting an illegal foreign campaign contribution to a violation of the Impoundment Control Act to who knows what all is next,\u201d Ray told senators. Bolton blows the impeachment case back open But for much of the day, other members of Trump\u2019s team, such as former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, offered far more political advocacy. \u201cWe would prefer not to be talking about this,\u201d Bondi said, before launching into a fearsome attack on Biden \u2013 an ironic moment, since Trump was the one who had brought up unproven claims about his rival that caused the political drama that has held Washington in thrall for months. Trump\u2019s team even rolled out Bill Clinton nemesis Ken Starr to explode Democratic heads by bemoaning the political damage of an \u201cage of impeachment\u201d \u2013 20 years after the then-independent counsel had pushed for the 42nd President\u2019s ouster. Ernst seemed to let slip the partisan goal of the defense argument in a conversation with reporters. \u201cIowa caucuses are next Monday evening. I am really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus voters, will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point?\u201d she said. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, hit back at Bondi. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that Breitbart was expanding into Ted Talk knockoffs. Here on planet Earth, the conspiracy theory that Bondi repeated has been conclusively refuted,\u201d Bates said. \u201cJoe Biden was instrumental to a bipartisan and international anti-corruption victory. It\u2019s no surprise that such a thing is anathema to President Trump.\u201d The President\u2019s team argued that he had been right to withhold aid to Ukraine because he feared corruption \u2013 and put Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy giant while his father oversaw policy toward Kiev, at the center of the storm. There is little evidence in the rough transcript of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Trump was interested in the wider issue of corruption. But he does repeatedly press for probes into Biden. There are appropriate questions about whether Hunter Biden presented an unacceptable conflict of interest with his employment choices. But despite Trump\u2019s false claims, in fact, Joe Biden\u2019s pressure for Ukraine to fire a prosecutor seen in Washington and Europe as corrupt would have made it more likely that Burisma, the company for which Hunter Biden was working, would be investigated. Still, the President\u2019s legal team has the luxury of knowing that its efforts are almost certain to be rewarded given the reality that not enough Republicans will vote to convict their own party\u2019s President. That gives them all sorts of leeway to please their boss \u2013 and to advance his political goals. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Arlette Saenz, Clare Foran and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. In the waning weeks of the convulsive Trump presidency, in the last days of the surreal year 2020, three stories are coming together to produce the kind of cinematic ending that \u2013 like much of what we have experienced this year \u2013 even Hollywood executives might have found too far-fetched to put on screen. In the past day, we learned ever more dramatic details about the assassination attempt against Alexei Navalny, the top domestic critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Simultaneously, we are following news of a massive cyberattack on government systems \u2013 targeting many countries \u2013 but mostly the United States with even Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  pointing a blaming finger at Russia. Then there\u2019s the third story: President Donald Trump finally breaking his silence about the cyberattack \u2013 changing the subject only briefly from his obsession with the November election he lost \u2013 and doing it only to downplay suggestions of Russian involvement; contradicting experts in his administration and in the private sector who say Russia\u2019s fingerprints are all over it, with evidence that it was done by a group called Cozy Bear, linked with Russian military intelligence. What we have, in short, is mounting evidence of the Russian regime headed by Putin attacking at home and abroad. Inside Russia, allegedly sending a squad to kill a man whose crime is demanding democracy and an end to corruption; abroad, presiding over the infiltration of major U.S. government and private networks. With Putin appearing like a ruthless foe, Trump\u2019s effort to defend him looks as puzzling as ever, underscoring the enduring mystery of the Trump presidency: Why has he found it impossible to criticize Putin during his time in the White House. Not when we learned Russians were offering bounties for the killing of US soldiers in Afghanistan; not now, with America facing one of the worst cyberattacks in its history. Eventually, the three storylines could become part of a flood of productions. Countless movies and series might grow out of the madness of our times. Trump's ridiculous exit strategy One of the first to get green-lighted will probably be the real-life spy thriller about the Navalny assassination attempt, made more satisfying by its most recent twist, when Navalny tricked one of his would-be killers into confessing. Just a few days ago, investigative journalists from Bellingcat and CNN released a bombshell report, identifying members of a Russian intelligence team specializing in the use of toxins and nerve agents. Navalny barely survived an assassination attempt last August, when he fell violently ill during a flight over Siberia, causing the plane to make an emergency landing in the city of Omsk.  After unexplained delays, authorities eventually authorized his release to Germany, where doctors concluded he had been poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by Soviet scientists and familiar from the attempted assassination of Russians in the U.K. in 2018. Bellingcat investigations had already unearthed evidence of Russian\u2019s role in that 2018 hit, as well as Russian poison attacks in Germany, and the shooting down of a civilian airliner by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. This time, working with CNN, they detailed how Putin\u2019s men allegedly tracked Navalny for years. The gripping story is complete with pictures, names and titles of the men believed to be involved in the August hit. The cybersecurity attack is another Trump mess Biden will have to clean up Then, Navalny, phoned one of the men, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, disguising his phone number and pretending to be a Russian security official. The recording, now translated, is not to be missed. Kudryavtsev describes putting poison in Navalny\u2019s underwear, traveling to Omsk to retrieve the poisoned clothing, and coming chillingly close to killing his victim. Putin denied trying to kill Navalny, claiming the stories are all fabrication by U.S. intelligence, but admitted that Navalny has been under surveillance. If Russia wanted to kill him, Putin said, they would have \u201cfinished it.\u201d What emerges is a picture of Putin less as statesman than as mustachio-twirling cartoon villain, or perhaps a run-of-the-mill mafia boss. That\u2019s why it is so shocking to hear Trump insist on defending him. US officials and Microsoft experts say the US is under major attack even now. Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called it \u201ca very significant effort,\u201d adding, \u201cwe can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.\u201d Russia denies any involvement here too. In the US this has been described as the worst intelligence failure since Pearl Harbor. The infiltrators have entered deep into the US government. Hackers have accessed the departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, and others. But Trump, shortly after Pompeo\u2019s statement, jumped to Russia\u2019s defense, tweeting, \u201cThe Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality\u2026..Russia, Russia, Russia,\u201d he mocked, accusing the \u201cLamestream media\u201d of ignoring the \u201cpossibility that it may be China (it may!)\u201d It was a preposterous claim, at odds with the views of experts.  On Monday, outgoing Attorney General William Barr, while rejecting Trump\u2019s claims of widespread election fraud, also weighed in on the cyberattack. \u201cI agree with Secretary Pompeo\u2019s assessment,\u201d he said, \u201cIt certainly appears to be the Russians.\u201d One day, the explanation for Trump\u2019s devotion to Putin will become known. Until then, perhaps the screenwriters will have to leave that question open, a cliffhanger. In the meantime, we are learning more about how Putin operates, making Trump\u2019s behavior only more perplexing. It all feels like fiction, but here we are. We believe it because we see it.",

The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN. We are used to election season being a campaign period, a day of voting, a fairly immediate concession and a subsequent inauguration \u2013 with the majority of citizens having little awareness of the rest of the process. Though the Electoral College certified the election results this week, the slow move until this point and the lack of a formal concession make this moment feel different. Now, we are hyper aware of both the gaps in the election system itself and the shocking threats against officials (and their families) who are working to ensure a fair process. In this climate, it can seem impossible to put the election behind us. But data can help give us the ability to move forward: to be vigilant in preventing political violence, while also providing the information we need to build inclusive and resilient communities. Starting in early 2019 and running through the 2020 presidential election, the Bridging Divides Initiative, a Princeton-based research initiative, shared information with local communities about current and potential challenges ahead of the election. This took the form of sharing details of local demonstrations, tracking incidents of political violence and analyzing trends of both. For example, through the US Crisis Monitor, our joint project with the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), we tracked more than 19,000 local demonstrations. Despite the high-profile news coverage and commentary by political leaders to the contrary, the overwhelming number of these events were peaceful and continue to be peaceful. Of the events BDI identifies as contentious, a definition that includes incidents such as minor property damage and police use of excessive force, repeated acts of political violence were rare or highly concentrated in a few locations, such as Portland, Oregon. And despite the online and real-life conversations about unlawful paramilitary and other armed groups showing up on Election Day, widespread armed intimidation at the polls did not materialize. BDI continues to track contentious events of real concern by both government and individual actors, yet in the last three months, including Election Day, most states recorded two or fewer violent incidents against property or people at any sort of demonstration. Having a peaceful Election Day, where a record number of people cast their ballots, was an accomplishment and not an accident. The largely peaceful outcome was the result of hard work: organizers, officials and leaders across the spectrum used timely, relevant information to reduce the risk of violence. The four issues that could unite a divided America Sharing our data with international and national organizations allowed them to orient their violence prevention and mitigation work to where it was needed most and would have the greatest impact. The Carter Center, which largely works overseas to build transformative and sustainable peace, used BDI data to focus on specific counties in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In turn, they gathered dozens of faith leaders in these critical areas to equip them with constructive messaging in support of acceptance of election results, promoting a peaceful electoral process and pushing back against violence. Rabbi Ron Symons of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, who attended one of The Carter Center briefings, spoke to us afterward about the obligation of local leaders to prevent violence. \u201cGiven the rancor in American politics, if we have the ability to use our shared values for peace and civility to influence the community, we have a responsibility to engage. We believe that we must redefine the term \u2018neighbor\u2019 from a geographic term into a moral concept. This is a moment that demands we do so.\u201d Data also helped in local security planning. Using the weekly, state-by-state updates, a coalition of legal experts and law firms reached out to governors, mayors and local officials about unlawful paramilitary activity and voter intimidation ahead of the election. They offered pro bono assistance, as well as details on relevant law that local mayors or sheriffs could quickly point to in forming their plans around sensitive issues. These guides and fact sheets were also shared with local poll workers and volunteers, to help them respond to voter questions and included direct coordination with long-standing national voter protection efforts. This proactive connecting and information sharing prompted concrete action from local leaders. In places like Erie, Pennsylvania, awareness of past incidents and information on potential intimidation helped the town council and election officials take steps to reduce the chance of armed intimidation ahead of Election Day. Data and analysis doesn\u2019t need to go through formal organizations or those in elected office to be useful. It can also directly challenge public misperceptions, especially when the information is made accessible to local, trusted voices. In the days leading up to the election, local papers  \u2013 as diverse as the Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville, FL), Bennington Banner (Vermont) and The Berkshire Edge (Massachusetts) \u2013 ran opinion pieces and letters to the editor citing data and analysis from the US Crisis Monitor. The articles ranged from using data to dispel rumors about Black Lives Matter-associated protests to calling for more nuanced reporting overall, rather than a focus on sensational headlines.  To be clear, the absence of violence is not the measure of success.  The root causes of tension may have gotten worse in this election cycle, but they did not emerge in the last four years. From rising levels of hate crimes to low levels of trust in government, many different indicators help measure the health of our society. We are likely to face the same, if not even deeper, divisions come the next election if these issues are not also addressed. The desire to stop political violence does not replace the deep need to build a sustainable peace grounded in justice. Still, key data and analysis helped inform powerful organizing, planning and response \u2013 including by communities most affected \u2013 to mitigate the risk of violence, and we will continue to support these efforts in months to come. Yet, neither analysis nor a single election is the end of the process. Instead it is a call to action, the first step in bridging the divides and building the future America we want to see.",

Essential Questions About the Future of Elections in America.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion at CNN. As President Donald Trump\u2019s defeat has been confirmed numerous times and courts have rejected his campaign\u2019s efforts to dispute the vote count, some of his loyalists have shown a growing urgency. Last Saturday, thousands of pro-Trump supporters in Washington and in several state capitals hit the streets in last-ditch protests to save an election they believe was stolen. As darkness fell, a large group of Trump backers faced off against a mass of counter protesters in front of the Supreme Court. The confrontation vaulted into fistfights, stab wounds, arrests and turmoil. A week earlier, Trump supporters \u2013 some armed \u2013 gathered outside the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Georgia election officials (many Republican) were also threatened with violence over unfounded claims of voter fraud, and the Arizona Republican Party, in a social media post, asked if its supporters would be willing to \u201cgive up [their] life for this fight.\u201d Peaceful transitions of power were not a settled matter during the early days of our republic. Elections at the state and local level occasionally spilled over into violence. As the electorate organized into opposing camps for the heated rematch between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in 1800, many worried about rising discord and mob violence \u2013 particularly when the final outcome remained in flux for months. George Washington\u2019s fatherly charisma offered stability and calm in the previous elections, even as the nation underwent a rapid transformation and developed a national identity. But in the 1800 contest, Washington was absent, having died a year earlier. Three terrible presidential transitions that hurt America Adams and Jefferson differed sharply on a range of issues and fundamental questions about the future of the nation. It was an acrimonious, ugly affair. Jefferson\u2019s victory marked one of the few times in world history that a government of one party (Adams and the Federalists) would be replaced by a government of another party (Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans) peacefully. Adams was devastated; his anguish and humiliation would linger until his death. But he did not dispute the results. He did not call out the army, put guards in the White House or rally his supporters to gather their arms. In the predawn darkness of Jefferson\u2019s inaugural day, Adams departed the capital and headed home to his farm in Massachusetts. Knowing the significance of the moment, Jefferson set one of the most sacred principles of American politics in his inaugural address \u2013 post-election unification. \u201cLet us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things\u2026[E]very difference of opinion is not a difference of principle\u2026 We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\u201d The late historian William Nisbet Chambers wrote that the event marked a high point in our nation\u2019s history and perhaps in the development of government. \u201cIt was the first such grand, democratic, peaceful transfer of power in modern politics. It was an example of a procedure which many old as well as many new nations have yet to experience, which many defeated factions or parties have found it difficult or intolerable to accept, but one which 1801 did much to \u2018fix\u2019 on the American scene.\u201d Fast forward nearly 200 years to the 1992 election. Early in the race, the incumbent, George H.W. Bush, seemed to be a strong position to win reelection. By the end of the Persian Gulf War, his approval rating stood at a staggering 89%. But then a young, dynamic candidate from Arkansas named Bill Clinton burst on the scene, \u201cfeeling the pain\u201d so widespread in the American electorate due to a recession. What Melania Trump leaves behind There was little love between the candidates (at that time), but after the election, the President invited Clinton to the White House, and a day later Barbara Bush hosted Hillary Clinton. As Hillary arrived, she was met with smiles and hugs, and as they walked into the White House, in front of a swarm of cameras, the first lady reached out to embrace Clinton. The nasty, rough election was over, and a peaceful transition would begin. Adams and Bush were among only 11 sitting presidents who lost a reelection. The most recent is Donald Trump. The rejection by voters can be humiliating, especially for politicians who place praise at the center of their identity. But Trump\u2019s protests and false claims are unprecedented in the annals of American elections. Whether he is convinced the process was corrupt \u2013 in so many states \u2013 or merely stoking the fires of grievance to raise money or maintain muscle with his base, the fix is coming undone. We\u2019re at a tipping point. With more than a month until the Inauguration, the atmosphere is tense. Instead of taking the Supreme Court\u2019s rebuff of his challenge of the election result as the final out, Trump has heightened his assault on election process legitimacy and the federal courts. Shortly after the Court rejected the Texas lawsuit, the President tweeted \u201cThis is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced.\u201d Any public official, including cabinet members, who shrinks from the cause is painted by him as weak and disloyal.  As the final hour approaches, will the President change course for the nation\u2019s good? Like the visitors to Ebenezer Scrooge\u2019s chamber on that cold winter\u2019s night, perhaps the ghosts of Adams or Bush, or any of the other true patriots of our democracy who relinquished their power with dignity and grace, and for the good of the nation, will visit President Trump in the recesses of the White House. Wake up, Mr. Trump, and ring the chimes of American democracy.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. When the drug company Pfizer announced Monday that early data showed its coronavirus vaccine is more than 90% effective in protecting people from the disease, the hearts of millions of people around the world leapt \u2013 and stock markets soon followed. On that day, America was still coming to grips with the results of the election \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t fully clear whether the outcome would prove more than 50% effective in protecting democracy and unifying the nation. By any measure, Joe Biden scored a clear victory over President Donald Trump. The former vice president, now President-elect, got 50.8% percent of the votes counted so far, 5 million-plus more than Trump. And with the red states of Arizona and Georgia now projected to flip into the Democrat\u2019s column, Biden has 306 Electoral College votes \u2013 the same number Trump got in 2016. Trump is challenging the results in the courts and refusing to concede, even as foreign leaders and a small but growing number of Republican officials are congratulating Biden on his win. \u201cTrump is choosing to end his presidency as he started it, attacking the truth and undermining the nation\u2019s institutions,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cIn the end, Trump will have to move out of the White House, whether he likes it or not. But his shenanigans will leave the country wounded.\u201d Karl Rove, the strategist behind George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns, argued in The Wall Street Journal that Trump is entitled to pursue his court battles to overturn the results in swing states, \u201cbut the president\u2019s efforts are unlikely to move a single state from Mr. Biden\u2019s column, and certainly they\u2019re not enough to change the final outcome.\u201d In the New Yorker, Susan Glasser wrote of Trump\u2019s \u201cevidence-free fantasy\u201d that the election was stolen from him. There were moments this week that \u201cfelt as though we were watching events unfold in Minsk or some other dictator stronghold where elections are not stolen the day votes are cast but in the weeks afterward, as the defeated President holes up in his palace, defying reality and increasingly urgent crowds in the streets,\u201d Glasser noted. While many Republican elected officials enabled Trump\u2019s false claims with their silence, some, like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham, actively helped spread doubts about the election\u2019s legitimacy, wrote Nicole Hemmer. In her view, it\u2019s a continuation of a decade of efforts by the GOP to suppress the vote and perpetuate minority rule. \u201cAll these efforts to undermine the electoral will of the people, from voter suppression to power-stripping to false accusations of fraud, are evidence that the pro-democracy alliance is smaller than many people think,\u201d Hemmer observed. Trump\u2019s court challenges \u201care unlikely to pay off in the form of a second term for Trump,\u201d wrote Richard L. Hasen in the Atlantic. \u201cHe would need the equivalent of three consecutive Hail Mary passes to stay in office.\u201d Shan Wu, a former prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, wrote, \u201cTo really overturn the results and try to throw out hundreds of thousands of votes, Trump\u2019s legal team would have to come forward with evidence of massive voter fraud. So far, no substantial evidence has surfaced beyond the baseless claims made by Trump surrogates like Rudy Giuliani.\u201d Trump allies have suggested that the Electoral College vote for Biden is not a certainty, a notion that political scientist Robert Alexander, who has written a scholarly book on the college, rejected out of hand. UK journalist Timothy Stanley pointed out that \u201cthe stakes were raised Wednesday with magnificent madness by Hollywood actor Jon Voight who released a video calling Trump\u2019s legal effort \u2018the greatest fight since the Civil War, the battle of righteousness vs Satan.\u2019 To be clear, there is no evidence of vote rigging or that Satan is a registered Democrat \u2026 but some version of this narrative is taking hold on the right and the Republican leadership can\u2019t do much about it. They are, as ever, reacting to events, not shaping them.\u201d In effect, Stanley wrote, \u201cthey are a prisoner of Trump\u2019s decision making \u2026 and have been for four wild years.\u201d Thinking of what might have been, Julian Zelizer wrote that Trump \u201ccould have started with a gracious concession speech, congratulating President-elect Biden on his impressive victory and urging his voters to throw their support behind the nation\u2019s new commander in chief.\u201d  He could have invited Biden to the White House, as Obama did for Trump in 2016, authorized the release of funding for the transition, enabled the full briefing of incoming officials on the pandemic and national security matters. But he did none of those things, instead \u201cdevoting his energy to Twitter rants and lawsuits \u2013 which keep getting thrown out \u2013 rather than concerning himself with the important work of governance.\u201d Baratunde Thurston spoke for many Americans when he wrote, \u201cfor the past four years, I have been holding my breath, in a defensive crouch and bracing for the worst. I\u2019ve expected some fresh horror, embarrassment or trauma to find its way onto one of my screens, and it\u2019s been exhausting.\u201d Now, after the victory of Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, \u201cmy heart is lifted, and I can exhale.\u201d Thurston was one of 26 writers who responded to a request from CNN Opinion editors, led by Pat Wiedenkeller, for their thoughts on Biden\u2019s election.  \u201cThe lesson to learn from this election,\u201d wrote Oren Cass, \u201cis that, whoever you supported, about half of your fellow citizens felt otherwise. Neither vilifying nor condescending to them will change any minds. If you cannot understand how they could reach conclusions so different from your own, the fault lies with you, not them.\u201d The election was above all a fateful choice, wrote Melissa Gilbert: \u201cAmerica has resoundingly chosen truth over lies, inclusion over exclusion, science over ignorance, faith over fear, compassion over cruelty, respect over ridicule, love over hate, substance over style, selflessness over self-dealing, freedom over oppression, unity over division and a global outlook over myopia.\u201d And to Penn Jillette, it\u2019s clear that Joe Biden now has \u201cone job.\u201d The 70 million-plus people who voted for Trump \u201care our neighbors and our relatives.\u201d Biden must \u201cfill all our hearts with love for each other\u201d so we can \u201cunderstand and move on together,\u201d Jillette wrote. Something about Richard L. Eldredge\u2019s family changed four years ago with the election of Donald Trump. As they quarreled over politics, \u201cfamily birthday greetings, anniversary celebrations and graduation photos eventually disappeared from my timeline as other family members used social media to take sides,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen I typed the names of relatives I\u2019ve known and loved all my life into the Facebook search box, profiles popped up, along with the phrase \u2018Add Friend.\u2019\u201d Other family members blocked him. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Eldredge addressed one of his relatives, with whom he recalled playing \u201chundreds of games of Wiffle ball in my backyard until dark. After the death of my older brother, you lovingly, instinctively took over the role. You introduced me to The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and R.E.M. I thought you were a god.\u201d But then, \u201cthe invitations to your holiday gatherings stopped coming. Your daughter got married and I wasn\u2019t invited. We haven\u2019t spoken since 2017.\u201d \u201cOver our love-filled 50-year bond, you chose a hate-filled New York millionaire who has never spent a moment with you, cried with one of you when your dad died, hugged another of you at your mom\u2019s funeral or otherwise cared about you.\u201d \u201cWas it worth it?\u201d For more on Election 2020: CNN Opinion contributors: Ringing church bells, relief and schadenfreude: the world reacts to the Trump-Biden drama Roxanne Jones: Kamala Harris shows Black women they have the power to change the world Joe Lockhart: Democrats\u2019 all-out battle over who deserves credit for Biden win Thomas Balcerski: A history lesson on presidents who snub their successors\u2019 inaugurations Paul Callan: The Watergate-era strategies that might win Trump a pardon Elie Honig: With his days in office numbered, here\u2019s what Trump may try to do Rich Thau: How to listen to Trump voters Lawrence C. Levy: These are the gatekeepers who let Biden win Covid-19 is spreading at record levels around the US and more peril lies ahead. Thanksgiving, a holiday that is so heavily based on family gatherings, poses the risk of more contagion. \u201cSmall indoor gatherings are driving the recent spike in coronavirus cases,\u201d wrote C\u00e9line Gounder, Ben Michaelis and Robert Cialdini. \u201cFamily and friends are getting together without masks because they look \u2018fine.\u2019 It\u2019s not just that asymptomatic people are driving much of this spread. It\u2019s also that we don\u2019t want to think ill of our loved ones. We want to trust them and believe that they\u2019re not going to harm us. And this makes many of our Thanksgiving traditions \u2013 whose comfort and consistency we crave \u2013 particularly dangerous in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d Read their advice for celebrating the holiday safely. The coronavirus surge is occurring when the nation is particularly vulnerable, wrote Kent Sepkowitz. President Trump is a lame duck whose term expires January 20, and President-elect Biden, who named a Covid-19 task force this week, can\u2019t yet implement any changes in US health policy. \u201cThis deepening crisis requires immediate, thoughtful, informed, evidence-based and decisive attention by the President and his advisers,\u201d wrote Sepkowitz. \u201cOtherwise, the pandemic will worsen, the economy will worsen and the morale of the American people will worsen.\u201d Among the key questions is how to design a plan to distribute a vaccine, whether from Pfizer or its competitors, once it is approved. In the late spring of 2016, Peter Bergen interviewed President Barack Obama in the White House Situation Room and offhandedly asked him about his thoughts on what would happen if Donald Trump became President and had to make national security decisions. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have those thoughts. Because I don\u2019t expect that to happen,\u201d Obama said. Reviewing the first volume of Obama\u2019s new book, Bergen wrote, \u201cTrump hangs over Obama\u2019s moving, beautifully written memoir of his first three years in office like an onrushing train that both the reader and author know is hurtling down the tracks to collide with what Obama hoped to achieve. In Obama\u2019s own words, he was striving to \u2018see if we can actually live up to the meaning of our creed\u2019 and to continue the work-in-progress of making a more perfect, racially equitable \u2018promised land\u2019 that has already produced \u2018Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers \u2026 Jackie Robinson \u2026 Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan, Billie Holliday \u2026 Lincoln at Gettysburg.\u2019\u201d Obama traces the GOP\u2019s wrong turn in part to the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008. And then there was, as Bergen wrote, \u201cTrump, who put into play repeatedly the lie \u2013 concocted to try to invalidate Obama\u2019s presidency \u2013 that he wasn\u2019t American, wasn\u2019t born in the US (and might even be a secret Muslim). As Obama explains of Trump, \u2018For millions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, he promised an elixir for their racial anxiety.\u2019\u201d Alex Trebek hosted an astounding 8,200-plus episodes of \u201cJeopardy!\u201d over 37 seasons and was still doing the show in recent weeks \u2013 before finally succumbing to cancer on November 8 after a long battle with the disease. \u201cGame show hosts tend to be stereotyped as sunny and anodyne, slick, toothy and insincere cheerleaders for their games and their contestants,\u201d Jeff Yang wrote. \u201cTrebek was, by contrast, what one might call a \u2018real one.\u2019 He was candid in his reactions, always ready to cock an eyebrow at a bad play and to bluntly call out obvious errors in the tones of a disappointed dad.\u201d \u201cYet somehow, he never seemed like a jerk. Though acerbic, his corrections always felt instructive, not destructive,\u201d wrote Yang, who called him a role model for how Americans can behave following a contentious presidential election. To Gayle Lemmon, Trebek\u2019s death seemed like the loss of \u201ca beloved relative.\u201d When she was 10, her mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. \u201cBy the time I turned 11 and 12, Alex was our favorite man of the house,\u201d Lemmon wrote. \u201cBy then, he had settled into his hosting groove and my mother\u2019s fight against cancer had turned into a daily bout with a cornucopia of medication, brain radiation and spinal taps.\u201d She and her mother would sit on a hospital bed and faithfully watch Jeopardy! at 7 p.m. each evening. Trebek\u2019s \u201ccalm erudition and steady hand had the healing power of a soothing, magical balm that offered a half-hour power of forgetfulness and ease.\u201d Tess Taylor: We are going to have a president who quotes poetry Chris Buckley: Former White supremacist: This is how to tackle hate and bigotry Paul Moses: The disturbing truths in the new Vatican scandal report Ja\u2019net Bishop: This group is sometimes forgotten on Veterans Day Jill Filipovic: The GOP is pitifully out of step with America on Obamacare AND \u2026 The Queen\u2019s Gambit is a popular set of opening moves in chess, familiar to fans of the game like such other sequences as the Ruy Lopez or the Nimzo Indian defense. It\u2019s also now a Netflix series about a fictional chess prodigy in the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cFor most of us, a show about a board game seems an improbable venue for riveting action,\u201d wrote Sara Stewart. \u201cAnd yet! Against the odds \u2013 kind of like its protagonist, Beth Harmon (played by Isla Johnston, then Anya Taylor-Joy) \u2013 this show is the perfect escapist entertainment for right now.\u201d What accounts for the success of the series? Stewart said, \u201cit\u2019s a dynamic character study with the sweeping emotional arc of a sports movie, set in an era in which the cultural deck is stacked against its heroine.\u201d The show celebrates a game in which intellect counts above all else. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternate universe in which being smart is glamorous and people behave honorably,\u201d Stewart wrote. \u201cI\u2019d like to spend more time there, so here\u2019s hoping calls for a second season might become a reality.\u201d",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. On Wednesday, November 4, Matthew McConaughey, Laura Bush and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs will celebrate their birthdays. It will be \u201cNational Candy Day.\u201d In many respects, it will be another weekday in the midst of a global pandemic. And yet, people could be waking up to an America on the verge of political transformation if the presidential contest is decided \u2013 or one gripped by days or weeks of uncertainty over the outcome. (It wasn\u2019t until the early hours of November 9, 2016, the day after the election, that Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump to concede the race \u2013 and this year\u2019s vote counting may well take a lot longer.) The hopes, dreams and plans of millions will be affected by what historian Manisha Sinha called the most consequential US election in 160 years. What binds this election and the 1860 vote that elected Abraham Lincoln, \u201cis the conviction that it is American democracy \u2013 rather than just opposing presidential candidates \u2013 that is on the ballot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAmerican history is filled with moments of change so fundamental that even in retrospect they seem remarkable,\u201d wrote filmmaker Ken Burns. He compared today\u2019s prospects of change to the 1932 election, where a once-popular President Herbert Hoover was trounced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt because he couldn\u2019t change course to ease the suffering of ordinary Americans in the Great Depression. \u201cThis massive shift in only four years \u2013 triggered by the worst economic collapse the country had seen and brought on by huge swings among labor and urban immigrant voters \u2013 changed American politics forever and redefined how we viewed the federal government\u2019s role in our lives,\u201d observed Burns. George Will predicted in the Washington Post that the campaign \u201cseems almost certain to end Tuesday with a fumigation election. A presidency that began with dark words about \u2018American carnage\u2019 probably will receive what it has earned: repudiation.\u201d Tensions are running particularly high in the swing states that will determine which candidate gets to 270 electoral votes. In Florida, Democrat Chris King wrote in favor of Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy, \u201cWe need hope. We need leadership. We need a government that can keep people safe and create an atmosphere where everyone \u2013 not just the rich \u2013 can thrive.\u201d To Texas talk show host Chris Salcedo and his fellow conservatives, the stakes are also enormous. \u201cTrump was not a lifelong politician or creature of the government establishment. He brought a fresh energy and perspective to politics. And like many of our listeners, I worry that if he loses on November 3, we may never have another citizen president like him again,\u201d Salcedo wrote. \u201cElections are choices,\u201d wrote Scott Jennings. \u201cPro-life or pro-choice. Higher taxes or lower taxes. Support free speech or coddle censorship. No politician ever satisfies me fully, but Trump comes far closer than Joe Biden ever could. There\u2019s room for Trump to improve, but in no way does Biden represent a step in a policy direction that I can support as a conservative.\u201d  Marc Thiessen, writing in the Washington Post, noted, \u201cPresident Trump says a lot of things that dismay even his supporters. But what if we turned off our TVs, stopped looking at Twitter and looked at what he has done in office over the past four years? With the sound off, Trump\u2019s is one of the greatest conservative presidencies in modern American history.\u201d Coverage of the campaign doesn\u2019t always pay a lot of attention to those in the middle, but they are key to the outcome. Daniel Lubetzky, who founded KIND Snacks, describes himself as a moderate. When Trump was elected, he wrote, \u201cI resisted jumping on the bandwagon of the fervent resisters or die-hard supporters and chose to evaluate the facts as they played out. Because I love my country, I hoped that Trump\u2019s competitive spirit would drive him to do well by the American people.\u201d \u201cYet, I sit here four years later with my worst fears confirmed,\u201d he added. \u201cMy sense of reason has been tested and now pushed past its limit. It is difficult to overstate the gravity of Trump\u2019s polarizing behavior and disregard for constitutional norms.\u201d He said he\u2019s voting for Biden, a \u201cbalanced centrist, guided by reason and principle.\u201d Garry Kasparov sees the stakes of the election as epic: \u201cTrump has spent five years dehumanizing his opponents and painting them as America\u2019s mortal enemies while conditioning his followers to see things as he does. They will not leave the field easily, but leave they must, or American democracy will not outlast them.\u201d With days to the election, Jill Filipovic wrote, \u201cEverything is terrible and nothing is OK. If you\u2019re feeling depressed and maxed out too, trust that you are far from alone.\u201d Looking past the election results, she wrote, \u201cReal reconciliation and healing is a slow, difficult and intentional process; it won\u2019t happen with Kumbaya cliches or an agreement to disagree. But if we want to stitch our frayed nation back to one, it\u2019s what we will have to do \u2013 all of us. More than 90 million Americans have already voted, a number higher than two thirds of the total ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 and the early turnout should prompt politicians and the media to do some rethinking, wrote Vivian Schiller. \u201cIt\u2019s time to retire the term \u2018Election Day\u2019 and replace it with a far more clear and more accurate term: \u2018the last day of voting.\u2019 As for the stage we\u2019re in now? Easy: \u2018Election season.\u2019\u201d Still, on Tuesday there will be huge attention paid to what happens at the polls. And election law experts Richard Hasen and Richard Pildes warn us to be cautious. When an election takes place over 50 states and in thousands of polling places, glitches are inevitable \u2013 and often innocuous. \u201cWith commentators floating the possibility of a Constitutional crisis, a civil war, breaches in our electronic voting machines and other worst-case scenarios, hypervigilant voters and the media must be careful not to undermine our elections by giving excessive play to typical Election Day problems or hastily spreading viral posts before the facts are verified,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn our polarized, frayed-nerves society, there\u2019s a serious possibility that minor issues will be blown out of proportion and cast in sinister terms, especially on social media. Our advice (to both voters and the media) is to slow down, take everything you see or hear with a grain of salt until it is fully vetted, and keep a balanced perspective on the problems that do emerge.\u201d While the presidential race dominates the conversation, the 2020 election will have an effect that\u2019s even more long-lasting: the winners of seats in most state legislatures will \u201cbe in the driver\u2019s seat for redrawing their states\u2019 (political) maps \u2013 which will, in turn, determine who controls the next 10 years on voting rights, gun safety, police accountability, Covid-19 recovery and so much more,\u201d wrote Gaby Goldstein and David Daley. Those district lines will be drawn next year in the wake of the 2020 Census \u2013 and will last till 2031. Republicans and Democrats have flooded the courts with last-minute election-related cases as each side maneuvers for maximum advantage, with a particular focus on the US Supreme Court and the newest member of its conservative bloc, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She didn\u2019t participate in rulings this week that enabled Pennsylvania and North Carolina authorities to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day. \u201cJustice Barrett is now part of Trump\u2019s firewall,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cConservative justices, including three he chose, now hold a 6-3 majority in the court and may help him win reelection. If a Democratic landslide makes that impossible, he undoubtedly hopes they will side with him as he faces a potential tsunami of legal troubles regarding his taxes, business and allegations of sexual assault.\u201d In the final hours of the campaign, Trump and Biden hopscotched the country, trying to shore up their chances in the swing states. \u201cWe\u2019re getting your husbands back to work,\u201d Trump told a rally in Michigan, in what Kara Alaimo called a horribly misguided plea to suburban women voters, who have turned against the President. \u201cThe implications here \u2013 that he believes all women have or should have husbands and that workplaces are the province of men \u2013 are so sexist and outmoded that they will likely alarm American women who have long become accustomed to inappropriate treatment from their commander in chief,\u201d she wrote. The closing days of the campaign coincided with a new surge of Covid-19 cases around the country. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, \u201cWe are not going to control the pandemic,\u201d and in doing so, he summed up the fears many have about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cDonald Trump has surrendered without ever joining the battle,\u201d wrote Jeffrey D. Sachs, calling him the \u201cthe greatest presidential failure in American history.\u201d He observed, \u201cTrump\u2019s stupidity came in his false belief that the choice before the country was to let the epidemic rage or to shut down the economy.\u201d (For a look at 12 ways the US response to Covid-19 has failed, read David Holtgrave\u2019s view.) As Laurie Garrett pointed out, the President signed a little-noticed executive order that could have a profound effect on the future ability of federal officials to freely follow the science on the pandemic. \u201cIt appears to stifle the President\u2019s opponents within the government, posing a particular danger should it affect policymakers who are working tirelessly to fight the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d The order reclassifies an estimated 100,000 or more federal jobs \u2013 it \u201celiminates the employee\u2019s ability to appeal a dismissal and lumps him or her among political appointees \u2014 essentially serving at the pleasure of the President.\u201d Garrett described it as \u201can edict expected under a dictatorship, a banana republic or a military regime.\u201d Jared Kushner\u2019s comments to a Fox News anchor that Trump \u201ccan\u2019t want\u201d Black people \u201cto be successful more than they want to be successful\u201d also drew criticism. Elliot Williams wrote, \u201cIt is hard to see Kushner\u2019s comments as anything other than an attempt to solidify President Trump\u2019s white-male base the week before an election. But it\u2019s remarkable to see how a series of tossed off comments that were supposed to be a list of accomplishments could have been so ignorant, deceitful and insulting to Black people at the same time.\u201d For more on the election: Nicole Hemmer: The long history of all-in-the-family political attacks Dean Obeidallah: Obama gives us one of the best reasons to dump Trump John D.

Topic A is the Covid-19 pandemic. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who served in former President Barack Obama\u2019s cabinet, and Frances Fragos Townsend, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s White House, wrote that \u201cthe next president will confront a dual challenge: managing the current pandemic and ensuring that the country and the world are better prepared when the next plague strikes \u2013 as it inevitably will. It is past time for the nation to make the investments we need to prevent, detect and respond quickly to emerging infectious diseases, like the coronavirus, before they sicken Americans and force catastrophic economic shutdowns.\u201d Cupp discussed the issue on video with Dr. Leana Wen, historian Julian Zelizer and Tom Nichols, author of \u201cThe Death of Expertise.\u201d In coming weeks, the series, edited by Yaffa Fredrick and Laura Juncadella, will look at issues such as the economy and race. The newly elected President will be faced with responding to a year that \u201chas laid bare, for all the world to see, the depth and breadth of racial injustice in American society,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph. \u201cRegardless of the election outcome, transformational change must be the next step, with racial justice advocates helping all of us to re-imagine American democracy and calling on leaders to repurpose national policy ambitions in service of these goals.\u201d Climate change will also be an issue for the US, given the \u201copportunity to substantially reduce carbon emissions while creating millions of new green-tech jobs that could help revive and strengthen the American economy after the Covid-19 crisis,\u201d wrote Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy. A key player will be the Defense Department, whose bases could be imperiled, she observed. \u201cClimate change is already causing the armed forces to plan for new contingencies: from being prepared to undertake more frequent disaster relief missions to anticipating instability and conflict created by resource scarcity and population migrations.\u201d Four years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime expected and feared that Hillary Clinton would be elected president, wrote Mikhail Fishman, former editor in chief of the Moscow Times. \u201cClinton was hawkish on Russia and was expected to marshal a coalition of Western leaders to try to isolate Russia,\u201d he noted. Now the calculation is roughly similar. \u201cA Biden victory could mean the Kremlin will be again facing a more united West \u2013 the same threat to Putin\u2019s agenda as four years ago, and in similar circumstances,\u201d Fishman wrote, as part of a number of global reaction pieces curated by Arlene Getz for CNN Opinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d on weekends. Somehow, in his desperate effort to keep his tax returns out of the hands of prosecutors, President Donald Trump has lost in federal court five times. And, remarkably, even after those stinging rejections by the courts, it\u2019s still not over yet.  Trump is now down to his final shot to prevent prosecutors from getting his tax returns. He\u2019ll almost certainly lose on the merits \u2013 but if the goal was simply to drag this dispute out beyond the election, then he\u2019ll have won, despite all the losing. Last month\u2019s explosive New York Times expose gave us a hint about why Trump might be flailing so hard to prevent prosecutors with the New York County (Manhattan) District Attorney\u2019s office from obtaining his tax returns via a subpoena issued to the accounting firm Mazars USA. The Times piece raised a panoply of serious questions: How on earth did Trump twice pay only $750 in federal income taxes? How can Trump justify a payment of over $700,000 to his daughter Ivanka Trump as a \u201cconsultant\u201d? Did Trump properly obtain a tax refund of over $72 million in 2010? How and when does he intend to repay the hundreds of millions of dollars he appears to owe to various unknown creditors? When the DA\u2019s subpoena calling for the tax returns first landed, Trump responded by raising an \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d defense, arguing that he cannot even be investigated criminally while in office. The federal courts did not agree, to put it mildly.  First, federal district court Judge Victor Marrero \u2013 I appeared in front of him many times and he\u2019s as even-keeled a jurist as you\u2019ll find \u2013 forcefully rejected Trump\u2019s argument, calling \u201caspects of such a doctrine repugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d (0 for 1, for those keeping count). A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concurred, quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s warning in the Richard Nixon tapes case that Trump\u2019s argument, if accepted, would \u201cgravely impair the basic function of the courts.\u201d (0 for 2). The Supreme Court then granted \u201ccertiorari,\u201d meaning it decided to take the case.  Once again, Trump lost. This time, it had to hurt a little extra to see both of his own Supreme Court nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, side against him in a 7-2 ruling. At this point, Trump was 0 for 3. But it wasn\u2019t over yet because, while the Court rejected the President\u2019s specific \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d argument, it still left the door open for him to make other arguments against the subpoena. Trump's taxes tell a tale of debt and desperation So down we went to the district court to begin another go-round. This time, Trump tried new legal arguments \u2013 he claimed the subpoena was overbroad and meant to harass \u2013 and he met with just as little success. Judge Marrero rejected Trump\u2019s challenge (0 for 4) and the Court of Appeals did the same (0 for 5). Trump now has asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, for a second time.  One way or another, this will be the last stop.  I doubt the Court will take the case; the Court of Appeals correctly and pointedly noted that the subpoena calls for \u201crun-of-the-mill documents typically relevant to a grand jury investigation.\u201d This language seems purposeful; the Supreme Court generally steers clear of \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d disputes. And if the Court does take the case, then I see no realistic chance they come out in Trump\u2019s favor, given the merit of his arguments and the Court\u2019s prior 7-2 rejection of his initial claim. Trump almost certainly will lose this legal battle at some point, likely soon. But ultimately he will prevail simply by jamming up the system. He has appealed, and re-appealed, and re-re-re-appealed.  As a result, the Manhattan DA likely will not have the tax returns before Election Day, and the general public certainly won\u2019t see them by then. Credit Trump for this much: he has figured out a way to turn 0 for 5 into a win. Now, your questions: Trump's puny $750 tax bill proves he's right \u2014 the system is broken Jeff (Idaho): Can Congress reduce the number of Supreme Court Justices, or only increase? Congress technically can either increase or decrease the number of seats on the Supreme Court. We\u2019ve become used to having nine seats on the Supreme Court, but the Constitution actually does not specify any particular number. Congress has the power to set that number through legislation, and it has exercised that power throughout the nation\u2019s early history; at times, we\u2019ve had as few as five and as many as 10 justices on the Court. But the current law, setting the number at nine, was passed over 150 years ago, in 1869. So while we\u2019ve gotten used to the notion of a nine-justice Supreme Court, Congress does have the power to either increase or decrease the number of seats. Decreasing the number would run into the practical and legal difficulty of removing one or more sitting justices, who, under the Constitution, serve life terms. If a decrease is the object, then perhaps the only workable solution then is to provide that some set number of vacancies, as they arise, will not be filled, until we are left with the desired number of seats. Mary (North Carolina): Does the president have authority to issue a nationwide face mask mandate? Probably. Federal law gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to issue regulations that \u201cin his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases\u201d from foreign countries into the United States, or between states. The President, as head of the Executive Branch, can instruct the Secretary to exercise this power. That federal government\u2019s authority here is extraordinarily broad. For example, the law permits the Secretary to require \u201cinspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated.\u201d Logically, if the regulations can go so far as to require extermination or destruction of goods to prevent the spread of disease, then it should also permit a mandatory order that people wear face masks in public, which, if anything, is less drastic and less intrusive.  Daniel (New York): In the line of succession, does the secretary of state or the speaker of the house become president, after the vice president? Federal law provides that the speaker of the House and the Senate president pro tempore are third and fourth in line to the presidency, followed by the secretary of state. But the Constitution itself provides that only an \u201cofficer\u201d can succeed to the presidency, and there is a constitutional question about whether congressional leaders qualify as \u201cofficers\u201d given the original meaning and intent of the Constitutional framers. There is some historical support for the notion that \u201cofficers\u201d means only Executive Branch officials, and not members of Congress; if so, then the secretary of state, not the speaker of the House, would be third in line of succession. In the very unlikely event that succession ever got that far, we could see a legal dispute that likely would wind up in the Supreme Court. ",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN. The fever may be starting to break. Donald Trump has held his party in line with bullying tactics and the white-hot love of the conservative populist base. But now \u2014 badly trailing in the polls and marred by increasingly erratic, self-sabotaging behavior \u2014 there are signs that some Republicans are beginning to distance themselves from Trump in a desperate attempt to avoid political doom. The unlikely canary in the coal mine came in the form of Arizona Sen. Martha McSally \u2014 typically a Trump sycophant \u2014 who avoided answering several direct questions on whether she was proud of her support for the President during her debate against Democratic challenger Mark Kelly. Instead, she robotically repeated that she was \u201cproud to be fighting for Arizona.\u201d It wasn\u2019t subtle but it was strategic. That\u2019s because hugging Donald Trump too tight is a liability in a purple state general election. Independents make up 32% of registered voters in Arizona and in the latest CNN poll, Trump has just a 37% approval rate among independents nationally. In Arizona, Trump has the added burden of repeatedly insulting the state\u2019s favorite son, John McCain, whose wife Cindy has endorsed Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s persistent disrespect of McCain provoked McSally to slap the President more directly: \u201cIt pisses me off when he does it.\u201d It\u2019s not that McSally had a change of heart or mind. It\u2019s that she\u2019s losing by 11 points, according to a recent New York Times/Siena poll, to Kelly, an astronaut and husband of former Arizona congresswoman and gun-reform advocate Gabby Giffords. It\u2019s not just an Arizona problem. In Texas, polls show a surprisingly tight race between Trump and Biden. Perhaps not coincidentally, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn \u2014 running for a fourth term against combat veteran M.J. Hegar \u2014 notably dared to criticize Trump last week, saying that the President \u201clet his guard down\u201d and stirred \u201cconfusion\u201d with his chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI think the biggest mistake people make in public life is not telling the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cparticularly in something with as much public interest as here because you know the real story is going to come out.\u201d Trump's grotesque coronavirus theater In Iowa \u2014 a state that voted for Trump by a margin of almost 10 points in 2016 \u2014 Republican Sen. Joni Ernst is down 5% to her Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield. In Colorado, Republican Sen. Cory Gardner has been trailing former Gov. John Hickenlooper for the duration of the race. In Maine, self-styled moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins \u2014 who refused to even vote for witnesses during the Trump impeachment trial \u2014 finds herself staring at the end of a quarter-century career. Legendary Republican campaign strategist Ed Rollins, who is the chair of the pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, told me \u201cI\u2019m afraid the race is over.\u201d Rollins said that he \u201cwould definitely recommend that candidates make the case for their own reelection, and when asked about President Trump they should say \u2018I support him when it\u2019s in the interest of my state, North Carolina, Arizona \u2014 and oppose him when it\u2019s not in the interest of our state. My job to support the people of our state.\u2019\u201d The respected Cook Political Report rated Republican-held Senate seats as toss-ups in typically red states like South Carolina, Georgia and Montana \u2014 which Trump won by a cumulative average of 13 points four years ago. \u201cWhat happened after the first presidential debate is every Senate race saw a 3- to 4-point drop [for Republican candidates] across the board,\u201d said Rollins. \u201cSo campaigns are panicking and it\u2019s the first time in a long while that they are being outraised. The potential is there to lose not only the presidency but the Senate as well\u2026and to see the kind of wipeout we haven\u2019t an experienced since the post-Watergate year of 1974.\u201d The idea that incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham could be in a neck-and-neck race in South Carolina against Jamie Harrison would have seemed absurd in any other cycle \u2014 but that\u2019s where we are. Lindsey Graham\u2019s embrace of Trump after Trump\u2019s attacks on his good friend John McCain have not reflected well on his character. The smell of desperation has only increased over the past week, after Trump\u2019s disastrous performance at the first presidential debate that widened the already cavernous gender gap and pushed Biden to a 21-point edge among senior citizens in the latest CNN poll. In the wake of the White House Covid-outbreak and Trump\u2019s subsequent \u201c\u2018roid rage\u201d tweets, single-handedly scuttling Covid-relief bills, calls to arrest political opponents and even attacking loyal-to-a-fault cabinet members Attorney General Bill Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made some wonder if Trump would take everyone down with him. America is hurtling toward a crossroads on November 3. What comes next? There\u2019s reason to worry. The Republican Party has not prospered under Trump nearly as much as Trump has prospered \u2014 in fame and influence \u2014 from his takeover of the GOP. He\u2019s been so focused on projecting strength to the base that it\u2019s obscured the fact that he\u2019s really weak with the general electorate. In the 2018 midterms, Republicans got crushed not just by a \u201cblue wave\u201d but a \u201cblue tsunami\u201d as my CNN colleague Harry Enten called it \u2014 resulting in Democrats gaining 40 House seats, their largest pick-up since the post-Watergate surge of 1974 \u2014 and that\u2019s despite a massive degree of gerrymandering designed to stop Democrats from getting their fair share of congressional seats, commensurate to the popular vote. Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both faced midterm election repudiations, but they both easily won reelection. That does not seem to be the scenario Donald Trump is heading into this fall. Despite this destructive dynamic, Republicans in Congress have been caught in a Catch-22. While Trump is hugely popular with the base, he has been a historically unpopular president overall \u2014 the only president in the history of the Gallup Poll to never be above 50% in his approval rating, despite low unemployment before the coronavirus crisis. But because of polarization, power in the party has been driven to the margins, with most members of Congress more afraid of losing a partisan primary than a general election. As a result, they live in fear of a presidential tweet, offending a conservative donor or being attacked by a right-wing website. All this breeds anemic apparatchiks. Whether it is Trump\u2019s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power or refusal to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, a reluctance to clearly condemn white supremacists or allegations that he insulted the sacrifice of US troops (Trump has denied the claims), there has seemed to be no red line that Trump could cross that would cause Republican elected officials to speak out. This even as more than 200 former GOP elected, national security and George W. Bush administration alumnae leaders have crossed party lines to endorse Joe Biden, including former members of the Trump administration itself. But what happens when politicians\u2019 self-interest starts to override Trump\u2019s blustering excesses? And what\u2019s stopping more from stepping off the Trump train before it runs off the tracks?  Many saw Trump pull off an impossible win last time around \u2014 despite all the polls \u2014 and some believe that it\u2019s destined to happen again, data be damned. Others are afraid that speaking out will destroy any hope of higher office in some future Republican Party, where Trumpists will retain influence. Still others just don\u2019t want to deal with the grief from hyperpartisan trolls on social media or salve their bruised conscience with negative partisanship, telling themselves that Bernie Sanders, not Joe Biden, is the de facto nominee of the Democratic Party. Finally, for others, it\u2019s just too late to have a conversion experience and credibly campaign as an independent-minded Republican. They worry they could lose the base while failing to gain the center. A week is a long time in politics, especially when Donald Trump is throwing bombs. Anything can happen \u2014 it is 2020, after all. But as he threatens democratic norms and insists on his alternate reality, more Republicans may \u2014 at least in cold moments of private panic \u2014 awaken from their hyperpartisan stupor to realize that loyalty is always a one-way street with Trump. Facing defeat, despite all the self-debasement, they might realize that their first impressions of Trump were right, before they rationalized it all away for proximity to power at the expense of their principles. As Lindsey Graham tweeted in 2016: \u201cIf we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed \u2026 and we will deserve it.\u201d This article has been updated to include an additional quote from Ed Rollins about the potential for Republicans to lose the White House and Senate.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Elie Honig is a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d on weekends. If there was any question before about whether William Barr could be willing to use his power as attorney general to tilt the scales in the upcoming presidential election, there shouldn\u2019t be anymore.  Barr appeared to confirm as much in his interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN Wednesday: that he would be willing to breach longstanding Justice Department norms \u2013 that is, the unwritten \u201c60-day rule\u201d \u2013 to advantage the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump. Barr also continued to claim that mail-in ballots provide potential for widespread fraud. \u201cElections that have been held with mail have found substantial fraud and coercion,\u201d he said. When asked by Blitzer whether he could cite any prosecutions relating to this purportedly widespread criminal phenomenon, Barr responded by citing one case \u2013 yes, one. Blitzer asked: \u201cYou\u2019ve said you\u2019re worried a foreign country could send thousands of fake ballots \u2026 what are you basing that on?\u201d \u201cLogic,\u201d Barr replied.  \u201cBut have you seen any evidence?,\u201d Blitzer pressed?  \u201cNo,\u201d Barr replied. I\u2019m trying to envision what would have happened in my Justice Department days if I had made a crucial assertion about a case and, when asked by a judge for proof, responded that I had none \u2013 but it was \u201clogic.\u201d  It would not have ended well. Barr has made entirely clear that he intends to continue parroting Trump\u2019s most paranoid, cooked-up conspiracy theories about massive fraud in mail-in voting.  If we end up in a dreaded (but eminently possible) contested election scenario, Barr is offering plenty of reason to expect that he would be prepared to use the might of the Justice Department to swing the outcome towards Trump. The attorney general also tipped off another trick he may have up his sleeve. Traditionally, the Justice Department will not announce a new case that has political implications within this period. This 60-day rule (or the \u201cblackout rule,\u201d as it is sometimes called) reflects the Justice Department\u2019s vital commitment to keep its awesome prosecution power out of electoral politics wherever possible. In essence, unless it is absolutely unavoidable, the Justice Department will refrain from announcing new charges or from taking overt investigative steps (such as executing a search warrant) that might impact an upcoming election. As the Republican-appointed Mukasey stated while serving as attorney general, \u201cSimply put, politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges.\u201d But contrary to Justice Department practice under both political parties, Barr is keeping the door wedged open to deliver Trump a September or October surprise. Barr had already signaled that he will not respect the 60-day rule as it relates to any potential indictments resulting from the ongoing investigation by John Durham into the origins of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. When asked during his House Judiciary Committee testimony in July 2020 whether he would observe the 60-day rule relating to the Durham investigation, Barr responded flatly, \u201cNo.\u201d Barr reiterated in his interview with Blitzer that he is aware of the rule but does not believe it necessarily applies to the Durham investigation.  He said: \u201cI will handle these cases as appropriate, and I do not think anything we do in the Durham investigation is going to be affecting the election.\u201d For an example of the perils created by violation of the 60-day rule, look no further than 2016 when FBI Director James Comey announced the outcome of the Hillary Clinton investigation in July 2016 (outside the technical 60-day period) and then announced a reopening of the investigation in October 2016, just days before the election \u2013 a move the Justice Department inspector general later found to be a \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d that violated \u201clongstanding Department practice.\u201d Vinograd: This is one of the scariest things I've said on TV Barr himself has embraced the policy, in writing. The problem is Barr also has made clear elsewhere that he intends to apply it selectively and \u2013 no surprise, given Barr\u2019s recent history \u2013 to Trump\u2019s benefit.  The issue is not whether Durham will or won\u2019t find additional evidence of wrongdoing at the FBI, as he already has with the charging of FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith for falsifying an email related to a surveillance warrant. If Durham finds similar or other criminal wrongdoing elsewhere, those charges should be brought. The issue is whether Barr will refrain from announcing any new charges within the 60-day period based on the outcomes of this investigation. And considering Barr\u2019s House testimony, in which he draws a tortured distinction, it is unlikely. The 60-day rule prohibits announcement of new indictments close to the election if those cases are political \u2013 but, in Barr\u2019s apparent rationale, any indictments resulting from the Durham investigation do not qualify because he does not consider it political. This is utter nonsense, and Barr must know it. First, the Durham investigation itself, which began in 2019, was born of partisan politics. Even though both Republican and nonpartisan authorities \u2013 including the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, the nonpartisan Justice Department inspector general (originally a Barack Obama appointee but kept on board by Trump), and longtime Republican Robert Mueller \u2013 have already found that the 2016 investigation of Russian interference was both necessary and proper, Barr still insisted on commissioning Durham to try again to breathe life into Trump\u2019s ridiculous \u201cRussian hoax\u201d narrative. (Tellingly, Barr casually repeated Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory, referring casually to the \u201cthe Russiagate thing\u201d in his interview with Blitzer). Lawmaker: Barr will always be Trump's henchman Not only is Barr twisting common sense to reach his pro-Trump conclusion, but he also knows better. As Just Security\u2019s Ryan Goodman noted, Barr himself took a broad view of the 60-day rule during his first term as attorney general in the early 1990s. Back then, Barr said essentially that any case even peripherally touching on a candidate falls within the 60-day rule. Now, Barr seems to take a much narrower view that would limit the 60-day rule only to cases that charge an actual candidate or somebody close to that candidate. We already have seen what Barr is willing to do, how he has twisted the facts and norms \u2013 time and again \u2013 to serve Trump and his allies. He distorted parts of the Mueller report, prompting the special counsel to write a letter taking issue with Barr\u2019s characterization of his findings. Barr allegedly pressured the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York to resign under dubious circumstances, which ultimately led to the attorney\u2019s departure from the Justice Department. And he intervened in the cases of Trump political allies and advisers Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. In the case of Flynn, Barr sought to dismiss charges, but the appellate court ruled that the district court could conduct further proceedings to decide whether to grant the request. And, in the case of Stone, Barr overruled the trial prosecutors and requested a lower sentence that Trump ultimately commuted. The pattern is clear. Now, with the election right around the corner, do not be surprised if Barr continues what he has started and uses the Justice Department\u2019s might to tilt the scales in Trump\u2019s favor. Susan (Ohio): Can the President pardon Steve Bannon even though he has not been tried? Yes. The constitutional pardon power is extraordinarily broad, with virtually no explicit limitations. Article II provides that the President \u201cshall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\u201d (meaning the President cannot unimpeach an official who has been impeached). In short, there is no requirement in the US Constitution or anywhere else in our laws that a person must be tried, convicted or sentenced before the President can issue a pardon. Presidents have issued pardons throughout history for people who have not even been criminally charged, never mind convicted or sentenced. Then-President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon in 1974, shortly after Nixon\u2019s resignation but before Nixon was ever charged with any crime relating to Watergate (or anything else). In 1977, then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam War draft dodgers as a group, many of whom had never been charged with crimes. And, in 1868, then-President Andrew Johnson pardoned former Confederate soldiers, many of whom had not been criminally charged. Alicia (Ohio):  Is there a federal law requiring that voters send mail-in ballots through the US Postal Service, or can they send in ballots through private delivery services, such as FedEx or UPS? There is no federal law requiring that mail-in ballots be sent through the United States Postal Service or prohibiting people from sending in their ballots through private carriers, but virtually every relevant party advises against relying on private carriers. FedEx and UPS have both issued statements warning against and discouraging people from using their services for mail-in ballots. The primary concern is that rules and regulations can vary by state and by county, and it is possible that not all election officials would accept private delivery. According to election experts, the better approach for people worried about making sure their ballots will be counted is to mail in ballots as early as possible, or to deliver ballots directly to secure dropoff locations or local elections offices. Greg (California): Can the president legally remove the presidential two-term limit without congressional approval? No, and even if the president and Congress agreed, they\u2019d still need more to change the presidential two-term limit. Long an unwritten norm established when George Washington refused to run for a third term, the two-term limit formally became part of our Constitution with ratification of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt broke the unwritten rule by running for and winning a third term in office (in 1940) and then a fourth (in 1944).  The only legal way to change the two-term limit is by amending the constitution itself. That is an arduous process that, under Article V of the Constitution, requires proposal by two-thirds votes of both the Senate and House, followed by ratification by three-fourths of the states. Despite Trump\u2019s statements about seeking a third term (or beyond), there is almost no chance we see a constitutional amendment enabling that to happen. 1. Will Wisconsin prosecutors or the Justice Department pursue charges in the police wounding of Jacob Blake and, if so, what charges will they file? 2. How will courts rule on challenges to states sending mail-in ballots to voters in Nevada and New Jersey? 3. Now that the Michael Flynn case is back before the trial-level federal judge, will he dismiss Flynn\u2019s conviction or keep it in place?",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Garry Kasparov is the chairman of the Renew Democracy Initiative. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was flown to Berlin Saturday morning. He was in a coma after suddenly falling ill on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. Physicians in Berlin confirmed the poisoning of yet another Putin critic, and I very much hope not to lose another brave colleague in the fight against Putin\u2019s deadly mafia regime. Navalny came to prominence as an anti-corruption blogger, using investigation techniques and public documents to expose the incredible scale of looting perpetrated by Russia\u2019s ruling elite. He went on YouTube with photos of the spectacular yachts and mansions owned by Russian politicians with modest salaries. Earlier this year, he said that the new prime minister and his family owned $45 million in properties, even as the Kremlin disputed the source of income. He branded Putin\u2019s United Russia forever as \u201cthe party of crooks and thieves.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the traditional model of opposition figures like Boris Nemtsov and me and our grand rhetoric about democracy and freedom. It was local and concrete\u2014and it worked. The corruption theme struck a chord, especially with young Russians who never knew the Soviet Union and weren\u2019t motivated by ideology. But they knew they were being ripped off, and they were empowered by Navalny and his team\u2019s use of budget documents and investigative know-how to expose Putin\u2019s gang for what they are. He brought a new, young crowd to our coalition movement\u2019s a decade ago. Of course, Navalny\u2019s success and popularity put a target on his back, as well as everyone in his family and on his team. He exposed corruption, the lifeblood of Putin\u2019s mafia. Navalny has been arrested over a dozen times, attacked with a chemical that left him with permanent eye damage, and his family\u2019s bank accounts have been frozen. His brother was jailed in what was widely seen as a politically motivated case, his group\u2019s offices are routinely raided, as are the homes of his staff, even those of their parents and in-laws. That\u2019s how mafias work. Russian democracy is a farce. Putin wants the same fate for America But Navalny avoided the worst, at least until now. He wasn\u2019t jailed for the long sentences others suffered, or gunned down like prominent investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya and Boris Nemtsov. He didn\u2019t fall out of a window like so many Russians seem to do\u2014or go into exile like I did. The impression was that the Putin regime was wary of making a martyr of the popular Navalny, that they preferred to harass him and limit the damage. That uneasy equilibrium ended in agony on Thursday, when Navalny fell violently ill. It may have been something in his tea, but Russian agents have great experience with various methods of delivering toxins. This is the way of dictatorships, of Putin\u2019s in particular, of steady escalation. And please don\u2019t insult my intelligence with theories about rogue elements in a KGB-style  dictatorship who may be responsible. As with everything from election interference in the UK and US to a global assassination campaign, no one in Russia would risk attacking such a high-profile target without approval from the very top. Nor was this a trivial operation. It required real-time information, resources and expertise. The heavy involvement of security forces at the Omsk hospital Navalny was first brought to also suggested direct regime involvement. The doctors initially refused to release him (the head doctor said Navalny was too unstable to be released), and Navalny\u2019s personal doctor said she believed Russian authorities were trying to delay his departure long enough that it would be difficult to detect a substance in his system , which complicates both the patient\u2019s treatment and the investigation into the attack. If the Omsk doctors participated in any unnecessary delaying tactics, they have much to answer for. Perhaps Putin felt even more impunity than ever after the constitutional changes that confirmed his status as Russia\u2019s eternal supreme leader. Why bother entertaining even token opposition at this point? Maybe Putin wanted to make a big statement in the face of the huge pro-democracy protests in neighboring Belarus, where he is backing his fellow dictator, Alexander Lukashenko. Perhaps he doesn\u2019t think he will face consequences, as with his countless other actions. Dictators don\u2019t stop until they are stopped. Opinion: What's stopping Putin from expanding further? But wondering why Putin might, do this, and why now, is a distraction from the brutal facts and his long track record. I\u2019ve been asked many times, \u201cIf Putin is so terrible, why are you still alive, Garry?\u201d My answer, as always, is that anyone asking such a question will simply move on and ask the same of another name, another critic, even if something did befall me. We know what Putin is and what he is capable of. So, don\u2019t ask me or anyone else to explain what just happened to Alexey Navalny. Ask Putin. And yet, western foreign policy experts and diplomats are still proposing new resets and engagement policies with Putin\u2019s Russia. Last year, we were told that Russia\u2019s return to the Council of Europe would be \u201cgood news for Russia\u2019s civil society.\u201d  Earlier in the month, dozens of prominent names signed a letter proposing yet another \u201crethink\u201d of America\u2019s Russia policy after the disastrous Obama-era reset and Trump\u2019s open sycophancy toward Putin. I\u2019d certainly welcome a rethink if it would finally treat Putin\u2019s mafia state like the rogue nation it has become\u2014not one that would recognize Putin as a legitimate leader capable of being a reliable partner in resolving global problems. Unless you live in a fantasy world in which dozens of critics of a ruthless dictator\u2019s die horribly or fall gravely ill for no special reason, you might see Navalny\u2019s condition as Putin\u2019s response to all these pathetic entreaties. He will do what he wants, kill who he wants, and still expect the leaders of the free world to come back for more instead of isolating him and sanctioning him and his cronies into oblivion.  But he must be worried about the future. Joe Biden\u2019s prompt and strong statement about the attack on Navalny stands out against days of silence from the Trump administration, which belatedly called for a full investigation by Russian authorities. (That is, instead of a full international investigation of the Russian authorities, which would actually be of use.) Putin and other dictators may well be rushing to carry out their to-do lists before someone less compliant sits in the Oval Office. It cannot happen soon enough, and I pray it\u2019s not too late for Alexey Navalny. In the span of a few months, Putin has confirmed his status as dictator for life and his leading critic has been poisoned. At a moment when everyone is supposed to be wearing face coverings, Putin has removed his mask once and for all.",

            "article_content": "With few primary season challengers and strong support from his base, President Donald Trump easily emerged as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee. As delegates prepare for their convention, where Trump will be formally nominated, CNN Opinion asked 11 contributors from across the Republican spectrum to weigh in on their visions for the future of the party. If President Donald Trump wins again in November, the future of the party seems rather clear: Trumpism reigns supreme. His reelection, regardless of whether he receives a majority of the popular vote or not, will be hailed by the party as an affirmation of all things Trump. Reluctant Republican members of Congress will either resign themselves to play along \u2013 or they\u2019ll resign from office all together. During the 2013 government shutdown, House Republican leadership referred to it as a \u201ctouch the stove\u201d moment. If our members touch the stove, thus shutting down the government despite no strategic or principled imperative, we thought they would soon realize it\u2019s too hot. We were wrong. Many of them touched the stove, the government shut down \u2013 and there were limited electoral repercussions for the GOP. For the past four years, Republicans have been leaning on that same stove. If they get burned this time, and the 2018 House midterm results combined with recent polling suggest they might, it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what direction the party goes, because it\u2019ll feel pressure from multiple factions. Some Republicans, queasy but quiet over how Trump has governed, will want to return to pre-2009 \u2013 before the rise of the tea party and House Freedom Caucus, whom they blame for laying the foundation for Trump\u2019s rise to power. Others will seek that mantle of fiscal and social conservative purity that Trump never truly represented, hoping to return to a Ronald Reagan type of conservatism that valued low taxes and family values. And the President\u2019s most vocal supporters, for whom his personality was always more important than his principles, may well find reason in a Trump loss to claim the party was not quite Trumpy enough. Each President puts his own stamp on a party, but perhaps none more so than Trump \u2013 and to a party that so willingly gave itself to him, despite his lack of conservative credentials or being, well, a lifelong Republican. But once the party crosses that threshold, it can never fully cross back. Voters know this, which is why with a shrinking base and demographics increasingly against them, Republicans may be in for a long and painstaking journey back to relevancy. Douglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator. Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. As Democrats have lurched left and President Donald Trump has embraced a more populist agenda, we are seeing a realignment in American politics, in which working-class voters are moving right while many wealthy elites and suburban professionals shift left. In fact, following the 2018 midterms, 54 of the 66 wealthiest congressional districts in America were held by Democrats. As such, the Republican Party of the future may well be more economically and culturally diverse than ever before. While the Democrats\u2019 top-down, big government-led approach to public policy has had some appeal, in theory, it fails in practice. The contrast between heavily regulated and perpetually indebted Democrat-run states and their largely fiscally prudent red state counterparts is becoming more obvious with each passing day. State fiscal rankings by George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center since 2006 have consistently found blue states at the bottom for fiscal solvency, considering measures like cash-on-hand, ability to meet long-term commitments and unfunded liabilities like pension costs. I would like to see the party capitalize on this advantage and others that drew me, a first generation Black American, into the fold. Republicans have answers to poverty that actually work. Their pro-work, pro-family, pro-business, low tax agenda creates jobs and expands opportunity. Meanwhile, blue state policies incentivize government dependence, focusing on enlarging safety nets and thus disincentivizing work. As result, blue states take eight of the top ten highest rankings for welfare spending per capita, while traditionally red states consistently rank lowest. Though many in the party, including me, may be upset and tired of the brashness and combative style of President Donald Trump, we benefit from many of the policies he has promoted, including tax cuts, regulatory reform, better trade deals and energy independence. Additionally, instead of dictating from the top, Trump has in many cases allowed states to be the laboratory of ideas. My background in local government has taught me that, time after time, some of the best and most efficient solutions are found at the local and state level. People want to work, not become government dependents. They want to serve others, not outsource their service to government. They want to live in states that can capably manage their budgets without raising taxes. We can do more to elevate the diverse voices within our party \u2013 women, people of color, immigrants and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are here, and more are coming. We need them, and we should welcome them. Mia Love, a Republican, is a former US representative from Utah\u2019s 4th district and a current CNN political commentator. Before Congress, she served as a mayor and city council member in Utah. President Ronald Reagan used to describe the Republican Party as a three-legged stool, made up of social conservatives, foreign policy hawks and free market/limited government advocates. But that stool began to wobble in 2009, as the tea party emerged on the political scene, offering a more populist alternative to traditional conservatism. And, in the intervening 10 years, the stool appears to have been sold off at a garage sale. Just last month, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley may have written the final epitaph for the Reagan Republican coalition. \u201cIt turns out we haven\u2019t been fighting for very much,\u201d he wrote, referencing the \u201cruinous trade policies\u201d and a party that \u201cfocuse[d] more on cutting taxes and handing out favors for corporations.\u201d But it\u2019s not just the stool metaphor that is missing. The very idea of electoral coalitions is gone from the current Republican Party strategy as well. The GOP\u2019s victory in 2016 was centered around the personality of its candidate. And now the 2020 election will be a referendum on that personality. It\u2019s obvious that voters aren\u2019t weighing the competing policy platforms of two campaigns. As of last week, according to a CBS/YouGov poll, 96% of likely voters said their minds were made up about who to vote for this year. (By way of reference, the same poll in 2016 showed nearly three times as many voters were open to changing their minds even by October.) And in what should be a humbling thought about the future of the Democratic Party, more than half of registered voters supporting Joe Biden chose \u201che is not Trump\u201d as their primary reason. So, what is the future of the Republican Party after November? Win or lose, it will be a party that will never have Donald Trump on the ballot again. And the 2024 nominee will be charting a new path for the Republican Party without the shibboleths of the conservative movement that used to comprise it. But a loss in November will only add fuel to the recriminations from all corners of the previous iterations of the party who wants to claim the mantle of \u201crebuilding\u201d it. Meanwhile voters may start to ask what the party stands for \u2013 and that is an increasingly difficult question to answer. Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst. She is a staff writer at The Dispatch and an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. She previously worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and graduated from Harvard Law School. The Republican Party has experienced a titanic political realignment, a simmering tempest that exploded after years of trade and tax policy that left blue-collar families behind and a progressive cultural movement seeking to redefine our fundamental values. The Wall Street bailouts simply lit the fuse, and these working-class voters became a force with the emergence of the Tea Party. My pro-American manufacturing, traditional values platform appealed to this group of disaffected voters in the 2012 Republican presidential primary. But it was President Donald Trump who was able to do what no candidate had been able to do before \u2013 activating them to win the White House in 2016. Trump identified the importance of work, specifically in the manufacturing and energy sectors, for those left behind by the tech economy and globalism. He understood that we must be a party that drives the kind of economic growth that lifts all workers, especially because nearly 90% of Americans are workers, not business owners.  Policies that lift all Americans win, and so does America. However, as we have been reminded during the Covid-19 pandemic, money isn\u2019t everything.  Americans are worried about their health and family.  Everything the conservative movement advocates must also be seen through the lens of strengthening families, improving quality of life, and lowering the cost while ensuring the high-quality of health care. A GOP agenda focused solely on growing the economy without guaranteeing those policies lift all Americans will be a failed agenda, a realization that current and future leaders like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have forcibly argued. The Republican Party is now attracting blue-collar workers who love America for all it offers and represents \u2013 and that is with or without  Trump in the White House. We must be the party that fights for their economic well-being, supports the family as the basic building block of society and never waivers from advocating for our God-given rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of what makes us truly happy. Rick Santorum is a CNN senior political commentator and a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania. He ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016. I would like to see us get back to standing for and focusing on a platform instead of personalities. I\u2019m not for rigidity that precludes the flexibility to deal with unusual circumstances (i.e. the coronavirus pandemic clearly called for more government spending than your average Republican would want in normal times), but to grow and thrive we have to clearly articulate what we stand for no matter who the president or presidential nominee happens to be. That\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t love candidates who rise up and lead our party \u2013 it is clearly human nature to follow leadership \u2013 but it is to say that those leaders must be clear-eyed about why they are Republicans and that we must hold them to it. Our politics has fallen into the trap that plagues most of American culture \u2013 the celebrification of everything. We chase personalities, rising and falling on their stars, which unfortunately makes us vulnerable to their personal foibles and deviations from our supposed principles and values. Operating a party this way also gives the media too much control of a party\u2019s image; individuals are much more easily destroyed and discredited than a rock solid set of ideals. We have to recognize that policy fights aren\u2019t always won by simply \u201cowning\u201d the other party\u2019s people and plans, as easy as they sometimes make it (and as much fun as it sometimes is). There\u2019s an old saying \u2013 you can\u2019t beat something with nothing. To beat Democrats and their embrace of certain socialist policies, we have to offer policy ideas that appeal to common sense and our conservative worldview. I became a Republican, despite coming from a family of Democrats, for a handful of reasons. I am pro-life, because all life is precious and should be protected. I believe in lower taxes, because I don\u2019t support punishing people who work hard and create opportunity for others. And I think the United States ought to have the most fearsome and lethal military in the world, to serve as a deterrent most of the time and as a force to be reckoned with when bad actors choose to test us. Beyond that, my platform is simple: The Constitution, and the rights enumerated therein, are not negotiable \u2013 especially the right to free speech. American exceptionalism should permeate all of decisions. People should determine their individual path to life, liberty and happiness \u2013 not the government. Work is to be expected, valued and appreciated \u2013 not disincentivized. America welcomes those who are here to work, play by our rules and add value to our society. Our borders are sacred and strong, as is our compassion and goodwill. No law or regulation need exist where common sense and the free market can dictate a good outcome. We should treat others as we expect to be treated \u2013 with respect and dignity. And that\u2019s it. Party platforms needn\u2019t be lengthy, complicated documents. Setting up a series of maxims that guide policy thought and discussion is enough. Individual candidates can then use this kind of platform to develop their more specific policy proposals to achieve those maxims. The Republican Party ought to stand for reason and resist conspiracy theories. Old wisdom rings true to me \u2013 if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is. Being truthful and honorable is always the right answer. And it is never the wrong day to do the right thing. Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. As a longtime Republican, I have found the last four years ranging from disorienting to downright maddening. What happened to the conservative principles that used to undergird the party for decades? In one word, Trump. The advent of President Donald Trump ushered in utter chaos inside the GOP. Conservative orthodoxy was unceremoniously discarded to accommodate whatever Trump impulsively and self-interestedly needed in the moment \u2013 adoration, self-preservation, even revenge. Whether the party will ever wish to reclaim its core principles of fiscal responsibility, limited government, upholding the Constitution and fair elections is anyone\u2019s guess. But the damage is done. The corruption of the Republican Party by Trump is complete. The idea that Republicans can \u2013 earnestly and with a straight face \u2013 just pretend like the last four years never happened and pick up the policies and principles that the party used to espouse strains credulity. It\u2019s not clear, in fact, that they would even want to. The conservatives and moderate Republicans who\u2019ve been left behind by the Trump takeover have found themselves without a home. And so they might consider forming a new party, or joining the legions of independents \u2013 a plurality in America \u2013 who feel that neither Democrats nor Republicans adequately represent them. The GOP should permanently rebrand: the Republican Party is the Trump Party. Whether Trump is President another four years or leaves in November, the party is now his to do with what he wants. Given the fate of his multiple bankrupt businesses, that doesn\u2019t bode very well. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d The future of the Republican Party must be rooted in a principled, next-generation conservatism. That\u2019s the only way that the GOP can expand its appeal to those who do not traditionally think of themselves as conservatives. Unless the Republican Party becomes more appealing to women, the young, those with immigrant backgrounds or minorities who feel marginalized by the current state of conservatism in America, it will have a difficult time growing its base and winning elections in the decades to come. To accomplish this, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t need to turn its back on the conservative principles that have been at the core of its philosophy over the last few decades. Freedom, responsibility and a belief in American exceptionalism have defined conservatism in the United States for the last 50 years. The nature of conservative principles is that they are enduring\u2014and they indeed remain appealing to many Americans. But, to be successful, Republicans must adapt the way in which these conservative principles are applied, the policy ideas that emerge from them and how they describe their philosophy and what it means for peoples\u2019 lives. So, what would it look like for Republicans to embrace a next-generation conservatism? It means realistically assessing the political challenges that the party currently faces and adapting its thinking to changing times, while accommodating more voices to secure a broader range of support. For example, people\u2019s expectations of what the federal government can and should do for them have evolved over the last few decades. The last 20 years, in particular, have featured massive fiscal expansion and policies that dramatically expanded Washington\u2019s role in our lives. The Covid-19  pandemic has only magnified Americans\u2019 expectations. Republicans can and should be for reducing the federal government\u2019s influence in our lives, but this has to be tempered by the recognition that Washington already plays a substantial role in many issue areas people care about, like health care and education. Republicans look out-of-touch when they ignore this reality and make policy pronouncements that are completely dissonant with it. Not all who call themselves Republicans will agree with this approach. And the divisions within the conservative movement and challenges before it are many. But I believe that making the Republican Party broadly appealing again, through an adherence to principled, next-generation conservatism, is the key to success. Lanhee J. Chen is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the Hoover Institution. He served as policy director to the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and a senior adviser to Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential bid. The Republican Party has drifted toward a market fundamentalism in which freer markets and bigger tax cuts are the answer to every question. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey recently declared that \u201ccapitalism is nothing more than economic freedom.\u201d And former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted that \u201cas we are dealing with changes in our economy, tax cuts are always a good idea.\u201d This is not conservative in any meaningful sense of the word. Conservatives value economic freedom, absolutely, but a well-functioning economy is a means to the greater ends of strong families, stable communities and a flourishing nation under limited government. Markets are wonderful, but they only solve some problems. And, sometimes, they are the problem. Contrary to Toomey\u2019s assertion, conservatives recognize that capitalism only works when legal rules and a moral culture channel the pursuit of profit toward advancing the common good. If the system fails to deliver on its promise, as has been the case in recent decades, public policy has a vital role to play. More economic freedom is not enough. A group of conservatives, led by Sens. Josh Hawley, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, have advanced this argument in recent years. Running for president in 2011, Romney broke with GOP orthodoxy on free trade by highlighting China\u2019s destructive effects on our economy. In 2012, then-Professor Hawley published an essay warning that \u201ca rising tide does not necessarily lift all boats\u201d and recommending \u201cstructural renovation\u201d of the economy. And Rubio, who proposed a wage subsidy in 2014 and has led the fight to expand the child tax credit, observed in a speech last November, \u201cour nation does not exist to serve the interests of the market. The market exists to serve our nation and our people.\u201d Their efforts present a vital opportunity for the American right-of-center to develop a genuinely conservative economic platform that focuses on working families. Against a progressive agenda of government programs to provide what people can no longer provide for themselves, conservatives should focus on economic rules and reforms that return supply chains to our shores, create non-college career pathways and give workers a seat at the table. Steps like these can help Americans to achieve what they actually want: the chance to support their own families, contribute productively to their communities and raise children ready to do the same. Oren Cass is the executive director of American Compass and author of \u201cThe Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America.\u201d Former President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cself-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.\u201d Here are some extremely unpleasant observations about the state of the GOP today. The party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan has been upended by a toxic mix of populism and cultural grievance that will ultimately lead to the party\u2019s demise if it continues down its current path. Since the rise of Donald Trump, the Republican Party has morphed into a personality cult no longer interested in civil discourse or rational conservative policy debates. Instead, far right extremists and conspiracy theorists, worshiping at the altar of a dangerous leader who routinely tramples on constitutional norms, have now found their way into the Republican mainstream and have been amplified by the President himself. Revered Republican thought leaders like the late William F. Buckley, William Safire and Charles Krauthammer have been replaced by intellectually dishonest pundits in right-wing media who enthusiastically defend the indefensible night after night. Many Republican elected officials have demonstrated their willingness to sell out every political principle they once held and abdicate their constitutional oversight role to avoid the ire of an unfit President\u2019s tweetstorm, which might threaten their political careers. Gone are the politics of personal responsibility, limited government, uplifting messages of free market prosperity and the importance of honoring America\u2019s strategic global alliances. It\u2019s been replaced with messages of fear, ethnic resentment and isolationism. Character no longer counts. Good governance is no longer a priority. Adherence to democratic ideals and the preservation of institutions no longer matter. The party\u2019s decision to rehash some of the racist fear mongering of Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d campaign messaging adds fuel to the fire of division. Turning a blind eye to the President\u2019s defense of Confederate heritage \u2013 rather than embrace the condemnation of Confederate symbols during a time of a national reckoning on race \u2013 is shameful. Given the rapidly changing demographics in the US, it\u2019s also unsustainable. In order for the GOP to appeal to a broader coalition of voters in future elections, it must purge the party of Trump\u2019s ilk and return to its Party of Lincoln foundation. Without a course correction, it will be relegated to the ash heap of history alongside the Whigs. Tara Setmayer is a former GOP communications director, host of the \u201cHonestly Speaking with Tara\u201d podcast and a CNN political contributor. She is a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project. The future of the Republican Party rests on a simple premise: There\u2019s more that unites us than divides us. It\u2019s imperative that we don\u2019t fuel internal factions, but instead focus on creating substantive policy and space for inclusion. I call this the \u201cwelcome mat\u201d approach, as opposed to the \u201cmembers only\u201d club. Republicans need to continue to reach out to the electorate and communicate why our conservative policies better address their concerns, while avoiding chastising voters if they previously supported Democrats. So, how do Republicans do this? By sticking to policy solutions. With the visible tilt toward socialist policies by high profile members of the Democratic Party, Republicans need to be careful that this does not devolve into a battle of personalities. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and \u201cThe Squad\u201d may be seen as victims if the GOP engages in personal attacks over substantive policy discussions. Of course, this is challenging \u2013 even more so given the ideological divisions within the GOP, but a healthy dose of disagreement is not a bad thing.  It\u2019s also important to note these divisions represent a small fringe element of the GOP. President Donald Trump has strong support within the Republican Party. According to the latest Gallup poll, 90% of Republicans approve of the job he is doing. The vocal minority is therefore just that \u2013 and should not be taken to be representative of the party at large. The toughest challenge moving forward is that we must be careful not to let the different groups within our party become disenfranchised. This means satisfying the needs of the Freedom Caucus wing of the party, along with the more moderate voices. I should note satisfying these different elements should not necessarily include the Never Trumpers. They have allowed their disdain of Trump to justify a potential vote for Joe Biden. These so-called Republicans are now supporting the party of higher taxes, more regulation, weak defense and taxpayer-funded abortion. And anyone who supports that ideology, in my opinion, is not a true Republican. The best school of thought is to \u201cthink strategically and act tactically.\u201d Republicans would be wise to keep that in mind \u2013 and not allow internal fissures to derail party unity. Strategically speaking, the GOP is in a position to win over disillusioned independents and moderate Democrats and hold them long term. We do that by embracing diversity, minorities and social issues with sensitivity \u2013 all the while holding fast to our fundamental conservative tenets. That\u2019s a tough balancing act, but it can be done. Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator, former resident fellow at the Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. A robust debate about the future of the Republican Party is looming \u2013 and a reckoning may be in the offing. Should President Donald Trump win re-election, the GOP\u2019s future will be clear. We\u2019ll simply have more of Trumpism and all that it represents: protectionism, unilateralism, nativism, isolationism and a touch of nihilism. America will become more inward looking and isolated \u2013  solidifying its new approach of \u201cAmerica Alone.\u201d Or, perhaps more likely and as recent polling suggests, Trump loses reelection, at which point the reckoning will commence. Will Trumpism survive Trump? Were party leaders too acquiescent to Trump?  Why did Republicans abandon long held principles to accommodate Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the party? These are all good questions that need to be addressed. But before answering these questions, there is a more immediate problem: How should the GOP respond to radical and intolerant elements within the party, like QAnon conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, if and when they get elected? I have long argued that Republicans must embrace the nation\u2019s demographic changes, rather than resist them. Becoming a more diverse, inclusive and welcoming party is absolutely essential for survival and electoral viability, but that\u2019s an impossible objective to achieve when people like Greene, who make racist and bigoted remarks, ascend to positions of power under the Republican banner. How the party manages these situations will have a real impact on the future. House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wisely moved to remove Iowa Rep. Steve King last year from his committee assignments after recurring, racially incendiary comments. The \u201cSteve King\u201d treatment should be applied to Greene, if she wins her House seat in November. Of course, it doesn\u2019t help matters when Trump calls Greene a \u201cfuture Republican Star,\u201d or his campaign criticizes Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois who had the good sense to call out this craziness when he saw it. Once the GOP gets a handle on this problem, then I would suggest dusting off the 2013 Republican \u201cautopsy\u201d report, published after Mitt Romney\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid, that made many good suggestions about how the party should engage more aggressively with Hispanic, African American and Asian American communities. Furthermore, the Republican Party must resist ideological rigidity and allow for greater social tolerance. Permitting more diversity of opinion within the GOP on issues like marriage equality, reproductive rights, climate change, immigration and other policy matters where the party needs greater flexibility is necessary to remain a national governing coalition. Finally, the party must return to its senses on the importance of maintaining an open market, global trading regime and a system of strategic alliances that have advanced America\u2019s economic and security interests since the end of World War II. This means replacing the protectionist, crony capitalist model, which is a core pillar of Trumpism. And it means rebuilding relationships among allies that have been badly damaged, rejecting nakedly self-serving overtures from autocrats and accepting that American interests can be advanced through multilateral organizations. This debate is long overdue. Let\u2019s have at it.

            "article_content": "With few primary season challengers and strong support from his base, President Donald Trump easily emerged as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee. As delegates prepare for their convention, where Trump will be formally nominated, CNN Opinion asked 11 contributors from across the Republican spectrum to weigh in on their visions for the future of the party. If President Donald Trump wins again in November, the future of the party seems rather clear: Trumpism reigns supreme. His reelection, regardless of whether he receives a majority of the popular vote or not, will be hailed by the party as an affirmation of all things Trump. Reluctant Republican members of Congress will either resign themselves to play along \u2013 or they\u2019ll resign from office all together. During the 2013 government shutdown, House Republican leadership referred to it as a \u201ctouch the stove\u201d moment. If our members touch the stove, thus shutting down the government despite no strategic or principled imperative, we thought they would soon realize it\u2019s too hot. We were wrong. Many of them touched the stove, the government shut down \u2013 and there were limited electoral repercussions for the GOP. For the past four years, Republicans have been leaning on that same stove. If they get burned this time, and the 2018 House midterm results combined with recent polling suggest they might, it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what direction the party goes, because it\u2019ll feel pressure from multiple factions. Some Republicans, queasy but quiet over how Trump has governed, will want to return to pre-2009 \u2013 before the rise of the tea party and House Freedom Caucus, whom they blame for laying the foundation for Trump\u2019s rise to power. Others will seek that mantle of fiscal and social conservative purity that Trump never truly represented, hoping to return to a Ronald Reagan type of conservatism that valued low taxes and family values. And the President\u2019s most vocal supporters, for whom his personality was always more important than his principles, may well find reason in a Trump loss to claim the party was not quite Trumpy enough. Each President puts his own stamp on a party, but perhaps none more so than Trump \u2013 and to a party that so willingly gave itself to him, despite his lack of conservative credentials or being, well, a lifelong Republican. But once the party crosses that threshold, it can never fully cross back. Voters know this, which is why with a shrinking base and demographics increasingly against them, Republicans may be in for a long and painstaking journey back to relevancy. Douglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator. Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. As Democrats have lurched left and President Donald Trump has embraced a more populist agenda, we are seeing a realignment in American politics, in which working-class voters are moving right while many wealthy elites and suburban professionals shift left. In fact, following the 2018 midterms, 54 of the 66 wealthiest congressional districts in America were held by Democrats. As such, the Republican Party of the future may well be more economically and culturally diverse than ever before. While the Democrats\u2019 top-down, big government-led approach to public policy has had some appeal, in theory, it fails in practice. The contrast between heavily regulated and perpetually indebted Democrat-run states and their largely fiscally prudent red state counterparts is becoming more obvious with each passing day. State fiscal rankings by George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center since 2006 have consistently found blue states at the bottom for fiscal solvency, considering measures like cash-on-hand, ability to meet long-term commitments and unfunded liabilities like pension costs. I would like to see the party capitalize on this advantage and others that drew me, a first generation Black American, into the fold. Republicans have answers to poverty that actually work. Their pro-work, pro-family, pro-business, low tax agenda creates jobs and expands opportunity. Meanwhile, blue state policies incentivize government dependence, focusing on enlarging safety nets and thus disincentivizing work. As result, blue states take eight of the top ten highest rankings for welfare spending per capita, while traditionally red states consistently rank lowest. Though many in the party, including me, may be upset and tired of the brashness and combative style of President Donald Trump, we benefit from many of the policies he has promoted, including tax cuts, regulatory reform, better trade deals and energy independence. Additionally, instead of dictating from the top, Trump has in many cases allowed states to be the laboratory of ideas. My background in local government has taught me that, time after time, some of the best and most efficient solutions are found at the local and state level. People want to work, not become government dependents. They want to serve others, not outsource their service to government. They want to live in states that can capably manage their budgets without raising taxes. We can do more to elevate the diverse voices within our party \u2013 women, people of color, immigrants and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are here, and more are coming. We need them, and we should welcome them. Mia Love, a Republican, is a former US representative from Utah\u2019s 4th district and a current CNN political commentator. Before Congress, she served as a mayor and city council member in Utah. President Ronald Reagan used to describe the Republican Party as a three-legged stool, made up of social conservatives, foreign policy hawks and free market/limited government advocates. But that stool began to wobble in 2009, as the tea party emerged on the political scene, offering a more populist alternative to traditional conservatism. And, in the intervening 10 years, the stool appears to have been sold off at a garage sale. Just last month, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley may have written the final epitaph for the Reagan Republican coalition. \u201cIt turns out we haven\u2019t been fighting for very much,\u201d he wrote, referencing the \u201cruinous trade policies\u201d and a party that \u201cfocuse[d] more on cutting taxes and handing out favors for corporations.\u201d But it\u2019s not just the stool metaphor that is missing. The very idea of electoral coalitions is gone from the current Republican Party strategy as well. The GOP\u2019s victory in 2016 was centered around the personality of its candidate. And now the 2020 election will be a referendum on that personality. It\u2019s obvious that voters aren\u2019t weighing the competing policy platforms of two campaigns. As of last week, according to a CBS/YouGov poll, 96% of likely voters said their minds were made up about who to vote for this year. (By way of reference, the same poll in 2016 showed nearly three times as many voters were open to changing their minds even by October.) And in what should be a humbling thought about the future of the Democratic Party, more than half of registered voters supporting Joe Biden chose \u201che is not Trump\u201d as their primary reason. So, what is the future of the Republican Party after November? Win or lose, it will be a party that will never have Donald Trump on the ballot again. And the 2024 nominee will be charting a new path for the Republican Party without the shibboleths of the conservative movement that used to comprise it. But a loss in November will only add fuel to the recriminations from all corners of the previous iterations of the party who wants to claim the mantle of \u201crebuilding\u201d it. Meanwhile voters may start to ask what the party stands for \u2013 and that is an increasingly difficult question to answer. Sarah Isgur is a CNN political analyst. She is a staff writer at The Dispatch and an adjunct professor at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. She previously worked on three Republican presidential campaigns and graduated from Harvard Law School. The Republican Party has experienced a titanic political realignment, a simmering tempest that exploded after years of trade and tax policy that left blue-collar families behind and a progressive cultural movement seeking to redefine our fundamental values. The Wall Street bailouts simply lit the fuse, and these working-class voters became a force with the emergence of the Tea Party. My pro-American manufacturing, traditional values platform appealed to this group of disaffected voters in the 2012 Republican presidential primary. But it was President Donald Trump who was able to do what no candidate had been able to do before \u2013 activating them to win the White House in 2016. Trump identified the importance of work, specifically in the manufacturing and energy sectors, for those left behind by the tech economy and globalism. He understood that we must be a party that drives the kind of economic growth that lifts all workers, especially because nearly 90% of Americans are workers, not business owners.  Policies that lift all Americans win, and so does America. However, as we have been reminded during the Covid-19 pandemic, money isn\u2019t everything.  Americans are worried about their health and family.  Everything the conservative movement advocates must also be seen through the lens of strengthening families, improving quality of life, and lowering the cost while ensuring the high-quality of health care. A GOP agenda focused solely on growing the economy without guaranteeing those policies lift all Americans will be a failed agenda, a realization that current and future leaders like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have forcibly argued. The Republican Party is now attracting blue-collar workers who love America for all it offers and represents \u2013 and that is with or without  Trump in the White House. We must be the party that fights for their economic well-being, supports the family as the basic building block of society and never waivers from advocating for our God-given rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of what makes us truly happy. Rick Santorum is a CNN senior political commentator and a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania. He ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016. I would like to see us get back to standing for and focusing on a platform instead of personalities. I\u2019m not for rigidity that precludes the flexibility to deal with unusual circumstances (i.e. the coronavirus pandemic clearly called for more government spending than your average Republican would want in normal times), but to grow and thrive we have to clearly articulate what we stand for no matter who the president or presidential nominee happens to be. That\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t love candidates who rise up and lead our party \u2013 it is clearly human nature to follow leadership \u2013 but it is to say that those leaders must be clear-eyed about why they are Republicans and that we must hold them to it. Our politics has fallen into the trap that plagues most of American culture \u2013 the celebrification of everything. We chase personalities, rising and falling on their stars, which unfortunately makes us vulnerable to their personal foibles and deviations from our supposed principles and values. Operating a party this way also gives the media too much control of a party\u2019s image; individuals are much more easily destroyed and discredited than a rock solid set of ideals. We have to recognize that policy fights aren\u2019t always won by simply \u201cowning\u201d the other party\u2019s people and plans, as easy as they sometimes make it (and as much fun as it sometimes is). There\u2019s an old saying \u2013 you can\u2019t beat something with nothing. To beat Democrats and their embrace of certain socialist policies, we have to offer policy ideas that appeal to common sense and our conservative worldview. I became a Republican, despite coming from a family of Democrats, for a handful of reasons. I am pro-life, because all life is precious and should be protected. I believe in lower taxes, because I don\u2019t support punishing people who work hard and create opportunity for others. And I think the United States ought to have the most fearsome and lethal military in the world, to serve as a deterrent most of the time and as a force to be reckoned with when bad actors choose to test us. Beyond that, my platform is simple: The Constitution, and the rights enumerated therein, are not negotiable \u2013 especially the right to free speech. American exceptionalism should permeate all of decisions. People should determine their individual path to life, liberty and happiness \u2013 not the government. Work is to be expected, valued and appreciated \u2013 not disincentivized. America welcomes those who are here to work, play by our rules and add value to our society. Our borders are sacred and strong, as is our compassion and goodwill. No law or regulation need exist where common sense and the free market can dictate a good outcome. We should treat others as we expect to be treated \u2013 with respect and dignity. And that\u2019s it. Party platforms needn\u2019t be lengthy, complicated documents. Setting up a series of maxims that guide policy thought and discussion is enough. Individual candidates can then use this kind of platform to develop their more specific policy proposals to achieve those maxims. The Republican Party ought to stand for reason and resist conspiracy theories. Old wisdom rings true to me \u2013 if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is. Being truthful and honorable is always the right answer. And it is never the wrong day to do the right thing. Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W.

As a longtime Republican, I have found the last four years ranging from disorienting to downright maddening. What happened to the conservative principles that used to undergird the party for decades? In one word, Trump. The advent of President Donald Trump ushered in utter chaos inside the GOP. Conservative orthodoxy was unceremoniously discarded to accommodate whatever Trump impulsively and self-interestedly needed in the moment \u2013 adoration, self-preservation, even revenge. Whether the party will ever wish to reclaim its core principles of fiscal responsibility, limited government, upholding the Constitution and fair elections is anyone\u2019s guess. But the damage is done. The corruption of the Republican Party by Trump is complete. The idea that Republicans can \u2013 earnestly and with a straight face \u2013 just pretend like the last four years never happened and pick up the policies and principles that the party used to espouse strains credulity. It\u2019s not clear, in fact, that they would even want to. The conservatives and moderate Republicans who\u2019ve been left behind by the Trump takeover have found themselves without a home. And so they might consider forming a new party, or joining the legions of independents \u2013 a plurality in America \u2013 who feel that neither Democrats nor Republicans adequately represent them. The GOP should permanently rebrand: the Republican Party is the Trump Party. Whether Trump is President another four years or leaves in November, the party is now his to do with what he wants. Given the fate of his multiple bankrupt businesses, that doesn\u2019t bode very well. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d The future of the Republican Party must be rooted in a principled, next-generation conservatism. That\u2019s the only way that the GOP can expand its appeal to those who do not traditionally think of themselves as conservatives. Unless the Republican Party becomes more appealing to women, the young, those with immigrant backgrounds or minorities who feel marginalized by the current state of conservatism in America, it will have a difficult time growing its base and winning elections in the decades to come. To accomplish this, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t need to turn its back on the conservative principles that have been at the core of its philosophy over the last few decades. Freedom, responsibility and a belief in American exceptionalism have defined conservatism in the United States for the last 50 years. The nature of conservative principles is that they are enduring\u2014and they indeed remain appealing to many Americans. But, to be successful, Republicans must adapt the way in which these conservative principles are applied, the policy ideas that emerge from them and how they describe their philosophy and what it means for peoples\u2019 lives. So, what would it look like for Republicans to embrace a next-generation conservatism? It means realistically assessing the political challenges that the party currently faces and adapting its thinking to changing times, while accommodating more voices to secure a broader range of support. For example, people\u2019s expectations of what the federal government can and should do for them have evolved over the last few decades. The last 20 years, in particular, have featured massive fiscal expansion and policies that dramatically expanded Washington\u2019s role in our lives. The Covid-19  pandemic has only magnified Americans\u2019 expectations. Republicans can and should be for reducing the federal government\u2019s influence in our lives, but this has to be tempered by the recognition that Washington already plays a substantial role in many issue areas people care about, like health care and education. Republicans look out-of-touch when they ignore this reality and make policy pronouncements that are completely dissonant with it. Not all who call themselves Republicans will agree with this approach. And the divisions within the conservative movement and challenges before it are many. But I believe that making the Republican Party broadly appealing again, through an adherence to principled, next-generation conservatism, is the key to success. Lanhee J. Chen is the David and Diane Steffy Fellow in American Public Policy Studies at the Hoover Institution. He served as policy director to the Romney-Ryan 2012 campaign and a senior adviser to Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential bid. The Republican Party has drifted toward a market fundamentalism in which freer markets and bigger tax cuts are the answer to every question. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey recently declared that \u201ccapitalism is nothing more than economic freedom.\u201d And former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted that \u201cas we are dealing with changes in our economy, tax cuts are always a good idea.\u201d This is not conservative in any meaningful sense of the word. Conservatives value economic freedom, absolutely, but a well-functioning economy is a means to the greater ends of strong families, stable communities and a flourishing nation under limited government. Markets are wonderful, but they only solve some problems. And, sometimes, they are the problem. Contrary to Toomey\u2019s assertion, conservatives recognize that capitalism only works when legal rules and a moral culture channel the pursuit of profit toward advancing the common good. If the system fails to deliver on its promise, as has been the case in recent decades, public policy has a vital role to play. More economic freedom is not enough. A group of conservatives, led by Sens. Josh Hawley, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio, have advanced this argument in recent years. Running for president in 2011, Romney broke with GOP orthodoxy on free trade by highlighting China\u2019s destructive effects on our economy. In 2012, then-Professor Hawley published an essay warning that \u201ca rising tide does not necessarily lift all boats\u201d and recommending \u201cstructural renovation\u201d of the economy. And Rubio, who proposed a wage subsidy in 2014 and has led the fight to expand the child tax credit, observed in a speech last November, \u201cour nation does not exist to serve the interests of the market. The market exists to serve our nation and our people.\u201d Their efforts present a vital opportunity for the American right-of-center to develop a genuinely conservative economic platform that focuses on working families. Against a progressive agenda of government programs to provide what people can no longer provide for themselves, conservatives should focus on economic rules and reforms that return supply chains to our shores, create non-college career pathways and give workers a seat at the table. Steps like these can help Americans to achieve what they actually want: the chance to support their own families, contribute productively to their communities and raise children ready to do the same. Oren Cass is the executive director of American Compass and author of \u201cThe Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America.\u201d Former President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cself-delusion in the face of unpleasant facts is folly.\u201d Here are some extremely unpleasant observations about the state of the GOP today. The party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan has been upended by a toxic mix of populism and cultural grievance that will ultimately lead to the party\u2019s demise if it continues down its current path. Since the rise of Donald Trump, the Republican Party has morphed into a personality cult no longer interested in civil discourse or rational conservative policy debates. Instead, far right extremists and conspiracy theorists, worshiping at the altar of a dangerous leader who routinely tramples on constitutional norms, have now found their way into the Republican mainstream and have been amplified by the President himself. Revered Republican thought leaders like the late William F. Buckley, William Safire and Charles Krauthammer have been replaced by intellectually dishonest pundits in right-wing media who enthusiastically defend the indefensible night after night. Many Republican elected officials have demonstrated their willingness to sell out every political principle they once held and abdicate their constitutional oversight role to avoid the ire of an unfit President\u2019s tweetstorm, which might threaten their political careers. Gone are the politics of personal responsibility, limited government, uplifting messages of free market prosperity and the importance of honoring America\u2019s strategic global alliances. It\u2019s been replaced with messages of fear, ethnic resentment and isolationism. Character no longer counts. Good governance is no longer a priority. Adherence to democratic ideals and the preservation of institutions no longer matter. The party\u2019s decision to rehash some of the racist fear mongering of Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d campaign messaging adds fuel to the fire of division. Turning a blind eye to the President\u2019s defense of Confederate heritage \u2013 rather than embrace the condemnation of Confederate symbols during a time of a national reckoning on race \u2013 is shameful. Given the rapidly changing demographics in the US, it\u2019s also unsustainable. In order for the GOP to appeal to a broader coalition of voters in future elections, it must purge the party of Trump\u2019s ilk and return to its Party of Lincoln foundation. Without a course correction, it will be relegated to the ash heap of history alongside the Whigs. Tara Setmayer is a former GOP communications director, host of the \u201cHonestly Speaking with Tara\u201d podcast and a CNN political contributor. She is a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project. The future of the Republican Party rests on a simple premise: There\u2019s more that unites us than divides us. It\u2019s imperative that we don\u2019t fuel internal factions, but instead focus on creating substantive policy and space for inclusion. I call this the \u201cwelcome mat\u201d approach, as opposed to the \u201cmembers only\u201d club. Republicans need to continue to reach out to the electorate and communicate why our conservative policies better address their concerns, while avoiding chastising voters if they previously supported Democrats. So, how do Republicans do this? By sticking to policy solutions. With the visible tilt toward socialist policies by high profile members of the Democratic Party, Republicans need to be careful that this does not devolve into a battle of personalities. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and \u201cThe Squad\u201d may be seen as victims if the GOP engages in personal attacks over substantive policy discussions. Of course, this is challenging \u2013 even more so given the ideological divisions within the GOP, but a healthy dose of disagreement is not a bad thing.  It\u2019s also important to note these divisions represent a small fringe element of the GOP. President Donald Trump has strong support within the Republican Party. According to the latest Gallup poll, 90% of Republicans approve of the job he is doing. The vocal minority is therefore just that \u2013 and should not be taken to be representative of the party at large. The toughest challenge moving forward is that we must be careful not to let the different groups within our party become disenfranchised. This means satisfying the needs of the Freedom Caucus wing of the party, along with the more moderate voices. I should note satisfying these different elements should not necessarily include the Never Trumpers. They have allowed their disdain of Trump to justify a potential vote for Joe Biden. These so-called Republicans are now supporting the party of higher taxes, more regulation, weak defense and taxpayer-funded abortion. And anyone who supports that ideology, in my opinion, is not a true Republican. The best school of thought is to \u201cthink strategically and act tactically.\u201d Republicans would be wise to keep that in mind \u2013 and not allow internal fissures to derail party unity. Strategically speaking, the GOP is in a position to win over disillusioned independents and moderate Democrats and hold them long term. We do that by embracing diversity, minorities and social issues with sensitivity \u2013 all the while holding fast to our fundamental conservative tenets. That\u2019s a tough balancing act, but it can be done. Alice Stewart is a CNN political commentator, former resident fellow at the Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University and former communications director for Ted Cruz for President. A robust debate about the future of the Republican Party is looming \u2013 and a reckoning may be in the offing. Should President Donald Trump win re-election, the GOP\u2019s future will be clear. We\u2019ll simply have more of Trumpism and all that it represents: protectionism, unilateralism, nativism, isolationism and a touch of nihilism. America will become more inward looking and isolated \u2013  solidifying its new approach of \u201cAmerica Alone.\u201d Or, perhaps more likely and as recent polling suggests, Trump loses reelection, at which point the reckoning will commence. Will Trumpism survive Trump? Were party leaders too acquiescent to Trump?  Why did Republicans abandon long held principles to accommodate Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the party? These are all good questions that need to be addressed. But before answering these questions, there is a more immediate problem: How should the GOP respond to radical and intolerant elements within the party, like QAnon conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, if and when they get elected? I have long argued that Republicans must embrace the nation\u2019s demographic changes, rather than resist them. Becoming a more diverse, inclusive and welcoming party is absolutely essential for survival and electoral viability, but that\u2019s an impossible objective to achieve when people like Greene, who make racist and bigoted remarks, ascend to positions of power under the Republican banner. How the party manages these situations will have a real impact on the future. House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wisely moved to remove Iowa Rep. Steve King last year from his committee assignments after recurring, racially incendiary comments. The \u201cSteve King\u201d treatment should be applied to Greene, if she wins her House seat in November. Of course, it doesn\u2019t help matters when Trump calls Greene a \u201cfuture Republican Star,\u201d or his campaign criticizes Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois who had the good sense to call out this craziness when he saw it. Once the GOP gets a handle on this problem, then I would suggest dusting off the 2013 Republican \u201cautopsy\u201d report, published after Mitt Romney\u2019s unsuccessful presidential bid, that made many good suggestions about how the party should engage more aggressively with Hispanic, African American and Asian American communities. Furthermore, the Republican Party must resist ideological rigidity and allow for greater social tolerance. Permitting more diversity of opinion within the GOP on issues like marriage equality, reproductive rights, climate change, immigration and other policy matters where the party needs greater flexibility is necessary to remain a national governing coalition. Finally, the party must return to its senses on the importance of maintaining an open market, global trading regime and a system of strategic alliances that have advanced America\u2019s economic and security interests since the end of World War II. This means replacing the protectionist, crony capitalist model, which is a core pillar of Trumpism. And it means rebuilding relationships among allies that have been badly damaged, rejecting nakedly self-serving overtures from autocrats and accepting that American interests can be advanced through multilateral organizations.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The contrast could not have been more jarring. In Atlanta, three of America\u2019s four living ex-presidents \u2013 two Democrats and one Republican \u2013 joined in honoring John Lewis, a true American hero of the civil rights movement who risked his life for the cause of equality, at his funeral on Thursday. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama spoke passionately and with great emotion about issues such as fairness, love, the rule of law, humility, compassion, selflessness, unity, courage, dignity and service to others. They exemplified why the presidency is such a revered office. They captured the moment. A few hours later, their successor, Donald Trump \u2013 who pointedly refused to pay his respects to Lewis \u2013 took to the podium at the White House to criticize his predecessors and give himself undeserved credit despite his gross failure to competently manage the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken the lives of over 150,000 Americans. He also doubled down on his threat not to accept the results of the upcoming election in November. As Trump often does, he diminished the stature of the presidency. Trump's election tweet shows a frightened narcissist afraid of losing By his cowardly and self-aggrandizing behavior, he showed that the greatest threat to our democracy is posed not by foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin of Russia or Xi Jinping of China, but by our own president. Indeed, by intentionally casting doubt on the legitimacy of an election that he seems likely to lose according to the most recent polls, Trump seeks to rip out the very heart of our democracy. Nothing is more essential or defining of a democracy than the selection of leaders by the will of the people, expressed through their votes. Anything short of that is a monarchy or a dictatorship. President Trump can present all the false arguments he wishes about \u201cwidespread\u201d voter fraud and the unreliability of mail-in ballots. But there is no evidence to support his claims that either of these is true. Experts across the country have repeatedly pointed out the reliability of ballots submitted by mail (of which Trump and many in his administration have taken advantage) and the overall integrity of our electoral system. Only someone who fears losing would suggest an election could be rigged. Sorry, Donald Trump: The 2020 presidential election is on What to do? A place to start might be with the Republican leaders in the Senate, the House, and the party itself.  It was bad enough that they have remained silent \u2013 and some would say complicit \u2013 in the face of Trump\u2019s many previous transgressions, including being accused of threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine until it gave him dirt on Joe Biden (Trump denies there was any quid pro quo), his obsequious fawning over Putin, his lies about pretty much everything, and his disgusting attacks on women, minorities, the press and the institutions of government. But what\u2019s done is done. We cannot go back. Looking to the present and future, if there ever was a time for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John Thune, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, Rep. Steve Scalise, and the Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel to step up and put the country ahead of the party, it is now. What Obama knew about John Lewis It might be worth their while to ask themselves why they got into politics to begin with. Was it to gain fame and power? If so, there is little hope they will be of any use to America. But if, by chance, they went into politics because they believed in the nobility of public service, were attracted to the idea of making a contribution to society, and wanted to preserve and strengthen our democracy, then this is their moment. This is their moment to say: \u201cWe care more about our country than our own political fortunes. Mr. President, enough is enough. Quit casting false aspersions on our electoral process. Either agree here and now to accept the results or withdraw your candidacy.\u201d Were they to do so, two things are certain: Trump would explode against them on Twitter, but they would forever secure their places in history as people who helped to save America.  Not really a tough choice.  Whether one liked or supported the policies of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama, on Thursday it was obvious that all three men believed deeply in the goodness of America, the nobility of public service, and the promise of our future. And, perhaps, more importantly, they believe in what founding father John Adams said: \u201cOurs is a government of laws, and not of men.\u201d It was not lost on anyone who watched on Thursday that the man who lives and works where Clinton, Bush, and Obama did, disrespected a national hero and shrank from the moment.",

Follow them on Twitter at @jentaub and @JGeltzer. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN. By ruling on Thursday against President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to prevent a New York grand jury from getting its hands on his financial documents, the Supreme Court emphatically told Trump that no one \u2013 not even the President of the United States \u2013 is above the law. All nine justices agreed with one aspect of the ruling, that a president does not enjoy absolute immunity from state criminal process. A 7-to-2 majority also ruled that a state grand jury does not need to show a \u201cheightened need\u201d before serving a subpoena on a president. And, when it comes to congressional subpoenas, that solid majority rejected Trump\u2019s insistence that the House of Representatives must demonstrate \u201cspecific need\u201d before obtaining his financial and banking records. In short, there are real boundaries on Trump\u2019s power, and checks and balances to patrol those boundaries. Trump did not like what he heard. The following day he flexed his Article II muscles and commuted the sentence of Roger Stone, his longtime ally who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller in connection with Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Stone, convicted by a jury on seven felony counts including lying to Congress, obstruction of a congressional investigation, and witness tampering, was days away from reporting for a 40-month federal prison sentence. The commutation ends his prison sentence before it starts and gives Stone the opportunity to continue his appeal as a free man. This appeal could potentially include whether the guilty verdict itself should be overturned because of alleged juror bias. The commutation is an outrageous step \u2013 but, astonishingly, outrage among senators was far from universal. We are a long way from the constitutional framers\u2019 sense of what presidential overreach looks like and how senators would respond. Many of us who teach and write about the law were angered but not surprised by the commutation. Stone had just spoken to the media, telling news analyst Howard Fineman that he expected it to happen. \u201c[Trump] knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him. It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d Fineman later summed it all up: \u201cAnd so, in the fullness of time \u2013 which is to say, about an hour later \u2013 the White House made official what Stone already knew: Trump was commuting Stone\u2019s felony convictions for lying to Congress and tampering with witnesses.\u201d New York should prosecute Roger Stone What Stone said was an admission of an implicit quid-pro-quo bribery: an agreement to provide or receive something of value in exchange for an official act \u2013 here, Stone\u2019s silence in exchange for Trump\u2019s reprieve. It might not have been the traditional political bribe in the sense of money being offered to get a politician to do something, but in this case we can assume that  Stone\u2019s silence had value for Trump. Bribery is a federal criminal offense defined in statute 18 USC 201 to criminalize the act of both the person who offers or gives the thing of value and the federal official who solicits or receives the thing of value in exchange for an official act. Moreover, it is a specific ground for impeachment set out in the Constitution. Why include it as a particular basis for impeachment? Current circumstances show the wisdom of doing so. Even if federal prosecutors were to investigate both Trump and Stone for bribery, we know, given the Justice Department\u2019s view that a sitting president can\u2019t be charged, that they would not prosecute Trump while in office. (And with Attorney General Bill Barr at the helm it seems all but inconceivable they\u2019d even investigate Trump, who claimed Monday that he was getting \u201crave reviews\u201d for commuting Stone\u2019s sentence.) That\u2019s why, if we had a Senate prepared to do its institutional duty to hold accountable a president brazenly abusing his public office for private gain, the clear availability of impeachment would make total sense. Sen. Mitt Romney knows this well. As he put it on Twitter, \u201cUnprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president.\u201d This was a strong reaction from Romney, and he is not all talk. Recall that Romney was the only Republican this February to vote to convict and remove President Trump. And he is the only senator in our history to vote in this way against a President of his own party. Romney has shown courage, but the Framers expected more \u2013 more than just Romney, and more than Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who joined Romney in criticizing Trump\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence. The rage behind Trump's action on Roger Stone The Framers would expect action and bravery from all 100 senators, regardless of party. The Framers anticipated that, faced with a President badly battering our constitutional guardrails, senators would see themselves not as Democrats or Republicans but as guards of our constitutional order, akin to the seven-justice Supreme Court majority that included Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of the justices Trump appointed to the bench, when it ruled on Trump\u2019s tax returns last week. The President probably considers their votes personal betrayals, but fidelity to the Constitution \u2013 not to Trump \u2013 is their oath. The Framers\u2019 expectations were particularly clear when it came to presidential abuse of the pardon power. George Mason opposed giving a president that power precisely because \u201che may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself\u201d \u2013 a prescient characterization of Trump\u2019s public encouragement to Stone not to cooperate with investigators. But James Madison reassured Mason that the Constitution held a remedy: \u201cIf the President be connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him.\u201d For such impeachment to do any good, the Senate had to be prepared to consider, honestly and impartially, presidential wrongdoing. Yet we\u2019ve heard precious little such consideration from most Republican senators since Friday\u2019s commutation. Senators, of course, do not hold their appointments for life, and their personal political futures must weigh upon their minds in a way that our Constitution\u2019s provision of life tenure to federal judges and justices specifically avoids for them. But to uphold the rule of law and to stop this out-of-control president, just 20 would need to think less like senators concerned principally about retaining their offices and more like the all-in-one judges-and-jurors they would pledge to be at an impeachment trial. As the Framers anticipated in the extraordinary circumstances that would justify impeachment, this is about morality and legacy and our nation\u2019s survival as a constitutional republic. It transcends anyone\u2019s political future.  If 20 Republican senators were to state that Stone\u2019s bribery-tinged commutation is too much for them at last, that they are ready to hear the evidence and will not shut their ears to the facts as they did with the Ukraine impeachment, Trump could be out of the White House swiftly \u2013 perhaps even before the election in November. This isn\u2019t farfetched \u2013 it\u2019s roughly what happened to Richard Nixon in 1974 during the 15 days between the Supreme Court ruling requiring he hand over his tapes and his resignation.  At that time, his chief defense counsel, James D. St. Clair, rallied Republican members of the House and Chief of Staff Alexander Haig to let Nixon know he no longer had the party\u2019s support. Surely this lawless commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence is a smoking gun equivalent to the Watergate tapes. And yet, there\u2019s no universal congressional outrage \u2013 instead, it\u2019s overwhelmingly along party lines. That shows how far we have fallen below the Framers\u2019 expectations. And it makes the absence of universal outrage today\u2019s real outrage.",

View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. John Bolton has offered the nation a staggering profile in cowardice. He has left no doubt about his own monumental betrayal of his country. By his own belated admission, Bolton directly witnessed not one but multiple acts that could have been cited in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. But Bolton did nothing about it while he held a powerful post in the Trump administration. And he stayed quiet and took cover when Congress and the nation pleaded with him to speak out during the impeachment process. Yet now that he has entered book promo mode, Bolton suddenly has summoned the spine that he was sorely missing back when it would have made an actual difference. Bolton had ample opportunity to speak up throughout the monthslong impeachment of Trump over the Ukraine scandal. House investigators first asked that he appear to give voluntary testimony; Bolton was a no-show. Bolton then retained counsel, who requested a subpoena and promised to go to the courts for adjudication. Investigators decided not to issue a subpoena and spend months bogged down in court. Bolton later claimed he would testify in the Senate, if subpoenaed. But Senate Republicans \u2014 quite likely fearful of what Bolton might say \u2014 voted not to hear any witnesses at all. Let\u2019s be clear: Throughout the legal and political machinations, Bolton remained entirely free to speak out publicly. But he decided to remain quiet \u2014 until now.  And his testimony, it turns out, would have gone right to the heart of the matter. According to the New York Times, Bolton now belatedly reveals in his book that Trump explicitly conditioned foreign aid to Ukraine on investigations of his political opponents. Trump\u2019s defenders repeatedly claimed there was no \u201cfirsthand evidence\u201d of a quid pro quo. Bolton\u2019s testimony would have established just that. Worse, Bolton now tells the world that he witnessed (and apparently decided to do nothing about) not just one impeachable act, but several. Showing a remarkable lack of self-awareness, he criticizes House investigators for committing \u201cimpeachment malpractice\u201d by failing to discover these critical facts. But how, exactly, should investigators have discovered this information when the key witness \u2014 Bolton himself \u2014 played games and refused to talk? The Senate's dangerous move Even more troubling, Bolton now details Trump\u2019s active solicitation of election assistance from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bolton proclaims that \u201cI saw these developments as a threat to U.S. strategic interests and to our friends and allies.\u201d Bolton now writes that Trump engaged in \u201ca pattern of fundamentally unacceptable behavior that eroded the very legitimacy of the presidency. \u201c Yet Bolton did nothing and said nothing until now, as he tries to goose his book sales. Bolton proclaims that Trump engaged in behavior that \u201clooked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn\u2019t accept.\u201d But apparently, Bolton was absolutely fine with accepting it. He saw this pattern of obstruction of justice as it happened, and he curled up in a ball until the dust settled and his book hit the shelves. Bolton could have changed the course of history. Instead, he will go down in a footnote as an enabler of corruption, a model of cowardice and an opportunist who put self above country.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN. President Donald Trump is playing with fire. Just 24 hours after he told the nation\u2019s governors, \u201cYou are going to call your own shots,\u201d when it comes to reopening the economy, the President posted a series of incendiary messages on Twitter that seemed to incite his followers to revolt against the current orders to stay at home. \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d one tweet shouted in capital letters. He issued similar tweets calling for the liberation of Minnesota and Virginia, including a disturbing addendum for loyalists to \u201csave your great 2nd Amendment,\u201d adding, \u201cIt is under siege!\u201d It is unclear why Trump brought up gun rights in apparent references to pandemic mitigation measures, but the language is familiar. Who can forget his comments at a rally in 2016, when he considered the possibility that Hillary Clinton might win the presidential election? \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks,\u201d Trump said before adding, \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people \u2013 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d When he talks about \u201cliberating\u201d a state, he\u2019s calling for a reprise of what occurred in Michigan on Wednesday, when thousands of protesters, many of them carrying Trump signs, wearing MAGA hats and chanting \u201cLock her up!\u201d, protested stay-at-home orders issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a life-and-death effort to slow a pandemic that has already killed thousands in her state, one of the worst-hit in the country. What exactly is Trump trying to do? This is not an out-of-range dog whistle. We can all hear it. Trump is calling for open revolt in three states \u2013 all of which are potentially competitive in 2020 and run by Democratic governors. The three states are also home to thousands of people diagnosed with Covid-19, a disease that has killed tens of thousands of Americans, with the potential to kill millions in the US if allowed to freely run its course in the population. Even judged against Trump\u2019s own record, these incendiary messages are beyond the pale for many reasons. Trump's devious -- and brilliant -- coronavirus election strategy First, the president is undercutting the guidelines he personally announced a day earlier. None of the states meet the requirements he outlined from the podium on Thursday for starting to reopen the economy. The step-by-step approach requires careful consideration before restrictions are loosened, to avoid a resurgence of the relentless coronavirus. By contradicting his own guidance, crafted with the help of public health experts, the President undercut the credibility of the entire mitigation effort. Mass protests can spread the virus while sending the message that it\u2019s safe to ignore stay-at-home orders. Trump\u2019s tweets, if heeded, are likely to cause more deaths. Second, Trump is calling for disobedience during a most unstable time. People are understandably feeling tense and unsettled; for many, their incomes are vanishing. Anger and frustration lie just below the surface. It wouldn\u2019t take much for peaceful protests to turn violent. Trump\u2019s allusion to gun rights makes the prospect of violence more ominous. Third, Trump may discover that once he incites his supporters, he may not be able to rein them in should they decide to act. These are times unlike any we have experienced. Emotions are running high. That is a tempting canvas for a demagogue seeking to design his own version of reality, but there\u2019s no guarantee Trump can control what he sets loose. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee accused the President of \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one who saw that as the message. After Trump\u2019s string of tweets, right-wing extremists questioned whether the President was calling for a \u201cboogaloo\u201d \u2013 a term derived from 4chan that extremists use to describe an armed insurrection. A deep craving for 'normalcy' goes up against the reality of Covid-19's deadly risk Why is Trump undercutting his own message just 24 hours after issuing it? Why is he risking a resurgence of the virus that could threaten his reelection? Trump, understandably, is anxious about what the shutdown is doing to the economy and to his political future. He hates that the experts are telling him that reopening too soon would lead to an even greater disaster. The experts tell him one thing, but some corporate executives, along with the hosts on Fox News, have a different message: Reopen and don\u2019t believe the scientists. The Michigan protests were organized by a pro-Trump political group and praised on Fox. Prime time hosts, including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and others gushed about the protesters\u2019 love of freedom. Laura Ingraham exulted, \u201cTime to get your freedom back!\u201d Pirro told Hannity that \u201cThe American spirit is too strong, and Americans are not going to take it,\u201d predicting that protests would spread across the country. Trump appears to be torn. In the White House, he hears Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx tell him to move slowly on reopening. On television, his ego massagers tell him that\u2019s a mistake. But there\u2019s more. Trump has a populist\u2019s sixth sense for exploiting the frustrations of the masses. The shutdown has already destroyed tens of millions of jobs, leaving countless Americans bereft of income and afraid for the future. Trump doesn\u2019t want to be held responsible for any of it. By inciting unrest in battleground states with Democratic governors, he is telling people where to lay the blame for their woes, while carving out a path for his reelection.  It\u2019s a crafty ploy, but one doomed to fail. He remains President. He will be held accountable. His desperate effort to shift responsibility could make the situation worse. By waving a lit torch in the midst of a disaster, he may just start a fire on the wreckage.",

Decades before President Donald Trump ever attacked the media, Senator Barry Goldwater introduced a new idea to the presidential campaign trail: liberal media bias. Goldwater was 1964\u2019s Republican presidential candidate, and he was convinced that the journalists covering the campaign were infusing their reporting with a left-leaning tilt while claiming to be neutral observers. As a staunch conservative, Goldwater believed this bias put him at a distinct disadvantage in his race against President Lyndon Johnson. Struggling in the polls, he insisted that his message \u2014 rolling back the New Deal and taking the fight to the communists \u2014 was popular with Americans. The trouble, he said, was that his positions were constantly being distorted by the liberal gatekeepers in the media. He needled the journalists trailing him, even handing out pins to reporters that read \u201cEastern Liberal Press.\u201d Goldwater\u2019s \u201cliberal press\u201d claim had some basis \u2013 television news broadcasts and major papers based on the coasts were staffed with journalists who personally tended to support at least some level of desegregation, social safety net programs and US cold war policy \u2013 but they weren\u2019t the cause of his uphill battle with voters. Since the end of World War II, Republicans and Democrats had hashed out a rough consensus on many of the major issues of the day \u2014 a consensus Goldwater regularly rejected as he adopted positions well outside the mainstream. It was his fringe position, not the press, that contributed to Goldwater\u2019s loss in a historic landslide. Yet even in defeat, he\u2019d pioneered an argument that would become a staple of Republican campaigns: the US media favored Democrats and liberals, and skewed their reporting to help their preferred candidate. Can Bernie Sanders beat Donald Trump? Here's the reality This argument wasn\u2019t really true: many newspapers had a conservative bent, and most reporters maintained a commitment to the practice of objective journalism, regardless of their political preferences. But Goldwater discovered the political power of the bias charge, and future candidates would hone it into a brutally effective weapon \u2013 including Trump, who has used it as a key strategy throughout his presidency and will use it during his 2020 re-election campaign. Goldwater was far from the first presidential candidate to complain about the press. In the 19th century, before the concept of objectivity became a journalistic norm, most newspapers were partisan. Criticizing papers for their political commitments made little sense \u2014 that was, after all, what newspapers were for from about 1790 through the late 1800s. In 1848, for instance, the Democrats and Whigs spent heavily to start newspapers just to circulate the party line. So despondent were the editors at the Republican Los Angeles Times after Democrat Grover Cleveland won the 1884 race, they simply refused to report the results for several days. Even after objectivity became a journalistic practice in the early 20th century, presidential candidates still found plenty to criticize in the nation\u2019s newsrooms \u2013 but the complaint was seldom that the papers were too liberal. In the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt regularly railed against newspaper publishers, who he dubbed \u201cpress barons.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wrong. Newspaper publishers often had a rooting interest in conservative presidential campaigns; one Republican president, Warren G. Harding, was himself a newspaper publisher. Henry Luce, who headed up a publishing empire including Time and Life magazines, pushed so hard for Republican Wendell Willkie in 1940 that one of his reporters cabled from the campaign train: \u201cTake me off this train. All I can do is sit at the typewriter and write, \u2018Wendell Willkie is a wonderful man. Wendell Willkie is a wonderful man.\u2019\u201d For decades, this relationship between president and press was a state of affairs that rarely raised eyebrows among the public \u2013 until Goldwater\u2019s 1964 campaign. With his complaints, he planted the seed for the now widespread belief among Republicans that the media is skewed to support the left, despite the reality at the time that many newspapers favored conservative Republicans. Conservatives see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in Trump He did this by tapping into already simmering pockets of resentment across the US; his \u201cEastern Liberal Press\u201d pins were rooted as much in region as ideology. The senator hailed from Arizona, and long nurtured a disdain for the dominance of Eastern media, politics and culture. And in the South, white-owned papers and television stations censored Northern coverage of the civil rights movement, and white southerners heatedly criticized Northern journalists for what they saw as pro-civil-rights bias. This meant that by the time Goldwater became the presidential nominee, there was an audience more than ready for his message \u2013 one that had been arguing about journalism\u2019s alleged left-wing bias for more than a decade. Hearing their arguments popularized by a presidential candidate was a boon to a movement that had operated on the fringes of the two major parties. Cries of liberal media bias didn\u2019t save Goldwater. But they did pave the way for a much more powerful criticism of American journalism five years later, when Richard Nixon entered the White House. Nixon was no stranger to lashing out at the press, but he tended to argue that journalists were anti-Nixon, not anti-conservative. It was his vice president, Spiro Agnew, who transformed Goldwater\u2019s complaint into the one we recognize today: that a liberal coastal elite produces biased journalism that leaves the American people misinformed, hobbling their efforts to make wise political choices. This tactic isn\u2019t exclusive to conservatives \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination, has suggested that The Washington Post\u2019s coverage of his campaign is influenced by its ownership. But it is one that fueled the spread of a conservative media industry that remade American politics and journalism over the last 30 years. Belief in liberal media bias has become an article of faith on the right, a core part of conservative political identity. In recent years, the idea has undergone another metamorphosis. Donald Trump, with his \u201cfake news\u201d slur, has charged something well beyond simply favoring one ideology over another. He\u2019s accusing the media of wholesale fabrication \u2013 a line that, while completely untrue, delights his base.  Under Trump, the purpose of the media attack has become even more apparent: to delegitimize all news that isn\u2019t subservient to him, while encouraging supporters to trust only one source \u2014 Donald Trump. Political journalism isn\u2019t above criticism, far from it. But for the right, attacking the media is less about improving coverage or pointing out actual errors and biases, and more about eliminating alternative sources of information and rallying a base willing to ignore any news that comes from outside the movement. Understanding that strategy is vital to understanding the 2020 election. And it started with Barry Goldwater, more than a half-century ago.",

Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera\u201d at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Sen. Lindsey Graham stated on CBS News on Sunday morning that Attorney General William Barr has set up a mechanism to receive purportedly damaging information coming from Ukraine, via Rudy Giuliani, about former Vice President (and current Democratic presidential contender) Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Barr already has sacrificed his integrity and bent the law to do President Donald Trump\u2019s bidding, but this new arrangement, if true, with Trump\u2019s personal counsel would invite potential criminality right into the heart of the Justice Department. The Justice Department has not responded to confirm Graham\u2019s comments. There would be so many things wrong with Barr granting VIP direct access to Giuliani that it\u2019s hard to know where to start. First, Giuliani is treading in murky waters, at best, by continuing to solicit campaign dirt from foreign nationals to be used against Biden \u2013 and now Barr reportedly has plunged himself and the Justice Department right into that same mire by openly accepting, and weaponizing, the anti-Biden (hence, pro-Trump) dirt that Giulani generates. The Senate did not convict Trump for his conduct toward Ukraine \u2013 though even some of Trump\u2019s Republican defenders noted that his actions were inappropriate \u2013 but it remains a federal crime to \u201csolicit, accept, or receive\u201d a campaign contribution or donation \u2013 defined as \u201cmoney or other thing of value\u201d \u2013 from a foreign national. Acquittal is not exoneration The Justice Department has, however, refused even to open an investigation of the efforts of Trump and his surrogates to gather (or generate) dirt from Ukrainians on the Bidens. The President has repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted improperly in Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. It is an unresolved legal issue whether election \u201cdirt\u201d qualifies legally as a thing of value, but former Federal Election Commission counsel Larry Noble argues persuasively that it should. It is wildly irresponsible for Barr to countenance and encourage such borderline (at best) and illegal (at worst) conduct. Second, Barr, if the arrangement indeed exists, would once again reveal himself to be a spineless partisan, serving Trump\u2019s every political and personal desire. In the year he has spent in office as the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, Barr already has distorted in Trump\u2019s favor the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller; publicly echoed Trump\u2019s non-legal, campaign catch phrases like \u201cno collusion\u201d and that his campaign was subject to \u201cspying\u201d; and his DOJ tried to prevent the Ukraine whistleblower\u2019s complaint from going to Congress, as required by law. Simply put, Barr has not taken a single move during his first year in office that would in any way undermine Trump\u2019s political wishes, but he has bent the law and common sense in Trump\u2019s favor at every turn. The penalty Donald Trump should get for Ukraine scandal if the Senate acquits Finally, let\u2019s not forget: Rudy Giuliani himself is reportedly under criminal and counterintelligence investigation by the Southern District of New York (which is part of the Justice Department). The arrangement Graham describes would present conflicts of interest in both directions. Giuliani has every incentive to ingratiate himself with Barr by taking steps perceived as favorable to Barr or his benefactor, Trump. And, by giving Giuliani special access to the head of the Justice Department, Barr would be creating real questions about his impartiality in assessing a potential criminal charge against Giuliani. Beyond that, just as a basic matter of common sense: How smart would it be for an attorney general to open a direct line of communication with a potential counterintelligence threat? Graham spoke of this new pipeline of information from Giuliani to Barr as if it was a good thing, as if it will somehow clean up corruption. That notion is laughable. If anything, the Giuliani-Barr connection itself would be a manifestation of the worst kind of corruption \u2013 where the attorney general acts not as the top lawyer and prosecutor for the people of the United States, but rather as the President\u2019s most enthusiastic and unprincipled political cheerleader. Dave (Minnesota): Is there double jeopardy in an impeachment? If new information comes to light, can Trump be impeached again? Double jeopardy \u2013 the principle that a person cannot be charged twice for the same offense \u2013 applies to criminal charges but not to impeachment. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d  The phrase \u201clife or limb\u201d refers to physical punishment such as incarceration or execution. The penalty for impeachment \u2013 removal from office \u2013 is fundamentally different and does not qualify as loss of \u201clife or limb.\u201d While an official legally can be impeached more than once, there are political obstacles to a second impeachment. Impeachment is commonly seen as a politically divisive process. And, while Trump was the 20th American official to be impeached by the House, no American official ever has been impeached multiple times. All things considered, there is virtually no chance the House impeaches Trump again based on the Ukraine scandal, even if new evidence emerges. If an entirely separate scandal should emerge at some point, a second impeachment could be more politically palatable, but still would be tempered politically by the fact that Trump already has been impeached, and acquitted, once. Barbara (Michigan): Does the acquittal of President Trump mean that the President is above the law? No, the acquittal of Trump does not place the President above the law, but it does fundamentally alter the balance of powers in favor of the presidency. By constitutional design, impeachment is rare and conviction is rarer still. The Constitution permits impeachment only for \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and requires a supermajority two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict and remove.  There has been, on average, fewer than one impeachment per decade over our history \u2013 and only eight of the officials impeached have been tried and convicted. The only thing Trump learned from impeachment The Trump impeachment has altered the balance of powers between the branches of government in two crucial respects. First, some of Trump\u2019s defenders, including several senators who voted to acquit, argued that Trump\u2019s conduct, even if wrong or improper, was not impeachable. While one impeachment is not legally binding on future impeachments, if the Trump standard is followed, it will become more difficult \u2013 perhaps near impossible \u2013 to impeach and remove an official based on abuse of power. Second, Trump essentially got away consequence-free with defying all congressional subpoenas relating to the Mueller inquiry and the impeachment investigation and trial, making good on his public vow that \u201cwe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas.\u201d White House counsel Pat Cipollone later openly defied Congress, writing to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Trump \u201creject[s] your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process\u201d and would not comply with any requests for information. So the bottom line, for now, is that the House served dozens of subpoenas; Trump defied every one of them; and with his acquittal there seems to be no negative consequence to that refusal. If that result stands, it will severely impair the ability of Congress to conduct oversight of the President and the executive branch. Congress still has the option to go to court to enforce future subpoenas should the administration continue to stonewall. But unless and until the courts resolve the issue in favor of Congress, the executive branch has effectively diminished one of Congress\u2019s most important checks on the President. Roger (Wisconsin): Was it a mistake for House Democrats to impeach Trump based on abuse of power, without a specific crime? History and the law make clear that impeachment need not be based on a specific statutory crime. Indeed, federal officials have been impeached for noncriminal abuses of power or misconduct ranging from \u201cfavoritism\u201d to \u201cintoxication.\u201d The House was well within the law, therefore, to impeach Trump for two noncriminal acts: \u201cAbuse of Power\u201d (Article I) and \u201cObstruction of Congress (Article II). Mitt Romney and Doug Jones' profiles in courage The House did not need to \u2013 but could have \u2013 also impeached based on specific statutory crimes including bribery, extortion and solicitation of foreign election aid. House Democrats could have alleged these crimes as sub-parts of the abuse of power article of impeachment, or as separate articles after the abuse of power allegation. We do not know precisely why House Democrats opted against alleging specific crimes. My best guess is they did not want to get drawn into a complex, legalistic debate about the nuances of the elements required to prove a statutory crime. Instead, they opted for the broader, more sweeping Abuse of Power allegation. But by deciding not to allege specific crimes, House Democrats opened the door to the rhetorical argument that the impeachment was somehow lacking \u2013 as Trump himself put it, \u201cimpeachment lite.\u201d Trump\u2019s defense team amplified this theme during trial, arguing that in the absence of a criminal (or \u201ccriminal type\u201d) allegation, the impeachment must fail. Had House Democrats alleged specific crimes, they would have preempted this line of defense.  1. Will the House subpoena John Bolton and other witnesses on the Ukraine scandal? 2. What will happen on the various emoluments clause lawsuits against President Trump, now that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in Trump\u2019s favor in one such suit? 3. Will President Trump seek retribution against other witnesses, beyond Lt. Col. Vindman and Ambassador Gordon Sondland?",

After a motion to call witnesses was defeated Friday afternoon, Republicans are on track to conclude the trial \u2013 despite new reporting by The New York Times that a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton backs up the allegations that Trump improperly withheld US aid to Ukraine. The central question for the GOP, Scott Jennings wrote, was: \u201cEven if Bolton\u2019s account is fully accurate, does this episode, taken in its entirety, warrant the removal of a duly elected president?\u201d Now, get ready for \u201ca series of Trump campaign exoneration rallies as he travels the country hammering Democrats for their overreach,\u201d Jennings said. Trump\u2019s defense in the Senate was double-barreled: The lawyers denied that he conditioned military aid for Ukraine on an announcement of an investigation of the Bidens, and also contended that even if he did it, it wasn\u2019t an impeachable offense. To make the case, SE Cupp wrote, \u201cTrump wanted a spectacle \u2013 a vaudeville show of characters and personalities \u2013 and from Jay Sekulow\u2019s theatrics to Alan Dershowitz\u2019s law school lecture, he got it.\u201d Joe Lockhart noted that even though the President\u2019s plan to press the Ukrainians for an investigation announcement was foiled by a whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cthe President and his Republican colleagues found an alternative venue to smear Biden \u2013 the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s lawyers, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, \u201caired all the charges against Biden without providing ample evidence to support any of them. She, and the rest of White House counsel, misled the Senate and the American people on the basic facts of the case.\u201d Vox\u2019s Aaron Rupar wrote,\u201dShamelessness is a feature of Trumpism, not a bug. And while Pam Bondi\u2019s performance may seem laughable to most, it\u2019s been sufficient for Senate Republicans.\u201d Another Trump lawyer, Alan Dershowitz,  helped make Senate Republicans feel better about their effort to exonerate the President with an argument Democrats and many legal scholars labeled ridiculous: \u201cIf a President did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest,\u201d he told Senate jurors, \u201cthat cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\u201d Paul Begala observed, \u201cI did not go to Harvard Law, but I did go to the University of Texas School of Law, where I studied criminal law and constitutional law, but never dreamed a legendary legal mind would set them both ablaze on the Senate floor. The Dershowitz Doctrine would make presidents immune from every criminal act, so long as they could plausibly claim they did it to boost their re-election effort.\u201d John Avlon labeled it the \u201cKing Trump defense\u201d and \u201can insult to our Constitution and separation of powers.\u201d The Trump defense arguments won\u2019t convince voters, wrote Aisha Moodie-Mills. \u201cThe impeachment process has provided Democrats with a treasure trove of damning evidence to fuel the campaign against him and convince voters that he should be evicted from the White House in the November election.\u201d Other takes on impeachment: Paul Callan: Democrats\u2019 impeachment fantasy crashes Sarah Isgur: Why it\u2019s time to move on from impeachment Michael D\u2019Antonio: Trump in private: what really happens Michael Zeldin: Trial shows Trump is guilty as charged Elie Honig: Trump defense spins flimsy, misleading arguments Amalia Sirica: Watergate judge\u2019s courage is what we need today A week ago, the world was stunned to learn of the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, in a helicopter crash that took the lives of his 13-year old daughter Gianna Bryant and seven other people. \u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d wrote Jeff Pearlman. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t compute, in the way JFK\u2019s death didn\u2019t compute for my parents; in the way Len Bias\u2019 death didn\u2019t compute for me at age 14.\u201d As a young athlete, Bryant emerged as a complex character, Pearlman noted: \u201che possessed something few had witnessed before. Namely, a complete, total lack of self-doubt.\u201d His \u201cfive NBA titles and 18 All-Star nods\u201d would fully justify that confidence. \u201cHe was famously accused of raping a Colorado hotel clerk in 2003, and the ensuing legal drama often felt O.J. Simpson-esque in scale and magnitude,\u201d Pearlman wrote. \u201cFor many, it seemed to signify the end of Kobe Bryant as a spokesperson, as a hero, as a star. Even after the case was settled out of court. How would anyone ever cheer for Kobe Bryant again? How would anyone believe in him?\u201d Yet he started to put his life back together, centering it around family. Father Edward Beck observed that Bryant\u2019s Catholic faith and fulsome apology were instrumental: \u201cHe was loved and forgiven by so many because they perceived an indefatigable man who accepted responsibility for his shortcomings.\u201d There was an outpouring of memories: David Axelrod on Kobe prodding fellow NBA stars to do a better job of guarding President Barack Obama in a pickup basketball game, CNN\u2019s Matthew Quinn recalling Bryant as a fellow high school student in Lower Merion, Pa., staring him down in a casual game, Roxanne Jones remembering the times he helped her as she launched her career at ESPN, and LZ Granderson citing the occasion when he came up with a better idea for a magazine cover than the one professional journalists had proposed. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t simply an NBA legend, he was a cultural icon,\u201d Granderson wrote. \u201cBryant\u2019s death leaves a unique hole in our hearts.\u201d It could take a year for investigators to pin down the cause of the crash. The pilot was experienced and the helicopter was a sophisticated craft, wrote retired airline pilot Les Abend. \u201cLike all aviation accidents, this is an awful tragedy.\u201d In what Jill Filipovic saw as a revealing remark, US Senator Joni Ernst drew a direct line from the impeachment trial\u2019s discussion of the Bidens to her home state of Iowa, where the Democratic primary voting begins Monday. \u201cI\u2019m really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus goers,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cWill they be supporting VP Biden at this point?\u201d Filipovic wrote, \u201cIt turns out that it isn\u2019t just the President whose narcissism, corruption and immorality threatens the wellbeing of the United States. It\u2019s the entire party apparatus behind him. How do we know? Joni Ernst just told us.\u201d Iowa has traditionally played an outsized role in determining the front runners in the Democratic presidential primaries. But this year may be different, suggested Ian Sams, who was national press secretary on Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. A strong victory in Iowa can shape the narrative of a candidate\u2019s surging campaign, but new caucus rules providing for releasing three sets of results could confuse the picture. The caucus is already overshadowed by the impeachment drama and could be largely eclipsed by the spectacle of Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech Tuesday evening. \u201cThough Iowa\u2019s vote is important,\u201d Sams wrote, the \u201cunique media environment could dampen its historic effect of crowning a front-runner and make later contests even more influential for how voters perceive the candidates and the race.\u201d (For real-time election information about Iowa and beyond, check out the CNN 2020 Election Center.) The latest Iowa polls have shown a tight race, as progressive and moderate candidates battle for voters. Bernie Sanders has gained support, Julian Zelizer wrote, because his effort is not just an election campaign but a movement.  Sanders \u201chas amassed a loyal and devoted cadre of followers who imagine that they are trying to transform the fundamentals of politics, not just win an election\u2026.The passion that Sanders commands from his supporters is intense and it has created a solid foundation for his candidacy that prevents the dramatic swings others have experienced.\u201d Rep. Chrissy Houlahan nabbed a seat in Congress two years ago as a Democrat in a swing district of Pennsylvania, a state Donald Trump won in 2016. She\u2019s hoping Iowans will back a moderate who favors gradual reform, rather than Medicare for All, and who understands the importance of trade to rural voters. The key, she wrote, is \u201cmeeting voters where they are on issues like trade and health care, and proposing practical, pragmatic solutions for the American people.\u201d Last weekend, Michael Bociurkiw wrote that it was \u201cbaffling\u201d that the World Health Organization hadn\u2019t declared the Wuhan coronavirus a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d But as cases continued to spread and airlines restricted travel to China, on Thursday WHO did exactly what Bociurkiw had suggested. The full picture of the threat presented by the virus is still not known, but in addition to the health risks, it is fueling ugly stereotypes. \u201cAcross the internet,\u201d wrote Jeff Yang, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen widespread eruptions of racist scapegoating, blaming Chinese for a disease that has so far only killed Chinese.\u201d He added, \u201cAt the root of these reactions is something deeply insidious and very familiar. Throughout history, cultures have used ugly slurs on the savagery, backwardness or filthiness of foreigners as a way to rationalize excluding them, ejecting them or eliminating them; we\u2019re seeing this today in the language that Trump and some in his administration often use to talk about Latin American migrants and other communities, framing them as bestial and subhuman, as violent and barbaric, as diseased and unclean, all to rationalize inhumane policies.\u201d In the midst of the impeachment drama, President Trump unveiled a long-gestating plan to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, with the support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival retired Lt. Gen. Benjamin Gantz. Trump senior adviser Jared Kushner made the case for the proposal: \u201cwe have established a clear path to a final peace agreement that meets the core requirements of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.\u201d Aaron David Miller, who helped craft a variety of peace plans over a long career in the US State Department, said the problems with the new plan are manifest. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d is more accurately called the \u201csteal of the century,\u201d he argued. It \u201creflects the triumph of presidential arrogance, domestic politics and pro-Israeli bias over any commitment to serious peacemaking, let alone an already fraught two-state solution which the administration seems determined to bury.\u201d Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, was scathing in his criticism: \u201cBy far the most flagrant part of the plan is that it ends any possibility for an independent sovereign Palestinian state, instead dividing the territories into ghettos and Bantustans, besieged, suffocated and isolated.\u201d Rebecca Cokley: The next move in Trump administration\u2019s war on the disabled Samantha Vinograd: Pompeo\u2019s interview shows he doesn\u2019t respect the free press Carla Provost: Retiring Border Patrol chief: Crisis at southern border demands action by Congress Tina Smith: The Ukraine scandal comes to Minnesota John Avlon: The strange world of impeachment rock Laleh Ispahani: How I explain Trump\u2019s travel ban to my daughter Ronald Lauder: 75 years after Nazi death camp was liberated, the world pauses to remember AND\u2026 At 50, Jennifer Lopez is continuing her remarkable comeback with a headliner role in the Superbowl half-time show. \u201cHer star power is only growing stronger,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas. Lopez\u2019s 2019 \u201cgot off to a rocky start. Her performance during a Motown tribute at the Grammys last February was widely regarded as being in poor taste, especially given that several big artists snubbed the event for rewarding too few black artists in major categories. It was embarrassing, but she shook it off,\u201d Thomas pointed out. Her 50th birthday tour was a success, along with her starring role in \u201cHustlers.\u201d \u201cWhile other actors might balk at the thought of playing an aging stripper with a near-savage hunger for money,\u201d Thomas wrote, \u201cLopez not only seized the opportunity, but suggested the now-legendary pole dance scene which was her character\u2019s introduction. She took the role \u2013 and the producer gig \u2013 for free. As she later explained, \u2018I bank on myself.\u2019 It paid off.\u201d \u201cIn an entertainment industry that renders middle-aged women largely invisible,\u201d Thomas concluded, \u201cLopez demands not only visibility but a spotlight. No matter what knocks her popularity or her credibility, she always wins her audience back.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. There is a crime against the Constitution going on right underneath the chief justice\u2019s nose. Because any self-respecting institutionalist who has devoted his life to the defense of the Constitution and separation of powers should be able to recognize how dangerous and disingenuous lawyer Alan Dershowitz\u2019s argument is on behalf of  President Trump. \u201cIf a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,\u201d Dershowitz said on Wednesday. With this argument, Dershowitz completely conflates a president\u2019s self-interest with the national interest. If a president thinks \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the greatest president there ever was. If I\u2019m not elected the national interest will suffer greatly,\u2019\u201d Dershowitz believes \u201cthat cannot be impeachable.\u201d This is not consistent with the vision of the founders. It guts the system of checks and balances and it defies common sense. But we might be waiting a while to hear the cries of outrage from small-government constitutional conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee \u2013 despite the fact that this is the most breathtaking argument for an imperial presidency that could possibly be imagined. Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim That\u2019s because hyper-partisanship and polarization have lulled politicians into staying silent when it is politically convenient. As a reality check, just imagine how the Republicans would respond if a Democratic president\u2019s legal counsel advanced that argument. They would be outraged. And they\u2019d be right. There\u2019s been a full court press to roll back Dershowitz\u2019s comments. Don\u2019t buy it. It appears he said what he meant. Trump\u2019s legal team seems to recognize he went too far and could scare off swing votes. That\u2019s because the ideas he articulated are worth being alarmed about. If the Republican senators roll over for Dershowitz\u2019s argument, they won\u2019t get a do-over when similar circumstances emerge under a Democratic president. This will set a precedent for virtually unlimited executive power. Under this logic, President Richard Nixon could have been justified for covering up Watergate because he sincerely felt that his re-election was in the national interest. If that seems like a stretch, former White House Counsel and star Watergate witness John Dean facetiously applied that logic to Nixon and wrote, \u201cAll Nixon was doing was obstructing justice and abusing power because he thought he was the best person for the USA to be POTUS\u2026. Seriously, that was his motive!\u201d Earlier in the week, Dershowitz also argued that \u201cabuse of power\u201d could not be considered an impeachable offense: \u201cIt is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as abuse of power to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment.\u201d Trump is getting exactly what he wanted Actually, it is entirely conceivable that that was their clear intent. Because that\u2019s what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65: \u201cThe subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d So don\u2019t be swayed by Dershowitz\u2019s Harvard law-professor credentials \u2013 this isn\u2019t some novel reading of the Constitution. It is self-serving nonsense. And that\u2019s why every single one of the four legal experts who testified during the House impeachment hearing \u2013 including Republicans\u2019 favorite Jonathan Turley \u2013 say that impeachment does not require a crime. The real danger of the President\u2019s defense is clear when you consider the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime. This leaves impeachment as the only remedy to hold the President accountable for serious misconduct. The two-thirds threshold to convict and remove a president is already a high bar to meet \u2013 even more so in an age of polarization. Dershowitz\u2019s argument would essentially take it off the table, and allow a president to do almost anything to ensure his re-election \u2013 including asking a foreign power to intervene on his behalf. George Washington would have thought that argument absurd. In his Farewell Address in 1796, he said: \u201cAgainst the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering that George Washington was obsessed with the virtue of being of \u201cdisinterested.\u201d It\u2019s not a word we use very often anymore, but it means not being driven by self-interest, because self-interest distorts judgment and can\u2019t be trusted. Trump\u2019s legal team is advancing exactly the opposite argument, to a sinister extent. Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he bragged during the 2016 campaign that his followers were so devoted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing support. Nobody thought, then, that it would be the basis of a legal argument advanced by the President. But that\u2019s exactly the argument Trump\u2019s lawyer William Consovoy made in federal appeals court while trying to block the release of Trump\u2019s tax returns in October 2019. He argued that the President could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be charged until he is out of office. Presenting the ludicrous 'Dershowitz Doctrine' This absurd argument belongs in the legal hall of shame right alongside that of Nixon lawyer James St. Clair, who sounded a bit embarrassed when he told the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit: \u201cThe President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.\u201d St. Clair\u2019s absurd defense at least made an exception for impeachment. Now Trump\u2019s legal team is taking it a step further \u2013 by saying that he is effectively immune from a court of impeachment. This is the King Trump defense. And it is an insult to our Constitution and separation of powers. Anyone who professes to care about the Constitution should recognize the danger of this argument. And if senators remain silent out of fealty or fear of a president from their party, they should not be allowed to forget it. History is watching and they will be establishing a new precedent that goes against their alleged principles. But at this moment, it appears that even asking for additional information \u2013 from credible conservatives like former National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2013 is too much to ask. Here we have a direct witness who is willing to testify and who states in the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book that the President told him directly that he wanted to continue withholding congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine until they announced an investigation into his most formidable political rival. Hearing from Bolton would force the Republican senators to confront uncomfortable facts. Instead, they seem eager to accept the word of a President who many acknowledge to be a liar and pretend that the highly relevant new information is not worth further investigation. Dershowitz\u2019s argument gives them a whisper of an argument to justify their complicity in a Trump coverup. This is an insult to the trust put in them by the founding fathers. The Senate \u2013 as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 \u2013 was expected to be \u201ca tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent\u2026to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality\u201d in an impeachment trial.  It now seems up to Sen. Lamar Alexander to join his fellow Republicans Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney, who have hinted they could vote to hear from witnesses \u2013 to uphold that standard. As of Thursday morning, Lamar said he was still undecided. Either way, his legacy will be written by the result of this vote. The closing questions and debates in this impeachment trial represent much more than a partisan fight over power.  They represent a fundamental challenge to the rule of law and the separation of powers. If hyper-partisan polarization is enough to make senators forget their oaths and even their own power as a co-equal branch of government, they will be setting a dangerous precedent that takes aim at the heart of our democracy at a time when autocracies are on the rise around the world. In its place will be a President of low character who will be unleashed in pursuing his re-election by any means necessary. This is happening right under the chief justice\u2019s nose \u2013 and the question is whether he will let it happen without uttering a word of warning about the massively destabilizing impact it could have on the Constitution he has devoted his life to defending.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Aaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of \u201cThe End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (and Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\u201d Miller was a State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. Having helped to draft my fair share of Arab-Israeli peace plans many of which were unsuccessful \u2014 even half baked \u2014 the long-awaited Trump proposal leaves a universe of things to be desired. In one sense it represents a terminal case of diplomatic malpractice. But in another, it really isn\u2019t about diplomacy at all or peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Indeed, the deal of the century reflects the triumph of presidential arrogance, domestic politics and pro-Israeli bias over any commitment to serious peacemaking, let alone an already fraught two-state solution which the administration seems determined to bury. Most  American  peace initiatives over the years \u2014 from Kissinger\u2019s disengagement agreements between Israel, Egypt, and Syria (1973-1975) to Jimmy Carter\u2019s Egyptian-Israel peace process (1978-1979) to the Madrid peace conference (1991) to the US brokered interim accords under Oslo, (1997-1998) to various US initiatives on final peace deals with Israel, Syria and the Palestinians \u2014 were designed to launch talks, bridge gaps, create trust between the parties and ultimately reach comprehensive accords. Indeed, these previous efforts were marked by hundreds of hours of US dialogue with each side, including direct talks between the two sides and in other cases three-way US-mediated discussions. The 80-plus page document released Tuesday by the White House appears to be just the opposite: a one-hand clapping exercise preternaturally tilted toward Israeli needs and requirements without the benefit of the due diligence required to produce a sustainable basis for negotiations on which both Israelis and Palestinians could engage. There is no serious timeline or deadline and no operational component; Palestinians are given the arbitrary time of four years to decide on the plan. Lurking not so far beneath the surface is the administration\u2019s expectation that the Palestinians will not engage. In the words of its key architect, Jared Kushner, Palestinians \u201chave a perfect track record of missing opportunities.\u201d The US has a special relationship with Israel that it doesn\u2019t have with any of the Arab parties to the conflict. In many of its previous initiatives, Washington has clearly tilted toward Israel on security issues but also at times on many of the political issues as well. But the tilt \u2014 better described as a full-scale endorsement of the Netanyahu government\u2019s position on the key issues \u2014 goes beyond anything any administration has done in the past. The plan adopts Netanyahu\u2019s view that a much-shrunken Palestinian entity, including (roughly) 70% of the West Bank, will be a state in name only. Israel will control its borders, air space, electro-magnetic spectrum, foreign policy and security. On Jerusalem, the plan allows for a kind of Palestinian sub-capital in a few of the outer neighborhoods of East Jerusalem while maintaining that the city will remain the undivided capital of Israel. And the plan all but relegates the refugee issue to the back burner \u2014 ruling out the right of return or compensation. At the same time, the administration has put the Palestinians on a kind of probation. If they disarm Hamas, Palestine and Islamic Jihad, establish good governance, recognize Israel as a Jewish state, among other things, then and only then is a faux state possible. Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d is really the steal of the century \u2014 validating almost all Israeli claims and leaving Palestinians with the scraps Israel can afford to do without. The only peace here is Netanyahu\u2019s peace of mind that he\u2019s managed without a negotiation to get America to back the right\u2019s conception of what Israel\u2019s borders should be. People were surprised when Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign talked about wanting to achieve the ultimate deal \u2014 Israeli-Palestinian peace. Trump\u2019s bravado, arrogance and bad analysis somehow brought him to the conclusion that as the world\u2019s greatest negotiator, he or his designated envoy, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, should take on and resolve one of the world\u2019s most intractable problems. Instead, Trump failed to see that he had inherited an Israeli-Palestinian peace process that was comatose and a two-state solution that was on life support. The gaps between Netanyahu and Abbas on the core issues like territory and Jerusalem were enormous. There was no confidence nor trust between them and Israeli and Palestinian politics on the peace issue were both divided and dysfunctional.  And instead of recognizing reality, the administration plunged ahead with only one north star to guide it: making sure that whatever it did, Israel and Trump\u2019s domestic pro-Israeli constituency wouldn\u2019t be alienated. There\u2019s little doubt that domestic politics drove both the timing and the content of the peace plan. With little more than six weeks to go before Israeli elections, the desire to boost the political fortunes of the beleaguered Netanyahu played a key role. Waiting for the election results and for a new government might have taken until May or produced no government. And that would have gone deeper into 2020 and interfered with the President\u2019s electoral clock.  But there was something else, too. The Trump administration as with so many of its initiatives \u2014 withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accord \u2014 wanted to disrupt traditional approaches and put its own mark on the peace process too. Animated by an extreme pro-Israeli bias and frustration with the Palestinians, the administration has now changed the game and fundamentally altered the US approach of the past three administrations by aligning its view with Israel\u2019s on the Jewish state\u2019s final borders. And Netanyahu may not waste any time in taking advantage by extending Israeli law to West Bank settlements and the Jordan Valley. Once he does, Donald Trump may yet add another first to his collection: the first US President to watch the two-state solution expire on his watch.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. Early Tuesday, pro-Iranian Iraqi militia members and demonstrators stormed the US Embassy compound in Baghdad after the Trump administration\u2019s airstrikes on a Iranian-backed militia on Sunday. The embassy attack, perhaps the worst crisis between Iraq and the US since 2003, reveals the inconsistency and vulnerability of the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward both Iran and Iraq. Like a modern-day Gulliver, President Trump is metaphorically wandering around a Middle East where he\u2019d rather not be, tied up both by smaller powers whose interests are not his own \u2013 and by America\u2019s illusions about the region, perpetuated by Trump who somehow believes he can force Iran to bend to his will. The odds are that the situation for the US in Iraq and Iran is likely to get worse before it gets still worse. The US had little choice but to respond on Sunday to recent pro-Iranian Iraqi militia attacks against US forces in Kirkuk, which claimed the life of an American contractor and wounded US forces. The Trump administration needed both to deter and signal to Tehran that such attacks were unacceptable. Failure to do so would have left the administration in violation of one of its own red lines \u2013 that the US would not tolerate attacks against Americans. Iraqi security forces regain control of area around US Embassy after second day of protests But the US attacks in response seemed intentionally disproportionate, killing at least 25 militia and injuring scores of others . And it seems the US did not take into consideration that the airstrikes would seriously embarrass the government of Iraq or could lead to reactions like a storming of the American Embassy. The storming of the embassy raises questions as to why the administration didn\u2019t think through how Tehran might respond to Sunday\u2019s airstrikes on five pro-Iranian militia bases in Iraq and Syria, and why security at the embassy wasn\u2019t beefed up in advance. Iran has effectively coordinated attacks against US forces before, especially during the early phases of the Iraq war. But following this most recent attack, it should be clear that Washington isn\u2019t on a level playing field in Iraq and that Iran enjoys a tremendous advantage, for a number of reasons. Trump tweets 'threat' to Iran over embassy attack First, the Iraqi government is much more financially and economically dependent on its Iranian neighbor than it is obligated to the US. Iraq is the second-largest importer of Iranian non-oil commodities, and Iran is a key supplier of electricity to the country\u2019s southern region. Second, while we have spent billions in training, equipping and assisting Iraqi security forces with arguably a fair amount of success, the integration of several of the most pro-Iranian militias into those security forces is increasingly problematic. These forces have played a role in brutally helping the Iraqi government repress recent Shia demonstrators, and the initial storming of the embassy compound could not have been accomplished without government security forces\u2019 acquiescence to the militias. Third, the US handed Iran a tremendous propaganda advantage. It has turned anti-Iranian sentiment among Iraqis against the US and sparked protesters at the US Embassy to throw rocks and chant \u201cDeath to America.\u201d Things appear calmer around the embassy Wednesday morning. But it\u2019s too early to determine whether recent events will lead to a broader US confrontation with Iranian proxies or Iran itself. One thing is clear: President Trump\u2019s approach to Iran is muddled by a number of cross-cutting factors which make any policy move on Iran unpredictable. On one hand, in the wake of his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord, Trump launched a tough-minded campaign of maximum pressure on sanctions that\u2019s devastated Iran\u2019s economy. But such sanctions have neither halted Iran\u2019s regional activities in Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq, nor made it any more flexible on nuclear issues. On the other hand, his tough rhetoric withstanding, Trump has made clear many times that he\u2019d like to sit with Iranian President Rouhani, presumably to negotiate a new and better nuclear deal. And risk averse when it comes to confronting Iran directly, he chose not to respond by striking Iran in retaliation for its attacks on Saudi oil facilities last September. As we enter 2020 and an election year, it\u2019s unlikely that this confusion will end anytime soon, raising serious questions about what Trump really wants \u2013 to weaken Iran, change the regime or cut a new nuclear deal.  Trump, who ran on a platform of withdrawing from the Middle East and would just as soon get out of these unwinnable wars, faces a genuine conundrum: how to avoid looking weak but avoid triggering a messy conflict with Iran and deeper involvement in Iraq that would be certain to alienate his base and energize his opponents. On Tuesday night, Trump threatened that Iran would pay a \u201cbig price\u201d for the embassy storming. But it remains to be seen whether this is characteristic Trumpian bluster, or an uncharacteristic threat from the President that actually leads to a more aggressive American response to Iran.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Everyone will be talking today about an explosive New York Times report that revealed, among other things, that President Donald Trump paid no federal income taxes whatsoever in 10 out of 15 years beginning in 2000. He also reportedly paid just $750 in federal income taxes in the year he won the presidency and his first year in the White House. The tax information obtained by the Times also reveals Trump has been fighting the IRS for years over whether losses he claimed should have resulted in a nearly $73 million refund. The President\u2019s opponents have been trying for years to get a hold of his tax returns after he broke with tradition during the 2016 presidential campaign and declined to release them to the public. Some Democratic leaders have already said this new report makes it even more critical that Trump\u2019s entire tax history be released. Trump has called the Times report inaccurate and said Sunday that he pays \u201ca lot\u201d of federal and state taxes. President Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative federal appeals court judge, to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court. Her appointment will create a conservative majority on the court that could change the fabric of the country for the next few decades. Conservatives have voiced support for Barrett in part because of her closely-held religious beliefs and the possibility that she could be a key player in challenging the Affordable Care Act. Democrats believe Republican lawmakers are stealing the next president\u2019s chance to fill the seat by rushing to confirm Barrett in an election year. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham says his committee will approve her nomination on October 22, setting up a full Senate vote by the end of the month and putting into motion one of the quickest confirmations in modern history. Almost half of US states are reporting increased numbers of new Covid-19 cases, and health experts are again warning of an even more deadly fall and winter. According to one coronavirus model, the US could see a surge of cases in October and November, resulting in up to 3,000 daily deaths by late December. (Currently, the US is reporting about 765 deaths per day.) Around the world, the death toll from the pandemic has topped 998,000 and the US accounts for more than 204,000 of them. The situation in India is also getting more dire. The country just recorded 6 million cases, and is the only country other than the US to reach that ominous mark. Protests dotted the nation this weekend after the Kentucky grand jury\u2019s decision to charge only one officer last week in connection with the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor. Dozens of people were arrested during demonstrations in Louisville, New York City, Seattle, Portland and other major cities. In Portland, a pro-Trump rally organized by the Proud Boys, a far-right group, clashed with Black Lives Matter and antifa supporters. In California, a 40-year-old woman was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault after hitting two protesters with a vehicle during a demonstration in Yorba Linda. Chinese President Xi Jinping doubled down on his policies in the country\u2019s Xinjiang region even though the international community is becoming increasingly critical of alleged human rights abuses in the area. Up to 2 million Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, as well as other minorities, are believed to have passed through detention centers in the region in recent years. However, during a meeting that ended this weekend, Xi again said the practices were de-radicalization efforts that were necessary for \u201cthe healthy development of religion\u201d in the country. The US, France and other world powers have spoken out against the situation in Xinjiang. Last week, the US House of Representatives approved a bill called the \u201cUyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act,\u201d which aims to prohibit certain imports from Xinjiang and impose sanctions on those responsible for the region\u2019s human rights violations.

            "article_content": "It was a tale of two realities in Georgia this weekend. Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a young, ambitious Republican, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that \u201cmountains of misinformation\u201d from allies of President Donald Trump alleging large-scale voter fraud in the presidential election were hurting GOP efforts in the runoff elections for US Senate. Hours later one of those Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler, continued to offer lip service to Trump\u2019s baseless claims. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that there were issues in this election,\u201d Loeffler said during a debate Sunday night when pressed about the President\u2019s continuing legal fights to overturn the results. The contrast illustrates a growing rift inside the Republican Party, between those who are willing to call out Trump on his baseless attempts to overturn the election results, and those who aren\u2019t. It\u2019s been state officials \u2013 governors, lieutenant governors, and secretaries of state \u2013 who have been the most outspoken, not only in acknowledging Biden\u2019s victory, but also in pointing out the damage Trump\u2019s false narrative is doing. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress, typically among the standard-bearers of the party, have largely been silent, save for a few exceptions. And it\u2019s unclear whether those on Capitol Hill are going along with Trump for short-term political reasons or because they actually agree with him. Regardless, Republicans in Congress have had the luxury of ignoring many of the facts on the ground, while their state-level party colleagues have had little choice but to accede to the rules and laws governing elections in their states. \u201cIt\u2019s different if you\u2019re making calculations from the sidelines versus having actual power to determine or at least affirm the outcome,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist. The rift provides a window into the cracks and discord that could play out inside the Republican Party post-Trump. State-level leaders have been increasingly vocal in defending the results \u2013 in part because the responsibility for conducting elections falls on them. For governors and their fellow state officers, reaffirming the integrity of the elections is a matter of preservation of law-and-order but also their own long-term political legitimacy. But the political considerations for congressional Republicans cut differently, given the most immediate goal is the defense of the party\u2019s majority in the Senate. Holding onto Georgia\u2019s two Senate seats means maximizing Republican turnout on January 5, which requires keeping the party\u2019s most reliable motivator, Trump, happy. And for the time being, there\u2019s little members of Congress can actually do to affect the outcome of the race \u2013 barring a successful long-shot bid in the House of Representatives to overturn the presidential election \u2013 except to agitate. The majority of Hill Republicans have maintained a vague openness to Trump\u2019s legal strategy by adopting a message to \u201ccount all the legal votes.\u201d The phrase is open to interpretation: unobjectionable to any citizen on its face but a signal of validation to Trump and his supporters. Rick Scott, the Florida senator and new chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, gave voice to this in an interview with CNN last month. \u201cMy goal is: count all the legal votes [and] get through the legal process as quickly as you can,\u201d said Scott. \u201cLet\u2019s get a result. And then we\u2019ve got to accept the results.\u201d Scott has been among those Republican senators who have suggested December 14 as an end-point for their tolerance for Trump\u2019s shenanigans. In a Sunday appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana refused to recognize Biden\u2019s win but did indicate the end might be close. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a threshold coming on December 14th when the Electoral College meets,\u201d Braun said while warning against dismissing allegations of fraud, although there is no evidence of widespread fraud in this election. \u201cSo long as they\u2019re bystanders, they just keep their heads down,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cWhich is probably the best move, politically.\u201d But for the most extreme flank of the party, the fight doesn\u2019t end on December 14. Asked if Trump should concede after the Electoral College vote, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said bluntly: \u201cNo. No way, no way, no way.\u201d \u201cWe should still try to figure out exactly what took place here. And as I said that includes I think debates on the House floor \u2013 potentially on January 6,\u201d Jordan, a trusted Trump confidante, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a ways away,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and another close Trump ally, said when asked if Trump should concede after next week. \u201cThere are members who believe there could be value in having substantive debate of what occurred in states with substantial irregularities. I don\u2019t believe that 10 hours of debate on that subject would impair the union.\u201d The tone in Republican-controlled state capitals has been markedly different. As the recounts and legal disputes have confirmed Biden\u2019s victory in key swing states, governors and other state officials have ramped up the defense of the election. This, despite the fact that Trump has trained his rhetorical fire on them instead of Republicans in Washington While some of these GOP politicians, like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, were already vocally opposed to Trump, many of the other Republicans contradicting Trump are avowed supporters of the President. Geoff Duncan, for instance, told Jake Tapper Sunday that he supported and campaigned for Trump. So did Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has faced the brunt of the President\u2019s anger on Twitter. In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal Monday that largely accused media outlets of encouraging distrust of close elections, Raffensperger reiterated his defense of the Georgia election as \u201cthe most secure\u201d and with \u201cno evidence of widespread voter fraud and no significant issues with absentee ballots.\u201d \u201cConfidence has been undermined by politicians and pundits who tacitly or explicitly refuse to acknowledge their losses and receive a megaphone from sympathetic media outlets,\u201d Raffensperger wrote. Republican governors in Biden states have also stuck with the formalized results of their elections. Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona responded to attacks from Trump last week with a series of tweets of his own defending the state\u2019s election certification process. And Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who owes much of his political success to aligning with Trump, has resisted direct pressure from the President as recently as this weekend to revisit the results there. Even GOP state legislators have stood up to pressure from the President\u2019s allies to get involved. A group of Republican lawmakers from Michigan who were brought into the White House for a meeting with Trump last month amid calls that the state\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature overturn the popular vote and instead submit a pro-Trump slate of electors. Those lawmakers expressed no interest in the harebrained scheme following their conversation with the President. \u201cWe have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan\u2019s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield said in a joint statement after their November 20 meeting with the President. To be sure, some Republican officials in states he won have remained loyal to the President on the \u201celection fraud\u201d narrative. Politico reported that Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has continued encouraging Trump to \u201cfight\u201d even as he concedes the campaign\u2019s legal efforts are likely to be unsuccessful. But on the other hand, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a state Trump won handily and where he remains a popular figure with Republicans there, insisted early on that the President needed to accept defeat. \u201cI think that we need to consider the former vice president as the President-elect. Joe Biden is the President-elect,\u201d DeWine told CNN\u2019s John Berman on November 12. CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb contributed to this article.",

            "article_content": "Though states finalize and certify their results after every election, the process of confirming the winner of the general election has taken on new significance this year, as President Donald Trump continues to contest his loss. States certify their results after reviewing disputed ballots, conducting post-election audits, and double-checking numbers for accuracy. Federal, state, and local election officials from both political parties have said there was no widespread fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election. Certifying election results is typically a formality, but the arcane process has become the latest battleground in Trump\u2019s longshot attempt to cling onto power. His campaign is trying to block or delay certification in key states in hopes of overturning Biden\u2019s victory through the Electoral College. What happens between now and Inauguration Day The idea is that if there\u2019s no certification, then Republican-run state legislatures in a few key states could appoint pro-Trump slates of presidential electors, even though Biden won the popular vote in their state. \u201cThis is why they want to delay certification, because delaying certification could be a predicate to arguing that the state didn\u2019t make a choice, and that the legislature should step in,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a CNN contributor and an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Senior GOP lawmakers in key states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have already rejected this idea, and some states have laws explicitly ruling out this option. Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican, told reporters earlier this month that lawmakers don\u2019t have the legal grounds to appoint their own electors. While a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman, another Republican, also poured cold water on the idea of appointing electors that didn\u2019t support the winner of the statewide vote. \u201cOur legislation, election code makes it clear we have nothing to do with selecting electors,\u201d spokesperson Jennifer Kocher said, adding that Corman is not considering appointing pro-Trump electors and has never considered that as a possibility. The scheme essentially becomes impossible if key states certify their presidential results before December 8, which is known as a \u201csafe harbor\u201d deadline under federal law. When Congress tallies the electoral votes in January, it must accept electors that were certified before the deadline. If a state missed the deadline, then Congress can consider disputed slates of electors. \u201cEvery day that passes makes it legally and politically less likely that Trump can pull off this crazy attempt to subvert the will of the people,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cThe system is kind of on autopilot.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrat Sara Gideon has conceded the Maine Senate race to Republican Sen. Susan Collins in one of the most competitive and closely watched races in the fight for control of the Senate, potentially denying Democrats a top takeover opportunity and significantly narrowing their path to the majority. \u201cJust now, I spoke with Senator Collins. I congratulated her on winning this election,\u201d Gideon, the state House speaker, said in a concession speech Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWhile we came up short, I do believe that Mainers in every corner of this state are ready to continue to work together to make a difference,\u201d she said. CNN has not projected the winner of the Senate race. The defeat would be a major blow to Democrats, who have already come up short over the past 24 hours in a number of races where they were competing in hopes of flipping the chamber. Democrats\u2019 chances of controlling the Senate are now rapidly diminishing. Both parties have so far flipped a seat each with Republican Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach, unseating Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones and former Gov. John Hickenlooper defeating Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado. Senate Democrats had made Maine one of their top targets, in part because Hillary Clinton carried the state in the 2016 presidential election. Along with Gardner, Collins was one of just two Republicans running for reelection in a state Clinton won. This year, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has won at least three of the state\u2019s four electoral votes, CNN projects. Despite the state as a whole going for the Democrat at the top of the ticket, Collins \u2013 a long-time incumbent who has served in the Senate since 1997 \u2013 was confident she had held on. Collins\u2019 office confirmed the Democratic challenger had called her to concede, and the senator announced she had won reelection in Maine at a Wednesday news conference in Bangor. \u201cI want to publicly thank Sara for her call, we had a good time, and I very much appreciated her taking the time to call,\u201d Collins said. \u201cLet me say what an extraordinary honor it is to represent the great state of Maine and to know that I will have the opportunity to serve all of Maine for the next six years,\u201d she added. Republicans had been worried that even if Collins came out on top, if she didn\u2019t surpass 50% of the vote, she might lose in ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference on the ballot, if they choose to do so. Collins has worked to cultivate a moderate and independent brand while serving in the Senate. In July, she declined to back President Donald Trump for reelection, saying instead she would focus on her own race while suggesting that she only picked sides in 2016 because she was not on the ballot. Scott Reed, a veteran GOP strategist who led the pro-Collins super PAC 1820 PAC, told CNN that Collins\u2019 decision to decline to say whom she would support for president \u201creinforced Susan\u2019s independence, that she\u2019s above party politics, that she\u2019s for Maine.\u201d Reed said Collins\u2019 decision to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was also in line with the vast majority of Maine voters. \u201cThey didn\u2019t agree that the seat should be filled before the election,\u201d he said. Political groups spent over $135 million on ads in the Maine Senate race, according to Kantar/CMAG, 57% of which was from Democrats. \u201cThe amount of national resources that went into Gideon\u2019s campaign proved to be Schumer\u2019s follies,\u201d Reed said, referring to the Senate minority leaders.

A majority of the country never approved of President Donald Trump, or his handling of his top crisis, the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses and claimed the lives of over 230,000 people in America. Democratic candidates bet that protecting and expanding upon the Affordable Care Act, which ended their party\u2019s control of the Senate in 2014, would be their path back to power. Live updates: Senate and House election results And Republican senators warned that their loss would lead to socialism, even though Americans increasingly desire for the government to do more to address the country\u2019s problems, according to Pew Research, and former Vice President Joe Biden, the epitome of the establishment, took over the Democratic Party.

At least a dozen Republican Senate seats are now at risk, including two in blue states \u2013 Maine and Colorado \u2013 and 10 in states Trump won in 2016 \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alaska, Kansas and Texas (Georgia has two Senate races). Democrats are defending only two seats \u2013 in Alabama and Michigan \u2013 in competitive contests. Republicans hope that an economic rebound and the late confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett will remind voters why they put the GOP in charge, and save their Senate majority. But there are a number of other factors that could determine the future control of the Senate. Here are nine to watch: The 2016 election cycle was the first in which every state voted for the same party in both the presidential and Senate races. If that\u2019s the case again in 2020, then the Republicans should benefit, since many of the competitive Senate contests are in red states. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner would lose their seats, but Republican candidate Tommy Tuberville would defeat Alabama Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. The outcome of the Senate would then be determined by how well Trump does in close battleground states like North Carolina, Iowa, Arizona, Georgia and even Texas. The margin of the presidential race cuts both ways. It will be crucial in states like Michigan and Minnesota, where Trump is expected to lose, and also in others like Montana and South Carolina, where the President should easily win. John James, a Republican businessman who flew Army helicopters in the Iraq War, is trying to oust Michigan Democratic Sen. Gary Peters and become the state\u2019s first Black senator. While James has criticized the President for cutting Great Lakes funding and calling some African countries \u201cshitholes,\u201d Democrats have tried to tie Trump around him, noting that he said he supported Trump\u2019s agenda \u201c2,000%\u201d in 2018. Still, James and other Republican candidates in close races, including Georgia Sen. David Perdue and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, have campaigned with Trump in the last couple months of the race, understanding that the base of the party loves him. Collins, the last GOP member of Congress in New England, has put more distance between herself and the President, declining to say whether she will vote for him. Collins, the only Republican to oppose Barrett\u2019s confirmation, did not attend a recent rally in her state with Vice President Mike Pence. Some polls show that her state is rewarding Collins\u2019 unique brand, with Trump easily losing Maine but the senator neck and neck with Democratic candidate Sara Gideon. Some Democrats in Trump-won states have avoided confronting the President, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who ran for the Democratic nomination to take on Trump, but is now running against Republican Sen. Steve Daines on a health care-focused platform. But Republicans have attempted to tie Bullock to Biden, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. At a Halloween rally in Montana, Donald Trump Jr. said that Bullock and other Montana Democratic candidates are \u201cdressed up as though they\u2019re not radical liberals every day of the year.\u201d The country has become increasingly partisan, and split-ticket voting is rare. Only 4% of registered voters say they will support Trump or Biden and a Senate candidate from the opposing party, according to the Pew Research Center. Since 2012, 88% of the 139 Senate candidates were of the same party that won the state\u2019s most recent presidential election. The pandemic has fundamentally changed how people vote and count ballots. In Texas, where Sen. John Cornyn faces Democratic candidate MJ Hegar, over 9.7 million people have already voted, more than the Lone Star state\u2019s total in 2016, according to data company Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations. In North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tillis faces a tough race against Democrat Cal Cunningham, over 4.5 million people have already voted, only about 200,000 fewer than the Tar Heel state\u2019s total in 2016. How to spot a red or blue 'mirage' in early election night results Both states could see a so-called \u201cblue mirage\u201d because the states started processing mail ballots before Election Day, and the first results to become public will include early votes, which favor Democrats. The opposite, a \u201cred mirage,\u201d could occur in Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters faces Republican candidate John James, and in Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith faces former Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, as absentee ballots get counted late on Tuesday night. Perdue and the other Republican senator from Georgia, Kelly Loeffler, are both facing elections in 2020. Perdue, who first won his seat in 2014, is facing reelection against Democrat Jon Ossoff and libertarian candidate Shane Hazel. If no candidate gets more than 50% on Election Day, the two top vote-getters will compete in a runoff on January 5. While that could happen in Perdue\u2019s race, a runoff is \u201calmost absolutely certain\u201d to happen in Loeffler\u2019s, according to Dr. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. Late last year, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who resigned over health concerns. The winner of the special election will serve until 2022, when Isakson\u2019s term ends. The melee format is unusual, with all candidates regardless of party thrown together in the race. Loeffler is facing 20 candidates, including GOP Rep. Doug Collins and Democrat Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Republicans on the run in Georgia with two Senate seats within Democratic reach Bullock said that Republicans in Georgia have been better than Democrats in turning out their voters during runoff elections, noting that in 2008, the drop off in voters was more dramatic among black voters than white voters, helping then-Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss defeat Democrat Jim Martin. \u201cWhat might change it would be to have Reverend Warnock, an African American, in the runoff,\u201d said Bullock. Loeffler and Collins have viciously attacked each other for months, directly delivering their messages to the most conservative voters, leaving Warnock an opportunity to attract both Democrats and independents. Still, neither GOP candidate has expressed any hesitation on their race to the right. \u201cI don\u2019t have to move anywhere in this race,\u201d Collins recently told CNN. \u201cGeorgia is a conservative state and always has been.\u201d Maine Sen. Susan Collins\u2019 reelection race against Democrat Sara Gideon could decide which party wins the Senate. But Republicans worry that the state\u2019s ranked-choice voting system could hurt Collins since two third-party candidates, Max Linn and Lisa Savage, are also on the ballot. In Maine, a candidate needs to not only get more votes than the other candidate, but at least 50% of the votes. If no candidate gets a majority, then Maine\u2019s Senate election gets trickier. The Pine Tree state allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference on the ballot. Voters can select a first choice, second choice, third choice, fourth choice, et cetera. If no Senate candidate receives a majority of the vote this year, then the fourth-ranked candidate will be eliminated, and their votes will be reallocated to the other candidates based on who they ranked second. If no candidate hits 50%, the third-place candidate will then have their votes reapplied to the top two candidates, again based on if and how they ranked other preferences. If the race turns to a second round of voting, Collins could suffer. A September New York Times/Siena College poll showed that Gideon held a lead over Collins, but did not reach 50%. Savage, a Maine Green Independent Party candidate running to the left of Gideon on a pro-Medicare for All and pro-Green New Deal platform, is urging her supporters to rank the Democrat second. That could prove pivotal if no candidate initially hits a majority. When ranked-choice voting tabulation rounds are initiated, couriers are sent around the state to either collect actual ballots or memory devices and bring them to a secure location in Augusta, the state\u2019s capital. There, high speed tabulators process the ballots, and memory devices are uploaded. A secure computer is then used to determine the results by applying the ranked-choice voting rules. That process can take between one and two weeks to complete, so if no candidate wins outright on November 3, the winner will not be clear on election night. In 2018, Democrat Jared Golden defeated Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in a Maine House race even though Poliquin led in the first round of votes. Golden was announced the winner nine days after Election Day. \u201cIt is unlikely that any candidate will get a majority of the vote in the first round of balloting,\u201d said Mark Brewer, a political science professor at the University of Maine. \u201cIf ranked choice is necessary, it will absolutely cause a delay in determining the winner of the race.\u201d About a month before Election Day, text messages and reports detailing Senate Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham\u2019s alleged extramarital affair this summer undercut the image he carefully crafted as a man of integrity who serves in the Army Reserve. But while voters disapproved, he still has the edge over incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, according to polls. Before the sex scandal emerged, Cunningham was up 42% to 37%, according to a Times/Siena poll from mid-September. Since then, CNN released a poll showing that Cunningham\u2019s lead narrowed to 47% to 44%, due in large part because his deficit with men was slightly smaller than his advantage with women. Denise Adams, a Winston-Salem city council member, told CNN that women \u201crealize what\u2019s at stake,\u201d adding that health care, abortion access and education funding are all on the ballot. \u201cI ain\u2019t trying to call nobody\u2019s pot kettle black,\u201d she added. \u201cRight now, Democrats in North Carolina are united, and our task ahead of us is to bring this baby home.\u201d But Republicans are hopeful that the scandal could cost Democrats the seat and their hopes of winning the Senate majority. Andrew Romeo, a Tillis spokesman, told CNN that while Cunningham is \u201cin hiding\u201d and under investigation by the Army Reserve for his conduct, the senator is \u201csprinting to the finish line\u201d with a statewide public tour. \u201cWe are confident that this contrast will make the difference in this tight race and lead to Senator Tillis\u2019 victory on Tuesday,\u201d said Romeo. Rachel Petri, a Cunningham spokesperson, responded that the Democratic candidate is \u201cconnecting directly with voters to talk about the issues that actually matter in their lives like accessing health care, raising wags, and responding to this virus.\u201d \u201cSenator Tillis can\u2019t defend his record on the issues, which is why he\u2019s forced to spend the final hours of this campaign making desperate, personal attacks in a last ditch effort to save his political career,\u201d she added. Bill Bledsoe, the third-party candidate in the surprisingly close Senate contest between South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democrat Jaime Harrison, does not want anyone to vote for him. A month ago, he dropped out and endorsed Graham. But the conservative, Constitution Party candidate will still be on the ballot, potentially damaging Graham\u2019s bid for a fourth term. The Harrison campaign, which raised $57 million between July and September, the largest single-quarter total by any candidate in US Senate history, has plenty of resources. So the group has aired television ads in an attempt to boost Bledsoe with Republican voters, saying he is too conservative, pro-Trump, anti-abortion and pro-gun for South Carolina. Some of the ads show images of the ballot with Bledsoe\u2019s name highlighted. Harrison\u2019s campaign, along with two outside groups \u2013 Duty and Country, a Democratic Super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and the Lincoln Project, a group of former Republicans \u2013 have spent millions on the ads, according to Kantar\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group. Trump won South Carolina by 14 points in 2016 but leads Biden by eight points, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll in October. Graham led Harrison 46% to 40%. But other polls have shown a closer contest, and Democrats are hopeful that Bledsoe\u2019s candidacy could help Harrison win. The last Democratic candidate to win a statewide race in South Carolina, South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex, defeated a Republican in 2006 by 455 votes when four third-party candidates also ran for the office. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be huge for Jaime,\u201d Amanda Loveday, a former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, told CNN last month. \u201c[Bledsoe\u2019s] name will appear on every ballot in the state of South Carolina. And if you vote for him, it could potentially determine the results of the election.\u201d Political groups have spent over $1.7 billion to advertise in Senate races, according to CMAG. Democrats spent 54% of that figure, after their candidates won the fundraising battle and broke state records. The disparity between the Republican senators and their Democratic challengers was particularly acute between July and September. In the battleground states of Maine, North Carolina, Iowa, Arizona, Georgia, Montana and Colorado, the Democratic candidates outraised the Republican senator in each state between about $15 million and $31 million. But even in red states, the Democrats outraised the incumbent by astonishing figures. In South Carolina, Harrison raised $29.4 million more than Graham. In Kentucky, Democrat Amy McGrath raised $21 million more than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In Kansas, former state legislator Barbara Bollier raised $10 million more than GOP Rep. Roger Marshall. In Alaska, Al Gross, a political independent running as the Democratic nominee, raised $7.3 million more than Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan. And in Texas, MJ Hegar raised $6.7 million more than Sen. John Cornyn. ActBlue, the Democrats\u2019 online fundraising portal, said it broke its single-day record three times in September, raising $43.2 million on September 29, the day of the first presidential debate, $66.9 million on September 30, the last day of the financial quarter, and $70.6 million on September 19, the day after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Some Republican strategists said that Democrats were throwing good money at bad races. \u201cYes, they\u2019re being outspent heavily with all this national money,\u201d said GOP strategist Scott Reed. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m convinced they\u2019re going to hold the Senate.\u201d Reed told CNN that it was \u201cshocking\u201d Harrison raised all that money, but was \u201cconvinced\u201d Graham, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, would win. He said Trump would win the state by double digits and voters would reward Graham for leading the Senate confirmation of Ginsburg\u2019s replacement, the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said. Reed called Steven Law, a former chief of staff to McConnell, and his constellation of outside groups as the \u201cMVP\u201d of the 2020 election cycle. In the face of extremely well funded Democratic candidates, the conservative groups have had to save more than one Republican Senate campaign. Overall, the groups \u2013 the Senate Leadership Fund, One Nation, Plains PAC, Defend Arizona, Keep Kentucky Great and the Faith and Power PAC \u2013 combined spent over $310 million on ads, more than any other organization except the Trump and Biden campaigns, according to CMAG. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent over $79 million. And other groups typically aligned with the right spent even less; The Chamber of Commerce spent about $6 million. Outside groups also boosted the Democrats. The Senate Majority PAC, a Super PAC aligned with Schumer and led by strategist JB Poersch, along with Duty and Honor, Majority Forward and the Sunflower State PAC, spent over $246 million on ads, according to CMAG. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spent over $73 million. The Deep South is fielding more Black Senate candidates than it has since Reconstruction. Marquita Bradshaw, a community organizer and the first Black woman to win a statewide nomination in Tennessee, is running against Republican candidate Bill Hagerty, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Japan. Adrian Perkins, the mayor of Shreveport, faces Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy. And Mike Espy, who was Secretary of Agriculture under President Bill Clinton, is trying to defeat Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and far outraising her. None of these three candidates are expected to win their deeply conservative states. But Harrison in South Carolina and Warnock in Georgia have put their race in play. These Black candidates ran as the country grappled with a reckoning over race, following the police killing of George Floyd. Republicans attacked Democratic candidates for the liberal proposal to defund the police, which would reallocate funds from law enforcement to other local government agencies. Loeffler said at a recent rally in Buford, Georgia, that the idea is \u201cabsolutely insane.\u201d \u201cWe have to keep our communities safe,\u201d she said. The senator later said that Warnock has refused to apologize for saying some police officers act like gangsters and thugs, which he said in a sermon after Michael Brown\u2019s 2015 killing in Ferguson, Missouri. When Loeffler asked the pastor about those comments at a recent debate, Warnock said he had \u201cdeep respect\u201d for law enforcement but wanted the country to have \u201cequal protection under the law.\u201d Loeffler, the co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, sparked a backlash over the summer when she wrote to WNBA commissioner that she \u201cadamantly\u201d opposed the Black Lives Matter movement. Some players wore t-shirts that said, \u201cVote Warnock.\u201d In a recent interview, Warnock focused his comments on health care, talking about expanding Medicaid and protecting the insurance of those with pre-existing conditions. But when asked about Loeffler\u2019s dispute with her own team, Warnock said it was a \u201csad and cynical move by a desperate politician, trying to shore up her base at any cost.\u201d \u201cKelly Loeffler may have the privilege of playing politics with this issue, but I come from a community where the issue of police brutality is real and it\u2019s a matter of life and death,\u201d he added. When asked if he aligned himself with BLM, Warnock responded, \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d If Democrats do take back the Senate, it will be because of women. There has long been a gender gap in American politics, with women favoring the Democratic Party and men favoring the Republican Party. The biggest gaps were in 2016 and 1996, when 41% of women and 52% of men supported Trump, and 55% of women and 44% of men supported Democratic President Bill Clinton, according to Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women and Politics. Some polls suggest that Trump\u2019s presidency could widen that gap in 2020. In Senate polls across the country, many Democratic candidates have a double-digit difference in their support between women and men. \u201cI know it\u2019s gonna be close, but I actually do feel like we are in position to take back the Senate,\u201d Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List, told CNN. Schriock said she was \u201creally, really pleased\u201d that Democratic candidates like Theresa Greenfield in Iowa, Barbara Bollier in Kansas and MJ Hegar in Texas put their races on the map. These Trump-won states have been surprisingly competitive; Kansas hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932. A significant gender gap is present in a number of Senate races, according to a series of New York Times/Siena College polls the past two months. In Arizona, Democratic candidate Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut and the husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, led in his bid to oust Sen. Martha McSally because his deficit with men was smaller than his substantial advantage with women. He garnered 57% of support from women but only 44% of men. In Iowa, Greenfield narrowly trailed Sen. Joni Ernst. While she received 50% of support from women, only 37% of men backed her. And in Maine, Gideon, the state House speaker, led Collins because she tied her with men and captured the support of a plurality of the women. Schriock said that Republican efforts to attack the Affordable Care Act, block legislation addressing the gender pay gap and their anti-abortion views have made the GOP unpopular with women. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s his behavior, and the chaos that he produces constantly,\u201d said Schriock, referring to the President. \u201c[It] is just not anything women voters are interested in right now.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Foran, Marshall Cohen and Manu Raju contributed to this article.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler was apparently on another planet or something during the 2016 presidential race. Asked Wednesday about her previous assertion that there was nothing \u2013 not. one. thing \u2013 on which she and President Donald Trump disagreed, Loeffler reiterated that fact. Pressed by reporters on whether her unanimous support for Trump included sexist and misogynistic comments he made about women that were caught on an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and released just before the 2016 election, Loeffler said this: \u201cLook, what I agree with is the approach President Trump has taken since day one to put America First.\u201d Which, er, OK? But, it got worse. Here\u2019s what came next between a reporter and Loeffler: Reporter: \u201cAnd you\u2019re still not disagreeing with that particular thing that President Trump said, you\u2019re still not disagreeing with that?\u201d Loeffler: \u201cSorry, what are you referring to?\u201d Reporter: You\u2019re still not disagreeing with President Trump\u2019s statements about personally sexually assaulting women.\u201d Loeffler: \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that.\u201d At which point, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju interjects to note that the other reporter is \u201creferring to the Access Hollywood tape.\u201d To which Loeffler responds: \u201cYeah no. This President is fighting for America. That\u2019s what I\u2019m fighting for to make sure that every American has their chance to live the American dream and against the socialist policies that Joe Biden is espousing every day.\u201d It\u2019s hard to even rate this set of answers from Loeffler on the ridiculous scale. We might need to create a whole new scale. Because, while she was not yet in the Senate in 2016 \u2013 she was appointed by the governor to the seat of former Sen. Johnny Isakson in early 2020 \u2013 she was, in fact, alive during the last presidential campaign. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! And anyone \u2013 and I mean anyone \u2013 living in America at that time would have been aware of Trump\u2019s comments to Billy Bush, as captured on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. It created a massive furor in the final days of the race as a number of Republican leaders called for Trump to leave the contest or distanced themselves from him entirely. Trump dismissed the episode as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d It is completely and totally impossible that Loeffler was a) unaware of the story when it happened and b) had not heard of it in the intervening four years. Literally inconceivable. So what is she up to? The answer, as almost always, is politics. Because Isakson left before his term ended in 2022, Loeffler\u2019s appointment only holds through the November election.  On November 3, there will be an all-party primary. If no candidate gets 50% of the vote, which is very, very likely, the top two vote-getters \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 advance to a January runoff. Polling suggests that the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the preferred nominee of national Democrats, is virtually assured of a spot in that runoff. Loeffler is battling Rep. Doug Collins (R) for the other spot. (Collins was Trump\u2019s choice for the appointment.) And Loeffler has made the calculation that the way she beats out Collins is to be more Trumpian than Trump. She had a perfect 100% pro-Trump voting score this year, according to calculations made by 538. She has embraced Marjorie Taylor Greene, the likely congresswoman from the state\u2019s 14th district, who has made a name for herself nationally by embracing the QAnon movement and making a number of xenophobic and Islamophobic comments. This latest gambit \u2013 that she is unfamiliar with Trump\u2019s vulgar comments about women \u2013 is simply in keeping with Loeffler\u2019s strategy to ensure that Collins can\u2019t be more pro-Trump than she is. And it might work! But that doesn\u2019t make it right.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday gloated over the September killing of Portland, Oregon, murder suspect Michael Reinoehl by law enforcement officers who had been deputized as US Marshals. A task force involving federal, state and local law enforcement officers had been trying to arrest Reinoehl in connection with the August 29 fatal shooting of a supporter of a right-wing group in Portland, a killing that happened during clashes between pro-Trump groups and left-wing protesters. \u201cWe sent in the US Marshals,\u201d Trump said during a campaign rally in North Carolina, adding that it \u201ctook 15 minutes (and) it was over.\u201d The President immediately followed that statement by appearing to indicate that authorities had no intention of ever taking Reinoehl alive. \u201cThey knew who he was; they didn\u2019t want to arrest him, and in 15 minutes that ended,\u201d Trump said. It was unclear what information he was basing his assertion on. The comments from the President come one day after a Washington state sheriff\u2019s office released new details on how Reinoehl\u2019s death had unfolded and as questions swirl about whether police were justified in their use of force. The New York Times published a story earlier this week with interviews of nearly two dozen witnesses who cast doubt on the account from the sheriff\u2019s office and raised more questions about the use of force by police in the United States. Further, Trump\u2019s use of \u201cthey\u201d was unclear. He may have been reupping his criticism of local elected officials for not doing enough to quell protests. Or, perhaps more troubling, he may be been referring to the law enforcement shooting of Reinoehl as planned in advance. That raises further concerns and questions about the law enforcement response. It\u2019s not clear, however, what the President meant, and the White House offered no clarification when asked. The President has frequently advocated for police to use more aggressive tactics and has reveled in his political opponents, particularly protesters, being met with violence. The comments come at the same time that Trump is refusing to agree to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose in November\u2019s presidential election. CNN has reached out to the White House and US Marshals for clarification on the President\u2019s remarks. \u201cIf true, it would clearly be illegal,\u201d said Carrie Cordero, a CNN legal analyst and former Justice Department official, when asked about the possible interpretation of Trump\u2019s remarks as a planned effort by law enforcement to kill Reinoehl. \u201cIt would be an extrajudicial killing unless the agents involved were claiming they were acting in self-defense.\u201d The President\u2019s statement Thursday was not the first time he has weighed in on the incident. In an interview last month with Fox News, Trump spoke about the shots fired by the officers in terms of punishment against Reinoehl. \u201cThe US Marshals went in to get him, and in a short period of time \u2013 they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cAnd I will tell you something: That\u2019s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.\u201d Reinoehl had his hand on a partially withdrawn gun that was in his pocket when officers shot him during an attempted arrest in Washington state, the Thurston County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on Wednesday. According to a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office, one officer said he believed he saw Reinoehl pull out a gun earlier during the deadly September 3 encounter outside the city of Lacey, Washington. The information was released a day after The New York Times reported that witness accounts raised questions about whether Reinoehl had pulled out a gun or was fired on without warning. The statement by the Thurston sheriff\u2019s office offers more details from authorities than they initially released at time of Reinoehl\u2019s death. At the time, the US Marshals Service said initial reports indicated Reinoehl had produced a firearm as officers tried to arrest him. The sheriff\u2019s office said their release is based on statements of the officers involved in the arrest attempt. The New York Times reported that five eyewitnesses had said they never saw Reinoehl holding a weapon, and that the shooting began as soon as officers arrived in unmarked vehicles. The sheriff\u2019s office, which is leading the investigation into Reinoehl\u2019s shooting, has not said what civilian witnesses have told investigators about whether they saw him armed or how soon the firing started. Reinoehl was wanted in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County on a charge of second-degree murder in connection with the killing of Aaron \u201cJay\u201d Danielson at a protest in Portland. Asked to find him, a US Marshals task force located Reinoehl in Washington\u2019s Lacey area, a roughly 120-mile drive to the north, the service has said. Task force members saw Reinoehl leave a Thurston County apartment and enter a vehicle in the early evening of September 3, the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cMr. Reinoehl started the vehicle as officers pulled up\u201d to it, the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s release stated. The officers pulled up in two unmarked SUVs, The New York Times reported. After one of the officers \u201cgave verbal commands\u201d to Reinoehl, two officers saw Reinoehl begin \u201creaching toward the center console of the vehicle,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office says. \u201cOne officer observed what he believed to be a handgun presented by Mr. Reinoehl toward the officers,\u201d authorities stated in their release. Officers fired at Reinoehl while he was in the vehicle. He then got out of the vehicle and attempted to hide behind it as officers continued to shoot, the release said. It does not say whether Reinoehl was wounded at that point. Officers behind the vehicle \u201creported that (Reinoehl) continued to reach around his waistband and was attempting to manipulate his firearm,\u201d the release stated. Reinoehl then moved to the roadway toward two other officers, who \u201cfired their weapons as Mr. Reinoehl had his hand near his waistband and pocket where they observed a firearm,\u201d according to the release. Reinoehl fell to the ground. He \u201cstill had his hand on the firearm partially withdrawn from his pocket,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. He died at the scene, authorities say. A witness, Deshirlynn Chatman, told reporters last month that officers had tended to Reinoehl after he was shot. The New York Times reported that 21 of the 22 people near the scene who the newspaper interviewed said they hadn\u2019t heard officers identify themselves or give commands before the gunfire started. The 22nd person said he heard shouting, the Times reported. The sheriff\u2019s office said Wednesday that the officers \u201call had clear markings on their vests\u201d during the encounter but did not say whether the officers had announced themselves as police. The sheriff\u2019s office has previously said it didn\u2019t know whether Reinoehl fired any shots as officers tried to arrest him. The latest release did not address that fact, except to say a crime lab is examining a fired .380-caliber shell casing found in his vehicle, as well as \u201cthe weapons in Mr. Reinoehl\u2019s possession.\u201d The new release also did not specify whether investigators believe Reinoehl had a weapon separate from the one found partially withdrawn in his pocket. It also did not say whether the partially pocketed gun uses .380-caliber ammunition. Police have not said whether they have video of the confrontation. None of the task force members were injured. Four officers fired a total of 37 rounds, with two officers firing handguns and two firing rifles, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The office did not say how many times Reinoehl was shot. In an interview with Vice News in early September broadcast the day he died, Reinoehl, 48, appeared to take responsibility for the killing of Danielson at the Portland protest, alleging that he had acted in self-defense because he and a friend had been about to be stabbed. \u201cYou know, lots of lawyers suggest that I shouldn\u2019t even be saying anything, but I feel it\u2019s important that the world at least gets a little bit of what\u2019s really going on,\u201d Reinoehl said. \u201cI had no choice. I mean, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d In the interview, conducted with freelance journalist Donovan Farley, Reinoehl said he had gone to downtown Portland on the night of August 29 to provide \u201csecurity\u201d after seeing a caravan of hundreds of Trump supporters parading in vehicles through the city. He described himself as \u201c100% anti-fascist,\u201d though not a member of any antifa group. Danielson, who was a supporter of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, was shot in the chest during the confrontation and died. After the shooting, Reinoehl said he realized what had happened and \u201cwas confident that I did not hit anyone innocent.\u201d He then left the scene feeling \u201ctotally justified (that) had I not acted I am confident that my friend, and I\u2019m sure I, would have been killed.\u201d Reinoehl said he had decided to speak out because \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of propaganda put out there.\u201d \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve tried to make it look like we\u2019re all terrorists. And they\u2019re trying to make me look like a murderer,\u201d he said. The interview was broadcast as officers moved to apprehend him in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the incident. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said Portland police searched Reinoehl\u2019s home and found ammunition of the same caliber used in Danielson\u2019s fatal shooting and clothes that matched what Reinoehl was wearing on the night of the incident.

            "article_content": "Republican leaders took steps Wednesday to protect their vulnerable senators ahead of an unusual vote that will put them on the record about whether they support the Trump administration\u2019s push to have the Supreme Court strike down the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The GOP move is a clear response to the rare effort by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to seize the floor and force a vote requiring them to make a choice: Support a lawsuit backed by President Donald Trump or side with the law protecting people with pre-existing conditions, which has emerged as a central theme in the battle for control of the Senate and the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scheduled a procedural vote on a Republican bill \u2013 authored by vulnerable North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis \u2013 that they say would maintain the protections for pre-existing conditions should the Supreme Court toss out the ACA. That would give GOP senators something they can point to as evidence they want to continue those protections and also allow them to vote against and defeat the Democratic bill Thursday. The Tillis measure stalled Wednesday night on a strictly party line vote, 47 to 47, with Democrats voting against it and Republicans voting to advance it. While Democrats couldn\u2019t get the 51 votes required to kill the bill, it ultimately isn\u2019t going anywhere. It would need 60 votes to pass, which it would not be able to get in the narrowly divided chamber where the GOP has a 53-47 edge. Democrats call McConnell\u2019s move a \u201cshow vote,\u201d arguing that under close scrutiny past bills introduced by Republicans to demonstrate their support for keeping protections for pre-existing conditions fall short of that promise. \u201cSenate Republicans are once again shopping a do-nothing bill to fool Americans into thinking their loved ones with pre-existing conditions will be protected. The only people covered by this bill are Senate Republicans,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The back-and-forth comes after Schumer took a step rarely employed \u2013 by essentially taking control of the floor from McConnell, who typically controls the Senate schedule \u2013 and forced the Thursday procedural vote on the Democratic bill. Democrats are eager to spotlight the attempts by the White House to try to kill the health care law and are looking for ways to push back against the quick confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett before the election, given that the high court will hear the Trump administration\u2019s ACA appeal in November. Democrats have been forcing small procedural delays in Senate action since Barrett was named, in protest of her nomination, which they don\u2019t have the votes to stop. Democrats are expected to continue to force procedural votes that could force the Senate to return to session next week when senators had been scheduled to be on their pre-election recess. GOP Senate candidates turn to their families to deflect Democratic attacks on health care McConnell and his leadership team are telling their members that the chamber might be in session next week if Democrats don\u2019t cooperate. The topic came up at the Senate GOP lunch earlier Wednesday, according to an attendee. Since the vacancy arose, Democrats have prevented committees from holding meetings longer than two hours and dragged out a vote on the stopgap resolution to keep the government open until hours before a shutdown would happen. Asked if the Senate would be in recess next week, as it\u2019s been scheduled, Senate Majority Whip John Thune said: \u201cThat\u2019s kind of up to the Democrats.\u201d There needs to be unanimous consent to set up pro forma sessions \u2013 where no business is conducted \u2013 during a Senate recess. If the Senate is in session, it\u2019s unclear if there would be any votes. If there are no votes, then senators running for reelection would still be able to campaign back home next week.

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has well below 50% support in a pair of new polls released this week, showing just how precarious her reelection bid is weeks before voters decide her political fate in the toughest campaign of her career. Collins\u2019 Democratic challenger, Maine state House Speaker Sara Gideon, currently holds 49% to the senator\u2019s 44%, according to a new poll released Friday from The New York Times and Siena College, results that are within the poll\u2019s sampling error margin. The survey\u2019s finding is far tighter than a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this week showing Gideon with a wide, 54% to 42% advantage over Collins. The polls underscore how high the stakes are for Collins with just under 50 days until the election. Her race is regarded as one of the most competitive Senate races this cycle. The senator\u2019s expensive competition against Gideon could prove to be a make-or-break moment for her four-term career in the chamber. Maine will be using ranked choice voting in this year\u2019s Senate contest. There are two independent candidates running for the Senate seat in addition to Collins and Gideon. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, votes from the fourth place candidate would be reallocated to their second choice candidate, and then from the third place candidate, if needed, until one candidate has more than 50% support. Both polls suggest Gideon is closer to hitting that mark than Collins. Running for reelection in a state President Donald Trump narrowly lost in 2016, Collins is balancing the need to appeal to the President\u2019s base \u2013 whom she also needs to turn out for her \u2013 against not further alienating moderate and independent voters. The New York Times and Siena College poll also showed a Democratic upper hand in the presidential election, with former Vice President Joe Biden holding a wide 55% to 38% lead over Trump among Maine voters. On Friday, Collins rolled out two endorsements from Republican governors in blue states, a move that further highlights how critical the election is given the fact that the governors rarely issue endorsements for candidates outside of their own respective states. Republican Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts both voiced their support for Collins\u2019 bid for a fifth term in two separate 15-second ads in which they highlighted her willingness to work across party lines and serve as an independent representative of her state in the Senate. \u201cMaine has a long history of independent-thinking leaders, and Susan Collins is exactly the kind of independent, thoughtful and effective leader that we desperately need in the Senate,\u201d Hogan says in one of the ads. \u201cAs governor of Maryland, I can appreciate that. I urge you to reelect Susan Collins.\u201d \u201cAs governor of Massachusetts, I work with both parties to get things done. Susan Collins does that in the Senate,\u201d Baker says in his ad. \u201cShe\u2019s pro-environment, pro-women, pro-Maine. We need more leaders like Susan. I hope you reelect her.\u201d Given their positions in more liberal leaning states, both Hogan and Baker occupy a particular spot in national Republican politics. Hogan has made headlines throughout Trump\u2019s presidency for breaking with or publicly clashing with the President \u2013 particularly on the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Baker has also publicly criticized Trump, and one poll over the summer found that 89% of likely Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts approve of the job Baker is doing. In a third 30-second spot, both Hogan and Baker, as well as former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent and former Democrat, stump for Collins, urging Mainers to reelect her this November. Collins and Gideon faced off during a debate in Maine last week in which the senator said Trump \u201cshould have been straightforward with the American people\u201d about the threat from the coronavirus. When Gideon challenged Collins on who she thinks should be \u201cleading the country,\u201d the senator did not answer, saying the Maine people don\u2019t need her advice.

            "article_content": "Top Democrats sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe on Tuesday demanding that he resume election-related intelligence briefings to Congress. The letter comes days after CNN first reported Ratcliffe had notified lawmakers that intelligence officials from his office would no longer brief congressional committees on election security matters in person but would provide information only in written form. Top intelligence office informs congressional committees it'll no longer brief in-person on election security \u201cYour abrupt decision to cancel previously scheduled election-related briefings, contrary to repeated private and public commitments by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), is an abdication of your responsibility to keep the American people and their elected representatives informed of foreign threats to the 2020 election,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Rep. Pete Visclosky of Indiana wrote. \u201cIt is all the more troubling as it comes only weeks before the American people begin casting votes and within weeks of the Intelligence Community (IC) affirming publicly that our elections and American voters are once again the target of foreign interference,\u201d they added. CNN first reported that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had notified lawmakers on the House and Senate Intelligence committees about the briefing format change. The abrupt change runs counter to the pledge of transparency and regular briefings on election threats by the intelligence community. Schiff says it is possible House could subpoena intelligence officials to testify on election interference It comes after the top intelligence official on election security issued a statement last month saying China, Russia and Iran are seeking to interfere in the US election, a warning that prompted some backlash from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have continued to push for the public release of more information about the nature of those efforts. US officials charged with protecting the election said last week that they have \u201cno information or intelligence\u201d that foreign countries, including Russia, are attempting to undermine any part of the mail-in voting process, contradicting President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed false claims that foreign adversaries are targeting mailed ballots as part of a \u201crigged\u201d presidential race. Specifically, a senior intelligence official discounted the possibility of foreign actors mass-producing fake ballots to interfere in the November elections, again breaking with Trump, who has continued to insist that mail-in voting poses a significant threat to election security. \u201cWe have no information or intelligence that any nation-state threat actor is engaging in activity \u2026 to undermine any part of the mail-in vote or ballots,\u201d the official told reporters last Wednesday. On Saturday, Trump claimed that the decision to alter the briefings had been prompted by unauthorized leaks and cast blame on Democrats. \u201cDirector Ratcliffe brought information into the committee, and the information leaked,\u201d Trump said at an event in Texas. \u201cSo he wants to do it in a different form because you have leakers on the committee, obviously, leakers that are doing bad things, probably not even legal to leak, but we\u2019ll look into that separately,\u201d the President said. In response to Trump\u2019s accusations of leaks, Schiff tweeted, \u201cAs usual, President Trump is lying and projecting. Trump fired the last DNI for briefing Congress on Russian efforts to help his campaign. Now he\u2019s ending briefings altogether. Trump doesn\u2019t want the American people to know about Russia\u2019s efforts to aid his re-election.\u201d Democrats have pointed out that the move to limit briefings for lawmakers comes after the intelligence community publicly confirmed that Russia is seeking to interfere in the US presidential election and is working to \u201cdenigrate\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThe IC confirmed publicly on August 7 that only one country \u2013 Russia \u2013 is actively undertaking a \u2018range of measures\u2019 to interfere in the election. Your decision, moreover, comes as the Congress itself is the target of a concerted effort by Russia to launder and amplify disinformation, including through a \u2018pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian\u2019 who is spreading false claims \u2018to undermine former Vice President Biden\u2019s candidacy and the Democratic Party,\u2019 \u201d the lawmakers wrote in their letter Tuesday. Specifically, Democrats are demanding that Ratcliffe reinstate a briefing for the House Intelligence Committee that had previously been scheduled for September 17, which they say had been proactively offered by ODNI. They also call for reinstatement of a briefing for all House members that had also been tentatively scheduled for September. US intelligence officials say there's no evidence to back up Trump's claims about threats to mail-in voting Schiff previously told CNN that House lawmakers would consider issuing subpoenas should Ratcliffe decline to resume briefings, a threat the lawmakers reiterated in their letter Tuesday. \u201cIf you are unwilling to resume election-related intelligence briefings to Congress, we will have no choice but to consider the full range of tools available to compel compliance,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis intelligence belongs to the American people, and they have a right to know more about ongoing foreign efforts to influence their votes and interfere in our democratic process. With voting imminent in many states, it is imperative for the IC to disclose as much information as possible publicly \u2013 without further delay, conflation, or false equivalency \u2013 about our adversaries\u2019 aims, activities, and agents, as well as what the IC is doing to expose and thwart this interference,\u201d the letter states.

            "article_content": "For Donald Trump\u2019s America-on-fire campaign strategy to work, he needs violence to boil in cities right up until Election Day, or at least for enough voters to believe the nation is spiraling into an abyss of chaos and savagery. That brought the extraordinary spectacle Monday of a president \u2013 who would by tradition call for calm at a time of civic unrest \u2013 justifying violence by his supporters and all but excusing a pro-Trump vigilante who allegedly killed two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin. At the same time, in the White House briefing room, he minimized police brutality against African Americans that sparked a summer of protest and agony. In a Fox News interview, the President callously compared police officers who shoot Black men in the back to professional golfers who \u201cchoke\u201d over a three-foot putt. His word choice was particularly ugly given the death of George Floyd, who stopped breathing with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck in Minnesota in May. Trump\u2019s inflammatory behavior on Monday came on a day that could come to be seen as critical for the destiny of the White House after Democratic nominee Joe Biden launched a counterattack, warning no one was safe in \u201cTrump\u2019s America\u201d \u2013 which he said was hobbled by disease and fear. Biden condemns violence and asks if Americans 'really feel safe under Donald Trump' It also unfolded on the eve of Trump\u2019s visit to Wisconsin, which local leaders pleaded with him to cancel to avoid exacerbating tensions. Instead, the President gave every indication that he plans to use the trip to troll his critics with his claims of a nation on the edge from a platform in a key swing state. Dismissing the notion that his appearance at a raw moment might increase violence, the President said, \u201cit could also increase enthusiasm and it could increase love and respect for our country.\u201d Trump\u2019s provocative appearance represents a bet that a hardline \u201claw and order\u201d campaign can drown out the pandemic that he has badly mismanaged, that has killed more than 180,000 Americans and on Monday crossed the 6 million mark in known infections. No one doubts that protests and violence rattled US cities from Minnesota to Wisconsin and Washington, DC, to Chicago this summer \u2013 amid a national epiphany on race caused by the death of Floyd. The spectacle of a \u201cstrong\u201d President vowing no tolerance for rioters may be an attractive one to many voters. But the situation is far more complicated than the idea that left-wingers and \u201cterrorists\u201d who support Biden are going on the rampage. There is evidence that far-right groups and other extremists are also involved. Most protests have been peaceful and violence has often been sparked by opportunists. And even cities like Portland, Oregon, are not perpetually in flames as Trump claims. CNN law enforcement correspondent Josh Campbell, a former FBI agent, said that Trump\u2019s claim that Portland was \u201cablaze\u201d was a lie. He wrote in an email to CNN reporters on Monday that he stopped at a Starbucks, had lunch from a food truck and went to a mall: \u201cPortland is not a city under siege.\u201d Task force reports show dire reality despite Trump's positive messaging \u201cThey want to destroy our country. They\u2019re going to destroy our suburbs,\u201d he said during an appearance in the White House briefing room mislabeled as a \u201cnews conference,\u201d not even bothering to hide his goal to scare voters in affluent White areas around swing state cities into believing that Biden would bring political unrest that would shake America to its foundations. In his Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham, which at times verged on unscripted paranoia, Trump also claimed without evidence that \u201cthugs\u201d wearing \u201cblack uniforms with gear\u201d got on a plane from a \u201ccertain city\u201d and headed to the Republican National Convention last week. He refused to give details, claiming the case was under investigation. Trump\u2019s day of fury reflects how he has now firmly settled on a campaign of demagoguery to save his presidency. In a characteristic piece of projection, he accused Biden \u2013 who earlier condemned violence from all sources \u2013 of using Mafia talking points and Democrats of stirring disorder with \u201cdangerous rhetoric.\u201d On Tuesday he portrayed protests at the White House after his convention speech on Thursday night \u2013 in which Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and his wife were harassed \u2013 as if they were among the most flagrant examples of disorder in modern US history. \u201cIt was a terrible, terrible thing to witness,\u201d Trump said. His alarmism was expressed in a rant that resembled a highlight reel of conservative media buzz words and conspiracy theories including \u201cradicals,\u201d \u201cmaniacs,\u201d \u201cAntifa,\u201d \u201clooters,\u201d \u201carsonists\u201d and \u201cfascism.\u201d Fact check: Trump falsely describes Biden's comment on coronavirus shutdowns In a classic authoritarian tactic, Trump also vastly over stated the extent of lawlessness and political violence, then promoted himself as the kind of strongman needed to restore order. And he tipped his hand over his new campaign tactic by opening his appearance with a boast about the stock market and a perfunctory mention of the pandemic that brought the country to its knees. Then it was on to his real topic: \u201cleft-wing political violence.\u201d In one sense, Trump\u2019s gambit has already succeeded. He has moved the ground of the election away from the Covid-19 crisis and the multiple political corruption scandals that have clouded his term from day one. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, made an attempt to wrest the conversation back to Covid-19, using an interview on MSNBC to accuse the President of saying to Americans \u201cchoose me over your child\u201d as some kids go back to school without the testing infrastructure and needed safety precautions. Vigilante group activity on the rise, worrying law enforcement and watchdog groups On Monday, Biden left his campaign-from-home bubble in Delaware to travel to Pittsburgh to parry Trump\u2019s attacks amid increasing nervousness among Democrats that the President\u2019s hardline approach could lift him back into a race in which he is trailing. The Democratic nominee pointed out the flawed logic behind Trump\u2019s approach, given that the unrest hitting cities in Minnesota, Oregon and Wisconsin is unfolding, after all, on the President\u2019s watch. \u201cThe violence you\u2019re seeing in Donald Trump\u2019s America. These are not images from some imagined \u2018Joe Biden\u2019s America\u2019 in the future. These are images from Donald Trump\u2019s America today,\u201d Biden said. In a sign that he intends to maintain his aggressive push back \u2013 and that he has no intention of being \u201cswift boated\u201d as happened to 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry \u2013 Biden\u2019s team said that he hoped to travel to Kenosha soon. Biden also used his speech to move beyond the issue of violence in cities in an attempt to frustrate the President\u2019s effort to make law and order the key issue in the election. While accusing Trump of \u201crooting for chaos and violence,\u201d Biden said Trump\u2019s failings on the pandemic, on foreign policy and even on Social Security had made Americans much more vulnerable. \u201cDo you feel safer and more secure now?\u201d Biden asked in a repeating refrain. A Biden trip to Wisconsin would bookend Trump\u2019s own visit to the Badger State. The White House has said that it has tried to make contact with the family of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by police in an incident that triggered unrest last week. Blake is still in hospital and local police have offered few explanations for the incident. The fact Trump and the family have not connected appears to indicate there is no desire to meet the President. Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, have spoken at length with Blake\u2019s family over the telephone. The President plans to meet law enforcement officers in Kenosha and to survey damage from nights of unrest. He is claiming he ordered National Guard troops into the city to quell rioting and restore order. But in reality, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had already activated the troops before Trump called for their intervention. The political controversy over Kenosha is turning into a microcosm of the election in one of the most hotly contested districts in one of the most contested states. Biden, who on Sunday condemned the killing of a Trump supporter in clashes in Portland, sought to capitalize on Trump\u2019s news conference, in which he defended supporters for shooting paint balls at protesters in the city. \u201cOnce again, I urge the President to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is a right \u2013 a necessity \u2013 violence is wrong, period. No matter who does it, no matter what political affiliation they have. Period,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cIf Donald Trump can\u2019t say that, then he is unfit to be President, and his preference for more violence \u2013 not less \u2013 is clear.\u201d Daniel Dale, Tara Subramaniam and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The US intelligence community assessment that Russian interference in the 2020 election favors President Donald Trump threatens to undercut his hopes that prosecutor John Durham will discredit the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation into his 2016 campaign. Trump and allies, including Attorney General William Barr, have questioned whether the Russians showed a preference for Trump in 2016. But the US intelligence assessment released last week makes clear the Russians are doubling down on their pro-Trump efforts to undermine Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. The shadow of election-year politics has added to the partisan circumstances surrounding the probe, which Barr at one time contemplated appointing Michael Mukasey, a former attorney general who works closely with Rudy Giuliani, the President\u2019s personal lawyer, to lead. Pressure to try to deliver at least some findings before the November election is apparent to some witnesses who have sat for interviews with Durham\u2019s investigators recently, people briefed on the interviews said. Trump goes after FBI director Wray, whom he appointed, and issues warning to Barr The 2016 intelligence is among the issues being examined by Durham, the Connecticut-based federal prosecutor who is leading a broad inquiry into the Russia investigation. It\u2019s a probe that has become increasingly politicized, in part because Trump and allies have sought to build expectations that Durham could deliver last-minute surprise findings to boost the President before the election. The President used a Fox Business interview Thursday to make clear that he wants an election assist from Durham and Barr, and that he would be disappointed if Barr can\u2019t deliver. \u201cBill Barr has a chance to be the greatest of all time,\u201d Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. \u201cBut if he wants to be politically correct he\u2019ll be just another guy.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came after Barr for the first time said it\u2019s possible Durham\u2019s work will continue past November, though Barr is pushing to release at least some conclusions before the presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019re all aware of the calendar and we\u2019re not going to do anything for the purposes of affecting an election, but we are trying to get some things accomplished before the election,\u201d Barr told conservative commentator Buck Sexton in an interview that aired Wednesday. Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working to 'denigrate' Biden Before his appointment as attorney general, Barr had made clear his skepticism of the 2016 investigation of the Trump campaign. Even as he prepared to help close special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Barr was exploring appointing a new investigator to scrutinize the origins of the probe, which he believed was without merit. His first choice to appoint Mukasey to lead the probe, a move which hasn\u2019t been previously reported, likely would have drawn even more political controversy than the probe already has generated. Mukasey and Giuliani are former law partners and in recent years have worked together to represent Turkish clients. Mukasey, in a telephone interview, said he and Barr discussed the possibility early in Barr\u2019s tenure last year. \u201cThere was agreement on all sides, that it was better to keep it inside the Justice Department,\u201d Mukasey said. Mukasey in 2018 published an opinion column in USA Today criticizing Mueller\u2019s investigation, calling for it to be ended for \u201clegal and political reasons.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. While Barr has regularly discussed what he said are disturbing findings by Durham, the prosecutor himself has said little about his investigation. It\u2019s not even clear that Durham, who is known to work slowly, can complete all parts of a complex probe before the election, as the President\u2019s supporters would like. 37 times President Trump was soft on Russia Barr, who initially said he anticipated Durham to finish his work this summer but has also mentioned an early fall timeline, discussed possible delays, including trying to negotiate with witnesses, during a Fox News interview aired Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s meticulous and he is about gathering all the evidence,\u201d Barr told conservative host Mark Levin. \u201cI think people have to realize that in this process the witnesses have lawyers, sometimes they won\u2019t talk to you, they slow it down sometimes, they will take the Fifth Amendment unless you give them immunity.\u201d Aside from Barr, glimpses of the scope of the probe have emerged from witnesses who have been questioned. Based on questions asked of witnesses, among the issues Durham is looking into is whether Obama administration officials, including former CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, cooked the intelligence to damage the then-incoming president. Trump has long dismissed US intelligence on the Russians efforts to help him, in part because it implicates the legitimacy of his 2016 victory, former administration officials have said. Barr, in House testimony last month, said the premise of the 2016 FBI investigation into the Trump campaign was \u201cbogus.\u201d In Fox News interviews he regularly has described the investigation as \u201cone of the greatest travesties in American history,\u201d and accused the FBI of trying to \u201csabotage the presidency.\u201d Those views stand in contrast with a new assessment released last Friday. William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, issued an assessment on efforts by Russia, China and Iran to meddle in the 2020 election. While the statement described a Chinese preference for Trump to lose reelection, it described an active Russian-linked disinformation campaign to damage Biden and boost Trump. Whatever Durham finds on the intelligence work in the 2016 Russia probe, the current intelligence on 2020 bolsters the fact that the Russians see a benefit from a Trump second term, current and former US officials say. Durham has also been examining other aspects of the FBI\u2019s work in 2016 and 2017, including whether a former FBI attorney should be criminally charged for altering a document used in the preparation of a surveillance application filed with the foreign intelligence surveillance court. The FISA warrants targeting Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, contained serious errors and false statements, an inspector general report found. After some delays due to the Covid shutdowns of the courts, Durham and his team of investigators have picked up the pace of their work, according to people briefed on the investigation. Witnesses who have met with Durham have said there\u2019s no discernible major target for prosecution in the probe. In recent weeks, James Baker, former FBI general counsel during the Russia investigation, sat with Durham\u2019s team for an interview and was quickly brought back for follow-up questions, according to a person briefed on the matter. Barr asked about Russia election interference. Hear his response A grand jury in Washington\u2019s federal court, which Durham was using as part of his investigation, also has resumed work, people familiar with the matter said. Some key interviews appear to still be in the works. Brennan and Clapper haven\u2019t met with Durham. A spokesman for Brennan said discussions for an interview have been ongoing and that one issue remains that Brennan requires access to his papers from his time at the CIA, which the Trump administration has blocked. Barr in his Fox News interview this week said Durham\u2019s work is also complicated by the sheer number of issues, including conspiracy theories, he has been asked to look into. \u201cThere was a sprawling number of issues to be looked at here,\u201d Barr told Levin, \u201cand there were a lot of different conspiracy theories and part of our responsibility is to look at all of these things so we can assure people these various theories have been looked at.\u201d",

            "article_content": "With the presidential election fewer than 90 days away, federal prosecutors in New York face a narrowing window in which to take overt steps \u2013 including bring charges \u2013 in their investigation of Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, and his Soviet-born associates. Since early last year, prosecutors with the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan have been investigating Giuliani along with businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman in connection with their efforts to oust the then-US ambassador to Ukraine and initiate investigations by the country into Trump\u2019s Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In October 2019, prosecutors brought charges against Parnas, Fruman and two other associates, indicting them in an alleged campaign-finance scheme involving donations to a pro-Trump super PAC. They have pleaded not guilty. The investigation expanded into Giuliani. Prosecutors sent subpoenas to political donors and fundraisers asking about any business dealings they had with the former New York City mayor or his firm Giuliani Partners. The sprawling investigation into all of the men, however, was upended by the coronavirus pandemic, limiting prosecutors\u2019 ability to interview witnesses, collect further evidence, and meet with the grand jury. Now, with the presidential election approaching, prosecutors must decide, if they believe there is evidence of a crime, to bring charges or wait until after the election to avoid a so-called October surprise. While prosecutors privately indicated as recently as April that they intended to bring additional charges against Parnas and Fruman by the end of July, which CNN has reported, that timeline expired last week. And in recent discussions with at least one defense counsel, prosecutors provided no update on the timing of additional charges, according to a person familiar with the matter. The investigation received renewed attention in late June when Geoffrey Berman, the former US attorney for Manhattan, was ousted from his post, and public scrutiny centered on whether his dismissal was linked to his office\u2019s pursuit of those close to Trump. Meanwhile, Justice Department guidelines and longstanding practices discourage prosecutors from bringing a politically sensitive case \u2013 such as any that might involve a sitting President\u2019s personal attorney \u2013 in close proximity to an election. In New York in recent years, federal prosecutors have charged similarly politically sensitive cases no later than August of an election year. In Giuliani\u2019s case, while he has been under scrutiny for months, he has not had any contact with prosecutors, according to his attorney. That is not uncommon for a target of an investigation but, for a prospective defendant like Giuliani, a former Manhattan US attorney himself, it is likely he would be informed of possible charges and given a chance to make his case to prosecutors before they make a final decision. \u201cWe have had no contact at all, nor do I suspect we\u2019ll have any contact with federal prosecutors,\u201d Robert Costello, an attorney for Giuliani, told CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any reason to believe that anybody is really actively looking at Rudolph Giuliani for having done anything wrong, because he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d A spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment. Still, the inquiry involving Giuliani, Parnas, Fruman and their associates appears to have remained active in recent months, following some delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. Prosecutors and FBI agents interviewed multiple witnesses in February and March as the pandemic was taking hold in New York. By April, however, prosecutors asked the judge overseeing the case to postpone the October trial date for Parnas and Fruman until next year. The trial is now set for February 1. They noted their timeline on bringing charges had been pushed back by the pandemic\u2019s impact on their ability to interview witnesses and convene a grand jury. At the time, they privately told lawyers for the men that they anticipated they would bring new charges by the end of July. By June, according to two people familiar with the matter, the investigation picked up again, with prosecutors and FBI agents actively interviewing witnesses as part of their investigation concerning Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman. The people familiar with the matter said prosecutors\u2019 questions appeared to relate more to the conduct of Parnas and Fruman and matters that were charged in their original indictment \u2013 including a marijuana business venture and donations the two made to Republican candidates and a pro-Trump super PAC as an alleged effort to spread their influence \u2013 than they did to Giuliani. And in recent weeks, grand juries have reconvened in New York, including in White Plains, which is part of the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s office jurisdiction. For example, earlier this month, a White Plains grand jury issued an indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell, a former girlfriend and associate of Jeffrey Epstein, with recruiting, grooming and ultimately sexually abusing girls, some as young as 14. She has pleaded not guilty. As part of their investigation, prosecutors have continued to inquire about Parnas\u2019s Florida-based company Fraud Guarantee, which paid Giuliani $500,000 in 2018, these people said, and while CNN has reported that prosecutors have weighed additional charges in conjunction with the company, it isn\u2019t clear that those charges would be filed against Giuliani. Giuliani is more directly under scrutiny for his efforts to remove the US ambassador to Ukraine, according to people familiar with the investigation, who say a charge could be brought as a violation of foreign lobbying laws. Any charges under that statute, known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, would require the approval of the national security division in Washington, operating under Attorney General William Barr. In July, following his dismissal, Berman told lawmakers he was concerned that his removal \u2013 and an initial decision by Barr to replace him with an attorney from outside the office with no prosecutorial experience  \u2013 was an effort to disrupt or delay investigations. Berman, who didn\u2019t cite specific investigations of concern, was ultimately replaced by his deputy Audrey Strauss, a well-respected attorney. There is no indication that investigations have been impacted. During a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee last week, Barr was quizzed on Berman\u2019s firing and whether he interfered in any investigations in the office. \u201cNumber one, anyone familiar with the Department of Justice would say that removing a component head is not going to have an impact on a pending investigation,\u201d Barr said in defending the move. He added, \u201cI have not interfered in any investigation. I\u2019ve raised questions on occasion about certain matters, but as far as I\u2019m aware, the office was satisfied with the resolution.\u201d Even with prosecutors\u2019 continued scrutiny of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman, however, the clock is ticking toward the presidential election period, when prosecutors are less likely to bring charges. Justice Department memorandums advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to either candidate. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that extends that policy to within 60 days of an election. In Giuliani\u2019s case, some observers say there is no rush for the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan to bring a case before the election. If prosecutors believe they have evidence of a crime, they will have remaining time under the statute of limitations after the election cycle. Other lawyers have suggested the outcome of the election could influence the timing of any case. If prosecutors believe they have evidence of a crime and Trump loses re-election, they could delay announcing charges until January, after Trump leaves office, removing the possibility that he might pardon an ally. If prosecutors were to move toward charging Giuliani, protocol dictates that they would brief senior Justice Department officials, likely including Barr, in advance of making such an announcement. Prosecutors with the US Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan initially briefed Barr on the investigation concerning Parnas, Fruman and Giuliani early last year, shortly after Barr was sworn in. The sensitivity of charging decisions and investigative steps with respect to elections has been a source of tension for the Justice Department, particularly in recent years. Days before the 2016 presidential election, then-FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress concerning the reopening of an investigation involving Democratic nominee Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails. The Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General later criticized Comey\u2019s decision, saying his \u201cdescription of his choice as being between \u2018two doors,\u2019 one labeled \u2018speak\u2019 and one labeled \u2018conceal,\u2019 was a false dichotomy. The two doors were actually labeled \u2018follow policy/practice\u2019 and \u2018depart from policy/practice.\u2019\u201d Prosecutors in the Manhattan office have recently been faced with similar issues concerning charging decisions in advance of elections. In 2018, the year of the congressional midterm elections, the office charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year. In both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind. Cohen pleaded guilty that August and is serving a prison sentence in home confinement. Collins, who won his reelection while under indictment, initially pleaded not guilty, but later changed his plea and resigned his seat. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison, but has yet to report because of the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Outside digital organizers are capitalizing on TikTok to drum up enthusiasm for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, amid President Donald Trump\u2019s potential ban of the short form video app. Pro-Biden creators say that in light of Trump\u2019s announcement, they will continue to post on TikTok, but they\u2019re also testing out the waters on other platforms, cross-posting on alternative short-form video apps such as Dubsmash and Triller. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where the energy goes, but it\u2019s going somewhere,\u201d said Misha Leybovich, founder of Bigtent Creative, a left-leaning digital production company. \u201cTrump can\u2019t ban short form video.\u201d Although scrutiny around the short-form video app has increased in Washington in recent weeks, and the Biden campaign itself has instructed its staff to delete the app from their personal and work phones due to security concerns, content created by unaffiliated organizers is still flying, from \u201cMalarkey\u201d meters to graphics with animated confetti that falls around Biden\u2019s name. Security analysts have voiced concerns over the app\u2019s safety, given that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and reportedly collects users\u2019 location and metadata. \u201cThere have been bipartisan concerns, including by Sen. Chuck Schumer, related to TikTok, really focused on two issues: counterintelligence and censorship,\u201d CNN national security analyst Samantha Vinograd said. She noted that under a 2017 law, Chinese companies are required to disclose user data to the Chinese government. The Washington Post reported in September that the app didn\u2019t appear to feature content related to the pro-democracy protests taking place in Hong Kong. Schumer, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, among others, later questioned whether TikTok had censored Hong Kong-related content and the app\u2019s ties to the Chinese government. For its part, TikTok has pushed back against security concerns, calling them \u201cunfounded.\u201d The app, which is especially popular among members of Gen Z, has soared in downloads in recent months. On TikTok\u2019s official TikTok account, US General Manager Vanessa Pappas appeared in a video thanking American users for their \u201coutpouring of support.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not planning on going anywhere,\u201d Pappas said in the video. \u201cWhen it comes to safety and security, we\u2019re building the safest app because we know it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2026 We\u2019re here for the long run. Continue to share your voice here and let\u2019s stand for TikTok.\u201d Content creators also shrug off the concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny to me that we have these security concerns, this, that, whatever,\u201d said Matt Rein, 23, of Democrat Hype House, an outside organizing group that creates pro-Democratic content on TikTok. \u201cThe only reason why TikTok is being targeted in this specific fashion is because it\u2019s a Chinese company, God forbid. Deleting TikTok, I think that\u2019s kind of stupid.\u201d Trump\u2019s Friday announcement that he would ban the app in the US was aimed at resolving policymakers\u2019 concerns that the foreign-owned TikTok may be a national security risk, and the US government is conducting a national security review of TikTok in preparation of making a policy recommendation to Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters last week at the White House. Trump on Monday softened on his position, saying that TikTok has until September 15 to sell to a US based company, failing which he would shut down the app. He added a stipulation that the sale can only go through if the US Treasury gets a cut of the deal. Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok from its Chinese owners ByteDance; it is committed to a complete security review of TikTok before a potential purchase. Some young people think there is more than security concerns behind the president\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m angered that Trump believes he has that power. A company created a popular product and he should not be controlling the market like that. Also, we all know in part it\u2019s just because he\u2019s angry that TikTok was used in part to make his rallies look bad,\u201d Grace Naquin, 19, said, pointing to TikTok users\u2019 previous efforts to reserve tickets at Trump campaign rallies and then not show up. A number of young Democratic voters said that when they go to the polls this November, they may not be voting for their initial favorite contender. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Biden was definitely not the leader in terms of youth support,\u201d Naquin said, noting that for most young people, among the primary candidates, Biden wasn\u2019t their first choice. Young voters did not unite behind Biden in the primaries. In February, for example, about 50% of young people voted for Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. In the March primaries, Biden lost the youth vote again to Sen. Sanders, in Florida and Illinois, by double digits. Democratic organizers believe that if a growing number of 18-25-year-olds are on TikTok, their digital efforts need to be there too. More than 15 million young people have turned 18 since the last presidential election, and this November, one in 10 eligible voters will be between the ages of 18 and 23, according to the Pew Research Center. While young people, like everyone else, are generally not single issue voters, TikTokers were up in arms with anti-Trump messaging on the app following his announcement. In a post following Trump\u2019s announcement, TikToker @itsjohnwalsh dressed up as Trump and said, \u201cThose people are on TikTok making fun of me\u201d as a \u201creason to ban the app.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to put TikTok on notice. You have 45 days to make a deal, and I\u2019m the best deal maker there is, so I know,\u201d Walsh said in the satirical video. In a post back in July, Walsh dressed up as Biden and made a fake ad for Biden, positioning Biden as the pro-TikTok president. \u201cIf you want to save TikTok, vote for Joe,\u201d the video says. Groups such as the Biden Digital Coalition, Democracy Hype House, and Bigtent Creative recognize the opportunity to engage with this swath of the 2020 electorate on apps such as TikTok. While they each approach organizing on TikTok differently, they all strive to harness support for Biden this November. Research from CIRCLE at Tufts University demonstrates that young people hear about the election most from their peers, and organizers from each of these digital groups have targeted their outreach accordingly. \u201cMillennials and Gen Z are more influenced by their peers than any previous generation,\u201d Zach Fang, who formerly worked for both Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang, said. \u201cThey trust their peers, they trust their generation. So knowing that, and also knowing that [TikTok] is where they spend their time\u2026 we\u2019re reaching them in a way that they\u2019re receptive to, we\u2019re reaching them where they\u2019re spending their time.\u201d Fang, who said he currently volunteers for both the Biden Digital Coalition and is a consultant for Bigtent Creative added, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can make an argument that\u2019s any better use of time or money than investing it on [creating content on TikTok].\u201d The Biden Digital Coalition was built by former volunteers for the Pete Buttigieg campaign. After the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, much of his army of young supporters came with him. Naquin, who was formerly part of Students for Buttigieg, joined the Biden Digital Coalition as a leader within the group\u2019s Youth Coalition. She\u2019s now a part of the Biden Digital Coalition\u2019s hypehouse on TikTok, @bidencoalition, along with Zach Fang, Olivia Sullivan and Mary Jo Laupp. While the Biden Digital Coalition says they will remain active on TikTok, Trump\u2019s announcement last week made them to try other apps, including Triller. Sullivan made a Triller Sunday night and Fang said the BDC might go to Dubsmash, too. Both Triller and Dubsmash are short form video platforms alternative to TikTok. According to Naquin, while young liberal voters may be ambivalent about Biden as a candidate, the energy from young people to elect Trump out of office is strong, even on TikTok. \u201cI would say it\u2019s much more anti-Trump,\u201d Naquin said, adding that, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people on TikTok who are like settling for Biden, so to speak.\u201d In a TikTok posted on the Coalition\u2019s hype house, Sullivan expresses that while reasons to vote for Biden include \u201ca plan for climate change,\u201d \u201che supports (Black Lives Matter),\u201d and \u201cforeign policy experience,\u201d she concludes by underscoring: \u201cBecause Trump is the worst.\u201d Anti-Trump content has found its audience on TikTok, with creators both young and old speaking out against Trump on the app. In June, 51-year-old Mary Jo Laupp organized a \u201cno-show protest\u201d ahead of Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally where TikTokers reserved tickets to the rally with no intention of attending the rally to disappoint the campaign with attendee turnout numbers. Laupp, famously known as \u201cTikTok Grandma,\u201d joined the Biden Digital Coalition shortly thereafter. As a mother, grandmother, former teacher, and wife of a youth pastor, she believes organizing on TikTok works because it\u2019s youth driven and young people listen to their peers, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that young voters feel really in the process so that they could bring along their friends because it\u2019s their energy and excitement that\u2019s going to convince their peers to vote,\u201d Laupp said. \u201cThe number one result of the rally was that GenZ feels so motivated and so ready to rock,\u201d she added, speaking to the enthusiasm around protesting Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, when she made her big debut on the app. While the anti-Trump rhetoric on TikTok is strong, there is also a movement for Trump on the app, including groups such as Conservative Hype House, Republican Hype House and The MagaHouse. There is often conversation between pro-Biden TikTokers and Trump fans who respond to each other directly on the app. \u201cDigital organizing is the new frontier,\u201d Naquin said, speaking to the experimental nature of the Biden Digital Coalition. \u201cSometimes things flop and that\u2019s OK\u2026 there\u2019s no consequences if something doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d Leybovich, a former McKinsey consultant and MIT graduate, says his goal at the end of the day is to encourage voter turnout, and more specifically, to \u201cvote Trump out of office and vote pro-lefty things,\u201d he said. In threatening the ban on TikTok, Leybovich said, \u201cTrump has succeeded in pissing off a lot of people that maybe before wouldn\u2019t have been as political and maybe now are more so.\u201d Bigtent Creative is not tied to Biden in any official capacity; the group mainly spreads the word about voter registration, voting in general and anything anti-Trump. Nia Stanford, a micro-influencer with over 270,000 followers on the app, posts content about \u201cblackness, queerness,\u201d and short form raps, \u201csome of which have been politically motivated,\u201d she said. Stanford is part of a niche community on the app focused on Black Lives Matter activism and explained that she takes to TikTok to post about her life, which, according to her, is itself \u201cinherently political.\u201d Recently, Stanford posted about Trump\u2019s pardoning record. She worked with Bigtent to come up with the idea for the post. Organizers including Stanford, Fang, and Laupp shared that a benefit of digital organizing, especially on TikTok, is that it empowers creators and allows people to engage in political advocacy work who may have never had the opportunity to do so otherwise. \u201cHaving TikTok as a resource is an opportunity,\u201d Stanford said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that this is a rarity and this app is actually effectively changing peoples\u2019 perceptions. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of discourse on TikTok.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s potential ban, Stanford said she feels that people don\u2019t understand the way TikTok is used to build community and enact social change enabling those who weren\u2019t previously welcomed into political conversations to join in online. Given the Biden campaign\u2019s privately expressed concerns around TikTok, it does not have an official presence on the app, nor does it coordinate with any outside organizers who use it to rally voters for the presumptive Democratic nominee. But it doesn\u2019t try to stop them, either. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re reaching voters wherever they are. So that includes Facebook and Instagram, of course, but also channels like TikTok. It\u2019s worth noting here that we don\u2019t have an official account like we do on other social media channels,\u201d a Biden campaign official said. Instead, the campaign works with an army of 11,000 volunteer digital organizers who share content across social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Pinterest created by both the campaign and volunteer content creators. The volunteer content creators are given free reign to submit content within the framework of a branding guide that includes the campaign\u2019s color scheme and general messaging, which is then approved by Ben Cobley, the campaign\u2019s digital community manager. In an almost entirely digital era forced by the pandemic, digital organizing has become the era\u2019s version of door-knocking. \u201cFor the most part, though, it is very much organic. We want [content creators] to be invested in the campaign and by giving them the ability to create on their own, that is usually the best way for them to feel bought in,\u201d Cobley told CNN. Cobley\u2019s goal with the content created and shared by volunteers is to counteract the messaging of Biden\u2019s general election opponent. \u201cEverybody talks about Donald Trump\u2019s presence on social media and how he represents the darker side of the internet, the mean, the bullying, things like that. I\u2019ve always wanted to make sure that our volunteers, especially the ones that I interact with, embrace a more positive side because we want to we want to follow Joe\u2019s code, we want to be empathetic, we want to be joyful, we want to counter that darkness with some light, with some empathy,\u201d Cobley said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally published on November 17, 2019. It has been updated to include 12 new instances in which President Trump has gone easy on Russia. President Donald Trump has an Achilles\u2019 heel when it comes to Russia. Over the years, he\u2019s made no secret that he has a soft spot for the country and its authoritarian leader, President Vladimir Putin. Trump has proved that he is willing to reject widely held US foreign policy views and align himself with the Kremlin on everything from Russian interference in US elections to the war in Syria. Most recently, Trump has denied the veracity of US intelligence reports accusing Russia of paying bounties to Taliban fighters to kill US troops in Afghanistan. Pressed on the topic during an interview with Axios that was released on Wednesday, Trump said he did not raise the issue during a recent phone call with Putin, and continued to suggest that the reports are \u201cfake news.\u201d During the 2016 campaign, Trump\u2019s ties to Russians were so concerning that the FBI believed there was good reason to investigate potential collusion between his 2016 campaign and the Kremlin. Counterintelligence investigators also examined whether Trump himself was somehow a Russian asset. (Special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy of collusion.) In Trump\u2019s eyes, these allegations are proof of a conspiracy against him by Democratic lawmakers and other \u201cdeep state\u201d enemies within the US government. He has bombastically declared, \u201cThere\u2019s never been a president as tough on Russia as I have been\u201d \u2013 a dubious claim that he repeated during the Russian bounties scandal. But Trump\u2019s narrative is simply false, based on his own actions over the last few years. Here\u2019s a breakdown of 37 occasions when Trump was soft on Russia or gave Putin a boost. While he was a private citizen, during his 2016 campaign and throughout his presidency, Trump has showered Putin with praise. He said Putin was \u201cso nice,\u201d he called Putin a \u201cstrong leader\u201d and said Putin has done \u201ca really great job outsmarting our country.\u201d Trump also claimed he\u2019d \u201cget along very well\u201d with Putin. Few, if any, Western leaders have echoed these comments. Trump raised eyebrows in spring 2016 when he hired GOP operative Paul Manafort to run his presidential campaign. Manafort spent a decade working for pro-Russian politicians and parties in Ukraine and cultivated close relationships with Putin-friendly oligarchs. Manafort was sentenced in 2019 to 7.5 years prison for, among other things, evading taxes on the $60 million he had made in Ukraine. (He was released to house arrest in May 2020 amid coronavirus concerns.) Trump said Putin did \u201can amazing job of taking the mantle\u201d when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump broke with US policy and suggested he was OK if Russia kept the Ukrainian territory. He repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, \u201cThe people of Crimea, from what I\u2019ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\u201d Ahead of the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump campaign aides blocked language from the party platform that called for the US government to send lethal weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies. Mueller investigated this for potential collusion but determined the change was not made \u201cat the behest\u201d of Russia. (The Trump administration ultimately gave lethal arms and anti-tank weapons to the Ukrainian military.) Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on the US government assessment that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. At a news conference in July 2016, he even asked Russia to hack more, saying, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Instead of condemning Russia for hacking and leaking Democratic emails, Trump eagerly capitalized on the Kremlin\u2019s meddling, and used the emails to attack Clinton on a near-daily basis in the final stretch of the campaign. The Mueller report said Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cexpected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\u201d and that top officials believed they had inside information about WikiLeaks, so they planned a strategy around the expected release of hacked emails. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the Senate Intelligence Committee all confirmed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. But Trump has repeatedly rejected this view, and publicly sided with Putin at the Helsinki summit in 2018, saying he accepted Putin\u2019s denials. After the 2016 election, the Trump transition team asked Russia not to retaliate too strongly against new US sanctions imposed by then-President Barack Obama. The sanctions were intended to punish Russia for interfering in the election, but then-Trump aide Michael Flynn asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation so they could have a good relationship once Trump took over. Days before his inauguration, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he was open to lifting sanctions on Russia. He said: \u201cIf you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody\u2019s doing some really great things?\u201d Putin has tried for years to persuade the US and European countries to end crippling sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy. Bucking other US leaders, Trump has dismissed credible allegations that Putin uses violence against his opponents. Trump said in 2015, \u201cI think it would be despicable if that took place, but I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\u201d Asked again in February 2017, Trump deflected, saying, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\u201d The Washington Post reported in May 2017 that the Trump administration considered returning two diplomatic compounds to Russia. The Obama administration expelled Russian diplomats and seized the compounds in New York and Maryland after the 2016 election, claiming they were used for \u201cintelligence\u201d purposes. The compounds were never returned to Russia. In a shocking move during the early months of his presidency, Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in May 2017. The intelligence, which was about ISIS, was sensitive enough that it could have exposed a vulnerable source. The unplanned disclosure by Trump rattled even many of his Republican allies. Trump has repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin, who wants to weaken the alliance. Trump said NATO was \u201cobsolete,\u201d rattling European leaders. At his first NATO summit in May 2017, Trump scolded other countries for not spending enough on defense and declined to commit to NATO\u2019s mutual defense pledge. (Trump later said he supported the mutual defense provision.) He has also said he wanted to withdraw from NATO, according to The New York Times, though it hasn\u2019t happened. Lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill in July 2017 imposing new sanctions against Russia, even though Trump administration officials reportedly tried to water down the language. Trump reluctantly signed the bill, but claimed the new law contained \u201cclearly unconstitutional provisions.\u201d Trump had little choice in the matter because the bill had passed with veto-proof majorities: 419-3 in the House and 98-2 in the Senate. (The Treasury Department followed up with several rounds of hard-hitting sanctions.) After the July 2017 meeting of G20 leaders, Trump said he had spoken with Putin about \u201cforming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit\u201d to combat \u201celection hacking.\u201d Trump quickly backtracked after lawmakers from both parties said it would be ridiculous to work with Russia on cybersecurity because Russia was responsible for egregious hacks against American targets, including during the 2016 election. Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of US diplomats from Russia in August 2017, saying, \u201cI want to thank him because we\u2019re trying to cut down our payroll.\u201d Putin kicked out the officials to retaliate against US sanctions. Trump\u2019s comments conflicted with the State Department, which said the mass expulsion was \u201cuncalled for.\u201d (Trump later said he was being sarcastic.) The Treasury Department in 2018 sanctioned Russian oligarch and Putin ally Oleg Deripaska, along with three companies linked to him, over his support for Russian interference in the 2016 election. But by January 2019, the Trump administration lifted some of these sanctions. In a bipartisan rebuke, 11 Senate Republicans supported a Democratic resolution calling for the sanctions to remain. Ignoring the advice of several top national security aides, Trump congratulated Putin on his March 2018 reelection victory. Putin got 77% of the vote, but Western observers declared that the election \u201clacked genuine competition\u201d and took place in an \u201coverly controlled legal and political environment.\u201d Trump\u2019s critics said he had given the election legitimacy it did not deserve. Trump privately complained about US sanctions intended to punish Russia after one of its ex-spies was poisoned in the United Kingdom, according to Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton. The US and UK blamed Russia for trying to assassinate the defector, Sergei Skripal. After the sanctions were announced in August 2018, Trump tried to rescind them and said the US was \u201cbeing too tough on Putin,\u201d according to Bolton\u2019s memoir. In summer 2018, Trump blocked his administration from releasing a statement on the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war, according to Bolton\u2019s memoir. Bolton said European leaders noticed Trump\u2019s silence and \u201cbecame even more concerned about American resolve.\u201d Russia invaded its neighbor Georgia during the five-day war in 2008, and still occupies two breakaway territories. On several occasions, Trump has praised controversial far-right European leaders who have been shunned by most US officials because of their close ties to Putin. Trump met at the White House with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a top Kremlin ally. He praised the campaign of French politician Marine Le Pen, whose party previously got millions from a Russian bank. According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized Russia\u2019s \u201cdangerous escalation.\u201d The White House didn\u2019t say anything, but Trump canceled a meeting with Putin. During a January 2019 Cabinet meeting, Trump defended the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. He said the Soviet Union \u201cwas right\u201d to invade in 1979 because \u201cterrorists were going into Russia.\u201d The comments puzzled many observers, who noted that the Soviets had invaded to bolster a communist government and the US had backed Afghan militants who fought the Soviets. Breaking with American allies, Trump repeatedly called for Russia to be invited back into the Group of Seven. Russia was suspended from the working group of leading industrial nations in 2014 after Putin annexed Crimea. At the August 2019 G7 summit in France, Trump pressed the other leaders to include Russia at the 2020 gathering. They balked at the request, which would have handed a huge victory to Putin without any concessions. Trump announced in October 2019 that US troops were withdrawing from northern Syria. The abrupt move cleared the way for Turkey to conquer territories previously controlled by the US and allied Kurdish militias. It also gave Russia a golden opportunity to expand its influence and swiftly take over abandoned US outposts and checkpoints. Trump\u2019s move was a boon for Putin. After announcing the Syria withdrawal, Trump repeated Kremlin talking points about ISIS. He said, \u201cRussia hates ISIS as much as the United States does\u201d and that they are equal partners in the fight. But Trump\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the reality on the ground: Since intervening in Syria in 2015, the Russian military has focused its airstrikes on anti-government rebels, not ISIS. During his impeachment proceedings in 2019 and early 2020, Trump said many false things about Ukraine that align with Russian disinformation about the country. This includes claims of uncontrollable corruption, improper ties between Ukrainian officials and the Obama administration, and allegations that Ukraine meddled in US elections. This helps Putin\u2019s goal of destabilizing US-Ukraine relations. As the impeachment inquiry revealed, Trump personally froze $391 million in US military and security assistance for Ukraine in mid-2019. US diplomats said Ukraine desperately needed the help for its war against Russian proxies. Previously, the Trump administration had slow-walked sales of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine because of concerns it would upset Russia, according to a State Department official. For more than a year, Trump privately and publicly attacked Marie Yovanovitch, who was the US ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her in spring 2019. One of Russia\u2019s goals is to weaken the US-Ukraine alliance \u2013 Trump played into that by smearing Yovanovitch and undermining her diplomatic work in Ukraine. Her ouster was a major part of Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump said in November 2019 that he was thinking about visiting Russia, at Putin\u2019s invitation, to attend a 2020 military parade in Moscow. The US government has repeatedly called out Russia\u2019s aggressive moves around the world, so a visit from a sitting US president would be highly unusual. Obama made the last visit in 2013, when relations were warmer, before Russia invaded Ukraine. After months of speculation, Trump declined the invitation, as the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc around the world. As the coronavirus pandemic exploded in spring 2020, the US accepted a large delivery of medical supplies from Russia, which were flown into New York City. Trump thanked Putin for the \u201cvery nice offer,\u201d even while diplomats sparred over whether the equipment had been donated or purchased. Regardless, experts said the stunt was a propaganda bonanza for the Kremlin. Trump announced in May 2020 that he was postponing the US-based G7 summit because of the coronavirus and that he also wanted to extend invitations to Russia and three other countries to participate. Other G7 leaders swiftly rejected Trump\u2019s idea to invite Putin, because Russia still hasn\u2019t withdrawn from Crimea and has continued its aggressive actions around the world. Trump directed the Central Intelligence Agency to share more counterterrorism intelligence with Russia, according to the national security website Just Security, which cited two former CIA officials who had served under Trump. The officials said the US received nothing in return, which is consistent with past intelligence-sharing with Russia. The President was repeatedly told during in-person briefings and in written intelligence reports in 2019 and 2020 that the US government believed Russia paid bounties to Afghan militants to kill Americans, according to CNN and other outlets. Despite being given this information, Trump did not publicly condemn Russia or take any retaliatory actions. Trump has denied receiving any briefings on the topic. Rejecting the findings from US intelligence agencies, Trump said allegations that Russia paid Taliban militants to kill US troops were \u201canother hoax\u201d that was \u201cmade up by fake news.\u201d By saying he doesn\u2019t believe the allegations against Russia, Trump publicly sided with the Kremlin, which denies paying any bounties. After Trump was briefed on the Russian bounties, and after the story was revealed by the press, he had several phone calls with Putin. But Trump never raised the topic of bounties with Putin during these calls, never told Putin to stop and never threatened any retaliation. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue that many people said was fake news. \u2026 I have never discussed it with him,\u201d Trump said in a July 2020 interview with Axios. In June 2020, Trump approved plans to significantly reduce the number of US troops in Germany. The plan to remove about one-third of the force drew serious concerns from the Pentagon because it could compromise Europe-based defenses against Russia. In a letter to Trump, nearly two dozen Republican lawmakers said his decision would \u201cstrengthen the position of Russia to our detriment.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he will \u201csurge\u201d federal law enforcement officers to Chicago and other American cities, despite resistance from local leaders, as he adopts a hardline \u201claw and order\u201d mantle ahead of November\u2019s election. In making the move, Trump is wading further into an effort to portray Democrats as weak on crime and unable to protect the citizens of places where they are in charge. He has ordered federal agents to tamp down on protests in Portland, Oregon, leading to chaotic tableaux and reports of unmarked vehicles snatching people off the streets. And he has warned he may order federal officers into other states and cities he deems insufficiently policed, even if governors and mayors in those places don\u2019t ask for help. His attention in recent days has focused on Chicago, whose Democratic mayor said Tuesday she would not allow \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s troops\u201d into her city. Before he became president, Trump once railed against his predecessor for high crime rates in Chicago, but he now blames local officials for the scourge. Using ominous rhetoric and dark language to describe cities run by Democrats as rife with crime and violence, Trump suggested Wednesday he had little option but to take steps those leaders haven\u2019t to save innocent lives. \u201cNo mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city,\u201d he said during a mid-afternoon event in the East Room. Trump\u2019s campaign has increasingly turned to dark themes of violence and chaos as it seeks to falsely paint his Democratic rival Joe Biden as anti-police. Since protests spread throughout the country following the murder of George Floyd, Trump has worked to cultivate a tough-on-crime message that includes the federal law enforcement efforts now underway. Speaking at the same event as Trump, Attorney General Bill Barr criticized what he called \u201cextreme reactions that have demonized police\u201d in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, which he blamed for \u201ca significant increase in violent crime in many cities.\u201d Trump was announcing the expansion of the Operation Legend initiative, a Justice Department program first established in Kansas City earlier this month that utilizes federal law enforcement officers from the FBI, US Marshals Service, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to combat violent crime. Trump said he was dispatching additional federal law enforcement into other American cities, including Chicago, to tamp down on \u201cheinous crimes of violence.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll work every single day to restore public safety, protect our nation\u2019s children and bring violent perpetrators to justice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it and you\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s happening all around the country.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve just started this process and frankly we have no choice but to get involved,\u201d Trump said. Barr said there were about 200 federal agents dispatched as part of the program to Kansas City, and said a comparable number would head to Chicago to augment existing teams already there. He said 35 agents would go to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and that other cities would be added later. The program is named for 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, a Kansas City resident who was fatally shot while sleeping at home. When it was announced, the Justice Department described the initiative as \u201ca sustained, systematic and coordinated law enforcement initiative across all federal law enforcement agencies working in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officials to fight the sudden surge of violent crime.\u201d The program doesn\u2019t require the explicit invitation from local leaders, and many have resisted having federal officers patrolling their streets. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, tweeted on Tuesday evening: \u201cUnder no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump\u2019s troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents.\u201d Earlier in the day, she said she would \u201cwelcome actual partnership, but we do not welcome dictatorship.\u201d And New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich tweeted after being informed the operation was expanding to Albuquerque that federal law enforcement wasn\u2019t welcome. \u201cGiven the mess it created in Portland, I let him know in no uncertain terms that this isn\u2019t the kind of \u2018help\u2019 that Albuquerque needs,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Heinrich was referring to a separate Trump administration effort, led by the Department of Homeland Security, to quell protests in Oregon that has drawn scrutiny for its tactics. Leaders there have said the federal law enforcement presence has exacerbated tensions with protesters, who are marching against systemic racism in policing. The Trump administration has claimed it has authority to protect a federal courthouse in Portland in explaining its actions. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump was \u201cvery discouraged by the violence that he\u2019s seen in Chicago\u201d and claimed Lightfoot was \u201cclearly unable to control her streets.\u201d A day earlier, Trump himself suggested he would expand the deployment of federal law enforcement officers to other cities led by Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this happen in our country,\u201d he said, naming New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore and Oakland, California. \u201cAll run by liberal Democrats.\u201d Trump has turned increasingly to \u201claw and order\u201d themes as he works to portray Biden as weak on crime. His effort began in early June after the murder of Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. After mostly peaceful protests spread decrying Floyd\u2019s death and larger issues of systemic racism, Trump sought to tamp down on occasional flare-ups of violence and to claim his Democratic rival is weak on crime. His attacks, however, have relied on false talking points, including that Biden supports defunding police. In fact, Biden has said he supports increasing funds for community policing efforts. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump\u2019s campaign from releasing fear-mongering ads that suggest 911 calls would go unanswered if Biden is elected president, including one this week that depicted an elderly woman being attacked in her home. Facebook ads in a similar vein depicted protesters attacking police officers, casting the election choice as \u201cpublic safety vs. chaos and violence.\u201d Yet the photo of the attack was not from recent events in the United States; its caption on Wikicommons indicated it was taken in 2014 during pro-Democracy protests in Kiev, Ukraine. This story has been updated with additional developments.",

Jones is considered the most vulnerable incumbent Democratic senator in 2020. \u201cThe Covid crisis has shown how our health depends on each other, on our neighbors, our loved ones, our co-workers,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWearing masks and social distancing is about protecting each other, our parents and grandparents, the friend who has diabetes or a heart condition we didn\u2019t know about, the front-line workers who put themselves at risk, and so our small businesses open safely and get our economy moving.\u201d \u201cWe do this for each other,\u201d he adds at the end, while putting on a mask. The Jones ad comes in the middle of a debate within the Republican Party over how to encourage Americans to be safe during the pandemic. The Jones campaign has booked the ad to air in the Montgomery media market this week, at a cost of about $226,000, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. The mask has become a symbol of one\u2019s political allegiance during the pandemic, pitting some supporters of Trump against those who take the advice of health care experts. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Health Committee, and some top health care officials in the Trump administration have all encouraged wearing a mask as a way to slow the spread of Covid-19. Alexander urged Trump on Tuesday to \u201cjust get rid of this mask politics,\u201d adding that \u201cit hurts the country and it doesn\u2019t help him.\u201d Alexander, who is retiring after this term, said the debate \u201cmakes no sense\u201d because Trump supporters would help the President win reelection if they wore masks to contain the disease and reopen the economy sooner. If the Trump administration isn't requiring masks, who is? \u201cIf you\u2019re pro-Trump, you don\u2019t wear a mask, and if you\u2019re anti-Trump, you\u2019re more likely to wear a mask,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that makes no sense.\u201d Trump has continued to defy health experts\u2019 recommendations and shown reluctance to wear a mask in public, telling the Wall Street Journal it is \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d that could make people more likely to get infected since wearers fidget with them and could get a false sense of security. The President also suggested that some masks are worn as an expression of opposition to him. Vice President Mike Pence was asked on Tuesday if the Trump administration is delivering inconsistent public health messaging. \u201cThe President has worn a mask in public, as have I, and you\u2019ve heard a strong encouragement about mask wearing,\u201d he responded. \u201cBut let me say we believe that Americans should wear a mask whenever state and local authorities indicate that it\u2019s appropriate, or whenever social distancing is not possible. And we\u2019ll continue to convey that message.\u201d Overall, 65% of adults say they have worn masks \u201cin stores or other businesses all or most of the time in the past month,\u201d according to a recent Pew Research Center study. But only 49% of conservative Republicans said they have worn them \u201call or most of the time in the past month,\u201d compared with 60% of moderate Republicans and 83% of liberal Democrats. Alabama Republican Party Chair Terry Lathan told CNN that she wears a mask \u201cwhenever possible in public,\u201d but that \u201cthis topic will find folks on both sides of the debate.\u201d \u201cMy biggest observation is there seems to be a lot of mask shaming that adds more division,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cPeople are watching the data, updates and the Covid situation. They are making their own decisions. The time spent on the mask wars is probably interesting to many but does it change any minds? There is nothing wrong with reminders on wearing masks, but it\u2019s eventually the individual\u2019s choice.\u201d Lathan said the Jones ad is a \u201cgood mask public service announcement\u201d but that it omits Jones\u2019 voting record, which she said strikes against the will of the majority of Alabamians, including voting to remove the President after his impeachment and against the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cHe can\u2019t mask these facts in the highest-approval-rated Trump state in the nation,\u201d she added. 'It would help' if Trump wore a mask, GOP health committee leader says Jones is running in a state that Trump won in 2016 by nearly 30 points. In 2017, Jones beat Roy Moore, a twice-defrocked state Supreme Court justice accused of sexually assaulting teenagers, by a point and a half. He\u2019ll face a tougher opponent in 2020. On July 14, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who held the Senate seat for 20 years, faces former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, who boasts Trump\u2019s endorsement, in the Republicans\u2019 primary runoff election. The Jones, Sessions and Tuberville campaigns did not respond to requests for comment about the new ad. In the absence of a state mandate and amid a rise in cases, some cities and counties in Alabama have issued stricter guidance. In Jefferson County, the home of Birmingham and the most populous county in the state, a mandatory face-covering order reportedly went into effect on Monday.

            "article_content": "As Washington, DC\u2019s June 2 primary approached, Matthew Miller and Nima Sheth, married professors who live in the District, decided to vote absentee. With elderly, immunocompromised parents at home, plus a 1-year-old baby, it felt like the safest choice in the age of coronavirus. So, they submitted requests for absentee ballots on the last day of eligibility, a week before the primary. They got a confirmation email from the DC Board of Elections. But Miller\u2019s ballot never arrived, and Sheth\u2019s ballot was sent to the wrong address. Neither ended up voting. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a risk we were willing to take, at least for the primary,\u201d Miller said, \u201cThough November might be a different story. You just don\u2019t think something like this could happen in a country like America, where, if you follow the rules, you should be able to vote.\u201d Miller and Sheth are among tens of thousands of voters who didn\u2019t get their requested absentee ballots in recent primaries, including in the battleground states of Georgia and Wisconsin. In Maryland, where all registered voters were automatically supposed to get ballots in the mail, about 160,000 ballots, roughly 5% of those sent out, weren\u2019t delivered, officials say. With five months to go before the November election, when an unprecedented number of voters will likely cast mail-in ballots, some glaring trouble spots are beginning to emerge. States\u2019 rush to expand absentee voting ahead of primaries this spring exposed logistical issues that, if not addressed, could lead to much bigger problems on Election Day. This isn\u2019t the \u201cmassive fraud\u201d that President Donald Trump falsely claims is happening \u2013 a distortion he reiterated on Monday morning in an all-caps tweet. To the contrary, the frenzied rollout of mail-in voting has likely led to more eligible voters getting disenfranchised than voters fraudulently casting multiple ballots, according to a new CNN review of data from a half-dozen recent primaries. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. For instance, about 14,000 absentee voters never got their ballots in Wisconsin, a state Trump carried in 2016 by only about 23,000 votes. If just 1% of absentee ballots aren\u2019t delivered to voters in key states this fall, that could tip the balance in a close presidential election and potentially trigger a constitutional crisis. With issues cropping up in a handful of states, elections experts are warning about what could happen in November, and whether state officials, many of whom are still scrambling to calculate the extent of the problems, have enough time to fix them. The coronavirus created once-in-a-generation challenges for how elections are run, so officials across the country have rushed to implement new policies and scale up mail-in voting. For the most part, those efforts have gone smoothly. In West Virginia, rules were relaxed for who could qualify for an absentee ballot. In Nevada, officials pro-actively sent a ballot to ever registered voters. States with limited experience with mail-in voting saw record participation. That appears to be part of the problem, as many states have been overwhelmed by a surge in demand. In Georgia, for example, more than 800,000 absentee ballots had already been cast one week before the state\u2019s June 9 primary \u2013 a massive surge from 2016, when only 37,000 Georgians voted absentee. There were similar upticks across the country, according to data from election authorities. About 97% of primary voters cast absentee ballots in Maryland, which held a nearly all-mail election for the first time ever. The figure was 83% in Rhode Island, 74% in Wisconsin, and 51% in Indiana, which kept some polling sites open for voters who still preferred to vote in-person. But breakdowns have left tens of thousands of voters in the lurch. CNN spoke to registered voters in Georgia, Wisconsin and Washington DC, who said they followed the rules requested absentee ballots, and even sought assistance from local election officials, to no avail. \u201cThat was the most frustrating part, going through all those hoops, requesting the ballot and finally getting it straightened out \u2026 and then for them to send the ballot to the wrong address,\u201d said Cathy Lawton, 58, of Barton, Wisconsin, a small town in a reliably Republican county. Lawton was one of about 14,000 voters in Wisconsin who never got the absentee ballots they requested, according to a spokesman from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Some of these people may have been ineligible to vote, and others may have voted in-person once they realized their absentee ballot wasn\u2019t coming \u2013 but Wisconsin officials don\u2019t track those figures. These problems reappeared last week in Georgia: The state sent absentee requests to all voters, and county officials vastly reduced the number of Election Day polling sites. But when many voters in Atlanta didn\u2019t get the ballots they requested, they either gave up, or voted in person, crowding the same polling sites that officials hoped would stay relatively empty because of heavy mail-in voting. State Sen. Jen Jordan, a Democrat who represents Atlanta, said she didn\u2019t get the ballot she requested, and that she heard from hundreds of constituents who had the same experience. \u201cIt was members of the General Assembly, members of the board of education, someone who just ran for mayor, it hit everybody,\u201d Jordan told CNN, explaining that the issues affected everyone from first-time absentee voters to seasoned politicos who are running for office this year. Stacey Abrams, former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia and founder of a voting rights group, herself received an absentee ballot with an unusable return envelope. Abrams had initially requested an absentee ballot in May, and said she decided to vote in-person on Election Day. The Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office told CNN that nearly 97% of absentee ballots were delivered to the right place before Election Day. \u201cThe purpose of election administrators is to make sure there aren\u2019t so many accidents that people become disenfranchised,\u201d said Erica Long, 44, who works for the Atlanta Public Schools and never got her absentee ballot in the mail, so she braved the pandemic and voted in-person. Election officials and voting rights experts see a silver lining in the fact that the pandemic hit early in the year, and not during the run-up to November. In that sense, the pandemic-era primaries were like a dry run, revealing hiccups in the system, even if they were predictable. David Becker, founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states are trying to make changes in a few months that typically take years to implement. In western states like Washington and Colorado that conduct all-mail elections, local officials spent multiple election cycles testing their new systems and educating voters about the changes. \u201cThis is flattening the curve, for elections,\u201d Becker said, referring to the public health strategy. \u201cEach person who votes by mail is one less person who is standing in line on Election Day.\u201d\u2019 Some of the polling sites that stayed open were flooded with voters, with colossal lines that stretched for hours. When states scale back the number of polling sites, it disproportionately affects minority voters, who tend to prefer the in-person voting experience, experts told CNN. \u201cWe never miss an election,\u201d said Long, the Atlanta education professional, who is Black. \u201cWe like to go to our polling place and see our neighbors. It feels sort of festive.\u201d In Atlanta, many of the polling sites were understaffed, as election authorities struggled to recruit volunteers to risk their lives during a pandemic. A report from the DC Board of Elections released Wednesday said the city \u201clost over 1,700 poll workers\u201d in the run-up to its primary. Compounding the problem, voters who had absentee issues needed to fill out additional paperwork before they could vote in-person, slowing down the process for voters still in line. \u201cAround the country, most of the people who operate these voting centers are seniors. But seniors understand the vulnerability of this pandemic,\u201d said Bob King, an adviser to six former DC mayors who now runs get-out-the-vote efforts for seniors. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to make that extra $125 to work at the polls. They\u2019re scared because of the underlying conditions they have.\u201d Even with the emphasis on mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus, in-person voting will remain vital. \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible to make face-to-face voting go away and run a fair election,\u201d said Barry Burden, professor of political science and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. Burden said an \u201call of the above\u201d approach is likely the best way forward: Make it easy to vote by mail but also keep as many polling sites available as possible. States are trying to pick up the pieces from their primaries and make changes for November. In Wisconsin, the US Postal Service is actively investigating issues with Milwaukee County absentee ballots, including one particularly egregious breakdown, where about 1,600 ballots were discovered in three USPS tubs at a post office in Chicago, days after the election. The Wisconsin Elections Commission is set to implement changes for the general election. Officials on Wednesday approved a plan to send 2.7 million registered voters a mailer that includes an absentee ballot application. The commission also plans to improve ballot-tracking systems for absentee ballots that get sent in. \u201cThe important thing is that we avoid the last-minute rush that occurred\u201d before the April primary, election commission spokesman Reid Magney told CNN. \u201cThey have to act early.\u201d Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s top election official, also on Wednesday announced a set of proposals aimed at improving elections across the state ahead of November, including giving the State Election Board the power to intervene in county elections management. The proposals also include providing increased tech support to voting places to avoid the voting machine mishaps experienced last Tuesday, according to AJC.com. Raffensperger also announced that he wouldn\u2019t repeat a program that sent absentee ballot request forms to Georgia\u2019s 6.9 million active voters. Instead he will create a website for voters to requests absentee ballots online. In Maryland, where about 5% of ballots weren\u2019t delivered, the state election office conducted an \u201cextensive voter outreach\u201d effort to ensure voters received email ballots or were told to vote in-person. In Washington, DC, local officials decided on Wednesday to switch to this pro-active approach for the fall. Voters needed to submit an absentee ballot request for the June primary, and many didn\u2019t come in time, according to interviews with local officials and frustrated voters. A spokeswoman from the DC Board of Elections said they sent emergency email ballots to about 750 eligible voters who never got their absentee ballots. The spokeswoman, Rachel Coll, said these voters contacted the board of elections for help before Election Day, and that the board of elections doesn\u2019t know how many voters had this issue but didn\u2019t reach out, Coll said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answers I got before the election. And the answers I got after the election haven\u2019t been consistent either,\u201d said DC Council member Elissa Silverman, who added that her staff received more than 500 complaints from voters. \u201cI have a low level of confidence in the board of elections right now. And we need to get a high level of confidence for November.\u201d This story has been updated to reflect the latest data from the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, and to add context about who controls polling locations in the state.",

            "article_content": "A little more than three months ago, as Democrats cast their ballots in the Nevada caucuses, Republicans felt confident about their chances in 2020. The coronavirus seemed a distant, far-off threat. Democrats appeared poised to nominate a self-described socialist for president. The stock market was near a record high. The economy was roaring. President Donald Trump looked well-positioned to win a second term, and perhaps pull enough incumbent Republicans along with him to hold the party\u2019s majority in the Senate. Today, that view has drastically changed. \u201cPut it this way, I am very glad my boss isn\u2019t on the ballot this cycle,\u201d said one high-ranking GOP Senate aide. Republican strategists are increasingly worried that Trump is headed for defeat in November and that he may drag other Republicans down with him. Seven GOP operatives not directly associated with the President\u2019s reelection campaign told CNN that Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout have significantly damaged his bid for a second term \u2014 and that the effects are starting to hurt Republicans more broadly. Some of these operatives asked not to be identified in order to speak more candidly. Several say that public polls showing Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden mirror what they are finding in their own private polls, and that the trend is bleeding into key Senate races. The GOP already had a difficult task of defending 23 Senate seats in 2020. The job of protecting its slim 3-seat majority has only gotten harder as the pandemic has unfolded. States like Arizona and North Carolina, once thought to be home to winnable Senate races now appear in jeopardy. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Trump himself is being alerted to the problems. Politico reported this week that two of Trump\u2019s own outside political advisers, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, warned the President last week that his support was falling in some swing states. All of this demonstrates how difficult it is to run as a Republican incumbent almost anywhere in 2020. Strategists who spoke to CNN worry that Trump has become a liability for Republicans needing to expand their coalition beyond the President\u2019s core base of supporters. Whereas a few months ago, they were confident of the party\u2019s chances across the board, many of the strategists who spoke to CNN have lowered their expectations, and now talk in terms of minimizing what they worry could be a wipeout for the GOP. This leaves them hoping for a minor rather than devastating defeat, something akin to Mitt Romney\u2019s narrow loss in 2012, when Republicans lost two Senate seats, rather than John McCain\u2019s performance four years earlier, when they lost eight. \u201cRepublican candidates need something more like Romney in \u201912 and less like McCain in \u201808,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a GOP strategist in Washington.   The broader fear among Republicans is that the election becomes a referendum on Trump\u2019s performance during the pandemic. Coupled with a cratered economy, the effect could be devastating by both depressing the Republican faithful and turning off swing voters. That one-two punch could knock the GOP out of power in Washington\u2013 and it\u2019s what has strategists hoping the President\u2019s reelection team can successfully transform the race to a choice between Trump and an unpalatable Biden. But that effort has become increasingly difficult against the backdrop of a pandemic that has destroyed many of the economic gains Republicans had hoped to make the foundation of their re-election argument. \u201cThis is the one thing he (Trump) cannot change the subject on,\u201d said a Republican strategist. \u201cThis is not a political opponent, this is not going way and he has never had to deal with something like this.\u201d There is some evidence Trump is not getting the bulk of the blame for the economic downturn. In the most recent CNN poll, from early May, Trump overall has a 45% approval rating. While only 42% approve of how he\u2019s handled the pandemic, 50% still said they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy. The Trump campaign has argued that Americans trust the President when it comes to handling the economy and they will choose him to be the person to lead the recovery. \u201cThe economic message resonates strongly, particularly in a time like this,\u201d said Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. \u201cPresident Trump is clearly the one to restore us to that position. He did it once, he will do it again.\u201d Still, the worry for Republicans beyond the Trump orbit is that if there are no signs of the economy turning the corner by November that will be an impossible argument for the Trump campaign to make. \u201cAbsent some sort of V-shaped recovery many people think he is dead in the water,\u201d said the Republican strategist. In the four years since winning the GOP nomination, Trump has solidified his position within the party. That has made it harder for Republicans in Congress to distance themselves from him without antagonizing his base. That, say Republican operatives, risks keeping away voters who may consider the GOP but don\u2019t like the President. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tough environment. If you have a college degree and you live in suburbia, you don\u2019t want to vote for us,\u201d said one long-time Republican congressional campaign consultant, who added there is a serious worry about bleeding support from both seniors and self-described independent men. The party\u2019s chief concern, some of these Republicans say, should be holding onto its Senate majority. The task requires Senate candidates to make appeals to suburban voters who flipped to Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections as a reaction against Trump. But that goal is complicated by how dependent Republican candidates are on maximal turnout for the President, even in states the Trump campaign does not expect to win. GOP Sens. Cory Gardner in Colorado and Susan Collins in Maine cannot afford a depressed Trump base in their states, even as they play up their independent identities to win swing voters. And the concern for Republicans goes beyond endangered incumbents \u2013 including Sens. Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. There is even a chance, in a bad year for Trump, that GOP-held Senate seats in Georgia and Montana could be in trouble, said Donovan. In the meantime, the cratered economy has intensified the need for Republican senators to differentiate themselves in subtle ways from Trump and his record. Scott Reed, the political director at the US Chamber of Commerce and a veteran of Republican campaigns, said that a presidential reelection campaign is \u201calways\u201d a referendum on the incumbent and his party. While that bodes poorly for Republicans if the economy fails to improve or another wave of the virus emerges this summer, Reed said the GOP isn\u2019t necessarily doomed. Congress, he noted is, having a relative boom in popularity \u2013 31% support in the latest Gallup poll, the highest in over a decade \u2013 thanks in part to the passage of economic relief. Reed says incumbents should also trumpet their personal, localized accomplishments and areas where they have been independent of Trump without expressly alienating pro-Trump Republicans in their states. Gardner, for example, has claimed to be the \u201cchief architect\u201d for the plan to relocate the headquarters of the federal Bureau of Land Management to Colorado, which the Trump administration announced last year. The first-term GOP senator has framed the decision as a bipartisan win for Western states, where the vast majority of federally managed land is, and a victory for Gardner against the Washington bureaucracy. It also has the benefit of having little to do with Trump himself or the economic crisis. And in her campaign for fifth term, Collins has leaned heavily on her established political identity as an independent centrist. Her most recent TV ad touts her being named \u201cthe most bipartisan US senator\u201d for the seventh year in a row by Georgetown University\u2019s Lugar Center. The line aims to combat the most consistent line of criticism from Democrats \u2013 that Collins has voted in line with the Trump administration on everything from judicial appointments to health care to the President\u2019s acquittal on impeachment \u2013 without having to disavow Trump himself. Republicans point out that while Democrats and progressive interest groups have already spent millions in TV and digital ads against incumbents, the GOP and its own allied PACs have yet to engage fully in the air war against Democratic challengers. \u201cThe truth is despite being massively outspent by liberal dark money groups, Republicans are still well-positioned to hold the Senate majority in the fall,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The Trump campaign played down the worries of down-ballot Republicans, pointing out that a unified GOP offers the best chance of winning across the board in November. \u201cAny candidate that wants to win will run with the President,\u201d said Erin Perrine, the Trump campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cHe has the energy, the enthusiasm and the grass roots infrastructure. If you are a candidate you are going to want to be a part of that movement.\u201d But what Republican professionals say would help immensely is if the President stuck to an encouraging message on bringing the country back from the pandemic. \u201cWhen he does it right three days in a row, it really bumps his numbers,\u201d said Reed. \u201cWe need command performance on message discipline.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Now that Joe Biden is the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee, he\u2019s in the middle of vetting and picking his running mate. Biden has pledged to pick a woman \u2013 and a new poll shows Americans have a preference. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the top choice, viewed favorably by 69% of Democratic voters and unfavorably by 19%, according to new polling from CNN and SSRS. Behind her are Sen. Kamala Harris of California, then Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Cue the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Just four years ago, Warren was also the public\u2019s top pick for Hillary Clinton\u2019s veepstakes in a Monmouth poll (h/t to polling pro Grace Sparks, who dug through the archives). THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! But Warren, as we all know, was not Clinton\u2019s VP choice. That was Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2013 who that Monmouth Poll showed made a \u201cnegligible to slightly negative impact\u201d among general election voters if he shared a ticket with Clinton. It goes to show the veepstakes is a more complicated calculus than simply asking, \u201cWho does the public like the most right now?\u201d The same thing happened on the GOP side, too. In 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida registered the biggest positive impact on a ticket with then-candidate Donald Trump, Monmouth found. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence wasn\u2019t an option for respondents. The trend holds for 2012, when Mitt Romney vetted his VP. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in CNN\u2019s polling preferred Rubio, followed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who were tied in third place. Ryan got the nod (but not the vice presidency, as Romney lost). The Point: Hold your horses, Elizabeth Warren fans.

            "article_content": "At the first official briefing by a White House press secretary in 417 days, Kayleigh McEnany promised journalists, \u201cI will never lie to you.\u201d McEnany proceeded to say a bunch of things that weren\u2019t true. Whether they were deliberate lies or inadvertent false claims, we can\u2019t be certain; since it was her first time at the podium after being hired in April, we\u2019ll be generous in our choice of words. Regardless of her intentions, though, her comments were laden with inaccuracies. McEnany misquoted an FBI agent\u2019s written comment about former national security adviser Michael Flynn. She mischaracterized a Friday tweet by President Donald Trump about protesters in Michigan. She gave an inflated figure for the cost of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. And she said Mueller offered a \u201ccomplete and total exoneration\u201d of the President, something Mueller explicitly said he was not doing. McEnany also added confusion to an already-confusing situation surrounding the President\u2019s statements about whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. After taking questions about coronavirus, McEnany turned to the legal saga of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser who resigned after a few weeks on the job in 2017 and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts. As part of his plea bargain, Flynn cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller, but he\u2019s back in Trump\u2019s good graces after publicly disavowing his guilty plea and accusing the Justice Department of anti-Trump misconduct. Trump now says he is considering a pardon for Flynn, and ramped up his pro-Flynn rhetoric this week by seizing on a batch of newly unsealed documents that he says provide explosive new reasons to doubt Flynn\u2019s prosecution. McEnany referred to some of those documents Friday. \u201cWe have a handwritten FBI note that says, quote, \u2018we need to get Flynn to lie,\u2019 quote, and get him fired,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThere is an unfair target on the back of General Michael Flynn. It should concern every American, anytime there is a partisan pursuit of an individual.\u201d Facts First: The FBI notes do raise serious new questions about the Flynn case, but McEnany misquoted them in a way that makes them look much more damning than they actually are. She ignored parts of the notes that undercut Trump\u2019s cherry-picked narrative, and added the phrase \u201cwe need\u201d before \u201cto get him to lie,\u201d even though she said it was a word-for-word quote. Also, McEnany\u2019s claims that Flynn was politically targeted are not supported by the facts. A federal judge recently ruled that there wasn\u2019t a partisan plot against Flynn, and the Justice Department watchdog concluded that the Flynn investigation was opened without bias. CNN examined many of the facts of Flynn\u2019s case on Thursday after Trump made a series of similarly inaccurate and false claims. The newly unsealed files \u2013 FBI emails and handwritten notes \u2013 shed new light on how FBI officials carefully prepared to interview Flynn in January 2017, when he was national security adviser. Investigators had reviewed US intelligence intercepts of Flynn\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador, and those transcripts contradicted public comments from several top Trump officials that Flynn never discussed sanctions with the Russians. Flynn supporters point to one note where an FBI official asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d At the press briefing on Friday, McEnany\u2019s misquote of the line makes it look like the FBI was dead-set on coercing Flynn to lie. A closer examination of the documents shows this is not necessarily the case. The newly public information is not a clear-cut breakthrough for Flynn. Other notes reveal that the FBI planned to refresh Flynn\u2019s memory to give him a chance to correct his statement and potentially avoid a criminal charge. Additionally, Flynn testified in 2018 that he knew it was a crime when he lied to the FBI agents, that he didn\u2019t think his rights had been violated, and that he didn\u2019t want to challenge the circumstances of his interview. He has since reversed course and is trying to withdraw his guilty plea, which requires a judge\u2019s approval. The judge overseeing Flynn\u2019s case has previously rejected many of the allegations that McEnany and Trump are now championing. The judge said in a December ruling that \u201cthe record proves\u201d that Flynn wasn\u2019t ambushed by the FBI as part of some caper orchestrated by anti-Trump partisans. The Justice Department inspector general also concluded in a sweeping report that there were legitimate reasons to open the Russia investigation in 2016, which led to Flynn\u2019s FBI interview. The inspector general also said he didn\u2019t find proof that the top FBI officials who opened the Flynn investigation were motivated by political bias. In discussing Flynn, McEnany said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40 million of taxpayer money being lost in a complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\u201d Facts First: McEnany exaggerated both the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and its cost. Mueller explicitly said that he was not giving the President a complete exoneration. And the investigation actually cost $32 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department. Mueller\u2019s report said that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign \u201ccoordinated or conspired\u201d with Russia\u2019s election interference. The report did, however, lay out a case that Trump may have committed obstruction of justice. It explained that Mueller would abide by a Justice Department policy that holds that a sitting President cannot be indicted. \u201c\u2026 while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d the report said. When Mueller was asked by House Judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler during congressional testimony in July 2019 if he \u201ctotally exonerate(d) the President,\u201d Mueller simply said, \u201cNo.\u201d McEnany was asked about Trump\u2019s tweet on Friday morning about protesters in Michigan who oppose the state\u2019s emergency pandemic restrictions. Trump wrote: \u201cThe Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.\u201d A reporter asked McEnany if the \u201cvery good people\u201d remark was referring specifically to armed militia members who crowded into the state Capitol on Thursday.   McEnany responded: \u201cThe President was referencing generally that in this country you have a First Amendment right to protest.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s tweet did not make any reference to the First Amendment or the general right to protest. He simply praised opponents of the restrictions \u2013 though he did not specify whether he was referring to armed militia members or any of the others \u2013 and urged Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to make concessions to them. When asked about a New York Times report that senior Trump administration officials have pushed intelligence agencies to find evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 originated in a Wuhan laboratory, McEnany responded, \u201cI can assure you that no one is pressing the intelligence community to come to a determination.\u201d McEnany attempted to further clarify the White House\u2019s stance on the origins of the outbreak by suggesting that the President and the intelligence community are in agreement, despite apparent contradictions in recent statements. Referring to a statement the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a few hours before the President took questions Thursday at the White House on coronavirus, McEnany added, \u201cThe intelligence community statement stands. It\u2019s in perfect concert with what the President said.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s a stretch to say the intelligence community statement and the President\u2019s recent remarks on the origin of the novel coronavirus were in \u201cperfect\u201d alignment. The President on Thursday told the press, without providing details, that he has seen evidence that gives him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the novel coronavirus. However, the public statement from ODNI said that no such assessment about the outbreak\u2019s origins has been made as they continue to \u201crigorously examine\u201d the origins of the outbreak. While the intelligence community is looking into whether the outbreak was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, the statement released by the ODNI, on behalf of the entire intelligence community, made it clear they do not have enough information to confidently assess whether that was the case or if the pandemic began \u201cthrough contact with infected animals.\u201d The statement also noted that the intelligence community \u201cconcurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\u201d Two weeks earlier, when asked about concerns the virus was manmade or otherwise came out of a laboratory in China, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said the evolution of the virus is \u201ctotally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.\u201d When pressed about his confidence in a connection between the virus and the Wuhan lab, Trump said he was \u201cnot allowed\u201d to share the information which lead him to that conclusion.",

            "article_content": "On Monday, just five days after suspending his presidential campaign, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed de facto Democratic nominee Joe Biden. \u201cWe need you in the White House,\u201d Sanders told the former vice president in a livestreamed conversation. \u201cI will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe.\u201d Pro-Biden Democrats were quick to note that Sanders\u2019 endorsement of Biden in 2020 came far faster (and earlier) than his endorsement of Hillary Clinton in 2016. (Sanders endorsed Clinton in July 2016, more than a month after the end of the primaries.) True! And far better to have Sanders on the record endorsing Biden than, well, not. But don\u2019t assume that simply because Sanders has formally endorsed Biden that the legion of supporters who have backed the Vermont democratic socialist in both of his presidential races will suddenly flock \u2013 or even meander \u2013 toward Biden. \u201cWith the utmost respect for Bernie Sanders, who is an incredible human being & a genuine inspiration, I don\u2019t endorse Joe Biden,\u201d tweeted Sanders 2020 national press secretary Briahna Joy Gray shortly after the endorsement went public. \u201cI supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like #MedicareForAll, cancelling ALL student debt, & a wealth tax. Biden supports none of those.\u201d Gray is, obviously, just one person. But so much of Sanders\u2019 appeal is tied into his support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d (a policy Biden does not support) that it won\u2019t be as simple as Sanders saying \u201cI endorse Joe\u201d to convince his followers that the former VP is the right choice. Now, that\u2019s not to say that lots of Sanders\u2019 supporters will back President Donald Trump in the fall. In 2016, one study showed that roughly 12% of Sanders\u2019 backers voted for Trump in the general election. It\u2019s hard to see that number being anywhere close to as high in 2020 \u2013 given how much anger and unhappiness Trump\u2019s first three-plus years in office has caused liberals. But that\u2019s not even the real danger here for Biden\u2019s general election chances. The real issue would be if dispirited Sanders backers simply decided to stay home on Election Day. That erosion in the Democratic base vote could badly hamstring Biden\u2019s campaign. The Point: Saying the words \u201cI endorse\u201d won\u2019t magically make every Sanders backer a Biden person. Not by a long shot.",

            "article_content": "As the returns rolled in on Super Tuesday, Joe Biden\u2019s aides were flabbergasted. Huddled at their headquarters in Philadelphia and snacking on candy carted in from the nearby \u201cNuts to You,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign was braced for a long night of election results, according to a senior member of the campaign staff. The team was cautiously optimistic after a resounding victory in South Carolina and a subsequent consolidation of the moderate wing of the party behind the former vice president. But their goals were still modest: Run up the margin as much as possible in most of the Southern states, and stay competitive in Texas and California. Not only was the campaign meeting those goals, it was notching victories in places where resources had been withdrawn and field staff had been redeployed, like Massachusetts and Minnesota, and later Maine. There was no television in the conference room where Biden\u2019s senior aides were holding the hourly meeting. But with each win, a loud cheer would erupt from the aides in the press area and at the front of the office, interrupting the meeting as everyone ran to the television screens to catch the latest victory. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Just a few days earlier, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the race\u2019s undisputed front-runner. Biden\u2019s campaign appeared ill-equipped to pull off the comeback necessary to win. The fractured field of six top candidates seemed poised to split delegates on Super Tuesday, setting up the possibility of a contested convention. But during the week and a half between the morning of South Carolina\u2019s primary and this past Tuesday\u2019s elections, three candidates got out of the race and endorsed Biden, and the former vice president racked up victories and delegates in 15 states to become a strong favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders has insisted that he is not leaving the race, but as the pair head into Sunday\u2019s debate, the reversal of their fortunes could not be starker. Conversations with more than a dozen Democratic operatives and aides to Sanders and Biden offers a window into how the campaigns experienced the dramatic re-shaping of the 2020 race and how that transformation sets the stage for the contest\u2019s next chapter. Biden racks up Buttigieg, Klobuchar, O'Rourke endorsements on same night The elements of Biden\u2019s comeback during that 10-day span clicked into place. His aides had feared he would not be able to recover from a third or fourth place finish in Nevada. But his second-place finish in Nevada cleared the way for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s pivotal endorsement. Black voters \u2013 the historical arbiters of Democratic contests \u2013 coalesced behind Biden in virtual lockstep in South Carolina and later several more Southern states, even as Sanders continued to win young voters and Latinos. One-time rivals Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke all stepped forward in the 48-hour period that followed the Palmetto State primary to anoint Biden as the best candidate to confront Trump. The speed of the consolidation of the moderate wing around Biden stunned the entire political universe, including the Sanders team. Sanders\u2019 aides had run a formidable campaign that carried a candidate who was at one time in fourth place in the polls \u2013 a candidate who had suffered a heart attack on the trail \u2013 to victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, and a near victory in Iowa. Before Klobuchar and Buttigieg exited the race, Sanders advisers believed they were well positioned for Super Tuesday wins in Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota and even Texas, where Sanders had planted an early flag. But the coalescence behind Biden was so fast and widespread, there wasn\u2019t even enough time to shift plans or ad buys before Super Tuesday. \u201cIt was as though people had been waiting for a sign and South Carolina was their sign,\u201d said Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to the former vice president\u2019s campaign. \u201cThey liked Biden. They thought he could be president \u2013 that he was qualified to be president, and they just needed some piece of evidence to tell them that he was electorally strong and could build the kind of coalition to take on Trump, and they felt they got it in South Carolina.\u201d A mere two weeks earlier within the Democratic establishment, the question was not whether Sanders could get the nomination, but rather whether anyone could stop him. The Sanders campaign was so bullish about their prospects that they ramped up their efforts in South Carolina \u2013 Biden\u2019s firewall \u2013 placing a late $500,000 ad buy in South Carolina with the hope they could keep the race close, with a high single-digit margin. Up until that point within a party scarred by the memory of Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016, most leaders had taken pains to show their neutrality from the sidelines. But now Biden was dangling after his fourth-place finish in Iowa and fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, hanging his chances of a comeback on a distant second-place finish in Nevada. With Biden\u2019s lead shrinking in South Carolina, the campaign dispatched Symone Sanders to join South Carolina state director Kendall Corley to spend the two and a half weeks between New Hampshire and South Carolina in the Palmetto State \u2013 traveling the state, ramping up the field organization, managing surrogates to hold it together until Biden arrived. Then a few days before the primary Clyburn stepped into the arena. \u201cI know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,\u201d the venerable South Carolina lawmaker said as Biden stood beside him. Clyburn set the tone for the two weeks to follow by centering on the electability question, stating that he was fearful about the future for his daughters and grandchildren under Trump: \u201cIt is time for us to restore this country\u2019s dignity, this country\u2019s respect,\u201d he said, stating no one was better suited to do that than Biden. During that week of the Clyburn endorsement and the South Carolina primary, unsettled Democrats were also watching a split screen as the current commander-in-chief begin bumbling his way through the coronavirus response, claiming it was \u201ca problem that\u2019s going to go away\u201d and tweeting that the stock market was looking good to him. On the same day that Clyburn endorsed Biden, President Trump returned from India to conduct a disastrous coronavirus press conference laced with misleading claims. Trump said \u201cthe risk to the American people remains very low\u201d and made the now laughable assertion that \u201cwe\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people\u201d with the coronavirus. \u201cWe could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time,\u201d Trump said. Democratic voters felt increasingly uneasy about the odds that Sanders, with his calls for dramatic structural change in government and an overhaul of the nation\u2019s health care system, could build a winning coalition for November. Those who had shopped around for months looking at other candidates decided it was now no time to gamble. \u201cTrump being in the White House, Bernie emerging as the frontrunner, and then the coronavirus all together\u2014those were three different forms of fear for some Democrats,\u201d said Paul Begala, the longtime Democratic strategist who helped engineer Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201ccomeback kid\u201d narrative in 1992. \u201cMy friends who are investors say when there\u2019s a crisis there\u2019s \u2018a flight to quality\u2019\u2026 In politics, I think Joe was the flight to quality. It was just like, \u2018Well, you know, we\u2019re not going to wrong with him.\u2019\u201d Biden had seen his share of election nights throughout five decades of running for office, but he had never encountered one like that last Saturday in February when the networks announced he was the winner on the presidential ballot in South Carolina at 7 o\u2019clock when the polls closed. As he reveled in his triumph that night, Biden received a congratulatory call from former President Barack Obama, praising him for his decisive win that would revive his quest to win the presidency. It was not an endorsement call from Obama. The two men had discussed this several times before, with Obama had long insisted that putting his hand on the scales of the 2020 race would only backfire. On that night, an endorsement wasn\u2019t discussed at all. But, less than 48 hours later, Biden was basking in the praise of his two rivals, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who had dropped out of the race in 2019. Elizabeth Warren had knocked off Michael Bloomberg in the two previous debates, making it impossible for the New York Mayor to emerge as the Biden alternative. Now the race looked like a binary choice between Biden and Sanders, and the endorsements from party leaders flooded in as voters began to view the contest differently. It was that period \u2013 from Sunday morning to Monday evening \u2013 that Biden\u2019s advisers now believe were the most critical hours in his effort to make Super Tuesday truly live up to its billing. While Biden\u2019s positive attributes and deep experience played a pivotal role in bringing his former rivals aboard, one top aide conceded that someone else was a bigger motivating factor. \u201cPresident Trump is the driving factor here,\u201d the longtime aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t sitting in the White House, this would still be a wide-open race.\u201d Older voters, rather than the younger voters Sanders was counting on, mobilized and turned out in greater numbers at the polls. The following week, in a stark contrast with 2016, working class voters split in key states like Michigan, giving the win to their longtime ally, \u201cblue-collar Joe.\u201d And as a global pandemic swept the globe, more voters \u2013 particularly newly empowered suburban voters who turned the tables in 2018 \u2013 decided they would be in safer hands with Biden, both to confront crisis and battle Trump. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a choice between Sanders and Biden, if you care about defeating Trump, you\u2019re going to be with Biden,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic pollster who helped craft one of the early anti-Sanders  for the pro-Israel super PAC known as Democratic Majority for Israel.  \u201cMore than that, there was a general consensus among elected officials that having Sanders at the top of the ticket would prove a real danger to House members and Senators to candidates in competitive races.\u201d The Sanders team never pursued endorsements in the way that Biden did. Sanders\u2019 message was that he was taking on the Democratic establishment, not trying to be a part of it. But the flood of endorsements paid off for Biden on Super Tuesday, by giving him a unexpected boost from earned media. In the leadup to Super Tuesday, cable news coverage of the race had morphed into what Sanders supporters viewed as a three-day informercial about how Biden was unifying the party. Though Sanders was talking to Warren frequently by phone, the Massachusetts senator was not ready to endorse, another blow to his campaign at a critical time. \u201cThere\u2019s never been any sort of embrace from any sort of representative of the establishment wing of the party signaling that it\u2019s OK to be for Bernie,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton. \u201cSo you could say, \u2018Oh, (the Sanders campaign) should have done that in that week in between Nevada and South Carolina\u2019; \u2018They should\u2019ve tried to signal that there\u2019s a coalescing happening.\u2019 But really you can\u2019t pull that together in one week\u2019s time.\u201d To cut his losses in the week between the two Super Tuesday contests, the Vermont senator canceled an event in Jackson, Mississippi, and hunkered down in Michigan, a state where he vanquished Hillary Clinton four years ago \u2013 hoping to replicate the win that had given his campaign a jolt of momentum in 2016 that allowed him to continue on. But press coverage centered on the notion that he was abandoning the pursuit of black voters who dominated the Mississippi primary, an idea he rejected. \u201cEverybody knows that there are limited amounts of time; we did three rallies yesterday,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper during his Sunday appearance on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe are working as hard as we can. You have to adjust the schedule at every moment.\u201d Sanders conceded that Mississippi was going to be a tough state for him and touted his endorsement from Civil Rights leader Jesse Jackson, who he hoped would help him make inroads with black voters as they campaigned together across Michigan. In the Midwest, he relentlessly made the argument that Biden would be the weaker opponent against Trump because of his past support for \u201cdisastrous trade agreements\u201d like NAFTA. \u201cGoing into Wisconsin, key battleground states\u2014all states that have been devastated by these terrible trade agreements I fear very much if Joe is the candidate,\u201d Sanders told Tapper, echoing the argument he was making at his events on the trail. \u201cBelieve me, Trump will and has already talked about Joe\u2019s record on trade.\u201d \u201cI believe that we are the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump, (a) because we have a grassroots movement that is unparalleled, (b), because we have a voting record that speaks to the needs of working families.\u201d But the campaign was faltering, partly because Sanders\u2019 effort to expand the electorate and build a winning coalition by driving up turnout of independent voters and younger voters did not materialize on the first Super Tuesday or the second. Turnout was up, yet it was Biden who was putting together a broad coalition of older voters, suburban voters and blue-collar voters. Still, during the week between the two big Super Tuesdays, the Biden campaign remained clear-eyed about the road ahead. They knew Michigan offered a potential lifeline to Sanders, who had invested far more time and money into the state. The momentum that had carried Biden into the March 3 contests had been overtaken by the nation\u2019s distraction with the coronavirus virus outbreak, depriving both campaigns of much of the daily coverage they needed to get their message out more broadly. Going into the second round of Super Tuesday contests, with Michigan\u2019s 125 delegates looming large, Sanders\u2019 strength in 2016 and his come-from-behind-win over Clinton dominated much of the political discussion. But it missed two important facts: Biden is far more beloved than Clinton and Trump is sitting in the Oval Office, serving as a daily \u2013 or hourly \u2013 motivator to Democrats. \u201cJoe Biden is in the race,\u201d Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist told CNN when asked why he supported Sanders in 2016, but decided to endorse Biden this time. \u201cMichigan is a state of consequence. A win here is going to make the difference in 2020.\u201d Ultimately in that second round of Super Tuesday contests, Sanders did not perform as well in areas where he beat Clinton in 2016. He no longer had the leverage of anti-Clinton sentiment in key working-class areas of states like Michigan. Biden ran up big margins in urban and suburban areas. When Sanders emerged before the microphones midday Wednesday, he was unsparing of his own campaign\u2019s failures. He would fight on, but he sounded more like an ideological warrior than an aggressive delegate seeker. \u201cWe are losing the debate over electability,\u201d Sanders said bluntly, tallying his losses in Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho and Michigan. \u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to, who have said, and I quote, \u2018I like what your campaign stands for; I agree with what your campaign stands for, but I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden, because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s unique connection to voters was a strength that also came to the forefront in those pivotal 10 days between South Carolina and the second Super Tuesday. Clyburn, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke and all the other leaders who campaigned for him reminded the American people of Biden\u2019s chief strength: his deep empathy and connection with ordinary Americans. It was a salient point during a period when President Trump cavalierly waved off concerns about the pandemic and later said he\u2019d rather have thousands of people marooned offshore in a disease-infested cruise ship than to bring them on shore and have his number of infected people in America spike. The contrast between Biden and Trump recalled one of the maxims of President Obama\u2019s former strategist and CNN contributor David Axelrod, who says that when people fire a president they want \u201cthe remedy, not the replica.\u201d Biden won every county in Michigan, the state where Sanders was hoping to revive his campaign. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a CNN contributor, said that voter connection to Biden was one of two central reasons Sanders could not replicate his 2016 strength. \u201cTrump is no longer a mere possibility as he was in 2016; he is a poisonous cancer that we urgently must remove from our body politic,\u201d Granholm said, citing the first reason. \u201cAnd second, I think the vote was more for Joe Biden than against Bernie Sanders.\u201d \u201cPeople know Joe, his strengths and his challenges. They are willing to forgive his challenges because they know and trust him so much,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cThey know he\u2019s experienced horrific tragedy, been on the mat, but has gotten up. They feel he sees them because of his own tragedies. They know his heart, his intentions. And they feel protective of him in a way.\u201d Fresh off his string of victories \u2013 the biggest being Michigan, which Democrats lost to Trump in 2016 \u2013 Biden plans to swivel toward \u201ca more of a presidential footing,\u201d an adviser said Tuesday night, and start focusing on \u201cthe gravity of the moment.\u201d At the moment with officials warning against big events, concerns over the Coronavirus are also robbing Sanders of one of his biggest strengths: his ability to draw massive crowds of supporters \u2013 something Biden has always struggled to do. As the two candidates prepare to debate Sunday night, one of the great unknowns about the closing chapter of the Democratic primary fight is whether scores of Sanders supporters will unify with Biden. Though some Sanders loyalists have told CNN in interviews in recent months that they will never support someone as \u201ccorporate\u201d and deeply ingrained in the system as Biden, an air of practicality was clear during conversations with loyal Sanders supporters who came to see him in Michigan. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go as far as we can with the Bernie train,\u201d said Beau Crnkovich, who stood alongside his mother at a Sanders rally on a sun-splashed Sunday rally in downtown Grand Rapids. \u201cBut if it comes down to Biden, I\u2019ll definitely vote for Biden \u2014 for sure.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Jeff Zeleny, Gregory Krieg and Jessica Dean contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, a key voice on gun violence prevention, has endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, calling him the \u201cchoice for a true gun safety president.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden leads with his heart. He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety,\u201d Giffords said in a statement Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I\u2019ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence\u2014and win. This is the leadership we need in the White House. Joe Biden is the choice for a gun safety president.\u201d In a video announcing her endorsement, Giffords said, \u201cHe was there for me, time and time again. He will be there for you too.\u201d Biden thanked Giffords for her support, calling her an \u201cAmerican hero who embodies the courage and tenacity we need to take on and defeat the gun lobby.\u201d Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race \u201cI have been proud to work alongside Gabby in the fight to end gun violence and am honored to have her support today,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cGabby\u2019s leadership and organization have pushed meaningful and lasting change across the country, winning hard-fought progress and making our communities safer.\u201d The endorsement from the former congresswoman, who is a co-founder of the gun violence prevention group Giffords, is the latest in a string of endorsements from gun control groups and comes ahead of the Arizona primary next week. Biden is steadily moving toward the Democratic nomination, getting important wins Tuesday in the Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, and Idaho primaries. Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a pro-gun safety group, endorsed Biden for President Sunday, while the Newtown Action Alliance, Moms Demand Action, and Everytown for Gun Safety backed him on Monday. Biden\u2019s gun control plan, which he released in October, aims to tackle urban gun violence with an eight-year, $900 million program that would go toward efforts to combat shootings in 40 cities with the highest rates of gun violence. The plan would force owners of assault-style rifles to either sell their firearms through a voluntary buyback program or register them with the federal government under the same law that was first used to strictly control sales of machine guns in the wake of the gangland shootings of the 1920s and \u201930s. Giffords will join the former vice president at a gun safety rally in Miami on Monday. This story has been updated to include additional information and reaction.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is moving closer to consolidating the support of moderate Democratic voters and donors after a resounding victory in South Carolina and the departure of Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar from the party\u2019s presidential race. The former vice president is set to get a massive bump from both exiting candidates: Buttigieg endorsed Biden on Monday in Dallas, and Klobuchar is set to endorse the veteran Democrat at a rally later in the night with former presidential candidate and ex-Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. The question heading into Super Tuesday is whether the former vice president and his growing momentum will be enough to keep pace in the delegate race with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He\u2019ll also need to stave off former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose ads have blanketed the airwaves and social media apps in Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg could be positioned to be a spoiler for Biden, helping Sanders rack up delegates by dividing moderate voters. Visit CNN\u2019s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Fourteen states and American Samoa will vote on Tuesday on the biggest day of the Democratic primary \u2013 with 34% of the party\u2019s pledged delegates up for grabs. Sanders expects a big win in California, the day\u2019s biggest prize, as well as in other western and northeastern states. Biden is aiming to build on his advantage with African American voters in southern states like Alabama and North Carolina. The biggest battleground could be Texas, where Biden is campaigning Monday, and Sanders is hoping to recreate the Latino-led coalition that led him to victory in Nevada. Biden\u2019s blowout win in South Carolina is rapidly reshaping the Democratic race, as Biden moves to lock down the party\u2019s Democratic wing. Pete Buttigieg ends his historic presidential campaign The first major domino fell Sunday night, when Buttigieg \u2013 the former of South Bend, Indiana and a moderate whose criticisms of Sanders were often similar to Biden\u2019s \u2013 dropped out of the race. And then on Monday, Klobuchar, through a campaign aide, confirmed she would be exiting the race and endorsing Biden at an event in Dallas. A source familiar with the matter said Buttigieg was unwilling to risk accumulating delegates for a campaign with no path to the nomination, fearing that doing so would help Sanders build an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d lead. After delivering his concession speech, Buttigieg spoke to Biden by phone, two people familiar with the conversation say. Biden congratulated Buttigieg on his campaign and asked for his endorsement. Buttigieg did not make an immediate decision, telling advisers after the call that he wanted to think about it overnight. CNN reported just before 3 p.m. Monday that Buttigieg would be joining Klobuchar and Biden in Dallas and officially make his endorsement there. Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, who had endorsed Buttigieg, switched his support to Biden on Sunday night \u2013 the latest Virginia Democrat to endorse the former vice president before Tuesday, when the state will be a closely watched battleground. Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton, part of the 2018 wave that helped Democrats take control of the House, also endorsed Biden on Sunday. Biden\u2019s allies, meanwhile, intensified attacks on Bloomberg, whose late entrance to the race in November was motivated by the view that Biden was weak and Sanders was on course to become the nominee. In a memo to supporters Sunday night, three strategists with the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country wrote that Bloomberg \u201cshould decide soon if he wants to be the reason why Bernie Sanders is the nominee of the party.\u201d Still, Biden\u2019s campaign faces massive financial and organizational disadvantages compared to Sanders, Bloomberg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has had aides organizing in Super Tuesday states for months. Biden\u2019s campaign said he raised $10 million on Saturday and Sunday alone \u2013 more than he\u2019d raised in the entire month of January. But Biden was outraised in February. Biden said Sunday he raised $18 million in February \u2013 well off the $46 million that Sanders raised and the $29 million hauled in by Warren. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has spent $170 million on Super Tuesday ads \u2013 compared to Biden\u2019s $2.2 million Super Tuesday advertising plan. Someone who is not expected to intervene to help Biden: Former President Barack Obama. The two spoke by phone Saturday night after Biden\u2019s win in South Carolina. But a source close to the former president said Obama\u2019s plans to stay out of the Democratic primary haven\u2019t changed. \u201cWe are skeptical that an endorsement coming from us could truly change the political winds right now,\u201d the person close to Obama told CNN. If Obama were to endorse Biden, the person said, there is \u201ca very real chance it backfires.\u201d Obama also spoke with Buttigieg by phone late Sunday night, praising  his campaign and his decision to leave the race, two people familiar with the conversation said. Obama noted how difficult it is to disappoint supporters and admirers. Obama told Buttigieg he ran a historic campaign to be proud of. The former president made clear the decision on whether to endorse a candidate is Buttigieg\u2019s alone to make, two people familiar with the call say. The two discussed the leverage that Buttigieg has now \u2013 and how he could be most helpful in shaping the race. Before a quick conversation with reporters on Sunday night, Sanders congratulated Buttigieg on what he described as a trailblazing, \u201cbrilliant campaign.\u201d Asked if he believed that his moderate rivals were privately discussing ways consolidate their support, and derail his bid, Sanders didn\u2019t reject the premise. \u201cI think it\u2019s no secret that the establishment is getting very nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it is the corporate wing of the Democratic Party or the political leadership.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expects Sanders to emerge from Tuesday\u2019s contest with a lead in delegates, two Biden campaign aides said. Its goal is to \u201cremain competitive\u201d with Sanders, the aides said \u2013 and to put enough distance between Sanders and Biden and everyone else in the race that it\u2019s clear it has become a two-person contest. The Biden campaign\u2019s approach to Super Tuesday starts with congressional districts in the South where a majority \u2013 or at least large share \u2013 of voters are African American. A Biden aide said the former vice president can win Tuesday in states with demographics similar to South Carolina \u2013 including Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee. Biden has also said he believes he can win Texas. He was campaigning Monday in Houston and Dallas. Biden enters Super Tuesday outspent and out-staffed, hoping South Carolina gives him a boost Key targets cited by aides include Alabama\u2019s 7th District, which includes Selma and parts of Birmingham and where Biden was endorsed by Rep. Terri Sewell, and North Carolina\u2019s 1st District, where Rep. G.K. Butterfield is another prominent backer of the former vice president. Biden\u2019s aides believe other candidates could fall below the 15% support necessary to earn delegates in those districts, making wins there for Biden even more valuable in the drawn-out delegate battle that now looks increasingly likely. \u201cPeople died for the right to vote \u2013 in my district, especially. And we\u2019re not going to be held hostage to someone who just can spread money,\u201d  Sewell said of Bloomberg. \u201cI think that this kind of support is earned, and Joe Biden\u2019s earned it.\u201d Buttigieg used the moments after dropping out to thank his former competitors for \u201cdemonstrating what public service can be.\u201d But the end of Buttigieg\u2019s run signaled where the former mayor was leaning, ultimately leading him to endorse Biden after the former vice president\u2019s strong win in South Carolina. Buttigieg spent the final weeks of his campaign lambasting Sanders by labeling his movement an \u201cinflexible, ideological revolution\u201d and suggesting that his nomination would be a death knell for House and Senate Democrats in tough races. Speaking in South Bend on Sunday, Buttigieg issued a similar warning to the one he made after Sanders swept the Nevada caucuses. He didn\u2019t name the Vermont senator this time, but again suggested Sanders would be a drag on down-ballot Democratic candidates. \u201cWe need a broad-based agenda that can truly deliver for the American people, not one that gets lost in ideology,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWe need an approach strong enough not only to win the White House but to hold the House (of Representatives), win the Senate and send Mitch McConnell into retirement.\u201d While Buttigieg did attack Biden during his campaign \u2013 he suggested days before Iowa that Biden was selling from the \u201csame Washington playbook\u201d and recycling \u201cthe same arguments\u201d \u2013 the two were far more ideologically in line than others. And Biden, at one point, told an audience in New Hampshire that he\u2019d consider \u201cIndiana\u201d \u2013 a shorthand reference to Buttigieg \u2013 among the 2020 candidates who\u2019d be an ideological fit as a possible vice presidential nominee. Biden and Buttigieg, according to aides, exchanged phone calls on Sunday ahead of the former mayor\u2019s decision to get out. A separate source familiar with the matter told CNN that there was staff-level communication between their campaigns on Sunday. And some Buttigieg donors informed top Biden supporters after the South Carolina results came out that they were eager to support the former vice president when the former mayor exited the race. Buttigieg\u2019s supporters, though, are far from monolithic. Conversations with hundreds over the course of the campaign revealed a mix of second choices, including Biden and Warren. And while rare, some Buttigieg supporters did tell CNN that they were considering Sanders, too. On Sunday, Buttigieg did not reprise any of the attacks he leveled during the campaign at Warren, the primary\u2019s other leading progressive. Both Buttigieg and Warren have performed well with college-educated white voters, entrance and exit polls have shown. Despite their differences on policy, and a fiery December clash over donors and transparency, Buttigieg and Warren appeared to draw from a similar cohort of voters. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, Buttigieg\u2019s supporters, when asked who their second choice would be, were split between Warren and Klobuchar, with 26% eyeing each \u2013 a number touted in a tweet by Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and one of Warren\u2019s staunchest advocates. The overlap between Buttigieg and Warren, especially among white, college-educated Democrats, became evident late last year. But after Buttigieg\u2019s strong showing in Iowa, it appeared that the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor had won them over. Now, similarly-inclined voters in the Super Tuesday states and beyond will be looking for a new home. Shortly after the news broke, the Working Families Party, which endorsed Warren last year, sent out a split fundraising email \u2013 subject line \u201cPete Buttigieg (!)\u201d \u2013 shortly before Buttigieg spoke in South Bend. \u201cElizabeth Warren is currently in second place in multiple national and state polls, including in the delegate-rich state of California,\u201d it said. \u201cThe polls also show her as the second choice for a LOT of Pete Buttigieg supporters.\u201d The Warren campaign was mostly mum on Sunday night. Warren in a tweet thanked Buttigieg, adding, \u201cI know you\u2019ll continue giving back and serving our country for many years to come.\u201d His departure from the race might well serve her campaign in the much nearer term. This story has been updated with additional reporting and to reflect Klobuchar has ended her campaign. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

Democrats are on the cusp of making a very important decision after Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 decisive win in Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses. Faced with a choice between moderates promising a way back to the pre-Donald Trump era \u2013 the resistance \u2013 and Sanders\u2019 revolutionary vision for a radically different America, voters are choosing revolution. Sanders has momentum. If the question is whether Democrats should pick the candidate with the most energized base of support, there\u2019s no doubt Sanders deserves the nomination. But his attacks on wealth and inequality, and his uncompromising rhetoric about systemic change will continue to alienate a lot of people. The problem? Those voters haven\u2019t coalesced around any one candidate. Unless that changes, Sanders will continue to rack up delegates and he will very soon seem unstoppable Sanders has already declared that the Democratic establishment can\u2019t stop him. It was clear he plans to take by force the party he\u2019s never joined but may soon be chosen to lead. A Sanders victory would mean moderates and independents in the middle of the political spectrum may not have an option on Election Day. It also means, if it happens, the two US political parties will have been bent out of recognition from what they were short years ago. A choice between someone with no ideology \u2013 or an ideologue. If Sanders wins the nomination, the choice voters face will be either a President whose policy stems from his frustration at immigrants and his own self interests or a senator whose had the same views for decades and is promising changes that seem impossible to pass through a Senate that requires supermajorities to get much done. The Democratic debate Tuesday in South Carolina provides an opportunity for the rest of the Democratic field to take Sanders on in a way it has not yet done \u2013 because candidates were too preoccupied with taking shots at Mike Bloomberg in the Nevada debate. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren tried to compare Bloomberg to Trump \u2013 both egomaniacs and billionaires, she said. Now Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, wants to create a similar equivalence between Trump and Sanders. It\u2019s \u201cjust replacing one form of divisiveness with another,\u201d he said. He\u2019s making an aggressive play to be the candidate of the middle, challenging irregularities in the count for a (distant) second in Nevada. Yes, South Carolina\u2019s primary next Saturday is only the fourth nominating contest of the season and yes, Sanders, the democratic socialist promising radical change to the US health care and higher education systems, does not have this thing sewn up. But things start moving very fast from here on out and while the accumulation of delegates will take months, it could be clear after Super Tuesday that Sanders will go into the convention this summer with most people behind him. CNN will host two nights of town halls this week featuring the leading Democratic presidential candidates. The hourlong individual town halls will air in primetime on Monday and Wednesday, and will follow the CNN town hall format of candidates taking questions directly from audience members and a moderator. Here\u2019s the lineup: Monday Wednesday The President is heading to India, where he\u2019ll have a \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d stadium rally. He\u2019ll also make a stop at the Taj Mahal with first lady Melania Trump. The trip comes with his approval at home rising to its highest point since he was inaugurated. From CNN\u2019s Harry Enten: A new Gallup national poll finds that Trump has a 49% approval rating and a disapproval rating of 48%. That\u2019s very similar to its previous poll and marks the first time since January 2017 that Trump has a net (approval - disapproval) positive approval rating in the Gallup poll. Shelby Pierson, the US intelligence community\u2019s top election security official, appears to have overstated the intelligence community\u2019s formal assessment of Russian interference in the 2020 election, omitting important nuance during a briefing with lawmakers earlier this month, officials told CNN. Here\u2019s the three key points: Read more from CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Jake Tapper and Zachary Cohen. Trump has been periodically briefed on Russian interference in the 2020 election, but was upset when he learned of Pierson\u2019s characterization of the intelligence in part because intelligence officials had not characterized the interference as explicitly pro-Trump. One national security official said Russia\u2019s only clear aim, as of now, is to sow discord in the US. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien discussed the intelligence briefing with his own remarkable lack of nuance in an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. O\u2019Brien denied the existence of an intelligence assessment regarding Russian interference aimed at helping Trump but, notably, did not explain that the US has also assessed that the Kremlin views Trump as a leader they can work with. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no briefing that I\u2019ve received, that the President has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump. We just haven\u2019t seen that intelligence. If it\u2019s out there, I haven\u2019t seen it. I\u2019d be surprised if I haven\u2019t seen it. The leaders of our \u2013 the IC have not seen it,\u201d he said. O\u2019Brien was also quick to seize on reports that Russia is interfering in the election to help Sanders in the Democratic primaries \u2013 and mischaracterized the reports to suggest Russia wants Sanders to be President. The American system of government has been challenged to deal with a singular President and a divided country that will decide whether he should get another four years in the White House. Stay tuned to this newsletter as we keep watch over the Trump administration, the 2020 presidential campaign and other issues of critical interest.",

            "article_content": "With a five-month impeachment saga behind them, White House aides are bracing for the prospect of another staff shake-up in the West Wing as President Donald Trump looks to enter a new chapter of his presidency. Trump effectively lost confidence in his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, months ago, but was convinced not to act by close aides, who argued a leadership change in the White House during impeachment could cause unnecessary chaos. The impeachment ended Wednesday in acquittal. And officials say Mulvaney\u2019s future is now in question. Trump denied that Mulvaney is on the outs, telling reporters Friday on the South Lawn: \u201cThat\u2019s a false report.\u201d \u201cI have a great relationship with Mick. I have a great relationship with Mark. And it\u2019s false,\u201d Trump said, referring to retiring North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows, whose name has been floated as a possible replacement. Meadows is traveling to Charlotte with Trump for a Friday event. Mulvaney himself is increasingly unhappy in the role, aware it has been diminished from previous chiefs of staff, people familiar with the dynamics said. According to several sources familiar with the matter, the President \u2013 who has never graduated Mulvaney from his \u201cacting\u201d role \u2013 often ignores Mulvaney\u2019s input and has opted on multiple occasions to do the opposite of whatever he suggests. It\u2019s not clear when or if Mulvaney will depart his post, and sources were split on whether his exit was now imminent or he would remain in place through November\u2019s election. But discussions about his future have ramped up among staffers as the post-impeachment chapter of the Trump era begins. A White House spokesman said they have no personnel announcements at this time and said the President is focusing on \u201cdelivering results for the American people\u201d now that Trump\u2019s trial is over. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate but not surprising that at the end of a week when the President was totally acquitted, CNN is turning to palace intrigue stories. As he indicated in his State of the Union address this week, President Trump is focused on delivering results for the American people. We have no personnel announcements at this time,\u201d said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere in a statement. Mulvaney brashly admits quid pro quo over Ukraine aid as key details emerge -- and then denies doing so Over the past weeks, Mulvaney has taken an active role in the administration\u2019s efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China. And he travels regularly with the President when Trump leaves town. But Mulvaney was not a visible presence in the impeachment proceedings, during which he was locked in an internal feud for influence with White House counsel Pat Cipollone. His appearances in the media declined sharply after a disastrous news conference in October, when he acknowledged a quid pro quo in Trump withholding aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Privately Trump was enraged by the performance, which Mulvaney attempted to walk back afterward. The damage from the news conference lingered for months, including during the impeachment trial, when clips of it aired repeatedly during the House managers\u2019 presentation, irking Trump further. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Mulvaney in recent months, and people close to Mulvaney have worried the onetime South Carolina congressman would not remain long after impeachment is over. Officials close to him have acknowledged that they don\u2019t expect much warning if he is indeed axed by the President, mindful that past firings and forced resignations have been quite sudden. Mulvaney is the third person to sit in the chief of staff\u2019s office during Trump\u2019s first term. His predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, each left after losing influence with the President. While Kelly had sought to enforce strict discipline in the West Wing after a looser approach from Priebus, Mulvaney has eased those restrictions, allowing a more freewheeling style to take hold. When Mulvaney departs could depend on who\u2019s in line to take his place. Top Trump ally in Congress not running for reelection When it comes to filling the chief of staff role after the impeachment dust settles, Trump has suggested his first choice remains Meadows, sources familiar with the talks said. The North Carolina Republican has been advising the President daily during the impeachment. Meadows also has the support of Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, among other crucial aides. A source close to Meadows said he has not aggressively pursued the post. During Thursday\u2019s post-acquittal speech, Trump thanked Meadows at length for his support during the impeachment proceedings and called him \u201can extraordinary guy\u201d and \u201cvery special.\u201d Meadows, in turn, was the only other person who spoke during the President\u2019s address \u2013 rising from his seat in the audience to praise Trump. \u201cI just wanted to say that this reflection today is a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Mulvaney was in the audience, but Trump did not single him out during his remarks. Meadows and Mulvaney remain close, and they sat in adjacent seats during a charter flight from Iowa following a flood of Trump surrogates during the state\u2019s caucuses. While Meadows has not turned down the chief of staff role, in private conversations the staunch Trump ally has at times expressed interest in a different position, such as the one created at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency for Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist. Such a job, a person familiar said, would allow him to advise the President in an official capacity without saddling him with the responsibilities and blame that come with the chief of staff position. Others have cautioned that could replicate the toxic dynamic that once existed between Bannon and Priebus. Multiple sources also said the option of taking an advisory position outside the White House was still on the table, preserving the possibility for Meadows of something official within the administration post-reelection. Ultimately, people familiar with the dynamic believe that if Meadows does join the White House staff, it will be for the top job. There is also a chance that if Meadows isn\u2019t ready to take the chief of staff job now, Mulvaney could remain in place. Trump is cautious about a repeat of the 2018 episode when he offered the chief of staff job to Nick Ayers, the top aide to Vice President Mike Pence, only to be turned down. Trump instead selected Mulvaney, who he is now wary of pushing aside without a clear replacement. Another name sources have mentioned as an option to replace Mulvaney is Eric Ueland, the legislative affairs director, though his prospects appear to have diminished in recent days. Regardless of who succeeds Mulvaney, there is a clear sense inside the White House that the President, in the wake of his Senate acquittal, will increasingly rely on himself rather than any adviser. The President is increasingly confident in his own instincts and finds himself more unbridled than at any point previously in his presidency. A series of issues that were largely put on hold during the impeachment saga are set to bubble to the surface. Most pressing, aides say, is containing the coronavirus outbreak in China. Administration efforts to combat the virus and prevent it from entering the US are already well underway. But some administration officials acknowledge there will be greater attention on the subject now that impeachment is over. Next week the White House will present its yearly budget, which will be closely scrutinized as a list of administration priorities. Already, a dust-up ensued after the administration signaled it could propose cutting foreign aid to Ukraine, forcing it to announce the money would stay at current levels. The White House is planning a traditional rollout for the budget proposal. Trump himself is itching to ramp up his campaigning as the election year gets underway. He\u2019ll be in New Hampshire on Monday, the eve of that state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary. And officials say he\u2019s eager to add more events to his schedule, particularly as the Democratic race heats up. One official said to expect at least one rally a week for the rest of the year. And though much depends on his other commitments, Trump has told aides he wants to eventually return to the pace he kept during the 2016 campaign. The President is also expected to scale up his fundraising efforts, including an upcoming West Coast swing. Trump will travel to India in the coming weeks on a state visit, where he\u2019ll boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite concerns over his overly nationalist bent. But there isn\u2019t a whole lot of other foreign travel on tap for the rest of the year, particularly because the G7 summit will occur this June at Camp David.

            "article_content": "Can\u2019t get a new witness? Call Donald J. Trump. Republicans might be blocking new testimony in the Senate trial but Democratic impeachment managers keep returning to the person who makes their case better than anyone: the President himself. Trump, of course, is not literally in the Senate chamber \u2013 though he said Wednesday he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to be in the front row to stare at his \u201ccorrupt\u201d accusers. But for Democrats, there\u2019s no better evidence with which to paint a picture of what they say is a self-dealing, obstructive leader with a kingly view of his own powers than the highlight reel already compiled by the most television-obsessed president in history. \u201cI have, in Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President,\u201d Trump says in one clip aired on Tuesday by lead impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California. The Trump tapes not only break up hours of dense legal arguments. They also put the President at the center of the action, portraying him as the ringleader of the scheme to pressure Ukraine for political favors, and not an outsider player. They also confront the Republican senators, serving as jurors, with the direct evidence of what Democrats say is outlandish, impeachable behavior in a way that may not change their minds but is deeply uncomfortable. Senate impeachment trial: Managers outline the case for removing Trump Driving home the case for new witnesses, currently being thwarted by GOP senators in multiple votes, Schiff turned to a clip of Trump on December 3. \u201cWhen it\u2019s fair, and it will be fair in the Senate, I would love to have Mike Pompeo, I\u2019d love to have Mick (Mulvaney), I\u2019d love to have Rick Perry and many other people testify,\u201d the President said at the time, taking a position at odds with the current arguments of his legal team and Republican Senate leaders. On Wednesday, Democrats wanted to establish a pattern of behavior on Trump\u2019s part of soliciting foreign interference in US elections, as he is alleged to have done in a quid pro quo in Ukraine, as they seek to prove corrupt intent. So Schiff dug out the famous clip from the 2016 election when Trump called on Russia, \u201cif you are listening,\u201d to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s 30,000 \u201cmissing\u201d emails. Last year\u2019s call by the President for China to \u201cstart an investigation into the Bidens\u201d also came up, as did Trump\u2019s comment to George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that if a foreign power had election dirt: \u201cI think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d As that last clip echoed through the chamber, impeachment manager Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, bemoaned the \u201cshocking video\u201d to underline the point. Every time Trump\u2019s unmistakable tones started reverberating through the chamber, the heads of senators snapped toward the screens showing the clips. The President\u2019s lawyers argue that he did nothing wrong in Ukraine, that he acted within his powers and that the Democratic case that he abused his power is \u201cridiculous\u201d and unconstitutional. Trump says he would 'love' to sit in Senate chamber during impeachment The flurry of video underscored how Trump\u2019s torrent of verbiage often contains comments that hurt his own interests, come back to haunt him or even appear to openly reveal malfeasant behavior. After all, this is the President who fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017 and then went on NBC News and said his shock move had been motivated by the Russia investigation. The clips of Trump\u2019s remarks also help shed light on how he manages to so often skip free after behaving in a way that might have downed his predecessors: He does it all in public. Had Trump\u2019s comments on getting election dirt emerged on a secret tape, Richard Nixon-style, they would seem so much more damaging. As House impeachment manager Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said Wednesday when dealing with a rough transcript that shows the President putting pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart: \u201cThe evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is hiding in plain sight.\u201d In the internal drama playing out in the Senate, Trump\u2019s greatest hits are being used by Democrats to suggest that his alleged abuse of power \u2013 seeking political dirt from Ukraine on his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden \u2013 is not an isolated act but conduct in keeping with his character. The videos also add credibility to a case that Republican senators, almost all of whom are expected to vote to acquit the President, are being faced to hear in relentless, repetitive and incriminating detail. Some of it may even be new to them or may contradict their GOP talking points. And Democratic opponents in November know it will be much harder for them to plead ignorance of what the President was up to. Impeachment managers' tall task becomes clearer \u201cI think it\u2019s painful for them to keep hearing how the President shook down the President of another country \u2026 but you know what, this is forcing them to face it. If they turn off their ears, I am really sad for our country,\u201d Hawaii\u2019s Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d There are few signs, however, that the hours of testimony, also punctuated by clips of other witnesses who took part in House impeachment hearings and are highly critical of the President, are changing the minds of Republicans, who have insurmountable political incentives to acquit Trump. North Dakota\u2019s Sen. Kevin Cramer appeared to be laughing during two clips played by Garcia, including one featuring Trump. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a friend and political ally of the President\u2019s, wore a big smile when Schiff played the clip of Trump urging Russia to find the missing emails. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas was asked by CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett whether he was concerned by anything that the President was depicted as saying. \u201cThat\u2019s really not the question,\u201d Cornyn replied. \u201cThe question is whether this is treason, bribery or another high crime and misdemeanor. I mean, this is the nuclear option under our Constitution to remove a duly elected president by the vote of the House and the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something we should not do unless that constitutional standard is met, and I\u2019m struggling to see how that is even close.\u201d Conservative commentator Scott Jennings said on CNN that even if some GOP senators were upset by the evidence of Trump\u2019s behavior they were forced to watch, they had little realistic choice about what to do. Such senators were asking, \u201cAre we really going to throw a president out of office for the first time in American history over this?\u201d Jennings told Burnett. How Adam Schiff became Democrats' impeachment star On the first day of the trial, Democrats made repeated attempts to get Republicans on the record as opposing the admission of witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and White House acting chief of staff Mulvaney as they seek to show the GOP is thwarting a fair trial. If the public comes to believe their narrative, it will be harder for the President to claim vindication following his likely acquittal. But on the Rumsfeldian principle that you go to the war with the witnesses you have rather than those you wished you had, they featured clips from multiple current and former diplomatic officials testifying in the House impeachment inquiry. By repeatedly turning to footage of former White House senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, who described how Trump\u2019s men carried out political errands in Ukraine, Democrats hinted at a broader point about the need for more witnesses in the trial \u2013 a showdown that will take place after both sides have presented their cases. Inside the Republican lunch that slowed McConnell's plan to rush the impeachment trial Hill gave the most graphic testimony in the House inquiry about how Bolton had called Rudy Giuliani\u2019s off-the-books diplomatic initiative in Ukraine a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and the President\u2019s personal lawyer a \u201chand grenade.\u201d That begs the question of Republican senators: Shouldn\u2019t they hear what Bolton has to say for himself? Democrats also showed footage of ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch admitting that she was intimidated by Trump\u2019s tweets attacking her. While the President was all over the trial, his legal team apparently has no desire to see the commander in chief in person at their table in the well of the Senate. \u201cHis counsel might recommend against that. That\u2019s not the way it works,\u201d Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told reporters. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t do that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Phil Mattingly, Ted Barrett, Betsy Klein, Clare Foran, Daniella Diaz, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Detail by detail, the Democrats prosecuting the impeachment case against President Donald Trump laid out their arguments on Wednesday. They included: Not all of these facts factor into the formal impeachment articles \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress \u2013 that the Senate is considering, but the case, methodically laid out with video from the House impeachment hearings, is hard to deny. Scott Jennings is a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and he laid out a very smart survey of what\u2019s going on for the GOP in the Senate chamber in an appearance on CNN. His point, which I thought was so important I typed it up in full below, is that Republicans might be uncomfortable with what Trump did, but they\u2019re not likely to throw him out of office for it. And Democrats, he said, aren\u2019t helping their cause by insulting Republicans. Here\u2019s the whole thing: Some agree Trump exercised \u2018galatically bad judgment\u2019 \u201cI think there are Republicans in that room who have varying degrees of discomfort with what happened. I think some don\u2019t think it was a big deal, some are probably moderately alarmed and something it was a galactically bad judgment. And I think more may be thinking that. But there are only two choices \u2013 acquit or remove him from office \u201cBut in this process there\u2019s just two choices, acquit the President or throw him out of office. And I think where Republicans are coming up short\u2026 are we really going to throw a President out of office for the first time in American history over this? Accusing the GOP of a coverup or stealing the election won\u2019t help Democrats \u201cOn the other side of the ledger, by the way, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m hearing out of Republicans down there, (Chuck) Schumer keeping the Senate in all night after complaining about \u2018Midnight Mitch\u2019 didn\u2019t go over well with the Republicans. Number two, (Jerry) Nadler accusing him of engaging in a cover-up definitely rankled Republicans and number three, (Adam) Schiff today also said, \u2018We have to throw the President out because he is going to steal the next election,\u2019 that effectively is what he said, which Republicans do not believe in.\u201d Murkowski, a key vote, was offended Proving Jennings\u2019 point, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate voice in the GOP, was bristling Wednesday at Nadler\u2019s accusation of a coverup. \u201cI took it as very offensive,\u201d she told Alaska Public Media. \u201cAs one who is listening attentively and working hard to get to a fair process, I was offended.\u201d About coverups Of course, since it would take 20 Republicans to remove Trump from office, don\u2019t forget that while Democrats say they had no principled choice but to impeach Trump, it\u2019s also always been extremely unlikely they get much or any support for removing him from office. And if they can\u2019t get any help subpoenaing documents from the administration, it\u2019s not the stupidest political decision to call this a coverup. Repetitive arguments or hard truths? Republicans like Texas Sen. John Cornyn complained the arguments were getting old. \u201cSenators are struggling to try to see why we have to sit here, sit hearing the same arguments over and over and over again.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s painful for them to keep hearing\u2019 Democrats like Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono said repetition is part of the point. \u201cHe\u2019s calling it repetitive because they don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really I think it\u2019s painful for them to keep hearing, how the President shook down the president of another country, and abused his power, and is engage in obstruction of congress.\u201d She pointed out there\u2019s no new information in the arguments in part because Republicans blocked attempts to subpoena the White House, the State Department, the OMB and the Pentagon. Hirono said what\u2019s already there \u201cis damning enough.\u201d Reporters are not allowed to take phones or other electronics into the Senate chamber. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb has been inside watching. Here are some of his notes: At one point Colorado Democratic Rep. Jason Crow noted the movement in the chamber and asked if the senators wanted a break, and he wasn\u2019t wrong \u2013 there was a lot of walking around and empty seats. When Crow suggested a break, you could hear several \u201cno\u2019s\u201d from the senators. Herb counted 25 vacant seats at one point during the afternoon, 11 on Democratic side and 15 on the Republican side. Most of the absences are brief trips to the cloakroom, or walks around the chamber to say hi to someone. Several senators have taken to standing at their desks, hands on the top of their seats for support. The Democrats also were passing around a folded note that went to about 15-20 senators up and down several rows. Catch up: Every dispatch through the day Along with the ban on electronics, there are severe restrictions on what senators can bring into the Senate chamber. In addition to water, senators have been seen slugging milk, which is the only other beverage they\u2019re allowed to drink on the Senate floor. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas enjoyed his with some chocolate. Yes, really. Why milk? CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Dana Bash report that according to Alan Frumin, the former Senate Parliamentarian and CNN contributor, a precedent from January 24, 1966, stated, \u201cSenate rules do not prohibit a Senator from sipping milk during his speech.\u201d Frumin said this is a \u201cprecedent\u201d and not a formal rule of the Senate. GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is a physician, said the practice started to ease senators suffering from peptic ulcer disease because \u201cway back when, in the \u201950s\u201d there was no treatment for the condition other than drinking milk. We\u2019d show you pictures of the milk, but we can\u2019t. The tight restrictions for press coverage of the hearing have been an issue, drawing outrage from the Washington press corps as the capitol has essentially been locked down. Reporters are hindered in where they can go in the building, where they normally roam relatively freely. And in the Senate chamber, the Senate controls the cameras and only the person speaking can be shown. The one exception here are the courtroom sketches CNN has licensed from the artist Bill Hennessy. And no, Marco Rubio didn\u2019t actually use a quill to take notes. But he did pose with it. Just before Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts admonished counsel from both the impeachment and Trump teams in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Maine Sen. Susan Collins was seen handing a note up to the dais where he sits. According to CNN\u2019s report, Collins was reluctant to acknowledge any contribution to the remarkable rebuke of the parties arguing the impeachment trial. When she came off the floor about 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, a reporter told her that she was seen handing a note up to the dais, to the parliamentarian, she replied coyly: \u201cWho, me? I did that?\u201d Some Republican senators continue to tease the idea they\u2019ll try to call Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a witness at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial to answer questions about his role with the Ukrainian company Burisma \u2013 the very thing Trump was pushing Zelensky to investigate. Side note: Biden will be in court in Arkansas next week, where he\u2019s been ordered to appear as part of a child support case.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons is the author of the new book \u201cJust Faith: Reclaiming Progressive Christianity.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @GuthrieGF. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The Rev. Raphael Warnock is not just a candidate in one of the pivotal US Senate runoffs in Georgia, he\u2019s also a successor to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. Like King, Warnock roots his call for the government to respect the God-given dignity of all people in his faith. This powerful appeal for Democrats is leading Republicans to launch an all-out attack on Warnock\u2019s faith. The GOP response is evidence that Democrats, too, have a claim to religious and moral arguments. And, like Warnock, Democrats should not be afraid to claim them. \u201cA fundamental part of Warnock\u2019s worldview, like King\u2019s, is that the gospel should inform politics, and politics are essential to the work of the church,\u201d The Atlantic wrote about Warnock\u2019s campaign.  \u201cI\u2019m an activist preacher,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t see how I could lift up that gospel on Sunday, and then fight to get rid of health care in the richest country in the world in the middle of a global pandemic on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d Warnock is not new to national politics. For years, he\u2019s been a powerful advocate for social justice and even received national attention for leading the funeral services for the late Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who was a member at Ebenezer. Warnock\u2019s campaign, unlike that of many Democrats in recent years, hasn\u2019t shied away from religious appeals to voters and making the election about moral reality. This even applies to the issues that Democrats are most often averse to discuss through a religious frame. \u201cI\u2019m a pro-choice pastor, and I believe that a hospital room is way too small for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government,\u201d Warnock tweeted recently. He\u2019s also pledged to support the Equality Act, which would amend existing civil rights law \u2013 including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 championed by King \u2013 to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics. Warnock isn\u2019t alone. Many progressives today are rooting their political appeals in their religious convictions at levels that haven\u2019t been seen since King and the Civil Rights Movement. \u201cThe Squad\u201d in the House of Representatives have all embraced religious appeals. Religion News Service even described them as \u201cthe new version of the God Squad.\u201d Earlier this year, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a passionate defense of LGBTQ rights rooted in her faith during a congressional hearing: \u201cI feel as though if Christ himself walked through these doors and said what he said thousands of years ago, that we should love our neighbor and our enemy, that we should welcome the stranger, fight for the least of us \u2026 he would be maligned as a radical and rejected from these doors.\u201d Warnock on national attention: 'This is a Georgia race' And both President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also made religion a core aspect of their campaign. They both wrote about their own faith in op-eds, featured a prime time address about religion from Delaware Sen. Chris Coons during the Democratic National Convention, and invested in a seven-figure ad buy around faith-focused campaign ads. There\u2019s evidence this had an effect on the 2020 election. 55% of Americans see Biden as somewhat or very religious, compared to 35% of Americans who see Trump as somewhat or very religious, according to Pew Research Center.  And initial analysis of the election results points toward improvement by Biden among Christian voters. While the interplay of religion and politics is often hard to calculate, we know that 71% of both Democrats and Independents identify with a religious tradition. Leaving God talk to the GOP has left religious people with only one voice in their ears, which even Hillary Clinton lamented after the 2016 election. Republicans clearly recognize the strength of the religious appeal. That\u2019s why they\u2019re attacking Warnock\u2019s faith. It\u2019s a classic \u201cattack the strength\u201d political approach, mastered by operative Karl Rove, who is working for the GOP in the Georgia senate runoffs. Faith could bring us together. But too often it divides us Warnock\u2019s opponent Kelly Loeffler and the GOP have released a series of sermon snippets that attempt to paint the successor to King in the worst light possible. One was an attempt to portray Warnock as anti-military. But his point, \u201cAmerica, nobody can serve God and the military,\u201d comes straight from the Gospel of Matthew. Another was portrayed as divisive even though the idea that \u201cAmerica needs to repent for its worship of whiteness\u201d reflects the growing awareness in American churches of the need to confront White supremacy. The attacks on a prominent Black pastor who champions social justice aren\u2019t surprising. \u201cMartin Luther King Jr, who was lauded and applauded right now, in his last years, was one of the most hated men in this country,\u201d the Rev. Dr. Freddie Haynes, senior pastor of Friendship West Baptist Church in Dallas, told Politico. But there\u2019s a reason for GOP alarm. \u201cRepublicans see Rev. Warnock as a direct threat to their ability to hijack a gospel that prioritizes caring for and loving our neighbor no matter how or if they pray,\u201d Sarah Riggs Amico, who ran for Georgia lieutenant governor alongside Stacey Abrams in 2018, told me. \u201cRepublicans are right to be scared: Voters of faith know authentic presentations of the gospel build up God\u2019s creation rather than tear others down as Kelly Loeffler and the Trump GOP have done.\u201d Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, who has led the revival of Dr. King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign and has become the leading face of social justice-focused Christianity in America, told me that Warnock\u2019s campaign is an example of moral fusion organizing, which addresses poverty and systemic racism simultaneously with moral language.

It\u2019s not a question of health care politics, but of basic morality and justice.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil,\u201d goes the quote typically attributed to Edmund Burke, \u201cis for good men to do nothing.\u201d An implied addition: For evil to survive, some people also have to choose to do wrong. This week, both the administrator of the General Services Administration, Emily Murphy, and Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer (and the former New York City mayor) Rudy Giuliani have made themselves two exemplars of that Burkean aphorism. Murphy is refusing to do her job: doing nothing, technically, but making a clear choice to do harm by blocking a key part of the transition to the incoming government of Joe Biden. Giuliani is making an affirmative choice to undermine confidence in American democracy and our system of free and fair elections. This is how great institutions crumble: Not just by inertia and excuse-making for the decay, but because a small handful of people decide that doing maximum damage \u2014 whether actively or through inaction \u2014 is justifiable if it is to their immediate benefit. Let\u2019s start with Murphy, a previously little-known Trump appointee to the obscure office of Administrator of the General Services Administration. The President has refused to concede the presidential race to the winner, Biden. So Murphy has essentially put the bulldozer in neutral, taken her foot off the brake, and claims there\u2019s nothing she can do as it rolls downhill. Her chief duty right now is to affirm the projected result of the presidential contest  \u2014 as GSA administrators before her have generally done within a matter of hours of the election being called \u2014 so that the incoming administration\u2019s personnel can get busy setting up a new government. She has declined to do this. And so, like her boss, has made the whole country vulnerable. The process Murphy is in charge of, called \u201cascertainment,\u201d is necessary for the seamless transition of power. Among other things, her signature on an ascertainment letter formalizes the transition, providing money, access to officials, agencies, equipment, and office space. It allows the incoming president to be briefed on national security. Lankford says he did 'step in' over Biden intelligence briefing Some 4,000 political appointments need to be made, and given that many are in health and national security, they can\u2019t wait. In a scaling-up pandemic that has killed a quarter-million Americans, this transition is more important than ever. Biden will take office with massive crises on his hands, and he needs to start attacking them as soon as he can. Murphy is a partisan appointee, installed in her current position by Trump. She stands out among other routine appointees for enmeshing this relatively straightforward job in political controversy, and for deferring to the President as if he\u2019s a dictator and not an elected leader serving at the will of the people. \u201cI am not here to garner headlines or make a name for myself,\u201d Murphy said back in 2017, during her Senate confirmation hearing. \u201cMy goal is to do my part in making the federal government more efficient, effective and responsive to the American people.\u201d Either she was lying then or has fully surrendered her old goals. She has made an ignominious name for herself, though she has yet to speak publicly about her failure to acknowledge Biden\u2019s win. And she has single-handedly created chaos, inefficiency, and ineffectiveness, all while steadfastly refusing to respond to the American people, who, after all, have spoken through the ballot box. Murphy may be the newest pro-Trump loyalist to use her position for ill, but she\u2019s hardly alone. Rudy Giuliani is using (and abusing) the legal system to do his damage. On Tuesday, he asked to join the lawsuit challenging the Pennsylvania vote count and requesting that the state not certify the election results. Lindsey Graham fuels Republican civil war in Georgia The challenge is largely baseless, and Giuliani\u2019s entrance is a kind of Trump Team Hail Mary, which is why two teams of more reputable attorneys already quit the case. But Giuliani is doing his part to extend the President\u2019s delusions of victory, and to tell American voters \u2014baselessly \u2014 that our system is rigged, that Democrats stole the election, and that the American system is not to be trusted. A great many conservative voters seem to be buying this dangerous lie. But it\u2019s the rest of us who will pay the price Murphy and Giuliani are extracting: a slowed-down government less equipped to handle a deadly and devastating crisis; a divided and polarized nation where Trump followers increasingly live in their own ideological, fact-compromised universe, Trump opponents wonder whether we can coexist with people so divorced from reality \u2014 and everyone is angry and resentful.  So far, pro-Trump efforts to undermine the results of the election have stalled. But they are doing tremendous damage along the way. Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. And when he\u2019s in office, we shouldn\u2019t forget just the \u201cgood\u201d people who did nothing to push back against Trump, but those who chose to commit bad, dangerous, self-interested acts. They should find no rehabilitation and no absolution from Washington. To put it in more Trumpian terms: They should never work in this town again.",

Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Like a UNC Tar Heels-Duke Blue Devils basketball matchup, North Carolina was always going to come down to the wire. After North Carolina went blue in the 2008 election and red in the 2012 election, each by narrow margins, Trump carried the state in 2016 with a super slim majority of 50.5% of the vote. Already, this year, more than 3 million North Carolinians have voted \u2013 about 67% of 2016\u2019s total turnout \u2013 and if the state polls are any indication, we could expect another tightly won race. As a North Carolinian who has worked three Republican Senate races in my home state, Republican fervor for President Donald Trump still leaves me scratching my head. Trump is not a traditional conservative. He is largely non-confrontational with Russia, for instance. This is particularly striking given that anti-communist rhetoric was an important part of former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s closing message in his 1976 North Carolina primary win, keeping Reagan\u2019s political hopes alive for 1980 and of Republican Sen. Jesse Helms\u2019 entire career. And he isn\u2019t offering solutions to some of the big issues his party must address \u2013 including health care. In fact, after four years as president, he has not been able to offer any real specifics on health care, much less pass a law to prevent a government takeover of health care and provide greater patient choice, control and affordability \u2013 health care principles conservatives should rally behind. Despite all of this, Trump maintains solid support among the Republican base \u2013 a stark contrast to then-nominee Trump\u2019s 2016 experience. Visiting the state a few times before that election, I saw few materials and no enthusiasm for Trump at my hometown GOP headquarters in Winston-Salem. At two political rallies for down ballot races, candidate speeches in the days after the Access Hollywood tape did their best to avoid mention of Trump altogether. And yet, four years later, Trump is in a dead heat with Biden \u2013 and North Carolinian Republicans seem eager to get him reelected. Three factors could determine if GOP enthusiasm is enough to help Trump win my home state a second time around. 1. The state\u2019s population is growing. North Carolina has outpaced growth in the rest of country over the past 30 years, going from 6.7 million to 10.4 million residents. Much of that growth has been in the suburban areas outside of Charlotte, like Matthews, whose population has doubled since 1990, and Raleigh suburb Cary, which some joke stands for \u201cContainment Area of Relocated Yankees\u201d and whose population has quadrupled in that same time. Swiss cheese on cheesesteak? How to lose Pennsylvania Places with rapidly growing populations are trending more and more Democratic, while rural areas are trending more Republican. It\u2019s a trend we\u2019re seeing nationwide \u2013 and has become more and more pronounced in North Carolina over the last generation. These changes influence where candidates campaign \u2013 or where campaigning may be most effective. And, by and large, the campaigns are going to different places. North Carolina campaigns used to almost exclusively battle over the eastern part of the state \u2013 in mid-sized and small towns east of Interstate 95, where tobacco farming reigned supreme. For decades, Republican hopes were pinned to winning over enough of the eastern \u201cJesse-crats\u201d \u2013 conservative Democrats who would hand Republicans, like Helms, victories. The east is still important, which is why in recent days Trump visited Greenville and Vice President Mike Pence visited Selma. And when the Trump campaign is not in the east, it\u2019s focusing its effort on other rural communities, where it has traditionally succeeded in running up high margins, or GOP strongholds. The Biden campaign has a different plan. Stopping in cities or nearby suburbs, Biden is pinning hopes on those new to the state, while also engaging African-Americans, including the state\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which were turnout machines for former President Barack Obama, but did not have the same enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. Expect an Obama appearance in the state to help push Biden over the finish line. 2. Whither the undecided voter? An ABC/Washington Post poll earlier this week shows not only Biden leading the race by a mere point, but also that only 3% of voters appear undecided. The three biggest myths about battleground states This makes voter identification and turnout all the more critical for both campaigns, as there just aren\u2019t that many undecided, or pursuable, voters out there. For Trump, his campaign is much better funded and staffed than in 2016, when county party chairs often did not hear from a short-staffed, disorganized campaign. Given Trump\u2019s 3.7-point margin last time, having a better funded, more robust team should, in theory, give Trump a significant advantage. But this is no normal political environment \u2013 with a raging pandemic and the increasing economic uncertainty it has brought. And Biden has a key difference with Hillary Clinton. Namely, that he is not her. 3. Pro-Trump vs. Anti-Clinton In 2016, Clinton put together an impressive team in the state, devoting more people and resources than the Trump campaign even tried to do. It should have put her over the top, but voters just did not like her. That unpopularity had a long and deep history \u2013 the all-Southern Bill Clinton/Al Gore ticket never carried the state, and Hillary Clinton was a GOP target throughout the 1990s. National and local headlines were brutal. \u201cA record number of voters now dislike Hillary Clinton,\u201d an August 2016 Washington Post article read. One month earlier, Slate profiled individual voters who loathed Clinton, including a Raleigh voter, in a piece headlined, \u201cThe Hillary Haters.\u201d Joe Biden does not have that baggage. A June 2016 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Clinton\u2019s favorability 22 points underwater, with 33% positive and a massive 55% negative. Four years later, the June 2020 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found Biden with only a 38% negative rating. And given the lightning road that Clinton had been for years, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude the disdain for Clinton was not just larger, but more intense. A good example of this? My father, who was a registered independent in North Carolina. The last time I visited my father before he passed away was just before the 2016 election. In our conversation, he told me he voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary (North Carolina independents may vote in either party\u2019s primary) and then Trump in the general election. Why? So, he could vote against Clinton twice.  \u201cBut I sure wish Joe Biden were running,\u201d he said. North Carolina became a true battleground when Obama\u2019s campaign caught everyone, including a lethargic North Carolina Republican Party, by surprise. Many dismissed it as fluke sure to go Republicans in 2012. It did, but just by over 2 points. Trump\u2019s 3.7-point win was no landslide. As a wounded incumbent who carried the state as much because of who he wasn\u2019t \u2013 Clinton \u2013 than who he was, Trump faces perhaps his toughest challenge in the Tar Heel state now. The result may come down to who makes the buzzer-beater shot to win.",

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. Follow her on Twitter @fridaghitis. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election, raising the already blaring alarms over threats to America\u2019s democracy to a deafening volume. There\u2019s no clearer demarcation between democracy and autocracy than the peaceful transfer of power after an election. Trump showed us on Wednesday that he is prepared to cross that line. Any other president, at any other time in the history of this country, would have had a simple, straightforward answer, when asked if he would accept the results of the election. Any other president would have affirmed his respect for the will of the people \u2013 the hallmark of democracy. But when Trump was asked that question, his response was a shrapnel-filled grenade. Here\u2019s what he said: \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to have to see what happens. You know that I\u2019ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.\u201d He added, \u201cGet rid of the ballots, you\u2019ll have a very transfer \u2013 you\u2019ll have a very peaceful \u2013 there won\u2019t be a transfer, frankly. There\u2019ll be a continuation.\u201d I\u2019ll resist the temptation to clean up Trump\u2019s syntax in search of a cogent answer. But it is clear he\u2019s signaling \u2013 once again \u2013 that he has no intention of accepting the results if he loses. It is also evident that his monthslong effort to claim mail-in ballots are prone to fraud \u2013 something experts agree is extremely rare \u2013 is designed to hand Trump and his backers a path out of defeat. US Attorney General William Barr has previously dismissed claims that Trump would try to seize power if he lost the election and accused Democrats of fearmongering instead. But Barr has also supported Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting, and experts fear he could play a role in influencing the outcome of the election. When asked about Trump\u2019s comments, Democratic candidate Joe Biden responded with disbelief and asked, \u201cWhat country are we in?\u201d Biden, knowing how Trump might play the comment, went on to say, \u201cI\u2019m being facetious \u2013 what country are we in? Look, he says the most irrational things. I don\u2019t know what to say about it, but it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d Donald Trump just told us our democracy is at risk -- from him The President has made clear that this election is not simply a choice between Trump or Biden. It\u2019s a choice between an accelerated dismantling of America\u2019s democracy, or a return to America\u2019s centuries-long struggle to become a more perfect union \u2013 a nation that more faithfully reflects its founding ideals of democracy and equality. Trump also revealed, perhaps unwittingly, that he does not think he will handily win the election. He seems intent on sowing chaos and confusion and attacking mail-in ballots, which could potentially tear the country apart in an ensuing fight over the election results. \u201cI think this will end up in the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s very important that we have nine justices.\u201d Note that there were only eight justices on the court at the time of the 2016 election. Trump could very well pressure his nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to pledge loyalty to him and his electoral aspirations, rather than a commitment to fairness and the Constitution. Whatever Trump has in mind, there is only one sure way to prevent a disaster that could engulf the entire country: A landslide victory for Biden would make it more difficult for Trump to remain in office by leveraging the courts, congressional Republicans and even the bands of extremists roaming anti-racism protests aiming to spark more chaos. A decisive electoral result could defang Trump\u2019s postelection troops. But even then, we must prepare for what may lie ahead. The 2016 election offers some clues. Trump, who repeatedly claimed the election was rigged against him, refused to commit to accepting the outcome during the final presidential debate in 2016, saying, \u201cI will look at it at the time. I will keep you in suspense.\u201d Moscow had expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win, and pro-Kremlin bloggers were prepared to call into question the validity of the results with the hashtag #DEMOCRACYRIP, according to a 2017 US intelligence report. If Trump loses and rejects the election results this time around, he would create the perfect opening for Russia to delegitimize the new US president. Russia, along with other rivals and enemies of the United States, would delight in the electoral chaos and foster distrust in Biden\u2019s mandate. Democrats also play politics with Supreme Court seats Trump\u2019s most recent assault on democratic practices is hardly his first. The President has broken the most basic democratic norms by attacking the media, praising tyrants, demanding personal loyalty from government officials, turning the Justice Department into a personal political tool, pressuring public health agencies to downplay a pandemic and stoking internal divisions instead of trying to unite the country. These are all affronts against democracy, but they are more arcane, perhaps more subtle. Refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power after losing an election is pointing a loaded gun to the heart of democracy. Refusing to surrender power is pulling the trigger. Trump has signaled to his supporters \u2013 in the streets and in the halls of Congress \u2013 that the battle will not end after November 3. According to Barton Gellman of The Atlantic, Trump\u2019s team is already preparing a legal attack on the election results in key battleground states. Multiple scenarios are possible. Gellman envisions one where the battle drags all the way to January 20, with two men showing up to be sworn in. Others have looked at possible outcomes that might follow an election in which Trump has told his followers, who have shown a willingness to do almost anything to support him, that the vote is rigged. We cannot rule out the prospect of violence. Those wargaming the possibilities have also floated scenarios in which states with Republican-led legislatures, and Barr put their thumbs on the scale to help Trump.  When the election results were inconclusive in 2000 and the Supreme Court handed the victory to George W. Bush, the Democratic candidate Al Gore decided to accept the outcome for the sake of the country. But looking at the smoldering rage across Americans cities and the polarization that Trump has deliberately stoked, does anyone think a similar outcome is likely this time? The only way Americans avoid disaster is if they hand Joe Biden an overwhelming, indisputable victory.",

            "article_content": "The WNBA took the political center stage this week. Players from the Atlanta Dream wore shirts endorsing a political opponent (Raphael Warnock) of team co-owner and Georgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler had been critical of Black Lives Matter; many of the players endorse the movement. A look at the numbers shows why the antagonism exists. The WNBA players and fans are simply on a different political planet than Loeffler. Additionally, Loeffler almost certainly sees political benefit to the fight. The WNBA players have long been on the front stage of social justice. WNBA players were kneeling and wearing Black Lives Matter apparel long before this season. While we cannot know the political affiliation of every WNBA player, there\u2019s little doubt that the league leans left. The league has supported a number of organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, regularly bashed by Republicans. And long before most men\u2019s sports encouraged social activism to the degree they do now, the WNBA was promoting campaigns such as a Women\u2019s March video and the Take A Seat/Take a Stand promotion. When you examine the fan base of the WNBA, you can see that the WNBA doesn\u2019t really need to fret losing fans taking up left-leaning causes. A look across polls and studies reveals that WNBA fans are much more likely than the general population to be in groups that lean Democratic. WNBA fans are more likely to be women, have college degrees and be Black adults. In fact, the limited data that we do have suggests that more WNBA fans lean Democratic than any of the major male professional sport leagues (e.g. MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL). Loeffler, meanwhile, is a conservative Republican. More than that, she has an election this year. Loeffler is involved in a very competitive jungle primary in which all candidates of all parties will face off against each other. The top two candidates will advance to a runoff, unless one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in round one. Loeffler should be concerned with one opponent in particular: fellow Republican Rep. Doug Collins. Loeffler has been attacked by rivals as being insufficiently conservative. Collins and Loeffler are trying to appeal to Republicans in order to advance to the runoff, and it\u2019s not clear that Loeffler is winning that battle. The polling has Collins running about even with Loeffler. In an average of the last five polls of the race, Collins comes in with 23% to Loeffler\u2019s 21%. The main Democrats (Ed Tarver, Matt Lieberman and Warnock) running for the seat are stuck at between 6% and 14%, but most of the undecided voters are either Democrats or independents. Chances are that either Collins or Loeffler will advance to the runoff, not both. Whoever appeals most to Republicans will move forward to that runoff. Any issue that can prove Loeffler\u2019s conservative bonafides is good for her. Calling out players who endorsed Warnock as trying to enforce cancel culture helps her do that. Asking players to stand for the national anthem, which is what Republican voters overwhelmingly want, does that. Loeffler is a fish out of water when it comes to the WNBA\u2019s normally liberal ways. She stands to benefit from opposing them.",

Bush administration, in a competitive primary race Tuesday in New Mexico for a US House seat, CNN projects. Leger Fernandez, an attorney and activist who has emphasized strong ties to the local community, prevailed in a crowded Democratic primary for the seat being vacated by Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, a member of House Democratic leadership who is running for an open US Senate seat in New Mexico. Leger Fernandez had secured a slate of top-tier endorsements, including from EMILY\u2019s List, the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the Latino Victory Fund, and had raised nearly $1.3 million. The congressional district \u2013 the state\u2019s third \u2013 spans northern New Mexico and includes the capital of Santa Fe. It is considered reliably Democratic, making Leger Fernandez likely to win the general election in November. During her campaign, Leger Fernandez, along with Plame, embraced progressive agenda items like the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d Leger Fernandez made dedication to serving her community a centerpiece of her campaign message and her campaign describes her as \u201ca daughter of Northern New Mexico\u201d who will \u201crepresent the district with a deep understanding of what New Mexico\u2019s communities need.\u201d She and Plame had been viewed as the front-runners in the race. Plame had high national name recognition and raised over $2 million. Plame had launched her own campaign with a video that went viral in which she declares that her service to the nation \u201cwas cut short when my own government betrayed me.\u201d In July 2003, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, who Plame was married to at the time, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that in the months before the Iraq war \u201csome of the intelligence related to Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.\u201d Plame\u2019s work for the CIA was reported in the media not long afterward. The leak scandal made its way back into the headlines in 2018 when President Donald Trump granted a pardon to Scooter Libby, the chief of staff to then-Vice President Dick Cheney who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007 in an investigation into who leaked Plame\u2019s identity. He was not accused of the leak itself. Plame also faced controversy in 2017 after tweeting an anti-Semitic article titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Jews Are Driving America\u2019s Wars.\u201d She later said that she had \u201cmessed up,\u201d saying that she had \u201cskimmed\u201d the piece, \u201czeroed in on the neocon criticism and shared it without seeing and considering the rest.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Some tax-exempt organizations, such as the National Rifle Association, will no longer have to disclose their major donors\u2019 identities to federal tax officials under a policy the Trump administration is set to finalize this week. The change long has been sought by politically active conservative groups and powerful Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who have said disclosing the information \u2013 even just to the IRS \u2013 could subject contributors to harassment. But election watchdogs have cried foul, saying the change strips federal tax regulators of the ability to easily scrutinize donations and could leave US elections vulnerable to infiltration by foreign interests. The move comes as the nation grapples with the coronavirus pandemic and a little more than five months before November\u2019s general election. \u201cIt\u2019s another nail in the coffin of disclosure,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, an official with the left-leaning Public Citizen, one of the groups that opposed the change. In a statement, NRA officials said the new rule \u201chelps safeguard the legitimacy of the political process and helps ensure donors on both sides of the aisle will not be attacked for their beliefs.\u201d The change affects a wide swath of highly visible tax-exempt organizations across partisan lines, ranging from trade groups, such as the US Chamber of Commerce, to politically active nonprofits like the NRA, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and parts of the network aligned with Kansas billionaire Charles Koch. Koch officials have pushed to shield contributors\u2019 identities, and one Koch group, Americans for Prosperity, has battled in court with California authorities over donor disclosure. Brent Gardner, a top official with Americans for Prosperity, on Thursday praised the new rule as making it \u201ceasier for Americans to support causes and join groups without being monitored and intimidated by those in power.\u201d \u201cWhen people are free to stand alongside others who share their deeply held beliefs, they\u2019re able to amplify their individual voices\u2014contributing to a diverse public square and continued social progress,\u201d he said in a statement. Key groups at the center of November\u2019s presidential election also operate as tax-exempt organizations and would no longer have to disclose their major donors to the IRS. Those include America First Policies, which supports President Donald Trump, and Priorities USA, which backs Democratic presumptive nominee Joe Biden. The new policy will become official Thursday when the Treasury Department publishes its final rule in the Federal Register. The administration first announced the change to disclosure requirements in July 2018, but a federal lawsuit brought by Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock delayed its implementation by requiring the government to seek public input on the change. The names of donors to these politically active organizations have never been available to the public, but the groups disclosed them to the IRS on their annual tax returns. The agency then redacted the names and addresses of the donors when it released the tax returns publicly. The groups affected by the change do not operate as charities, and their donors do not receive tax deductions in return for their contributions. As a result, both Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and McConnell have said the IRS doesn\u2019t need the donor information to enforce tax laws. McConnell, in a speech on the Senate floor when the rule was first announced, said allowing the IRS to \u201cstockpile\u201d donor information would lead to \u201cAmericans being bullied for exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d McConnell and others who support the new policy have highlighted past examples of the IRS bungling its treatment of tax-exempt organizations. The agency became engulfed in scandal in 2013 after its inspector general concluded that tax officials had subjected conservative groups to additional scrutiny. Opponents of the change say it removes one of the few tools in the federal arsenal to detect potential efforts by foreign entities to influence elections. Under the new rule, nonprofits affected by the change still have to retain records on their donors that the IRS can request on a case-by-case basis. Gilbert says that\u2019s not good enough. \u201cThey are basically saying: \u2018We trust you to do this yourselves\u2019 with basically no evidence that bad actors will abide.\u201d In the regulations the agency is slated to publish this week, the Treasury Department notes that its job is to police tax laws: \u201cCongress has not authorized the IRS to enforce campaign finance laws,\u201d the new guidance reads. Meredith McGehee, who runs the watchdog group Issue One, said the responsibility now falls to Congress to act and \u201cstrengthen our transparency rules to ensure foreigners aren\u2019t using opaque tax-exempt organizations to meddle in our elections.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "\u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the resistance,\u201d \u201cFemales are strong as hell\u201d and \u201cWithout Hermione, Harry would\u2019ve died in book 1\u201d are among the thousands of protest signs being held at the fourth annual Women\u2019s March taking place around the country Saturday. While the reasons why people are participating vary, President Donald Trump has been a core source of frustration for many, including Rachael Ryan in New York City. Ryan joined roughly 3,000 other people Saturday near Central Park to stand against the President. \u201cThese protests are hugely important. We cannot have four more years of Trump. He has done too much damage already,\u201d Ryan told CNN on Twitter. Ryan spotted a group of protesters in New York holding signs that read: \u201cMy milkshake brings all the girls to the MARCH,\u201d \u201cFeminism: the radical notion that women are people\u201d and \u201cGirls just wanna have fundamental rights.\u201d Another common theme seen on protest signs around the US was reproductive rights. Linda Webb saw many signs in that vein in St. Louis. \u201cWe will stand up [for] women\u2019s rights and equality!  HUGE crowd. So many young women here who are fighting for their future,\u201d Webb tweeted. Webb snapped two photos of women in St. Louis holding signs that read, \u201cMy body my choice,\u201d  \u201cWho run the world\u201d GIRLS\u201d and \u201cNo sign is big enough to list all the reasons I\u2019m here.\u201d The Women\u2019s March began in response to Trump\u2019s election and has since transformed into a nationwide movement. According to the Women\u2019s March website, organizers follow eight \u201cunity principles:\u201d ending violence; protecting reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, worker\u2019s rights, civil rights, disability rights and immigrant rights; and environmental justice. The march is intended to \u201d harness the political power of diverse women and their communities to create transformative social change.\u201d Maggie Rowe attended the first Women\u2019s March at the Capitol and others around Delaware since. She was in Newark, Delaware, on Saturday and heard Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester speak \u201cabout the increasing number of women in Congress, the most we\u2019ve ever had, yet women still make up less than a quarter of US Representatives,\u201d Rowe said. During Blunt Rochester\u2019s remarks, Rowe snapped a photo of a protest sign resting in front of the podium that said, \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the resistance.\u201d In Portland, Maine, Riley Rourke attended the march with roughly 250 others. \u201cThese marches are incredibly important now more than ever with Susan Collins up for re-election and the upcoming trial of the President. It shows that women cannot and will not be silenced,\u201d Rourke told CNN on Twitter. Collins, a Republican, is a pivotal swing vote in the fight over whether to allow new witnesses during the Senate\u2019s impeachment trial of Trump, including possible new evidence from indicted Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas. While at the march in Portland, Rourke spotted the following signs: \u201cMy arms are tired\u2026from holding this sign since the 1970s!!!\u201d and \u201cWe are the granddaughters of the witches you weren\u2019t able to burn.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alaa Elassar and Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donning their iconic pink knit pussyhats, women and their allies are gathering Saturday across the United States for the fourth annual Women\u2019s March. What you need to know about today's Women's March In Washington, where the main event is being held, participants \u2013 many toting tough-worded signs \u2013 gathered in Freedom Plaza and planned to march around the White House in a symbolic blitz of President Donald Trump, whose election and inauguration prompted the first Women\u2019s March in January 2017. \u201cWe are so angry and channeling that rage into empowering our communities, into coming out and engaging our communities in a powerful way so that this administration can come to an end,\u201d Isa Noyola, a Women\u2019s March board member, told CNN. \u201cOur communities,\u201d she said, \u201cour powerful women deserve so much more.\u201d In New York, marchers gathered in Columbus Circle and listened to speeches and performers who echoed the Women\u2019s March organization\u2019s broad swath of principles, like protecting reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, immigrant rights and environmental justice, among others. Among the speakers there was Evelyn Yang, the wife of presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Yang this week told CNN she was sexually assaulted by her OB-GYN while she was pregnant with their first child. \u201cYou might have heard that I\u2019m standing here today also as a survivor of sexual assault,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cThere are far too many of us.\u201d Exclusive: Evelyn Yang reveals she was sexually assaulted by her OB-GYN while pregnant Yang described discovering that other women had also been assaulted and the doctor got a plea deal that allowed him to register as the lowest-level sex offender. The doctor\u2019s attorney has denied Yang\u2019s allegations in legal filings. \u201cI wish I could say this was an isolated case, a freak example of injustice, but unfortunately it is not,\u201d she said. \u201cFar too many women in our society are harmed and hurt and then betrayed and betrayed again by the institutions that are meant to protect us.\u201d Marches were held in other cities, too, like in Syracuse, New York, where Melanie Nappa participated. She told CNN that she was at the march in part because of her daughters, one of whom will be able to vote for the first time this year. They carried signs with messages like, \u201cPublic cervix announcement: no uterus, no opinion.\u201d The Women's March is evolving, but its enemies are the same \u201cThe Trump administration,\u201d Nappa said, \u201cin its attempts to restrict and roll back safeguards for women and marginalized populations requires engagement and social activism.\u201d The Women\u2019s March organization has suffered from growing pains since its first show of force in 2017. Controversy and allegations of anti-Semitism surrounding its founders eventually led to three of them stepping down from the board last year. They had denied the allegations. The Women\u2019s March then appointed 17 new leaders to the board.",

            "article_content": "The fourth annual Women\u2019s March is Saturday, and streets across the country and around the world will be flooded with women and allies to advocate for women\u2019s rights and equality. Thousands of women first swarmed the streets of Washington on January 21, 2017, to march for women\u2019s rights in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as the 45th President of the United States. More than 1 million people participated nationwide in the 2017 march. That march, the largest single-day protest in American history, has since become an annual event. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Women\u2019s March: The Women\u2019s March began as a reaction to President Trump\u2019s election and transformed into a movement to elect more women to public office and show their power at the polls. A wave of volunteers and activists joined different strands of the women\u2019s movement, contributing to unprecedented wins for the Democratic Party by women of color in the midterms. According to the Women\u2019s March website, organizers adhere to eight \u201cunity principles:\u201d ending violence; protecting reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, worker\u2019s rights, civil rights, disability rights and immigrant rights; and environmental justice. The march \u201cis committed to dismantling systems of oppression through nonviolent resistance and building inclusive structures guided by self-determination, dignity and respect.\u201d The main march will take place in Washington on Saturday, January 18. Participants will gather on Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington at 10 a.m. and the march will begin 11 a.m. Hundreds of sister marches are taking place across the country and around the world. A post shared by Women's March (@womensmarch) The protest in Washington will be led by Las Tesis, the Chilean feminist collective known for their protest anthem, \u201cUn Violador en Tu Camino,\u201d which translates to \u201cA Rapist in Your Path.\u201d The group from Valpara\u00edso, Chile, posted videos on its Instagram page of massive groups of women chanting the protest anthem on Chilean streets in late November and early December. The Women\u2019s March is funded by donations and partner organizations that pitch in resources, according to organizers. A post shared by Women's March (@womensmarch) If you want to march but can\u2019t make it to the main event in Washington, chances are there\u2019s a sister march taking place in your city or close to you. According to the Women\u2019s March website, there are more than 300 events across the United States and in countries overseas, including Portugal, Nigeria, New Zealand and Germany. If there\u2019s not an event already planned for your city, the Women\u2019s March have posted a guide on how to host your own march.",

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check coverage of the Democratic presidential debate hosted by NBC News and MSNBC and held in Las Vegas ahead of Saturday\u2019s Nevada caucuses. Tonight was the ninth presidential debate, and the first that presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg qualified for. Many of the other candidates on stage attacked the former New York mayor and billionaire on his previous policies, like \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and his campaign\u2019s significant ad spending. For candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, the debate offered a chance to turn around their poor showings in New Hampshire and Iowa, while Sen. Bernie Sanders looke to keep his lead in national polling and overtake former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s delegate lead. CNN fact checked candidate\u2019s claims raging from policy projections, their work history and alleged accolades and attacks on those sharing the stage. Warren accused Bloomberg of saying derogatory things about women. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against,\u201d Warren said, \u201ca billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump, I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\u201d At CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN\u2019s home for Facts First. Facts First: It\u2019s not clear whether Bloomberg ever said these specific words, but they have been attributed to him. The quote Warren is referencing is from a booklet of alleged Bloomberg quotes given to him by an employee as a gift for his birthday in 1990. While the introduction of the book says \u201cthese are all actual quotes,\u201d Bloomberg has denied that he actually said any of them. The Washington Post recently uploaded a copy of the booklet of alleged Bloomberg quotes, which includes a criticism of the British Royal family, calling them \u201ca bunch of misfits \u2013 a gay, an architect, that horsey faced lesbian, and a kid who gave up Koo Stark for some fat broad.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign spokesman Stu Loeser told the Post that \u201cMike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift, which has been circulating for 30 years and has been quoted in every previous election Mike has been in.\u201d The Post also reported that a Bloomberg spokesman said in 2001 that \u201c\u2018some of the things he might have said\u2019 and Bloomberg apologized to \u2018anyone that was offended by\u2019 the comments.\u201d However, as CNN has reported, Bloomberg has been accused of sexist and misogynistic behavior in the past. His campaign chairwoman responded to new questions about those accusations to CNN, saying in part, \u201cIn any large organization, there are going to be complaints \u2013 but Mike has never tolerated any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he\u2019s created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.\u201d \u2013 Holmes Lybrand Biden said Bloomberg called Obamacare \u201ca disgrace\u201d after it passed. \u201cThe mayor said, when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey\u2019re the exact words. It was a disgrace. Look it up, check it out, it was a disgrace.\u201d Facts First: This is true. Bloomberg did call the final Obamacare bill \u201ca disgrace\u201d during a July 2010 event at Dartmouth College, just months after the law\u2019s passage. Bloomberg added that the law did \u201cabsolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems\u201d calling it just \u201canother program that\u2019s going to cost a lot more money.\u201d Bloomberg defended himself at the debate, saying, \u201cI was in favor of it. I thought it didn\u2019t go as far as we should,\u201d comments his campaign also made to CNN\u2019s KFile on Sunday. His campaign pointed to comments he made in 2013 on a radio program after the bill\u2019s passage as a sign of his support.  \u201cCongress passed this, so let\u2019s try it at least,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cSome parts of Obamacare I don\u2019t think will work, I don\u2019t think is fair, I don\u2019t think is intelligent, whatever. But I don\u2019t have a better answer other than let\u2019s try this,\u201d Bloomberg also said. \u2013 Andrew Kaczynski Biden said that Bloomberg, as mayor of New York City, had \u201cstop and frisk \u2013 throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\u201d Facts First: There were approximately 5 million total \u201cstop and frisk\u201d stops during Bloomberg\u2019s tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, but Biden was inaccurate when he said that this was the number of young black men stopped. Of about 5.08 million total stops under Bloomberg, about half, approximately 2.6 million stops, were of black people \u2013 men and women of all ages, according to police data compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said Biden meant to refer to the total number of stops. Gwin correctly noted that the stops disproportionately targeted young African-American and Hispanic men. Bloomberg advocated stop and frisk even after a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way New York was using stop and frisk was unconstitutional. He began apologizing for stop and frisk in November 2019, the month he launched his presidential campaign, saying he only belatedly realized that too many innocent people were being harmed. However, his account of what happened has left out important information. You can click here for a detailed fact check. \u2013 Daniel Dale As she has in prior debates, Klobuchar asserted Wednesday that she\u2019s won elections in Republican-held areas. \u201cI\u2019m the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when I led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. And I\u2019ve done that as well,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again.\u201d Facts First: Partly true. Minnesota had the highest voter turnout rate of any state during each of her Senate campaigns, but Klobuchar is not the only candidate who has won Republican-held congressional districts Biden, who spent most of his career as the senator for Delaware, won in Republican congressional districts. Biden first won the 1972 election to be senator from Delaware and was repeatedly re-elected to serve in that position by considerable margins until he became vice president in 2009. During that time, Delaware\u2019s sole congressional district was held by Republicans from 1973 to 1983, and from 1993 to 2011. Turnout was highest in Minnesota in years when Klobuchar ran. In her three election years, Minnesota had the highest state voter turnout nationwide. \u2013 Caroline Kelly Warren attacked several of her rivals on their health care plans, particularly Buttigieg and Klobuchar. \u201cMayor Buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right, premiums, deductibles, co-pays, uncovered medical expenses. Mayor Buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums. And that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs. Amy, I looked online at your plan. It\u2019s two paragraphs,\u201d Warren said. Facts First: Warren is misleading in her description of Buttigieg\u2019s plan and wrong on Klobuchar\u2019s policy, which Warren also compared to a Post-it note. Buttigieg\u2019s plan would help lower deductibles and co-pays, in addition to premiums. And Klobuchar\u2019s proposal is more than two paragraphs. Buttigieg\u2019s proposal, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, would create a government-run health insurance plan, known as a public option, that would be sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. As Warren noted, he would expand federal premium subsidies for Obamacare policies so that more Americans qualify, and they wouldn\u2019t have to pay more than 8.5% of their income for that coverage. However, while Buttigieg\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t set caps on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, it would reduce what they have to pay for medical care in two ways. He would tie those premium subsidies to gold policies, which typically have lower deductibles and co-pays than the silver plans that Obamacare premium subsidies are based on now. And he calls for increasing cost-sharing assistance, which currently caps what low-income Americans who buy Obamacare policies have to pay for care, though he doesn\u2019t provide details. Klobuchar\u2019s website has one page that outlines her health care proposals in five paragraphs that briefly summarize her proposals on health care, prescription drugs, addiction and mental health, reproductive rights and seniors. But each of those paragraphs, except the one on reproductive rights, has a link to other pages with more details on her plans. Warren supports Medicare for All, which would eliminate premiums, deductibles and co-pays, though she would first implement a public option-type plan that would have premiums and co-pays for some Americans. \u2013 Tami Luhby Buttigieg criticized Sanders\u2019 handling of bullying by some of his online followers and asked, \u201cWhy did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your supporters?\u201d Sanders retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is especially the case.\u201d Facts First: While online harassment occurs across the political spectrum and the scope of the issue is hard to quantify, Sanders has battled allegations since 2016 that his supporters engage in harassment. A digital media expert who looked into it told CNN that the hostility from some Sanders\u2019 followers outweighs that of his Democratic rivals. Sanders leads the Democratic field in raw measures of engagement on social media with more than 10 million followers on Twitter and 5 million likes on his campaign\u2019s official Facebook page. Among unofficial Facebook pages created by supporters of Democratic candidates, Sanders also leads with 2.5 million followers and roughly 58,000 posts between November and January, more than that of all other Democratic candidates combined, according to data from the analytics company CrowdTangle. \u201cAnytime you have far greater numbers, you have far greater potential for harm,\u201d said Ben Decker, who runs the digital investigations consultancy Memetica. Decker, who has monitored Facebook groups supporting Democratic candidates and who previously spoke to CNN, said he has observed higher levels of online harassment among Sanders\u2019 followers relative to those of his Democratic rivals. In January, the Washington Post reported that Sanders supporters had \u201cweaponized Facebook to spread angry memes\u201d about other Democratic contenders and cited data showing that since 2019, almost 3,000 active pro-Sanders Facebook pages have generated more than 290 million shares, likes or other actions. At a CNN town hall Tuesday, Sanders said members of his campaign have also experienced harassment, and he disavowed all such behavior. \u201cI do not believe in online bullying,\u201d he said. \u201cEnd of discussion.\u201d \u2013 Curt Devine Bloomberg on Wednesday claimed that he released his tax returns every year to the public for the 12 years he served as the mayor of New York. \u201cI put up my tax return every year for 12 years in City Hall,\u201d Bloomberg said during his first appearance on the Democratic debate stage in Las Vegas. He added that his returns would be \u201cout in a few weeks.\u201d \u201cWe are preparing it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of pages will probably be thousands of pages. I can\u2019t go to Turbo Tax.\u201d Facts First: This is misleading. The billionaire mayor allowed reporters to review his tax documents, but didn\u2019t publicly release his full tax returns during his 12-year tenure from 2002 to 2013. As mayor, Bloomberg invited reporters every year from The Wall Street Journal and other outlets to review filings for \u201chours and hours of time\u201d with the mayor\u2019s accountants, Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman told CNN. The sessions offered journalists a chance to ask for \u201cexplanations about every page, schedule and addendum in his taxes,\u201d Loeser said. But in the last peek at the mayor\u2019s tax returns in 2013, the Journal described those disclosures as \u201chighly-redacted,\u201d and reported that the documents never quite offered a full view of Bloomberg\u2019s wealth. For example, the mayor\u2019s accountants often used a code letter to represent a range of dollar amounts rather than listing an actual figure, the Journal reported. Bloomberg has not released his tax returns since embarking on his presidential campaign, and has also not yet filed financial disclosures required of candidates to the Federal Election Commission. The New York Times reported in January that Bloomberg received a second extension that would allow him to keep the details of his personal wealth under wraps until after millions of Americans in 14 states vote on Super Tuesday. He now has until March 20 to file. \u2013 Donna Borak Bloomberg and Biden had an exchange about \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policing in which both of them got things wrong. Bloomberg said he reduced stop and frisk by 95% after deciding the policy had gone too far, while Biden said the decline was due to the Obama administration\u2019s decision to send monitors to assess the situation. Facts First: Bloomberg was misleading by omission when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk without explaining that the reduction happened only in the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years. And while Biden was correct that Bloomberg fought the appointment of a monitor to oversee New York City\u2019s compliance with a court order to reform stop and frisk, he was misleading on two other points about the monitor. Biden claimed the monitor was sent by the Obama administration, though the monitor was a private lawyer appointed by a federal judge with the Obama administration\u2019s endorsement. Biden also gave the false impression that the monitor was the reason the number of stops declined. What Bloomberg said Bloomberg delivered his now-familiar narrative about how his administration reduced the use of stop and frisk by 95% after he discovered too many stops were occurring. What Bloomberg didn\u2019t mention, as usual, was when this decline happened. While there was indeed a 95% drop in stops, it occurred after a 605% increase in the use of stop and frisk over his first 10 years in office. In claiming to have come to a discovery (his campaign says it happened around May or June of 2012) about the excesses of the policy, Bloomberg also omitted the fact that he continued to advocate stop and frisk for years after he supposedly had this change of heart. And he did not mention the pressure he had faced from the federal judge who had signaled in 2012 that she would soon rule against New York\u2019s use of stop and frisk. (You can read a full fact check here.) What Biden said After Bloomberg spoke, Biden argued that the reason stop and frisk actually declined was that President Barack Obama \u201csent moderators\u201d to New York City to oversee the city\u2019s use of stop and frisk, appearing to mean \u201cmonitors.\u201d He then added: \u201cOur administration sent in people to monitor it.\u201d The Obama Department of Justice did recommend to a federal judge who was hearing a lawsuit against stop and frisk that she appoint an independent monitor to oversee New York City\u2019s compliance with a reform order she might issue in the event she found its use of stop and frisk unconstitutional. The judge, Shira Scheindlin, found New York City\u2019s use of the policy unconstitutional, in August 2013, and did appoint a monitor. But this was her decision, not the Obama administration\u2019s. The monitor, Peter Zimroth, was a lawyer at a private firm, not someone from the federal government who could have been sent by the President. Biden was correct that Bloomberg argued against the appointment of a monitor.  Because the Bloomberg administration in New York City appealed the ruling and won a freeze in October 2013, Zimroth\u2019s work was put on hold until November 2014, under Bloomberg\u2019s successor Bill de Blasio, who dropped the Bloomberg-era appeal. But Biden was incorrect that the monitor was the reason the use of stop and frisk declined: the number of stops had already plummeted by the time Zimroth started in 2014. The 95% decline transpired between the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013. \u2013 Daniel Dale",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. If current polling is any indication, the 2020 election will see an unprecedented gender gap. But the divide between female and male voting patterns isn\u2019t just about sex; it\u2019s about sexism. One party has become the home of aggrieved men, running and electing an overwhelmingly male slate of candidates while accepting virulent misogynists and even putting one in the White House. The other is the party of a growing number of female candidates and increasingly feminist politics \u2013 not exactly the stuff of Gloria Steinem\u2019s wildest dreams but policies that at least are intended to allow women to control their own bodies and stay economically afloat. This polarization is as much about an embrace of appealing ideas as it is a rejection of the opposing ones. And that doesn\u2019t reflect well on American men \u2013 or bode well for American women. First, the numbers. Eric Levitz at New York magazine breaks them down, and they are stunning: While many political scientists and casual observers alike believed that President Donald Trump\u2019s antagonism toward immigrants and people of color would drive down his support among Black and Latino voters, polling indicates his support from those groups has in fact increased \u2013 but only among men. While according to Pew Research Center Trump won 14% of the Black male vote in 2016 (and virtually none of the Black female vote), 19% of Black men now say they approve of his job performance, according to Gallup. And some Democratic strategists say they\u2019re worried that Trump could pull in a significant minority of Black male votes. Among Hispanic voters, the numbers are even starker. According to Pew, 35% of Hispanic men say they plan on voting for Trump or are leaning toward voting for him, compared to 23% of Hispanic women. And Hispanic voters are a key demographic in several battleground states, accounting for nearly one in five eligible voters in Florida and about one in four in Arizona. That said, voters of color still support Democrats by a much wider margin than White voters. But even among White voters, the gender dynamics are telling: CNN polls show that Biden has led among White women registered voters by an average of 13 points since April \u2013 with Harry Enten writing that this makes for a more than 30-point gender gap among White voters compared to a 20 point gap in 2016. Win or lose, the party won't be over for Trump Gender gaps in politics aren\u2019t new. But the breadth of this gap, and its shift in just four years, is striking. The big question is why. Yes, Trump is a misogynist. Yes, women\u2019s economic security is increasingly under threat by a reactionary, anti-feminist Republican Party. Stripping away reproductive rights, for example, isn\u2019t just about a woman\u2019s ability to plan or end a pregnancy but about whether she can finish school, pursue her dreams and control her financial, familial and professional future. Yes, women would benefit from the Democratic Party\u2019s platform of an increased minimum wage (most minimum wage workers are women) and affordable childcare (women are much more likely than men to be the primary caretakers of children). But all of this was true back in 2016, too. The Trump promise is implied by the life Trump himself lives: you can enjoy all of the benefits of a sexist culture \u2013 the hot wife, the money, the power, the ability to belittle and degrade women \u2013 with none of the obligations of morality or decency. The key to understanding 2020 is perhaps the inconvenient fact that most voters don\u2019t vote on policy alone; they vote on feelings, culture and an amorphous set of highly unscientific factors. No one is entirely rational, and many people vote according to who they feel represents them, not necessarily whose platforms would best serve their interests. And sometimes, they vote against the party they feel embodies what they most oppose. Group calls out sexist reporting of woman VP candidates The entire ethos of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is about going back to a time when women largely didn\u2019t compete with men in the workforce, when marriage was culturally compulsory and when married women were largely charged with making men\u2019s lives easier: raising the children and tending to the home so that a man could go work. Under Trump, the GOP has become the party of cartoonish machismo. For a certain kind of man \u2013 for a lot of men, apparently \u2013 that doesn\u2019t look like chauvinism; it looks like freedom. And for a certain kind of woman \u2013 most women, apparently \u2013 that looks like an immediate threat that must be countered. Almost four years of Trump have shed a brighter light on what\u2019s at stake for women. With greater reproductive independence has also come greater financial independence for women, which in turn gives us more freedom in the rest of our lives. As a result, many women are marrying later or not at all (and often not partnering with men). We\u2019re having fewer children. We\u2019re much more likely to work outside the home. And we\u2019re increasingly demanding the policies that would accommodate our lives, rather than trying to jam our lives into a policy landscape that was not built for us. History suggests Barrett won't help Trump with women At the same time, more is being asked of men. A paycheck is not sufficient to earn a man full-time at-home support and unquestioned partnership; women increasingly expect men to be involved fathers, supportive husbands and, because patriarchal norms aren\u2019t dead yet, at least as financially secure as we are. A lot of men can\u2019t offer all of that \u2013 or don\u2019t believe they should have to. Women are no longer forced to settle for them. The disruptions of Covid-19 have perhaps brought this into sharper relief, as schools shuttered and working parents were suddenly charged with homeschooling and all-day childcare. These additional at-home burdens, along with cooking, cleaning and other domestic work, have fallen largely on women. Part of the gender gap may be that mothers have long done more at-home work than fathers, and now both mothers and fathers wish their partner would do more in the midst of this crisis \u2013 which, from a mother\u2019s point of view, would involve splitting at-home labor equally, and from a father\u2019s may look more like the traditional setup of a working dad and a stay-at-home mom.  Democrats, with their large number of elected women and a platform that includes universal early childhood education, seem to be listening to what these mothers are asking. Republicans, with an overwhelming number of White male elected officials and their embrace of \u201ctraditional\u201d family values, appear happy to facilitate a gendered division of labor.The fundamental difference in 2020 is this: Women are yearning for a future we\u2019ve never seen. A large number of men, it seems, are harkening for a past that was never so great for women.",

The opinions in this article belong to the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. The afterglow of an idyllic late summer walk with my love around Walden Pond was shattered when my best friend texted that she was bawling because of the news. I opened my news app, saw the name RUTH and the word DEAD, and was instantly, searingly, shattered. My thoughts tumbled and rushed \u2013 to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s beloved grandchildren, to reproductive rights, to the Supreme Court possibly deciding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election without her. I was terrified. RBG pioneered the interpretation of women\u2019s equality under the Constitution. Over the course of decades, led by her towering jurisprudence and unflinching vision, we Americans have fought together to improve the system that was conceived of and designed to place women, especially women of color, below white, propertied men. Because of RBG, we now take for granted that women can open bank and checking accounts and apply for credit cards without a man signing for them. Women can rent apartments and buy homes. We can attend the colleges we choose. Modern womanhood is vastly different because of her. This week, we are hearing directly from Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s conservative pick for Ginsburg\u2019s seat \u2013 during her confirmation hearings.  The Affordable Care Act and women\u2019s health and reproductive choice are all on the line, and I have every expectation that this confirmation would haul us back in time. Really, Sen. Cruz? This is what you asked Judge Barrett After RBG\u2019s passing, I keened and reflected upon her legal mind and jargon-free words. She was our voice in the room who steadily, unflinchingly, defended the equal dignity, rights and protections under the law of women and men. She often used clever reverse logic to show how social constructions of gender roles constrained men, too. She led us every step of the way. If her duty and desire was to make society better, then we surely have ours: to carry on where her small shoulders and giant legacy left off. To honor her, we must fight like hell for a more just, equal, fair and decent society. After watching Trump\u2019s spectacularly imbecilic performance at the presidential debate and his reckless and endangering behavior following his coronavirus diagnosis, it is clear that we are in the fight of our lives. We women want a pretty simple thing, one that society has made so hard and convoluted: to be free from discrimination based on sex. Many of us would also like to be able to plan our families and space the births of our children. To have privacy from the state about if and when to terminate a pregnancy. (This mattered to me when I was raped by someone I had known since second grade.  Not only did I not want to bring the pregnancy to term, I did not want this rapist to have paternal rights, which were accorded to those accused of rape in many states\u2013 including the one where I was raped \u2013 unless there was a conviction. This is still the law in many states.) What an obscenity, and what would have been my chances, given that only1% of rape cases result in a felony conviction? Amy Coney Barrett's alarming non-answers Equal pay for equal work for all races of women seems pretty darn intuitive. In a democracy, unencumbered voting rights sounds straightforward. To love whom we love, and to have the right to marry them. To manifest our God-given gifts in a society of equal opportunity. To be free from harassment, violence and retaliation at home, in public spaces, and at work. To be able to feed our families. To have guaranteed health care. All of these rights just make sense. Even as Justice Ginsburg was struggling with her own health, she stayed on the court to ensure others would have access to quality health care. The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, and with Ginsburg\u2019s passing, the next justice may determine whether nearly 20 million Americans lose their health care. The case is being considered even as the Covid pandemic rages, with a disproportionate impact on Black and Brown Americans. The number of vulnerable Americans with pre-existing conditions and with financial insecurity is increasing every day. Should Barrett be confirmed, she will have the chance to render enormously consequential decisions for American women for generations to come. Based on her record, we should be profoundly alarmed. Yesterday during her confirmation questioning, she had to be pressed before she would indicate that she believes in the peaceful transfer of power as laid out by the US Constitution. One of Ginsburg\u2019s final requests was that her seat remain open until after the election. In yet another galling example of Trump era cynicism \u2013 and only two Tuesdays before the election \u2013 Senate Republicans are rushing forward to install Barrett in RGB\u2019s seat.  They are not only violating the very standard they themselves set in 2016 when they refused even to consider former President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court pick for nine months before the election, they are also flagrantly disregarding the votes of more than 10.5 million Americans who have already cast their ballots and who want the next president to nominate the new justice. The hypocrisy is thick. Former Vice President Joe Biden made a historic decision in choosing Sen. Kamala Harris to be his running mate. This is our new era for American women. It honors a commitment to full equality for women and people of color. Sen. Harris, like Justice Ginsburg, is guided by her deep and abiding desire for justice and equality \u201cfor the people.\u201d No one can take RBG\u2019s place, but certain women among us strive to follow her path. Who does, and who does not, is as clear as the difference between chalk and cheese. Sen. Harris is a trusted leader, truth-teller, long-time champion for women and children, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and civil rights. I especially value her record fighting childhood sexual abuse.  As Vice President, Kamala Harris will bring backbone, character, policy chops and the good, moral fight. We owe a mighty mountain of gratitude to Justice Ginsburg for leading the way, and now we must move her legacy forward. The smart way we can honor Ginsburg now is turn out the vote in massive waves and to vote for Biden and Harris.",

He is on the Advisory Board of Supreme Court Voter. The views expressed here are his. Read more opinion on CNN. The prospect of a third Supreme Court pick for President Donald Trump looms large following the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday. In 2016, when President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the high court, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to even bring Garland up \u2013 arguing that, in an election year, it was only proper that he should wait for the will of the people. It was \u201cabout a principle, not a person,\u201d McConnell said back then. Now, predictably, McConnell has vowed that Donald Trump\u2019s nominee would get a vote. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. In the middle of a pandemic, a confirmation of one more Trump justice could end protections for Americans with preexisting conditions and kick millions off their health insurance. On November 10, the court is scheduled to hear arguments in California v. Texas, a case which could, yet again, decide the fate of the Barack Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republican-appointed judges have already deemed it unconstitutional in a series of lower court rulings in 2018, setting up this appeal. Obamacare survived its last Supreme Court battle by one vote, and the man who has spent years trying to destroy it now wants to hand-pick the successor of one of the five justices who voted to uphold it. If Trump\u2019s appointee is seated prior to November 10, it could mean the end of the law as we know it \u2013 and leave millions of Americans without healthcare in a pandemic. Alternatively, if the case is heard by an eight-justice court, a 4-4 split would render the lower court rulings valid, leaving a district court judge to decide which parts of Obamacare would be struck down. This could lead to a second set of appeals\u2013taking the case back up to a Supreme Court that would presumably have been made whole by that point. Either way, it seems clear that healthcare is top of mind in choosing a potential successor. Trump\u2019s shortlist is littered with people who have spent years trying to get the Affordable Care Act overturned or repealed. The list is a stark reminder that he has spent his entire presidency trying to kick millions of Americans off their healthcare \u2013 and is continuing to do so even during a global pandemic that has taken the lives of almost 200,000 Americans. With millions being thrown off their private health insurance, this moment calls for more protections for people with preexisting conditions and public healthcare \u2014 not less. So, it goes without saying that ending the Affordable Care Act would be catastrophic for public health at any time, and even more so in the middle of a pandemic. It is hard for me to contemplate the Supreme Court without Ginsburg More than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose legal protections that block insurance companies from denying them coverage. Tens-of-millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid expansion would have the rug pulled out from under them. Our healthcare system would be thrown into chaos at a time where it\u2019s already scrambling to save lives. The Administration has said repeatedly that any day now, Trump will be releasing a plan to keep his promise to cover everyone \u2013 and of course none has materialized. For people who pay a lot of attention to healthcare, it\u2019s something of a running joke. It\u2019s obviously true Trump does not have a plan to deliver on his promises. But in another sense, we do know what Trump\u2019s plan for health care is \u2014 he\u2019s said as much through his short list: It\u2019s to appoint Supreme Court justices who will empower the far-right and insurance companies to keep people from accessing the kind of care they need in the name of ideology and greed. We should hold him accountable for that plan and make sure he never gets to implement it. Trump\u2019s reelection strategy has included lying about his healthcare plan by pretending he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions. Trump knows that his party\u2019s plan to overturn the ACA was so toxic that it helped propel Democrats to victory in 2018. But the truth is that Trump\u2019s never stopped trying to end the law. Right now, the President is asking the Supreme Court to strike it down in its entirety \u2013 ripping healthcare from millions and ending protections for people with preexisting conditions. His Supreme Court shortlist released recently is a startling reminder that he\u2019s dead serious about doing that. And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s untimely passing makes that all the more likely.  Unfortunately, ending the ACA would be far from the only way Trump\u2019s Supreme Court shortlisters could destroy American healthcare. The people on his list are also profoundly hostile to reproductive rights. There\u2019s no reason to believe they will not follow through on Trump\u2019s promise to end the protections of Roe v. Wade. The next 40-some days will be some of the most consequential in American history. Beyond fighting to replace a President whose actions have helped perpetuate and deepen the worst pandemic in modern history \u2013 Democrats must now unite to protect the Supreme Court seat held by a lioness for equal rights to protect basic access to healthcare during this pandemic.",

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Has America ever seen a presidential campaign like this one? One that involves a candidate as out-of-the-ordinary as President Donald Trump, with his small but rabid base, running for reelection during a global pandemic, a crushing economic crisis and a deadly season of back-to-back-to-back natural disasters? Of course none of us alive have ever witnessed anything like this. But take a longer view, and you\u2019ll see there is something very old and very familiar about the 2020 race. The clash between Trump and Joe Biden is between two distinct philosophies and values that have been duking it out in America for more than 240 years. In this corner, individualism. This is the ideology that values personal freedom and autonomy, the right to pursue one\u2019s own goals and desires and values the rights of the individual above those of the state or other social groups. No one embodies that philosophy more than Trump. He is a walking, breathing example of I\u2019m OK, and everyone else can just fend for themselves. We hear it every day from Trump. Americans have the right to make up their own minds on what they do, how they live and what risks they will take with their own bodies. One irony here is that philosophy does not extend to reproductive rights. But I digress. Trump takes it to the extreme in repeatedly putting his own supporters at risk of contracting the coronavirus in pursuit of his own personal goal of being reelected. He apparently does not believe in personal or shared sacrifice. That was on full display at the controversial Nevada rally he held Sunday, which defied accepted science and state regulations. Afterward Trump expressed no concern for his supporters, packed tightly together in the room. He doesn\u2019t wear a mask, has mocked both Biden and reporters for wearing one and Tuesday night at ABC\u2019s Town Hall delivered a strange riff on how waiters don\u2019t like to wear masks. He\u2019s apparently not concerned about his own health because he doesn\u2019t come into contact with anyone who has not been tested. As his daughter Ivanka said, \u201cNo one is in close proximity to him that is not wearing a mask.\u201d Simply put, it seems Trump believes the only one he has to worry about is himself. In the other corner is the opposing philosophical force in American society, illustrated by Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden argues that we don\u2019t live independent of each other, but that we\u2019re all in this together. That is a value that has come to represent the Democratic party\u2019s philosophical bent over the last 50 years. Biden: I trust vaccines. I trust scientists. I don't trust Trump. President Bill Clinton talked about opportunity, responsibility and community. That community, the ability to depend on your neighbor and your government to be there for you and commonly sacrifice when necessary. Hillary Clinton described how it takes a village to raise a child, and to organize American life. Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 State of the Union was framed with these words: \u201cNo one built this country on their own. This nation is great because we built it together. This nation is great because we worked as a team.\u201d In an earlier speech, Obama argued that \u201cOur success has never just been about the survival of the fittest. It\u2019s been about building a nation where we\u2019re all better off. We pull together, we pitch in and we do our part.\u201d The original debates at the Constitutional Convention were about the split between the federalists and those who advocated for states\u2019 rights. They encompassed serious issues like how our federal government and banking system would function, but also laid bare this philosophical split in the country that has never really been resolved and drives political discourse today. For example, watching CNN interview Trump supporters who attended the Nevada rally without social distancing or masks, we heard an even more basic version of American individualism. They talked about how it was their right to show up to the event and that they were the ones taking the risk, one they were willing to take. Even though they\u2019ve been told time and time again by scientists and medical experts with long experience in epidemiology and infectious disease transmission \u2013 including the administration\u2019s own health officials \u2013 that the virus manifests regularly without symptoms, many of them refuse to accept responsibility for the risk and danger they pose to the rest of their community, either those gathered to celebrate Trump or those in their towns and cities and workplaces. We cling to American rugged individualism at our peril That\u2019s where this rugged individualism, glorified from Wall Street to Western novels to John Wayne movies, clashes with the risk to every element in all of our American communities. Witness that more than 400,000 Americans attended a biker event in South Dakota recently, exercising their personal rights \u2013 and also spreading infection. Over the next 50 days, Trump will remind you every day about your personal rights, and his, also.  He\u2019ll continue telling people in the suburbs they have the right to keep different people out of there. He will ridicule Joe Biden and Democrats who are taking steps \u2013 like wearing masks \u2013 to keep us all safe. He\u2019ll leave it to every American to design their own plans to stay safe and healthy while pushing schools, businesses and sports to open up in defiance of his own government\u2019s guidelines. Most of all, he will scorn the idea that as a national community we are responsible to each other and need to share in common sacrifice. We see this as he focuses daily on how the stock market is doing: He claimed Tuesday night that everyone owns stock, but the reality is only about half of Americans do. Instead of focusing on the struggling job market, he pointed out how well he and other rich people like him are doing \u2013 while other Americans are struggling to keep their homes and feed their families. Biden and the Democrats argue explicitly that we can\u2019t rise to the occasion if we don\u2019t stand together. Individuals did not beat back the Nazis in World War II or launch the war on terrorism after 9/11. These efforts were effective only because the country and our communities all worked together. Biden will use the debates and his advertisements to stress that community is what is the best of America \u2013 basic community-mindedness and community values are not some deep-state government plot to take away people\u2019s rights.  For centuries, our country has artfully balanced two conflicting philosophies in a way that has made the United States the envy of the world. But the Donald Trump presidency is upending this balance. It is forcing us to decide which value we will live by, and this will have profound implications for the future of our country and the happiness of those lucky enough to be here. And that is why when both candidates say it\u2019s the most important election in our lifetimes, they are both right.",
